       The pizzagate stuff would align with this.  Various techs like dating sites / social media / NSA data snarfing are ripe for mining sex-related data.  The design of laws in the west has created a legal framework that prevents stopping elite abuse, and enables it.  Feminism, as a general movement, has also been an agent for perpetuating abusive laws that would allow false claims to be taken as truth.  Yet another weapon in the "sex blackmail" domain.  It would appear, that all around us are the designs and machinations of a group that uses sex-related blackmail to further their power agenda.  And, opposite of the general perception of power, it would seem to put women in the driver seat.

       My thoughts? It's their command &amp; control structure. Here are a bunch of things I've compiled.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pedophiles/satanists can be controlled by blackmail. Get each of your minions on video raping and/or murdering a child, and it ensures that when you give an order, it will be carried out...
         <em>
          OR ELSE.
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As a prerequisite initiation, it ensures your minions have no moral quams about carrying out your orders. Kill a family? No problem. Start a war? You got it, boss.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As an initiation, it ensures that no Good Guys will infiltrate your ranks and expose or disrupt the operation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's a major perk for evil pedophile satanists. Just do what you're told, and you can rape, torture, and kill all the kiddies you want with zero repercussions. These sociopaths lust for nothing more than power. What is a greater expression of complete domination of another than rape, torture, and murder... of a child?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's so over-the-top evil that even if it's exposed, nobody in the mainstream will believe it. You might as well try to tell people that zombie dolphins from the planet Zoltar have infiltrated the government.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Kills compassion for their fellow humans. If the rapist/torturer had some spark of goodness that might hold them back from executing tasks that most would consider to be pure evil, these rituals help destroy it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This sounds pretty out there, but folks such as Max Spiers, David Wilcock, and David Icke talk about interdimensional entities feeding on "loosh" or negative energy during these sessions. edit: I added this because I keep seeing it come up. Maybe complete bullshit disinfo, or maybe the most important item here. I have no direct experience in this area.

       Great analysis, but I would replace satanists with Luciferians.  These people worship Lucifer, not Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Freemasonry provides an ideal framework as a nursery to sort through potential candidates, right?  The ones that are useful move up, the ones that are not, are presented with a completely different point of view and do not move up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US was founded on the principles of Freemasonry, so this makes sense...

       Some misconceptions here as far as worship is concerned. They aren't all Luciferians.  A peek inside demonolatry will show many of them pledge allegence to other beings.

       You're spot on about Freemasonry being the original framework. And freemasonry's history is intertwined with Luciferianism. But these people involved in ritual sex abuse and trauma-based mind control are satanic.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Satan', as an individualized being, is less important in satanism than the archons/parasites who feed off the negative energy of the abuse. The above comment about "loosh" is correct. David Icke and David Wilcock are two of the foremost experts on these topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luciferians and Satanists are two sides of the same coin, operating from different power structures of the illuminati. Jesuits and Zionists.

      <p>
       In what way are these people satanic?  They believe an actual satan being exists?  I am familiar with the non-theistic variety of satanism, but it sounds like you mean the theistic satanism.
      </p>

       I will look into Icke and Wilcock.

       Yes the ones at the tops of these structures do believe these entities exist and do worship them. That's not the case for all pedophiles or murderers within that structure. All of them are controlled at some level by participation.
      </p>
      <p>
       This info comes from many sources, but to understand the origins of the deities from the Abrahamic religions, of Ancient Sumeria and Mesopotamian religions, you could start with the work of Zechariah Sitchen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others have built upon his work and connected many of these deities across cultures, to their extraterrestrial or inter-dimensional origins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan is a title, not a name, and specifically refers to the one who opposed the 'god' of the Old Testament, Yahweh. These ET 'gods' went by many names but the one known as Satan was also Hadad, Marduk, Set and many more. This being is allegedly no longer around (I'm sourcing this from current esoteric teachings which would be a huge tangent)... but the main obstacle holding humanity back from our great leap forward in consciousness are the Archons (demons in theistic terms).
      </p>
      <p>
       A ritual can be like opening an energetic portal... violence, trauma, sickness, fear these things are not the 'natural' way of GOD (as in source consciousness) which is 'Love' or 'Unity'. So by definition these things are 'satanic' because they oppose the consciousness of love and unity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whole religions have been founded on this principle, setting up a dark and a light but both being the same side... pretty much every war is fought this way. Even false flag 'terrorist' attacks... Both sides are secretly the same. One hand creates the problem, the other hand provides the solution. David Icke explains all of this really well.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of pedophiles, they are controlled by the archons and feed them through the negative energy rituals. Illuminati families have practiced this for many generations. The result of their servitude is power and control over the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it's less important they're outed as satanists or luciferians, there is overlap between them. The priority is stopping them, and unfortunately most people aren't ready for the whole truth about WHY they are doing what they are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luciferians say they worship the black sun at the center of the galaxy. In essence they invoke the 'inverse' of love and unity like satanists, but are usually less overt about causing trauma through blood sacrifice and thing like that. Much of the ancient knowledge they co-opted was once used for positive purposes, like freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesuits and Zionists - these are two groups who have specifically maintained power under different names because they have kept the secret knowledge about the old ET 'gods' that they serve, whose DNA they believe they share, and whose souls are able to incarnate into their family bloodlines because of this.

       I know you said it would be a pretty large derailment, but I'm genuinely curious about the idea of "Satan" (or whomever) not being around any longer. If you have time, that is.

       This is a Hero Narrative design mistake, thinking a person alone can be entrusted to manage their power wisely.  Heroes can be wrong, coerced, have limited domain knowledge.  As well the adoption of Hero mentalities has a whole host of failed modalities with it, like protecting the Hero Ledge.  Humanity needs to get over its reliance upon Heroes and Hierarchical designs, in general.

       Given that humans spend around 20 years developing in a state where they are dependent upon others for everything, it tends to instill a program of abiding by hierarchy.  But hierarchy is Bad Design and learning to forget/rewrite our Hero Program is a mandatory growth step, imo.

       This sums it up very perfectly however I am also inclined to believe that having a family is also a requirement. Given the sick stuff these people do and are into it seems strange that they all have families. However playing on the theme of leverage, having a family gives the group more leverage in the event that someone who is "fucked anyway" decides to bring the ship down with them. If they stop caring about their life, they still have their family's to worry about.

       Well, having a family makes you look more normal. Just look at John Podesta with his creepy stuffed animals in his bedroom when he has no kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also since psychopathy is likely hereditary (Rothschilds love their inbreeding) this promotes further spawning of future elite. Even if they don't get the right genes, the style of nuture will make them disaffected and sociopathic anyway.

       John has kids, you're thinking of Tony. Yes, the family could definitely be to just look more normal. These people really don't look affectionate enough to love someone. Still, it's possible that many of these people were subject to some sort of cultish abuse growing up, and feel so desensitized to it that they're able to pull off the evil things they do while still being otherwise normal

       It's been estimated that anywhere between 5 to 10% of the entire human population are predatory "psychopaths" or parasitical "sociopaths" and as such are quite capable of doing virtually anything to others around them including very their own families, close relations or their friends and neighbours, or committing virtually any kind of a crime for no other reason than that it suits or amuses them personally to do it and to be smart enough to manage to get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The brains of these creatures are wired very differently from the rest of us. They have no innate sense of right or wrong and no innate sense of simply "being human" in the way that we all quite naturally and normally understand that, or sense of social belonging and need to honestly share and communicate our common thoughts and feelings with one another and just as naturally understand and sympathize with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever we are selfish or unthinking and hurt or harm others because of it we automatically begin to feel a terrible sense of guilt, regret, remorse, or sorrow that outweighs whatever we initially though we could ever get or gain by it and that alone discourages us from falling prey to the inclinations that made us do it in the first place. In the simplest terms we don't feel very good about ourselves or comfortable in our own skins whenever we let that happen to us so it's clearly something we all want to avoid doing just as much as possible. That's simply the way our own brains happen to be wired and the kind of emotional responses that wiring happens to produce in the vast majority of us and it is all quite recognisably for the good and a very good thing that it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now all of that and all of those quite naturally and normally occuring feelings are completely alien to the psychopath or sociopath. They know only their own particular wants and desires and have no other motivation but to satisfy them and no inhibitions whatsoever when it comes to choosing the most expedient way to do that for themselves. Lie, cheat, or steal, it doesn't really matter to them how they achieve their own particular ends only that they do and whenever they do that only encourages them to be even more ambitious and daring in seeing what else they can possibly do or achieve strictly for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now most of them are either above or well-above average when it comes to their basic intelligence and they recognise the difference between themselves and others very early on by the kind of startling and negative reactions sharing some of their own completely selfish thoughts, ideas, and perspectives apparently have on others around them so they quickly learn to convincingly lie and pretend to simply be like everyone else in order to not have that get in their way. Due to their own peculiar and unusual psychological make-up and lack of any inhibitions it's not only easy for them to do that but also take a great deal of pride and satisfaction from just how easily they can in fact dupe others and how unsuspecting of it those others always seem to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       That also makes them feel vastly superior with nothing but contempt for any of their victims. By and large their private wants and desires aren't generally very different from most of our own but the motives and ambitions that drive them on towards them are all completely selfish, self-serving, and unrestrained in any way. They derive no pleasure or satisfaction from being able to honestly help or give to others in any way at all. They will of course pretend to, but only insofar as that gives them an increased sense of power over them and as way to further control and manipulate them for their own purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       To achieve their own ends and most easily satisfy them, the route most often taken is to seek-out positions of authority and leadership of any kind where their ability to control, manipulate, and take advantage of others and the circumstances around them strictly for their own selfish purposes and gratification will rarely if ever be suspected.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can enter into and rise swiftly in almost any occupation or field of endeavour by quite convincingly faking it and taking full advantage of all the others around them at every possible opportunity as well as contriving and devising situations quite specifically designed to ingratiate and make themselves appear to be indispensable to those in a position to promote, advance, and give them greater authority over others.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are also quick to recognise others like themselves both above and below in any organisation that they can work in concert with and can privately share and gloat over their mutual ability to personally rise above and take the fullest advantage of all the others around them while conspiring to create more and better ways to do just that between them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said they can be found in virtually any field or occupation but when it comes to what we might only call "professional" and "organised" crime syndicates and circles, they are in a domain of their own and outnumber those around them to the same extent that they are outnumbered by ordinary people in any legitimate enterprises or occupations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those of course are the most intelligent, daring, dangerous and utterly ruthless psychopaths and sociopaths to be found. When it comes to the so-called Lucifarians and Satanists we not only have that but ones with exceedingly sick and perverse personal wants and desires at the very top of their list just for good measure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forbidden wants and desires they have banded together to successfully create an environment where they can safely indulge in them as a group as well as extend to other psychopaths and sociopaths in legitimate enterprises and occupations that feel similarly inclined and excited by such possibilities in exchange for certain favours they can bestow in return for occasionally being allowed to indulge in them with no one ever being the wiser about it or the existence of any such arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the kind of sick, sinister and always corrupting forces that are at work to some degree in virtually every human society and that the so-called globalist agenda provides the greatest ability and opportunity for those forces to network, combine, and extend their reach around the entire planet virtually unseen and unchecked while corrupting and compromising virtually everything and everyone else in it's path.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all truth, it's the only feature of that particular agenda that actually has been successful and why in the final analysis it has been so very detrimental to all the very ordinary human beings who's wants and needs are simply honest and modest ones as are all the simple pleasures that no more than simply having those met happen to bring them. That is all most of us know or can see while never understanding why it must be so difficult and growing ever more difficult to accommodate such simple and humble aspirations for ourselves and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The unpleasant truth, such as it is, is that the psychopaths and sociopaths in major positions of power and leadership throughout our entire society are only interested in controlling, manipulating, and exploiting us for their own purely selfish and private reasons and nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasons that go well beyond our humble understanding because we really don't understand or appreciate just how devious, treacherous, and manipulative all these creatures actually are, nor the degree to which they have gained, maintained, and extended their control over us long before now to finally reach the point where there's quite simply so much rot, filth, corruption, and patent duplicity from their actions that there's nowhere we can turn without seeing anything but more and worse of it.

We've got much bigger problems than pedophiles and satanists to worry about, these zombie dolphins are literally embedding themselves in our government....rising Tuna costs are the result of their sinister efforts, what's next?

       Some friends and I have been talking about this very thing. I think it's far too unlikely statistically speaking, that all of these "leaders" just happen to be pedophiles. It makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible that these politicians are being blackmailed for things they have done but now... I am starting to think that it goes beyond that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am starting to seriously suspect that these people are helped to get into positions of power because they have ALREADY been compromised. They are degenerates who are placed into power solely because of the types of people they are... and what they will willingly do when asked.

       Right - I don't think you get into positions of power (that includes acquiring massive wealth)

       you've already been compromised. It's like your ticket to the big show.

       A retired FBI analyst whose job for many years was vetting potential candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court attested to the fact that the cleaner any candidate's background checks and personal integrity appeared to be, the less likely they were to ever be chosen. In fact it was always those with a shady past and plenty of skeletons in their closet that went to the top of the list and that were eventually selected.

       The only conclusion he could reach was that the Whitehouse wanted to be able to direct and control whatever decisions those choices would render and it didn't seem to matter which party actually controlled that Whitehouse when it came to that.

       Maybe this is why Podesta emails kept referring to
       <em>
        disclosure

       .  Spirit cooking could be some weird interdimensional energy harvesting ritual for young human dna.  Satanism could just be a long time cover for alien harvesting of humans.  Our brains can wrap their minds around human sacrifice way before connecting the alien dots.

       That sounds a lot like garmonbozia that Bob eats in the series

       Hah, yeah see, that's changing, and you're behind the times, bud. David Icke's shows are packed these days, and the audience isn't just there to laugh at him anymore. If you read

       "a sex cult runs the world..."
      </p>
      <p>
       You put too much stock in the sex angle here. Sex is but one of the powerful tools used to control people. The group that runs the world isn't a 'sex cult', that is just one of the tools they use.
      </p>

       'Pizzagate' was openly practiced in ancient Greece. This really is nothing new, just current moral tastes dislike it. 'Moral Tastes' are manipulated, just like 'Drug Laws' are manipulated. Drugs still is yet another control lever.
      </p>
      <p>
       People hopefully understand that it is all about control. The world we live in is designed to control us. To make us 'work hard' to get ahead, to make us think a better life is possible, and on and on.  The benefits of humanities efforts all flow to an elite few and they give us only enough benefit they think will keep us slaving away for them.

       The abuse and murder of innocents may be historically something that humanity has done.  But surely it's an area in which we can change our ways.  I doubt humanity would be welcomed as a space-faring people if we can't.

       See, I find the assumptions behind the ET quarantine angle to be ridiculous. It assumes all alien species have identical moral codes to Western humanity, when they developed completely independently millions of light years away potentially, under unique societal and environmental conditions...and when not even the majority of our
       <em>
        own species
       </em>
       believes in that moral code.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the aliens are waiting for mankind to move beyond the concept of innocence and understand that the only truly universal law is that might makes right. Perhaps the aliens eat their own unwanted children alive as a method of population control. Perhaps they're mystified why we haven't exploited our knowledge of computer networking and neuroscience to link mankind's minds together into a single collective supermind to eliminate wasteful conflict and inefficient verbal communication. Maybe they're shocked we still operate with a fractious and feuding tribalistic nation-state system when we have weapons capable of exterminating ourselves and want us to advance beyond hierarchy as an organizational tool. Maybe their religion prohibits contact with aliens of any kind, as they are unclean and to be avoided. Maybe they just really really hate the color orange and will never contact us so long as we allow it to exist on our planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the obscene diversity of life even just on Earth, and the incredible diversity of ideology and creed between members of the same species, the idea that an alien race gives a shit what our leaders do to our young is so outlandishly unlikely that I'd sooner believe in fairies than that.

       Greece had its own norms about what was an acceptable age for sex. They didn't approve of sex with toddlers or children. Just because one culture or time period sets its own age of consent doesn't mean there are no rules.

       There's nothing to welcome/not welcome us anyway. Aliens are likely as fuck, but when you look at the size of the universe, and the age, there's no chance they'd ever be vaguely comparable to us in technological level. You can see the difference 100 years makes, it'd be our technology now meeting 1910 tech, that's a ridiculous advancement. If these dudes are 2000 years (a fucking microscopic, inconceivably close age) older than us they're barely going to notice us.

       Along those lines... aliens almost certainly exist. But are they visiting us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Time-travel is a more likely explanation for alleged 'ET phenomena' such as UFOs.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        It doesn't involve hypothesizing another intelligent species (the travelers are our own descendants)
       </li>
       <li>
        It doesn't involve spanning unimaginable distances (the travelers are coming from Earth, but in the future)
       </li>
       <li>
        It is a logical outcome of current trends on Earth (technological progress at an incredible rate)
       </li>
       <li>
        Time-travel is a known aim of current scientific research (so is being worked toward now and if possible will most likely be achieved in the future)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Lastly but not leastly, it would explain the fact that the 'visitors' observe but do not appear to intervene. Anyone who has read enough sci-fi would understand why, and even if it's not actually correct then time-travelers might not want to take the risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the really weird thing is that only the past is determined, so some of the futures from which we are being visited would never actually happen, because not all futures in which time-travel is invented could be true at the same time.

       Lemme tell you a very strange experience I had when I was a young child.  I was on my porch and across the street I watched a group of kids seemingly get possessed and try to run a bike with one of the kids on it over a baby.  I'm not making this up.  The light in the sky seemed to change, as if getting darker, and these kids just changed into something feral.  They were probably around 10 and younger.
      </p>
      <p>
       In hindsight with all this pedo stuff leaking out, I'm wondering if killing babies is an archonic or alien thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah the whole incident really did seem alien.

       The thought crossed my mind recently that maybe a portion of the anti abortion crusade is to keep the steady supply of troubled youths going.  Kids involved in these circles most likely did not come from the best upbringing.  If your parents don't care then nobody really does.  You end up in foster care, youth center, somewhere very vulnerable to the authority figures around you.  Unfortunately they are not always benevolent.  A kid could disappear without a trace and who would know or care?

       It's how they keep the all-volunteer military going.

      <p>
       If it ever gets to where everyone in the country has good economic prospects where their life isn't on the line, the all-volunteer thing might become unsustainable, and at that point suddenly you have a hard time waging war abroad when American safety at home isn't directly at stake.

       It gets even worse when you realize how unfair they really are. Middle Class American children are charged a fortune in education costs, and have to fight for limited scholarships. So that yes some of them will be forced to join the Military. Meanwhile foreign migrants are imported by the thousands an given entirely free education courtesy of the tax payer. The recent terrorist that tried to run people over an stab a professor at a college was one of them.

       Child protective services, or whatever it's called in one's country, seems to have an incredibly bad record with regards to child welfare compared to the baseline.  And it's been like this for years.  Some feminist policy choices have also perpetuated this failure.  I find it curious that where you'd have supposedly more state control and oversight you have more needless deaths, and bad outcomes.  So something's wrong with policy.  And the groups advocating for status quo are doing so with full knowledge that their strategies are failing and continue to do so.

       now i understand why they want to break down the family unit institution.

      <p>
       if children are taken under government care, its easier to exploit and manipulate them.

       anti abortion ? that almost sounds political... like you are implicating anti abortion , more like pro life groups. Pro life . No they have 'breeders'. Man is this sub compromised or what? Sounding shillish..And btw it isn't teenagers that these types seek out.  They are infants , toddlers and young , children. under the age of 10 .

       Partially true. On the other end there is sexual molestation in music and hollywood and that is the glue that keeps their stars in line. It gets into actual mond control torture and occult practices like causing people to be posessed by demons again for mind control purposes.

       Bingo. Great thread. I had been wondering "why"? and "why these people"? And how come they are rarely caught , let alone prosecuted... and I heard this theory on talk radio  about blackmail and certain factions of the government prefer these freaks because they are controllable , via blackmail and exposure. Hence the govt. connection . hence some of  the politically powerful , and wealthy ,   seem to get involved with this shit.

       back in the 1990's you could buy a "hat" with a leaden weight and a "drain" channel.  you needed medical tape to wear this (it hurts a lot!) and you would switch to larger sizes as nature took its course.

       J Edgar hover. He was in power for so many presidents because he would dig up dirt on your sex life and send prostitutes to the bars you hung out at just so he could confront you with the knowledge, and thus blackmail you into keeping him on. He did this with everyone not just his bosses, foreign diplomats, governors, lawyers,senators
      </p>

       He had lists for everyone of where they hung out, and what they liked in the bedroom.

       I remember reading a chan post, don't have it on me, that basically put forward the hypothesis that high level positions of power, are controlled by forcing them to do something highly illegal. Like sex with a child.

       Here's  a thought. Are the politicians blackmailed into running for office because of their past that can be used to control them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are the Pedos who're in power put there in the first place  because they can be manipulated over their past?

       I'm talking about "You better run for office or else.".

       The hag is dying , her campaign didn't have any fire. So why run for office? She has  tens of billions of dollars in her accounts.

       I admit that I look at (completely non-pedo) porn from time to time, but I don't go anywhere near physical sex.  My younger brother is $20,000 in the hole due to child support, and a friend is periodically suicidal because he has babies to two women who he has to pay support for, and although he's one of the most compassionate people I've ever known, he has never been able to hold down a job.  My mother tried to commit suicide three times because of the number of women she found out about my father having slept with, some of whom were her own family members.

       You're safer inserting your penis into an electrical wall socket than a vagina, these days.  If there's one thing I've noticed about politicians, it's that the more psychopathic they are, the more sex they have.  The only reason I've ever supported transhumanism, is because one of the technologies that they've promised to implement, is asexual reproduction.  Sex needs to entirely cease to exist, as far as I am concerned.  I virtually never see it doing anything but harming people.

       This is a Hero Narrative design mistake, thinking a person alone can be entrusted to manage their power wisely.  Heroes can be wrong, coerced, have limited domain knowledge.  As well the adoption of Hero mentalities has a whole host of failed modalities with it, like protecting the Hero Ledge.  Humanity needs to get over its reliance upon Heroes and Hierarchical designs, in general.

       There's nothing to welcome/not welcome us anyway. Aliens are likely as fuck, but when you look at the size of the universe, and the age, there's no chance they'd ever be vaguely comparable to us in technological level. You can see the difference 100 years makes, it'd be our technology now meeting 1910 tech, that's a ridiculous advancement. If these dudes are 2000 years (a fucking microscopic, inconceivably close age) older than us they're barely going to notice us.

       Lemme tell you a very strange experience I had when I was a young child.  I was on my porch and across the street I watched a group of kids seemingly get possessed and try to run a bike with one of the kids on it over a baby.  I'm not making this up.  The light in the sky seemed to change, as if getting darker, and these kids just changed into something feral.  They were probably around 10 and younger.
      </p>
      <p>
       In hindsight with all this pedo stuff leaking out, I'm wondering if killing babies is an archonic or alien thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah the whole incident really did seem alien.

       See, I find the assumptions behind the ET quarantine angle to be ridiculous. It assumes all alien species have identical moral codes to Western humanity, when they developed completely independently millions of light years away potentially, under unique societal and environmental conditions...and when not even the majority of our
       <em>
        own species
       </em>
       believes in that moral code.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the aliens are waiting for mankind to move beyond the concept of innocence and understand that the only truly universal law is that might makes right. Perhaps the aliens eat their own unwanted children alive as a method of population control. Perhaps they're mystified why we haven't exploited our knowledge of computer networking and neuroscience to link mankind's minds together into a single collective supermind to eliminate wasteful conflict and inefficient verbal communication. Maybe they're shocked we still operate with a fractious and feuding tribalistic nation-state system when we have weapons capable of exterminating ourselves and want us to advance beyond hierarchy as an organizational tool. Maybe their religion prohibits contact with aliens of any kind, as they are unclean and to be avoided. Maybe they just really really hate the color orange and will never contact us so long as we allow it to exist on our planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the obscene diversity of life even just on Earth, and the incredible diversity of ideology and creed between members of the same species, the idea that an alien race gives a shit what our leaders do to our young is so outlandishly unlikely that I'd sooner believe in fairies than that.

       You're spot on about Freemasonry being the original framework. And freemasonry's history is intertwined with Luciferianism. But these people involved in ritual sex abuse and trauma-based mind control are satanic.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Satan', as an individualized being, is less important in satanism than the archons/parasites who feed off the negative energy of the abuse. The above comment about "loosh" is correct. David Icke and David Wilcock are two of the foremost experts on these topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luciferians and Satanists are two sides of the same coin, operating from different power structures of the illuminati. Jesuits and Zionists.

       Greece had its own norms about what was an acceptable age for sex. They didn't approve of sex with toddlers or children. Just because one culture or time period sets its own age of consent doesn't mean there are no rules.
