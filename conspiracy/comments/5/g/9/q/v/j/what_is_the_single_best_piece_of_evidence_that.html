       If you know anything about physics, it's probably the Hezarkhani footage showing a Boeing 767 melting into a 150,000 ton steel and concrete building like a bullet going through an apple.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to a normie it's probably the BBC reporting the collapse of WTC7 23 minutes before it happened, with the building still visible in the background.

       I always thought the cellphone calls were pretty obvious fuckery. Back in 2001 it was easily overlooked. But now it's common knowledge. Cellphones do not work on airplanes.

       Cell phones do actually have limited capability at about 2000 feet and below (guessing). Every time I fly I will test it to see when I lose signal and when I pick up signal. I haven't tried calling anyone though but text works. With that said, I seriously doubt folks were able to make calls back then like they portrayed.

       Actually they did have air phones. I used to travel for work non-stop and used them all the time on my companies dime to call my boyfriend when I was bored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe those particular planes weren't equipped with them but they definitely had air phones on many models of airplanes at the time.

       This is not the "single best piece of evidence" by a long shot, but it always cracks me up it's so ridiculous so I have to throw it in here. You have to watch it if you haven't seen it before....
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy Mark Walsh (of course all the initial eyewitnesses are media employees) comes out of nowhere while everyone is still scratching their heads and/or running in fear with no idea what has just happened and excitedly spits out what will become the official 9/11 Commission Report explanation for why the buildings collapsed. It's totally unbelievable.  Pretty funny.

       There's three pieces of evidence I see as "proof"
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         WTC 7 reaching free fall speed during its fall, which is a physical impossibility for a building collapsing on itself.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nanothermite found in the wreckage without any explanation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The proof of steel that not only melted, but actually evaporated and left behind a Swiss cheese pattern in one known case. The wreckage was red hot for weeks after the collapsed.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Obviously there is a ton more evidence, but those are the strongest points.

       I have read a lot of topics regarding 9/11. Maybe too many but this one is news to me. This needs more eyes on it because I just did some searching and there is very little info out there on it. I'm guessing a lot of people don't know about building 6.

       Israeli Mossad agents caught driving a van with artwork on the side of it depicting a plane hitting the WTC. The van was loaded with bombs. Multiple calls reported that van in the area. The 5 dancing Israelis that were arrested and deported back to Israel and went on Israeli tv afterwards saying they knew about 9/11 in advance. Larry Silverstein buying a worthless building filled with asbestos that would've cost
       <em>
        billions
       </em>
       to destroy and rid of asbestos then 6 weeks later planes magically flew into them and destroyed them for him and he sued for insurance twice because it was "2 acts of terror" and doubled his insurance payout in the
       <em>
        billions

       .

       I remember the van, but not that it had artwork or actual bombs in... I do remember them saying they found
       <em>
        traces
       </em>
       of explosives in the van though. And that they caught the guys dancing and celebrating on the roof of it.

       Alex Jones (info wars) has good stuff on 9/11. I heard the elites bought him out after 9/11 reports. He tells a lot of truth but mixes disinfo 
Yesterday he told his viewers Julian was ok at the embassy. Wtf lol no he ain't

       When they cut his internet they probably just left him with a landline phone. There were some big leaks in the passed few weeks.

       They want us wasting our energy looking for our hero instead of researching the clinton foundation and watching the recounts.

       And finally, maybe Julian just thought clinton would win. And is holding on to a lot of shit for after the inauguration.

       I love how this got buried. I mean there is so much to what happened that day and the weeks and months after but this one has always bothered me a lot. "No, no, just look the other way. We aren't concerned about this bit of the puzzle."
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it amazing that the IRS can find me anywhere. You know those little reports you get in the mail every year that tell you your earnings, expected retirement benefits and everything else? I have fucking moved to places without my name on anything, haven't filed a change of address form or anything else and somehow those reports still find their way to my mailbox. I recognize that they are probably getting the info from my employer so it's not that magical but my point is there are paper trails on everyone everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you are telling me you can't figure out (
       <em>
        or disclose - because someone knows
       </em>
       ) who was behind all the shady trading before everything happened? Who is this? Dr. X hiding out at his volcano island fortress?

       Never needed evidence from the mainstream media to convince me. I was on the phone with an engineer when the second tower collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the second plane plowed into the second tower, I decided to call in to work to let my boss, the above mentioned engineer, know that I was going to be late. I had the TV on, he did not have one in the office and wasn't aware that the second bldg had been hit. So, I called in and was telling him that yes, a second plane had hit the other bldg... when bldg fell straight down into its own footprint. As I described what I was seeing to him he said this: "That is impossible. That can't happen. There is no way that a plane could have done that. That is physically impossible - what is going on?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember the chill that came over me when hearing his denial. I was at the time 7 and a half months pregnant, and it was surreal enough watching 9/11 play out right there on TV live, but then to have him tell me that what I was seeing and hearing was not possible...well, I had to wonder what kind of world I was bringing my first child into. She's 15 now, and I still wonder.

       There's so much, just the fact that an official source claimed that a passport survived the initial impact on the WTC, AND the collapse is mind boggling. Also the part of the Pentagon that got hit was investigating the 2.3 trillion dollars that went missing, (probably what funded the whole damn operation in the first place) the whole entire store is complete BS. Watch all the news coverage of that day. So many things out of place. And some shots just look like pure CGI.

       IMO, the freefall. Dimitri Khazelov has a good theory about it. Stolen Russian suitcase-nukes (as in, they performed inventory and were missing a bunch of them) detonated underground conveniently explain a huge chunk of the mysteries around 9/11, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Massive heat remnants measured even in December
       </li>
       <li>
        Cycling of emergency personnel when they hit a certain level on their dosimeters
       </li>
       <li>
        Freefall
       </li>
       <li>
        Explosions heard by witnesses
       </li>
       <li>
        Long-term symptoms felt by firemen etc., matching radiation sickness. Lots of lung cancer cases.
       </li>
       <li>
        Building 7's corner being caught by part of the second nuke's radius

       One thing I want to know is what happened to the people on the actual planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I mean is if the Pentagon was hit with a missile instead of an actual plane where did the people on that real flight go? Were they just killed? Did they fly the plane out somewhere over the ocean and blow it up?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure I believe the Pentagon was hit with a plane. It doesn't make sense. If it was that is a pretty random plane that makes small and delicate holes without breaking windows or leaving much in the way of plane debris.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are talking about one of the most heavily guarded buildings in the world. You know there is probably a camera every five feet monitoring every inch of space on the property and the best they can do is release one shitty stop frame video that doesn't even look at all credible?
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, where are the people and the actual plane that supposedly hit the Pentagon?
