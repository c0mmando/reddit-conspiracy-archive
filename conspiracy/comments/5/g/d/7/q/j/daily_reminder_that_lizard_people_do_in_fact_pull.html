    <div class="md"><p>As far as my knowledge allows, Grey aliens were originally an organic race of beings from Zeta Reticuli, but some sort of parasite or disease disabled them from reproducing.</p>

<p>The Greys, seeking the survival of their own race, made a pact with Draco Reptilians. These intensely negative Reptilians promised the Greys that in return for their unwavering obedience, they would become inorganic and immortal.</p>

<p>Greys are like the worker bees for these 4th dimension Reptilians. They seem to be robotic in nature. They (the Greys) abduct humans/animals, extract bodily fluids from them, and carry out whatever wishes the Reptilians desire as part of the &quot;contract&quot; that is being fulfilled.</p>

<p>I may have gotten a few details wrong.</p>

<p>Only the grandest idiot in the world or the wisest being in the world would assume that their opinion is infallible. By suggesting, with no measure of open thought or regard, that I need help is ALSO suggesting that your seat of knowledge is unquestionable.</p>

<p>So which are you? The dumbest person or smartest person in the world? I&#39;ll be waiting for an elaborate response detailing exactly what you are.</p>

<p>Open your mind, pleb. I&#39;ll try to as well. This universe is far more diverse and interesting than you seem to have figured out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By not paying attention to this guy, I also most logically infer that this guy and his likeminded are on the exact opposite of the spectrum, saying the same thing about me and the likeminded - to not, &quot;pay attention&quot; to them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the lack of paying attention to difficult circumstance is one of the many reasons we&#39;re in such a grand mess in the first place. Thank you for your comment, but maybe we should pay attention to each other, because some good may come of it.</p>

<p>You agree that the universe is open to possibility, yet then instantly retract your statement by measure of Ad Hominem - suggesting that what i&#39;m talking about is outside of your comfort level by simply being, &quot;too idiotic&quot;</p>

<p>Not only did you retract yourself in 10 words or less (an interesting feat for sure) you also went further and completely obliterated any stance you took by stooping to the low level of personal insult.</p>

<p>I am not your &quot;bro&quot;, do you always throw around false gestures of familiarity or do you only do so when you&#39;re intellectually cornered by your own shortcoming?</p>
