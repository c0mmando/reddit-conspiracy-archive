<p>If this were true passing over magnetic north from direction x would produce opposite results from passing over magnetic north from direction -x. You&#39;ve no clue what you are talking about.</p>

<p>The compass faces magnetic north, no matter where you are on earth. The polarity of earth does not reverse just because you happen to pass by it with a compass.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an explanation of pole reversal:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you are <em>at</em> the north pole, if you move in <em>any</em> direction the north pole will be behind you.</p>

<p>So yes, if you fly over the north pole your compass will change direction <em>because</em> it always points at the north pole, which moves from being in front of you to being behind you as you fly over it.</p>

<p>Simple logic, my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your reaction to the previous post seemed to suggest that you did not believe that a compass would change diretion as you pass over the pole.</p>

<p>I see now that we both interpreted the word &quot;polarity&quot; used in the previous comment differently.</p>

<p>I took it to mean the compass would change the direction it was pointing, while you seem to have taken it to mean that the compass would point south instead of north.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s what I meant by the earth reversing it&#39;s polarity. If you approach the pole from direction x, and the polarity changed as you passed the pold, your compass would continue to face the way it was right before. So by approaching from direction -x the results would be &quot;reversed&quot;. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what direction you approach the pole from.
Did you try the experiment yourself? No, of course you didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>OP could have been a bit clearer in their parent post of this thread, but the reality remains the same.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no mystery involved with the earth being a semi-spherical object (oblate spheroid). You can verify this with extremely simple experiments.</p>

<p>The flat earth theories literally rely on denying evidence that can be obtained from the most basic of physic experiments. </p>

<p>Hate to break it to you but FE is dead wrong. Everything from planes, satellites, cell phones, etc. would not work. Millions of people from engineers to scientists would have to be &quot;in the know&quot; and keep this secret in order to do their jobs. All for what? </p>

<p>The article you linked proves nothing for globe earth. Its the same old material that&#39;s been regurgitated over and over. If it had convinced me before then i wouldnt néed to look at flat earth. All those experiments can be explained with flat earth theory just as easily. </p>

<p>Planes can fly on a flat earth. Why would a flat Earth stop planes from flying?</p>

<p>Cell phones and recievers pick up signals that are wave guided through the atmosphere. You don&#39;t need a satellite high in orbit to send and recieve signals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to add, </p>

<p>I have a friend who works for telcom and was slowly probing him on what he thinks about the structure we live on, was an eminently staunch globalist, that is until I posited a question of basic principles on the subject of telcom, radar and TV signals and how they are transmitted. It was a basic questions such as &quot;Where to our antennas, satellite dishes point?&quot;. </p>

<p>Short answer: &quot;I asked at a state meeting with national directors as to how the dishes/antennas function and got told they point to a specific tower. No satellites needed&quot;</p>

<p>So if one is to understand the basic principles of electromagnetic waves or any sound or frequency wave that they move fastest in a straight line. All the satellite towers are on topographic high points. Why in the 21St century can we get no cell reception in a gully or Valley but walk to the top of a hill and have a perfect reception? It simply is because one &#39;picks up&#39; on the frequency by being exposed to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cell phones aren&#39;t satellite phones. Cell phones use towers on the earth. A better example would be satellite tv, which has to point in a specific location in the sky depending on one&#39;s geographical location and the location of the satellite. Ever wonder why sat tv goes out when there&#39;s storms? It&#39;s because the clouds block the signals from reaching the satellite and vice-versa. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>GWEN tower get on it. Satellite TV does not use a literal satellite you drongo nor in my comment did I state anything about cell phones being satellite phones. You lose signal in a valley, with storms you lose signal because of electromagnetic interference, low clouds disrupt the density of air and along with the water in clouds disrupts communications and how electromagnetic waves travel, as water conducts electricity naturally.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t wonder anything I know. Satellite dishes don&#39;t point straight up they point to a high point. A topographic advantage point for the tower to be placed to best cover the 100-300 miles in a radius, there are so many as to secure signal strength which overlaps, which is why your GPS has to triangulate and sometimes skips and sends you on the wrong path.</p>

<p>Everything uses towers on the earth it would be uneconomical to send billions of dollars of tech into the sky when we can&#39;t even get signal in a gully???? </p>

<p>Now if there were thousands of &#39;satellites&#39; &#39;orbiting&#39; in a &#39;geosyncrounous&#39; manner then at any point we should have connection. Yet here I am talking about taking a stroll down a hillside into a valley and not having reception and then walking back up to the top and being able to communicate fine with the frequency emitting technology.</p>

<p>Layman&#39;s for you. Friend told me telco companies don&#39;t use satellites. TV and Broadcasters don&#39;t use satellites. NASA does not use satellites, Geographical surveyor&#39;s do not use satellites. </p>

<p>They all use planes with LIDAR imaging.</p>

<p>How no one knows this is hilarious. I like however your grade 5 explanation though. Really hits home how devoid of reason science has become.</p>

<p>In the diagram of the globe earth you&#39;ve drawn the clouds higher than an orbiting satellite.</p>

<p>The very highest clouds form at 20,000 feet above earth&#39;s surface. 
Normal rain clouds form much lower and closer to the earth&#39;s surface.</p>

<p>At the scale of your drawing the clouds would not be visible because they are so close to the surface.</p>

<p>Rays of sunlight, in the globe earth model are parallel when the they hit the earth, for the most part.</p>

<p>This means if the sunlight ray angle is tangential or less to the earth&#39;s surface then the observer will not see the sun rays anymore.</p>

<p>Which then means, if the observers can still see sunlight then the angle of the sun rays are pointing downward to the observer. From above the cloud layer. The earth obstructs the sunlight before the angle of the sunlight could ever be able to shine under the cloud layer, while still being visible to an observer on the earth surface.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was conveying the idea of my argument to the guy I was answering who clearly didn&#39;t understand what I was saying. Making an accurate model would render the image unusable because the earth would literally not be visible. It would be smaller than a pixel. But please, go ahead and waste over half your answer on attacking a model which clearly was never intended to accurately describe sizes and distances. </p>

<p>The sun&#39;s rays are indeed &quot;pretty much parallel&quot;. But they&#39;re not completely parallel. As soon as the sun goes below the horizon, you have sun rays coming at the clouds from below the horizon and up into the clouds. And that is why a globe earth model can explain this phenomenon. A flat earth model can not.</p>

<p>And that was exactly what I was orginally asking. How does a flat earth model explain this phenomenon? It seems it can&#39;t, because I now have two geniuses doing mental gymnastics to avoid answering the question. What you both have been trying to do is explain why this isn&#39;t even a thing in the first place. Which every single person who has ever seen a sunset knows it is. On top of this, a globe earth model explains why the clouds appear to be pink, or red in color during a sunset. A flat earth model can&#39;t explain this.</p>

<p>This is mainly the problem with you flat earthers. I have yet to meet one who can have an actual dicussion without going completely off topic. It seems to me that you&#39;re always focusing on the wrong things, because you know that you can&#39;t win a real argument on some of these subjects.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve missed the point of my post. In your diagram I was not addressing the portrayal of the earth&#39;s size or it&#39;s distance relative to the sun. I was addressing the wildly exaggerated height of the clouds and the sun rays angle of approach, which you tried use to supposedly show how sunlight hits the underside of the cloud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But please, go ahead and waste over half your answer on attacking a model which clearly was never intended to accurately describe sizes and distances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your model was never intended to accurately describe how it works then why did you spend the time to share it? It proves nothing. It&#39;s actually a false claim and does more to harm your argument then aid it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does a flat earth model explain this phenomenon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a flat earth model the sunset is the sun traveling far away from you and receding into the horizon line. The sunset clouds that an observer sees as illuminated from below are also very far away and receding into the horizon line. These clouds are closer to the sun then the observer is to the sun. The angle of sunlight then reflects more readily back up to the clouds underside, even more spectacularly over a reflective surface like the ocean. You&#39;ll notice that the clouds directly over the observer are darker and less illuminated as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On top of this, a globe earth model explains why the clouds appear to be pink, or red in color during a sunset. A flat earth model can&#39;t explain this. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A flat earth model explains this as well, and in the same way. During a sunset the sunlight that reaches the observer must travel a farther distance and through more atmosphere, and so the light is scattered much more. red light waves are scattered the least by atmospheric gas molecules.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is mainly the problem with you flat earthers. I have yet to meet one who can have an actual discussion without going completely off topic. </p>

<p>I referred <em>specifically</em> to your diagram. How is that going off topic? That is as on topic as I can be.
We are talking about how sunlight seems to be lighting the underside of a cloud. Are we not? We are discussing a specific phenomena. </p>

<p>The Earth has an iron core that is part liquid and part solid crystal due to gravitational pressure. It is believed that movement in the liquid outer core is what produces the Earth&#39;s magnetic field. Like all magnetic fields the Earth&#39;s magnetic field has two main poles, a north and south pole. These magnetic poles are slightly off from the Earth&#39;s axis rotation which is used as the basis of the geographic poles, but they are close enough that the general directions with adjustments for the polar difference, called a declination, can be used for navigation. Essentially a compass is a light weight magnet, generally a magnetized needle, on a free rotating pivot. This allows the needle to better react to nearby magnetic fields. Since opposites attract the southern pole of the needle is attracted to the Earth&#39;s natural magnetic north pole. This is how navigators are able to discern north</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gravitational attraction. Or do you deny gravity exists as well?</p>

<p>The very existence of gravity disproves the flat earth model and explains <em>why</em> all massive bodies must become spherical.</p>

<p>The mass in a planet is constantly falling towards its center. This means that at the edge of a flat earth, the direction of gravity would not be downwards (where there is less mass) but sideways towards the center of the plane. The edges would literally be pulled inwards until every part of the surface was approximately the same distance from the center of mass. The shape it would form is spherical, not planar.</p>

<p>For the flat earth model to be true, the direction of gravity would be dependent on your location, it would not always point down, because at some places on the surface the center of mass would be off to the side, not below you. In those areas you&#39;d fall sideways, not down.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t happen on our planet so it <em>must</em> be a sphere.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/sZcbN6E.png">Here is a rough image to demonstrate</a></p>

<p>The red lines reflect the direction of gravity pointing towards the center of mass. As you can see, on a flat plane the direction is not always pointing downwards perpendicular to the surface, but at the edges it is almost parallel to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trouble with that is that gravity does not exist on a flat plane. Mass being greater then the density of the object around it does however exist and is verifiable. Like you know dropping lead into the ocean no matter how small the piece of lead, the density is greater than the liquid around it and is heavily concentrated. That is not to say that lead is incapable of floating it can and does float on liquid, that being liquid mercury 11 grams vs 13.5 grams.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>False.</p>

<p>On a flat plane, gravity still exists, but it would be acting to turn the flat plane into a sphere, and the only thing that would stop it is if the material the plane is made of is stronger than the gravitational force.</p>

<p>This is why the moon is spherical, while small asteroids can be all sorts of non-spherical shapes. The amount of mass in the asteroid can not generate enough gravitational force to overcome the strength of the material the asteroid is made of, while the mass of the moon <em>is</em> great enough to crush the material it is made of into a spherical shape.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Actually, gravity is the weakest force we know about - that is why a tiny magnet can hold a paperclip off the ground despite the gravity of the entire planet pulling on it.</p>

<p>The helium is floating on the oxygen and nitrogen, which are heavier molecules that are pulled down far more strongly than the lighter helium molecule. The buoyancy &quot;force&quot; overcomes the weak gravitational force, and the helium floats to the top.</p>

<p>It is a shame many people can overlook the basics whilst being indoctrinated in the complexities. Take a step back and see the trees for the forest.</p>

<p>Gravity does not exist, and saying gravity does exist while trying to use confirmation bias and peoples own statements to prove your own while you BELIEVE in a THEORY of gravity. The gravity appears to be an inability for oxygen to travel to your brain because of the strength of such a force as &#39;GRAVITY&#39;. A belief in something that cannot be proven is merely fanciful thinking and fraudulent especially in any scientific setting.</p>

<p>The moon is a satellite, asteroids are planetoids and are not spherical. The moon is a disk, we can only see one side which is flipped and viewed by people on the opposite side of the plane. Eg &gt; @ &lt; the two arrows represent the perspective of say Australia vs the US. </p>

<p>&quot;while the mass of the moon is great enough to crush the material it is made of into a spherical shape.&quot; - you</p>

<p>That is a pretty broad and reaching statement got any proof for that theory?</p>

<p>What&#39;s your point? Water is less dense than lead, and mercury is more dense than lead.</p>

<p>Gravity is a force of nature, just as electromagnetism is. You see light, just as well as you observe gravity. There&#39;s literally no arguing against it. The <em>models</em> we use to describe them are what we can argue. The fact you do not get this shows a complete lack of understanding on what science is.</p>

<p>In order for FE to be even close to true we have to <em>completely dismiss gravity</em>. It&#39;s like trying to say the sun does not exist because a blind person does not see the sun.</p>

<p>Explain how gravity does not exist and you might have a leg to stand on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mass = heavier than air = what you believe is called gravity.</p>

<p>Lead sinks in water. H20 sinks in h20. Humans are made up of many atoms that comprise bonds that are heavier than air. So we walk on the ground because we cannot fly. We jump, through the thrust of the compression of force in the muscle defy gravity and come back down because we cannot remain lighter than air through any such force other than thrust.</p>

<p>So gravity is not a force it is a theory describing a bunch of things that are not it. So people messed up and thought that there actually needed to be a force to describe all forces in one. When that is poppy cook.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t want to touch on anything that disproves gravity I get it just look to my statement and the truth states for itself. Gravity can not be proven.</p>

<p>If gravity existed plane engines would have to be 5 x the size. But the reason planes defy gravity that&#39;s right, is because their wings create lift after the engines create thrust. The low pressure on the top of the wing causes the plane to rise higher because of the condensed air underneath the wing. </p>

<p>If this was not the case then the engines would need to be pointed like a rocket, which they are not..</p>

<p>You don&#39;t see gravity because it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll be waiting for you to even address this with a rebuttles. Which I know you won&#39;t because you don&#39;t get anything from being wrong.</p>

<p>Hopefully nothing over 1 soul, I only have one. It&#39;s very dear to me. Must be why there are no automatic doors at Universities.</p>

<p>But in all seriousness you haven&#39;t even tried to debunk anything I have stated but I am interested as to why you have started another thread to derail on.</p>

<p>Classic forum sliding.
You should really read up on your own rules.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no FE model that can explain gravity away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Newtonian gravity works out correctly for a flat Earth if the Earth is an infinite plane. IIRC you get normal gravity on the surface if the plane has the real Earth&#39;s density and is about 2/3rds the Earth&#39;s actual radius.</p>

<p>Of course, none of our observations about the motions of the planets make sense in this model. It&#39;s just a fun mathematical novelty, really.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not gravity, it&#39;s surface tension. Caused by electrostatic force.</p>

<p>I should have clarified what I meant here. Assume surface tension doesn&#39;t exist, then gravity would result in this but only in atmosphere. The reason we know surface tension exists is because this also happens in a vacuum. So I was trying to show that even if we disbelieve in certain things, gravity is still there no matter how hard you may think otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s wrong though. Gravity is a very weak force and isn&#39;t enough to pull small amounts of matter together like that, especially when everything is already moving around. Maybe in deep space with no other forces, but there&#39;s a reason there&#39;s random dust in the solar system that hasn&#39;t coalesced into planets.</p>

<p>Also, you can tell surface tension exists because sand doesn&#39;t form droplets but water does.</p>

Besides if jumped from the building he would disprove gravity and the rotation of the earth as the earth should move from under him and he would end up meters from where he jumped (presuming no Geo-Engineering included). </p>

<p>... dude, think for yourself.  Have you ever used a compass?  Try to imagine how it would work differently on a plane than it would on a sphere.</p>

<p>Hint: imagine using a compass on a sphere and travelling due east according to the compass, think of where you would eventually end up.  Think of the same on a plane.  Think about how north on the  compass would appear under each of the circumstances.  You can do this, I have faith in you.</p>

<p>Think for yourself instead of relying on Youtube videos and other people to educate you on basic things.  Conduct the experiment I outlined for you in your head, think about how it would differ on a sphere or on a plane.  I understand it must seem challenging and strange for you to reach conclusions based on educating yourself, but even with the smallest amount of critical thought and a rudimentary ability to think in 3 dimensions I&#39;m certain you can figure this out on your own.</p>

<p>Well at least you&#39;ve now admitted that I&#39;m not &quot;stalking&quot; you, whatever that is supposed to mean.</p>

<p>If you are unable to mentally visualize how a compass would act differently on plane than on a sphere then there is really no helping you.  I&#39;ve even outlined an experiment that you could do yourself.  With any of the free 3D programs available you could easily learn something on your own without pestering random people on reddit to teach you rudimentary physics.</p>

<p>First of all, the current theory of what causes the tides is far from satisfactory. I&#39;ll suggest you research into the the discrepencies if your care.</p>

<p>As far as how the tides are our occuring  with flat earth, perhaps the land mass of the earth is just like a large island bobbing slowly in the waters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What happens at the ends of this flat Earth? </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know. It&#39;s possible that it goes on forever and never ends. Another theory is that there is some sort of dome surrounding us.</p>

<p>I&#39;m from Duluth, and can see Superior with my naked eye practically anywhere in the city. There are certainly gases, water vapor, and particulates that distort my view of Superior, but I still see it. Why? Because those things account for extremely small portions of the light that enters my FOV. The same goes for telescopes. The amount of gases,  water vapor, particulates, etc. that are within its FOV are extremely small, and do not distort what it sees in such a way as to fake a horizon.</p>

Further peak - less vivid, slightly washed out color and clarity.
Even further peak, low resolution, significantly lighter than the closer mountain peaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering the first few reasons are laughably false, there is no need to attempt to debunk them all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The horizon always appears perfectly flat 360 degrees around the observer regardless of altitude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. The photos used as &quot;evidence&quot; do show a slight curvature. The problem is, the curvature is small enough that it only accounts for a difference of a few pixels that is very difficult to measure by drawing lines on the photo.</p>

<p>Take a look at the Mount Everest photo and you&#39;ll see why. On either end of the line, the horizon is a few pixels below the line. In the middle it is on the line and possible even obscured behind it. That photo shows a clear curve, but a very slight one. The line has been drawn in such a way as the curve is mostly obscured, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The horizon always rises to the eye level of the observer as altitude is gained, so you never have to look down to see it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No shit. The distance <em>to</em> the horizon increases, however, which can&#39;t be explained away by saying that the atmosphere is scattering the light. You can see further, the higher you go. After you get <em>high enough</em>, that&#39;s when the horizon drops away. Of course by then you&#39;ll be in space well above low earth orbit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The natural physics of water is to find and maintain its level. If Earth were a giant sphere tilted, wobbling and hurdling through infinite space then truly flat, consistently level surfaces would not exist here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, the natural physics of water is to fall towards the center of gravity. On a flat plane, that would mean the water would all rush towards the center of the plane as the direction of gravity would not always be downwards perpendicular to the surface. Also, think of a rain drop. Surface tension pulls the water into a spherical shape, not a flat plane or cube.</p>

<p>In a spherical planet &quot;level&quot; is when all parts of the surface are the same distance from the center of mass/gravity - that is, on a sphere &quot;level&quot; is spherical. If the sphere is large enough, the surface <em>appears</em> to be flat because the curvature is so slight.</p>

<p>As I said, the first few are so laughably false as to make the rest of it not worth wasting time on.</p>

You lose signal in a valley, with storms you lose signal because of electromagnetic interference, low clouds disrupt the density of air and along with the water in clouds disrupts communications and how electromagnetic waves travel, as water conducts electricity naturally.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t wonder anything I know. Satellite dishes don&#39;t point straight up they point to a high point. A topographic advantage point for the tower to be placed to best cover the 100-300 miles in a radius, there are so many as to secure signal strength which overlaps, which is why your GPS has to triangulate and sometimes skips and sends you on the wrong path.</p>

<p>Layman&#39;s for you. Friend told me telco companies don&#39;t use satellites. TV and Broadcasters don&#39;t use satellites. NASA does not use satellites, Geographical surveyor&#39;s do not use satellites. </p>

<p>They all use planes with LIDAR imaging.</p>

<p>How no one knows this is hilarious. I like however your grade 5 explanation though. Really hits home how devoid of reason science has become.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re comparing completely different types of jobs. Satellites are for jobs that require 24/7 365. The amount of fuel necessary to keep the <em>millions</em> of planes/drones in flight at all times (on top of passenger flights) would suck the earth dry in a matter of months. Satellites don&#39;t need all that fuel, because their motion is generated by <em>falling to the earth due to gravity</em>. </p>
