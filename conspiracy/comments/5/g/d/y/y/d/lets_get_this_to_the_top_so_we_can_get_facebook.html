        Email response from facebook and my follow up might have gone a little far with the criminal harassment thing but 
its really starting to feel like I'm being harassed maybe legal action is in order. I've had to create a second account ( this one) and now its locked as well I'm done with this shit. Something bigger is happening here.

       Reposting because mod's removed my first post because I had a Facebook link in the body. Everything is Imgur hosted now as per rules.

       If we can get this to the front page I encourage anyone with Twitter to tweet at the official Facebook page on Twitter and #FacebookStopExtorting #BoycottFacebook #MakeFacebookPrivateAgain.

       So a month or so ago I got my original facebook profile shutdown by facebook not because I violated terms or was bullying or anything that would merit my pages removal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said fuck it I was using my nickname as my last name ( which hasn't been a problem for the last 5+ years ) Facebook said I had to give them an ID to open my page back up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, Fuck that - So I photoshopped my fake last name onto my california DL and it was flawless I also blurred my address out because they themselves even said I could do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for a second form I showed a piece of mail again with the address blurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I sent it in I get a response from Facebook rep " Steve " saying that they can't accept those because it seems they have been altered. I explain that this is been altered for my own safety and privacy as per their own advice. 
So after a week of back and forth from my personal email ( always headed with my first and last name ) I say fuck it I need to stay in contact with friends that don't use IG or Twitter so I make a new account .
      </p>
      <p>
       This time With my full real name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yesterday I get a notice that my password isn't safe so I have to make a new password. Okay. Did that.
I go to sign on today and I'm hit with the same bullshit message again saying for my safety they need to verify my identity?

       Theres got to be something else going on I see fake pages everyday on facebook get requests from catfish pages ect. but my REAL life personal page keeps getting flagged either by someone I know or Facebook themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does facebook need my personal information? If I have access to my email address for the account I am clearly who I say I am. I understand people get other peoples passwords to email and could control accounts this way but anyone with a email probably has a second email address and should have setup that as a backup account in the event their new email is compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has to be an alterior motive for FB to want private information such as that would be on a gov't ID .
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not giving them shit and noone else should either theres some fuckery afoot. Facebook became a billion dollar entity I don't doubt for one second theres not something malicious going on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I say to my fellow
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       subscribers if they ask for this info just never go back to facebook. they are up to something. #BoycottFacebook #DeleteYourFacebook they are extorting your personal pages for your private information.
      </p>
      <p>
       a quick search shows they've been fishing for private info for at least the last 3 years now

      <p>
       And for anyone who wants to know why this is a big deal - its because I can't stay in contact with people like I need to and its also how I do a lot of my business in graphic art , car sales , photography ect. So this inconvenience could be taking money from my pockets which is opposite of what a free safe service should do.

       Heres where their page takes you when you say you can't upload a photo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like photo ID isn't the end of what they want from you.
They can mandate you give them your mobile phone number as well

       Eh. Stop using Facebook. I have to take a picture of my driver's license and send it to blizzard every time I want to remove the Authenticator off my battle.net account when I get a new phone. It's just a thing companies do. Facebook already knows everyone you've ever slept with, everything you've ever googled, your entire life history, everyone you speak to, everything you do even when you're not on Facebook, etc. so if you're that concerned about your privacy, get rid of it. Not only will it make you a happier person but you'll eliminate like 30% of all the internet spying done to you and you'll never have to see a photo of someone else's kid or a shared Facebook account between an unreasonably "happy" couple.

       Removed Messenger and Facebook from my phone and the battery life improved dramatically. Those shit apps are constantly running in the background and spying on you. Use SMS and regular voice calls (not Viber or WhatsApp).
