        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s what I would have done:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Acknowledge, explain, and even apologize for the instagram photos and comments, as well as any creepy art in the restaurant.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide irrefutable evidence that the children in the photos are alive and well w/their families.  </p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge logo similarities to FBI pedo symbols and announce plans to change it.  </p></li>
<li><p>Take a video of the entire restaurant, inside and out, all access. Or offer after hours tours of the entire restaurant for $5 a pop. Come see the conspiracy, all access.  </p></li>
<li><p>That&#39;s the Comet pizza aspect, but not Podesta email codes. Acknowledge the codes in the emails are weird and that you know nothing about them (or provide a benign explanation if it exists).  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Instead, they get NYT to write fact check w/0 facts. Followed by others avoiding the instagram, podesta codes in their &#39;debunking&#39;. Comet gets Reddit, fb, twitter,etc to censor pizza, and Jimmy comes off arrogant in his explanations/actions, not apologetic.  Their reaction, with the NYT piece in particular, made me believe something was up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it&#39;s more important for the media to focus on Alefantis instead of writing about the missing kids in Virginia which was highlighted in this fake news.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know maybe they could have done something like how real news(missing kids) are getting caught up with fake news. But nope leading up to this &quot;gun incident&quot; they just kept saying its fake and people were harassing him. And now we need to make changes to our first amendment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, but Bucks is listed at two stories when it only has a main floor and a basement. Comet is listed the exact same way. So you can infer Comet also has a basement. This also doesn&#39;t explain the huge hole they were digging on their instagram.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure about this. I saw the voat post that lists both properties as 2 stories. But, if you use streetview, you can see that CPP has the same roofline as Chevy Chase Gallery, which is clearly 2 stories (ground floor and upstairs).</p>

<p>That&#39;s not true. The building next to it is 3-4 feet taller. Also, the buildings are built on a hill with Comet being on the higher side of that hill. </p>

<p>No it&#39;s not, it&#39;s 3-4 feet lower than the building next to it. The street is also on a hill with Comet being on the higher portion of that hill. Comet also has vaulted ceilings. It is one story.</p>

If I were being charged with these crimes and they were absolutely false claims, I&#39;d do like a live press conference, answer ANY questions, and literally take people through my shop and show them EVERYTHING and do anything I can to prove the claims false. If he&#39;s innocent, and the truth is on his side, why does he kick everyone who films the place out of the shop? Why didn&#39;t he prove the kids in those photos are infact safe and alive?

They start their own military assassin juntas and these bastards go running scared.

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying that when hordes of people harass you, send you death threats, and accuse you of having a child rape dungeon in the basement of your pizza restaurant where you regularly rape and murder children and drink their blood in satanic rituals with the political elite, your first response is to bend over backwards for, <em>and apologize to</em>, them while offering them tours and access into your life?</p>

<p>And you&#39;re saying that the fact that <em>any rational thinking human being</em> would not react in this fashion, and come off as &quot;arrogant&quot; in the face of these accusations, is evidence that they do in fact have a rape dungeon in the basement of their pizza restaurant where they regularly rape and murder children?</p>

<p>You&#39;re coming into this with the assumption that you are correct and that he is guilty, and view his lack of bending over backwards to appease the masses of people who harass the fuck out of him as further evidence that you are correct and he is guilty.</p>

<p>If you even make the most smallest attempt to approach this from an objective point of view and think critically about it, you&#39;d see how ridiculous that is.</p>

<p>And even if he followed your directions to the letter, you can bet your sweet ass that hordes of people would still consider him a child rapist.</p>

<p>He says, &quot;our logo does kinda look like the FBI thing&quot;, that&#39;s an admission of guilt and the fact that he wants to change it is him trying to cover it up.</p>

<p>He says, &quot;Here&#39;s a tour of the entire restaurant&quot;, that&#39;s just a testament to how well he hid his sex dungeon before he gave the tour, or an admission that his sex dungeon is actually off site.</p>

<p>The list goes on.</p>

<p>People did not arrive to these accusations in a rational manner. They will not abandon them when faced with a rational reason to. You cannot use reason to argue someone out of a position that they did not use reason to get themselves into in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t prove a negative. It&#39;s impossible. What you&#39;re asking me to do is literally the exact same as someone saying &quot;You cannot prove that God does not exist, therefore he definitely does exist&quot;.</p>

<p>Which is irrational as fuck. It&#39;s not my job to prove that God does not exist, it&#39;s your job to prove that he does, and if you fail to you cannot directly refute my argument that he does not.</p>

<p>I&#39;m making the argument that a path to these conclusions in a rational manner does not exist. I cannot prove this without exhausting literally every single possible path to reach these conclusions, which are arguably infinite.</p>

<p>It is not my job to prove that a rational path does not exist, it is your job to prove that one does, and if you fail to do so you cannot directly refute my argument that one does not exist.</p>

<p>Because you cannot <em>prove</em> a negative.</p>

<p>But outside of direct proofs, it is an <em>argument</em>, that has logical backing. Like all arguments should. Even though it cannot be proven, because it is a negative, it can be <em>argued</em>. And I&#39;ve argued it quite a bit already today. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gtit0/is_pizzagate_real/dav5fst/?context=3">Here&#39;s an example</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not rational to take a sentence that is <em>literal gibberish</em> outside of context, which you don&#39;t have because it is a private conversation between two people, and assume that the context is him talking about raping and murdering children in a satanic ritual.</p>

<p>It is not rational to take something that <em>could not possibly more clearly be a joke</em>, and take it as evidence that she was literally going to sacrifice a chicken in a satanic ritual for good luck.</p>

<p>It is not rational to assume that a guy talking about a basement <em>in a different location</em> 4 years ago, and him saying that his location does not have a basement, as evidence that he really does have a basement and the basement is actually a sex dungeon where he invites the political elite over to brutally rape and murder children in. And maybe cook their remains in the pizza he serves in the restaurant.</p>

<p>Nothing about these accusations and the leaps in logic they must take to arrive at their conclusions is remotely rational.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually explained that in the comment I linked. People shoved a veritable mountain of evidence that pizzagate was real down your throats.</p>

<p>When you see a mountain of evidence for something, the fact that there is a mountain of evidence for that thing makes you believe that that thing is credible.</p>

<p>But most of that evidence is either pure horseshit, huge leaps in logic, or just completely and utterly unrelated to the situation altogether.</p>

<p>If you strip away all of the evidence for pizzagate that is horseshit, you are left with a small amount of kinda weird things that no sane person would ever say proves that they brutally rape and murder children in the basement of a pizza place among the political elite in satanic rituals.</p>

<p>But that evidence is not stripped away for you. You are given the smorgasbord of evidence, horseshit and all, and are told that it is all equally valid.</p>

<p>And, like I said, because there is so much &quot;evidence&quot;, it looks a lot more real and credible than it actually is.</p>

<p>And if you couple this with the fact that it&#39;s tangentially related to Hillary Clinton, who I assume you have a strong bias against, makes you more ready to eat it up. Especially before the election.</p>

<p>Imagine if you hated Hillary, and then someone told you that her campaign manager brutally rapes and murders children in the basement of a pizza place.</p>

<p>You would be <em>a lot</em> more ready to believe that to be true than if you didn&#39;t feel strongly about her at all.</p>

<p>And as it turns out, a very large portion of the country had very strong feelings towards both presidential candidates.</p>

<p>So you have this mountain of mostly horseshit evidence, which doesn&#39;t look too much like horseshit because there&#39;s so much of it. And you have tens of millions of people ready to gobble that shit up because it&#39;s saying bad things about people they hate, and it will help the person who they want to win become the president if it was true.</p>

<p>You have tens of millions of people <em>wanting with every fiber of their beings for this to be true</em>. It&#39;s not that hard to trick them into believing in something they already wanted to believe anyway.</p>

<p>As it turns out, its human nature that if you <em>genuinely believe something to be true</em>, you are very averse to changing this belief.</p>

<p>So if you have a group of people who genuinely believe something to be true, at least in part for politically motivated reasons, and then the driving force behind that political motivation goes away, they will <em>still believe the thing in question to be true</em>.</p>

<p>And even then, with the division in this country between the left and right at greater heights than we&#39;ve ever seen before, the political motivation to believe that the person the left nominated is connected to a large pedophile ring is not exactly gone. </p>

<p>Do you honestly expect people who vehemently believe pizzagate to be true to just suddenly stop believing it after the election is over, even if they initially believed it largely in part because it was bad for Clinton?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are arguing that people who don&#39;t believe James Alefantis is innocent actually hope that children are being abused even after her humiliating defeat?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they don&#39;t want children to be abused. They want him to be guilty of abusing children, because if he is it will vindicate their beliefs and be bad for their political opponents.</p>

<p>There is a distinct difference between wanting children to be abused, and wanting him to be guilty of abusing children. This was never about the children. This was never about compassion or empathy towards the children they believe he hurt. This was always a witch hunt.</p>

<p>This was always about people being guilty, not the people they would have to have hurt if they were guilty. Because you, and people who believe in pizzagate, have something to gain in them being guilty.</p>

<p>You gain vindication in your beliefs, proof that the people pointing out the many flaws in your logic were actually wrong, proof that liberals and the establishment are literally the devil and are pure evil, and proof that everyone who voted Clinton made a mistake and Trump is unambiguously the correct choice for president.</p>

<p>You are incredibly full of shit if you can&#39;t admit that, if the police found a sex dungeon where Alefanfis performed satanic rituals in the basement of the pizza place tomorrow, you would feel some satisfaction in being proven right.</p>

<p>Alright lets start here. This whole pizzagate business has brought the Franklin Cover Up back into the spotlight so how is it that you can possibly tilt this as being about the liberals being evil? </p>

<p>Again it brought the Franklin Cover Up into the light so whats your theory here that the right was trying to bury the left, but accidentally revealed their own skeletons in the process? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It backfired so hard bro. It brought up a decades old event that involved Republicans very briefly. Sure showed them how dumb it was to make this conspiracy theory which is several times more popular than that decades old thing that people talked about briefly.</p>

<p>On a serious note, I legitimately cannot believe that you cannot see how flimsy it is to say &quot;This conspiracy theory spread almost exclusively by Trump supporters and right wing media is not politically motivated at all in the slightest, because it briefly brought a small amount of attention to a decades old republican controversy&quot;</p>

<p>Your position(and if that is not your position then <em>fucking correct me</em>, as I have given you ample opportunity to do) is so logically flawed I legitimately refuse to believe that you genuinely hold it.</p>

<p>Yeah of course, revealing Washington&#39;s bi-partisan pedophilia problem was a ploy by the right-wing. There&#39;s a strong theory right there &quot;bro&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait...</p>

<p>Are you arguing that this conspiracy theory <em>wasn&#39;t</em> largely spread by Trump supporters? Are you arguing that Clinton supporters and liberals bought into it in equal measure to Trump supporters? Are you arguing that it wasn&#39;t talked about every day on the Donald Trump for president subreddit? Are you arguing that most media that talks about it does not tend to be right wing?</p>

<p>I get it now.</p>

<p>You weren&#39;t arguing that these things were the case, but it still somehow wasn&#39;t politically motivated.</p>

<p>You were merely arguing against objective reality. I&#39;m actually kinda relieved. I can understand someone simply rejecting objective reality to fit their narrative a lot more than I can understand the gargantuan leaps in logic you would have had to take to both acknowledge reality and hold your position.</p>

<p>This all makes so much more sense to me. Thanks for clearing that up.</p>

<p>Nor does this:</p>

<p>See, typically when someone says they want an answer to a question, the answer only really counts as an answer if <em>it fucking addresses the thing that was asked</em>. On both of these occasions, you failed to do this.</p>

<p>Therefore, you didn&#39;t answer the question. You dodged it. Multiple times. </p>

<p>And then <em>you yourself</em> admitted that you did not answer the question, when you made this comment:</p>

<p>But, like I explained to you, I understand perfectly why you have no choice but to constantly dodge and refuse to answer the question. You literally cannot answer it without either admitting I&#39;m right or illustrating your horribly flawed logic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s perfectly rational for you to refuse to give straight yes or no answer to my yes or no question, because you can&#39;t without losing this argument.</p>

<p>But in doing so, in a roundabout way, you&#39;re just admitting I&#39;m right without saying it. And I understand why you&#39;d do this too. Because admitting you&#39;re wrong is hard, and I get you not wanting to do it.</p>

<p>The thing about psyops, they rely on factual evidence to mislead you. These stories aren&#39;t new. Nothing about the theory that the elites are pedos and ghouls is new. There&#39;s new evidence backing those claims now though and no single sit down is going to walk you through the years of mountains of evidence. So ya, it does seem to fit. </p>

<p>So while the whole thing has been led away from the elites and pointed at a pizza guy just by naming it pizza, there&#39;s probably some truth in there. </p>

<p>It is one huge psyop being orchestrated against conspiracy theorists in general though. From a purely objective standpoint it really is pretty brilliant. Same as any honey-pot. Give a little of what they want (in this case truth) to convince them you&#39;re on their side, then lead them down a hole that discredits their integrity as a community and find a reason to take away their rights before you lock them up or outright kill them. Cut and dry really. </p>

And a passion for science helps. The scientific method is always a good method to keep oneself in check.</p>

I think he tried to do it more originally but it didnt do him a lick of good (in the video even when he says &quot;heres the kids party room&quot; the guy with the camera says suspiciously/disgusted: &quot;KIDS party room?&quot; &quot;yeah, like for birthday parties&quot; and he is still surly and suspicious of the room)

    <div class="md"><p>No, innocent until damming evidence crosses over into irrefutable and guilt is beyond a reasonable doubt.  Yes, people must defend against charges in order to prove they are innocent of murdering someone, once a prosecution decides they have enough evidence to levy charges in the first place. </p>

<p>It is true charges have been made against Alefantis in the court of &quot;public opinion&quot;, and it is also true he has no legal obligation to masses. But to the OPs point, if Alefantis was interested in clearing the air it is not unreasonable to request he provide at least a believable story to feed to the thousands of people who have been convinced otherwise. Instead he is throwing his weight around and being flippant. Sure, he has no legal obligation at this point, but if what he is interested in is clearing his name then OPs approach would be far more effective than his current one.</p>

In this particular situation, yes, him being transparent would help tremendously. Does he have to? No. And that&#39;s the beauty of America. But at this point, it&#39;s about saving his business, and unfortunately his own actions are what has pretty much started this whole investigation in the first place.

    <div class="md"><p>of course they don&#39;t.  But, he is a business owner.  The OP is simply an assertion that there was a potential course of action that would have been far more beneficial to everyone, but for some reason, the guy took a totally different one, and on this basis they look guilty.  </p>

<p>If you owned a business like that, and were put in his shoes, don&#39;t you think you&#39;d use the exposure to address the images and performances being displayed in your store?  I would have said, for instance:  </p>

<p>&quot;Myself and Comet&#39;s management were not aware of the explicit nature of several of the IG images being shared by its employees, nor the absolutely disgusting nature of many music videos and live performances produced by one of the more unfortunate musical acts who have been booked at Comet in the past.  We have committed ourselves to being more thorough and selective in the types of performers we invite to entertain our patrons, and we absolutely condemn the kinds of disturbing and perverse imagery and humor that this particular artist seems to endorse.  They in no way represent our values or the values of those for whom we fundraise (etc. etc.)&quot;  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know.  I understand how they probably have a lot more shit to deal with than denouncing that fucking creep Majestic Ape, just because she played at Comet a few times, but you get the idea.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, even those types of statements seem to just make people sound more guilty in America these days, which is sort of tragic.   </p>

<p>But instead, he could have done it in a more candid way... I mean, he&#39;s got ties to politicians, but he&#39;s no candidate or gov&#39;t official.  He could have said, &quot;I don&#39;t know what the hell those images or that band are about, they&#39;re creepy, I don&#39;t want to be associated and I never would have allowed them to be booked here had I been aware of that shit.&quot;  </p>

<p>I would at least have taken a crack at Heavy Breathing, because their shit is seriously fucked up and disgusting, they&#39;re all over the Youtube vids, and they&#39;re an easy party to throw under the bus.  Artsy, edgy, explicit music group with negligible public clout/fanbase/connection to the important folks.  Just some weirdos from DC who did some shows in the store.  </p>

<p>Someone&#39;s gotta get tossed under the bus, why not them?  </p>

<p>idk...  This whole thing is the most bizarre shit i&#39;ve ever seen.  And I know I focused on the band more than seems appropriate, but to me they were one of the most uncomfortable parts of all this, and just an unfortunate little piece of culture that I never knew existed anywhere, much less in an arena where they&#39;re booked to entertain in some our government elites&#39; favorite restaurant (which is, strangely, in a way kind of just a crummy looking dive).   The videos and images that band uses seriously make me shudder.  </p>

<p>The main issue I&#39;ve seen from genuine people that support pizzagate is that they&#39;re so emotionally invested, they want/need it to be true. It&#39;s almost a damn cult or religion at this point. Religion is fucking amazingly good at deflecting any contradictory evidence and claiming they know the big picture when they have 10 pieces out of a 100 piece puzzle. Pizzagate is the same way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck if I know.  You&#39;re asking for me to give motivation behind acts of people I know nothing about, and neither do any of you Pizzagate people.  You&#39;re making conclusions based on a 4chan post of code words, a 4chan post from an unverified source claiming to be FBI, and social media pictures.  That&#39;s hands down the worst investigation I&#39;ve ever seen.  And I bet you any sum of money that if given enough time, I could create a fantastical, complex theory with a gaggle of politicians and business owners as well.</p>

<p>I digress, though.  At the end of the day, I don&#39;t know why he did those things, and neither do you.  But if you think they&#39;re posting about child abuse so blatantly on social media, you&#39;re out of your mind.  These are some of the most successful people in DC and I&#39;m sure they have a bunch of (metaphorical hopefully) skeletons in their closets.  They didn&#39;t get where they are because they were so blatantly obvious and stupid about this stuff.  If they possess psychopathic/sociopathic tendencies like many powerful people do, they have an innate ability to blend in better than your average joe.  They are constantly thinking of how to blend in, how not to stand out, how to keep what they do on the down low.  According to Pizzagate, the Podestas are pretty much out prowling for kids themselves and taking them to a pizza place in DC and then posting about it on social media....fucking really?</p>

<p>Hotard is more of an insult than anything. Retarded ho. Ok, a little more puzzling but not indicative of anything malicious in a pedophilia sense. My friends and I would probably have called each other hotards and the some point had we known the term. Maybe she tried to say a different word and what came out was hotard? There are other explanations and until you have actual evidence of pedophilia, all you&#39;re doing is conjecture, not investigating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing will ever convince you. Leave people in this sub because you aren&#39;t contributing to anything. If you think this shit has never happened before it&#39;s too late for you. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a list of 5 government pedophiles proven to have existed throughout history.</p>

<p>UK Parliament? Dutroux Affair? Franklin Boys Town scandal? Queen Frederika? UK football pedophile ring that&#39;s happening <em>right fucking now</em>?</p>

<p>In Canadian assimilation schools run by the government for Natives back in the early to mid 1900s had death rates in the 70th percentile. There were frequent reports of sexual abuse. This isn&#39;t even refuted nowadays, people just forget apparently. The government admitted to it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system</a></p>

<p>Anderson Cooper said on live air over three thousand pentagon employees were charged with possessing pedophilia, then not a news report happened on it ever again.</p>

<p>Queen Frederika was a cruise liner that brought 1,400 kids from Greece to be illegaly adopted after the country was ruined in WW2. The Greek aristocracy sold children that had parents and families to Americans looking to adopt. A prominent American lawyer was actually arrested too, but of course not the people he worked with, like the government officials that allowed this to happen and coordinated the logistics. In several cases, it was rich families who couldn&#39;t get kids in America for various reasons. One kid who went through this process said her mother couldn&#39;t adopt in the U.S. because she had obvious mental issues. Regardless, the point is Greek was just selling babies with families to other people. 90s NYT article about it : <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/13/nyregion/tales-of-stolen-babies-and-lost-identities-a-greek-scandal-echoes-in-new-york.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/13/nyregion/tales-of-stolen-babies-and-lost-identities-a-greek-scandal-echoes-in-new-york.html</a></p>

<p>I have not mentioned her one time. However, Monica Petersen was killed investigating child trafficking in Haiti according to the org she worked for and Silsby is convicted of trafficking children in Haiti. She was also represented by a lawyer who had been accused of child trafficking in another country and she is now working for Amber alert, a service that alerts where missing kids are. If you think she didn&#39;t have help getting that job after being convicted of child trafficking you are the stupidest genuine idiot on this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I haven&#39;t been banned because I don&#39;t attack the user base like you do? I try to attack information, not people. Try it out sometime, you might find that you can learn a lot when you do that.</p>

<p>Hey <a href="/u/putin_loves_cats">/u/putin_loves_cats</a>, how long have you been here? Is <a href="/u/high_priest_of_slack">/u/high_priest_of_slack</a> still here? Those are just two accounts off the top of my head that I&#39;ve been seeing for years. Is it odd that they haven&#39;t been banned? Maybe because they don&#39;t react maliciously to their ideas being challenged like I&#39;ve seen you do. Idk, let&#39;s ask <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> or <a href="/u/9000sins">/u/9000sins</a> or <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">/u/illuminatedwax</a> or <a href="/u/Sarah_Connor">/u/Sarah_Connor</a>, hey mods, why is it I haven&#39;t been banned in the 4 years I&#39;ve been here but my homie here has been thru multiple accounts because of bans?</p>

<p>My mistake with the Silsby thing, it was a different poster I was replying to.</p>

<p>And no, you have no evidence of anyone committing a crime when it comes to pizzagate. You have conjecture. You have a bunch of loose connections based off of 4chan (A+ source), wikileaks, and social media, all tying together art, instagram, a fucking potato head, and a pizza joint. The emails are also taken heavily out of context. Notice those pictures usually just include the sender info and the email they want you to focus on, not the ones before or after. Maybe because those would give you context clues that would eliminate the holes they purposely leave open so they can cram a pedophile story in it.</p>

<p>Where is the evidence of someone committing an act? Show that to me and you&#39;ll have my 100% full-fledged support.  Otherwise, I&#39;m not jumping down a never ending rabbit hole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, and?</p>

<p>You think there weren&#39;t people saying &quot;Sunil Tripathi is not the Boston Bomber&quot; when that happened? Of course there were. But just like with pizzagate, everyone was so damn sure they were right and so invested in it because &quot;OMG we did it Internet!&quot; that they wouldn&#39;t listen to reason. How&#39;d that work out? Oh yeah the Internet was fucking wrong. Maybe it was Djokhar and Tamerlan. Maybe it was Academia/blackwater. Maybe it was DHS. Maybe it was the FBI. But it sure as shit wasn&#39;t Sunil Tripathi.</p>

<p>Just an example to show you that, yes, the hive mind can be wrong as fuck sometimes.</p>

<p>And I will continue to ask for evidence as any rational person should. There isn&#39;t one piece of evidence that implicates anyone to a specific crime. Only conjecture. I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again, when I&#39;m presented evidence that implicates someone, I&#39;ll be right there with you guys. Until then, I will keep asking for evidence and informing people that they don&#39;t have a damn thing other than a collection of wild rabbit holes.</p>

<p>And one of your sources is still 4chan.  Where did your lovely code words come from?  4chan.  Where did the unverified FBIAnon post come from?  4chan.</p>

<p>One of your sources is 4chan.  Without those code words, pizzagate falls apart.  And it started in 4chan with nothing to back it.</p>

<p>And while we&#39;re on the topic of emails, why don&#39;t people show the emails in their entirety?  Why do people love cutting out what could be important context clues?  Oh yeah, because they invalidate the theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah. It is emotionally traumatic and encompassing but the sheer amount of information that&#39;s been dumped is what is so convincing. This info can&#39;t be consumed in a single article. There&#39;s enough to create a full Web page for it.</p>

<p>That being said, I am at least convinced that the entire investigation is a psyop being orchestrated in Trump&#39;s favor and no matter how much is factual, the targeted narrative has been redirected away from the elite and towards a pizza guy intentionally by naming it after pizza at the same time that someone else was begging for it to be named pedogate to avoid exactly that... and all will be covered up and go away in time, as usual. </p>

<p>I mean, if this isn&#39;t an orchestrated conspiracy spreading disinfo in a package we can swallow, why can Flynn Jr from the transition team for tweeting out pizza? </p>

<p>Maybe he does have inside sources and used the info against them but the cover up is in full swing now. Maybe he&#39;s really just a troll, but no one person even has the time to put together the efforts that went in to making this happen in that case. This was definitely a concerted effort. Conspiracy = Always left with unanswered questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. It&#39;s definitely derailed the sub. </p>

<p>There was plenty to go after her for without any of this and now she&#39;s gonna skate while we&#39;re faced with pizzapocolypse. It is definitely being pushed as an agenda or the number of new posts about it wouldn&#39;t fill the entire sub, drowning out all other posts. </p>

<p>There was a link here about a strange site someone found a few days ago. It&#39;s the only site that comes up in Google if you search for #flynn_lives and alafentis. Ww3radar or something like that. Probably got put on a separate list just for viewing the page but point being, the post never caught traction and disappeared quickly, and I&#39;m pretty sure it belongs to Flynn Jr  with the amount of Flynn memes mixed in with smug pepe and satanic hillary memes. Oya, screenshots of conversations with alafentis. </p>

<p>At first I thought it could be counter Intel tactics but the lack of recognition it got and how quickly it was drowned have convinced me that it&#39;s probably authentic. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve all been fools, and we&#39;ll do it again.</p>

<p>And this is how I&#39;ve come to a kind of social nihilism. I can no longer believe anything. My senses can be tricked. My mind can be temporarily provoked to action. My body can be compromised. All the world is an illusion that my subconscious mind creates on my behalf through the use of disgustingly fallible senses. Same as you and everyone else.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hillary Clinton&#39;s private email biz.  It&#39;s still unresolved.  Does she go to jail?</li>
<li>Does Obama go with her (he was using it too)</li>
<li>Does Comey go with them (he perjured himself and obstructed justice)?</li>
<li>Does Lynch go also?</li>
<li>Combetta?</li>
<li>Trump&#39;s cabinet looks like it is full of draconian authoritarin jesuit reptards, will he put us into fema rape dungeons during the new inquisition?</li>
<li>China, Russia, N. Korea</li>
<li>War in Yemen</li>

<p>the very first thing I do is post the mass grave I&#39;m digging for their mutilated bodies on Instagram</p>

<p>No one&#39;s saying it&#39;s used for a mass grave, we don&#39;t know what it&#39;s for, we&#39;d like to find out. The only people assuming are the trolls trying to discredit the convo, like you are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I leave a trail of cryptic breadcrumbs about my brutal child rape/murder habits on Instagram for... some reason. </p>

<p>They communicate on social networking just like every other human in the developed world does, woah, so crazy. Are you genuinely stupid? You&#39;re just stunned at the possibility of people communicating <em>through the internet</em>? Woahhh man never happens! Pedophiles must use pigeons and ancient hebrew to communicate and socialize, not instagram like me!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WTF</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cute theory that there is actual fucking evidence of massive financial crimes (Pay 2 play anyone?) that actually currently exist and WERE talked about until pizzagate?  It&#39;s cute that Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin should currently be behind bars?  It&#39;s cute that Saudi Arabia was all over the Clinton Foundation, showing to be donating a fuck ton of money?</p>

<p>Ok guy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re saying a special prosecutor should investigate someone despite there being <em>literally zero</em> physical evidence that they did anything wrong, and no circumstantial evidence that <em>proves</em>, or even indicates under scrutiny, that they committed a crime?</p>

<p>A special prosecutor should be appointed, because an internet conspiracy based purely on conjecture got too popular?</p>

<p>And I thought this sub would be against a police state.</p>

<p>If the burden of evidence to get someone investigated for raping, murdering, and eating children in satanic rituals is an Internet rumor then we live in a truly sad state of affairs.</p>

<p>Also, you <em>completely</em> dodged every question in my last comment. So I&#39;ll ask again. Please don&#39;t dodge it this time.</p>

<p>Could the fact that tens of millions of people in this country had something to gain politically from this story being true have anything to do with the fact that <em>that same group of people</em> are the ones who mainly believe it to be true, and are the ones who share and promote it?</p>
