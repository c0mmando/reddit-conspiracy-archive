       That's why I keep saying we just need to focus on red pilling people personally. Make it your duty to try to red pill 1 or 2 people a week and we will be good.

       Red pilling has to work on some people because we were all living in the Matrix at one point. Then one day found that things were not what they seemed.

       You're right. For me, it was a lot of things, but in part it was Alex Jones which triggered something in me. I know now that he is controlled opposition, a gate keeper, but then again his work infiltrating the alt media had to be done with some truth backing him up and that's what woke me up. From there on it was all the way down the rabbit hole and let me tell you...Kansas is not here anymore.

       Then please enlighten us as to what the code words in the Podesta e-mails could mean? I don't mean exact definitions but rather what would be the purpose to use a bunch of code words that happen to be the same exact ones used by pedophiles.

       There is literally no non-incriminating explanation. You can't explain away all the evidence by saying, well they just like pizza and hot dogs a lot and they like weird art. At the
       <em>
        very least
       </em>
       they are sick freaks who shouldn't be running the country and that's not even taking into account all the pedo evidence like the Podesta brothers looking exactly like the police sketch of Madeleine McCann's kidnappers. Let alone the money laundering associated with Comet Ping Pong.

       RIGHT?! Seriously, fuck thinking for oneself, that shit is overrated. These dumb conspritards need to put down the kool-aid and start watching that cable "REAL NEWS". I love paying out the ass for cable so that Nancy Grace lady can scream in my face what I should think! Then those awesome prescription drug commercials come on and tell me all those pills I need to be taking! Stupid conspiracy theorists and their fake news.

       Whats dangerous is the mental disorder thats behind it,  this sensationalist surrealisim based in free association and rampant cognitive hoop jumping that drives people into an irrational and irratated state of belligerance. Its not sane and its not thinking, its a maze of fantasy that builds up in a mind like psychosis and turns decent people into foaming mouthed anger machines who wouldnt know reason and rationality if it came up and beat them over the head with a cheese pizza, and i mean cheese pizza, not little girl or whatever the fuck bullshit mental jumprope code it takes to buy into such a vicious and quixotic fucktard fest like this asshole of humanity thats hecome a full fledged epidemic of stupidity. Why dont you go there, in reality, without a gun, and see it, in reality, for yourself, instead of watching some fucked brain game connect the dots on YouTube and threatening people you actually know nothing about and have never met.

       Ive read all the crap, a grown up doesnt read a bunch of thin conjecture and wild logic loops and start accusing people of fucking children. I'm not trying to protect the pizza joint I'm disgusted by what the right wing has become, I have seen it degrade slowly over the past decade into a tabloid nightmare with no checks or balances and no regard for anything but misinformation and antagonism.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are millions of people who would love nothing more than to nail the living shit out of the clintons, many of them are lawyers and policemen and members of the FBI and all sorts of other professions who are in more than adequate places to prosecute such a claim and bring it to light, the fact that this has not happened and that there are no investigations into it, and no evidence outside of what is essentially a tabloid cult Circle, would lead a rational adult to believe that this is probably yet another in a long string of vicious propaganda ploys by irresponsible political forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have two choices here actually:
      </p>
      <p>
       Either the clintons are comic book type super villains who have complete control over the entire Justice System every Police Department the FBI and the CIA
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       This is more vicious bullshit perpetuated by individuals who seem to have gradually lost the ability to disagree with someone without calling them a pedophile,communist or Moocher.

       The world is being overtaken by a disease and this is just a small symptom of that disease, I fear the worst is yet to come. But if history shows us anything it's that the world is gripped by Insanity from time to time and eventually it is overcome.
Usually after good people are driven to do horrible things by this very kind of antagonism and propaganda.

       I reckon this might look and feel like a right-wing propaganda, but , are you telling me that mainstream media are fighting a good fight? That media bias in favor of Clinton is unseen before , I believe.  Banning the sites and free speech ? Are we there yet ? Defending liberalism with more control of what people talk about ? That thing you talk about, my friend , is a bubble , in which only a small percentage live , in USA and western europe. Most of others are enslaved by the banks, by global corporations, by local bullys who works undercover for west, and by trivial life and themes portraited on mainstream media. I was a liberal and defended a liberal point of view in my developing country for years , while all the time in the name of 'freedoms' I'm seeing it fall and failing. And about a month a go I said to myself 'fuck that, everything seems wrong'.  That , and that cunt Hillary pulling for a WW3 with Russia. Oh, how the rich rubbed their hands to that song. Meanwhile , fuck all of us. Well, fuck that sick pizza shop owner if his feelings are hurt, meanwhile he likes the pictures of baby doll with a price, guys covered in blood , and satanic rituals and that creepy bitch artist IDK her/his name. At the same time organizing parties for kids. Fuck him back to hell , he has no moral compass and minimum human decency at all. And don't tell me he is plain poor , he's got connections with all them deciders and rulers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And about Clintons ... Of course they've got the power to slow down investigation , they are influental as fuck. They, the people who give them money, and the ones who recieve money from them, are all influental as fuck. Don't be naive. If the world is like you said, that guilty people gets punished , we would be living in a beautiful world. Are we?

       You're talking about hundreds of thousands of media Outlets, remember that.

      <p>
       The president-elect has said that he is going to "loosen up libel laws" so he can sue anyone who speaks out against him, a case by the way, which has not been brought up in American courts since 1798.  And the people who have complete control again of Congress are proposing a label of economic terrorist be put on protesters so they can be charged with a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not a conspiracy theory, that's actually what's happening, but excuse me if I don't fall into a pedophilia story about a pizza place menu with suggestive leading and some weird email code that sounds like some guy on acid made it up. 
Sure does look smell and feel exactly like every right-wing conspiracy in the last decade. Completely ignoring the reality and Logistics of a situation and just going for the comically evil and quixotic narrative.

       Well, instead of that, why don't liberals ban whatever is not in tune with their ear, whatever it is, and why don't we wage another hopeless war, send those right wing americans because they have no money working one honest job, destroying countries and radicalize people around a world, while we sing tunes to 'liberal' drumbeat.
