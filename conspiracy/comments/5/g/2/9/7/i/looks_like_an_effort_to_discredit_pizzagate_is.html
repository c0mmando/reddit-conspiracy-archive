       The very fact that the MSM has had to mention it, negatively or not, is a victory. We made them say "Pizzagate" :up

       Trust in the mainstream media is at an all time low. Talking about this stuff will just make people ask around or investigate and decide for themselves. Some folks will eat up the propaganda without a second thought, but most won't.

       That's fine.

       When people make an effort to discredit one another using evidence and if they manage to keep focused on the evidence, then the truth wins.

       All the article did was paint the whole thing in rose tinted glasses at every turn.   - Telling you exactly how you should think and feel about the whole thing and not a mention of any of the circumstantial evidence.  The article was a dismissive slam piece that just threw buzz words around; bought and paid for by those who don't want this public.

       To me this is them recognizing that this is really happening.  When else do they bombared us with news on conspiracies? Keep digging all. The world around you is not as it seems. Trust yourselves, be skeptical of anyone trying to tell you how to think.  We know something is amiss

       And all the evidence complied and pieced together was often baseless speculation where they simply added on those toppings.

       The source of the Leak Emails never ordered pizza. So this was somebody else placing in that context, the work of publicity trolls inciting.

       So tell me why it was branded fake news, and I am sure you already have your answer.

       What are you talking about pizzabait discredited itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The work of trolls feeding into an agenda of discredit the other side to make the transition of power easier, smoke and mirrors that has cost those trolls when new legislation has just given unprecedented access to hack the fuck out of them and suppress even more information. It is still playing currently until it dies out upon being branded as fake news, because it was false. Expect that happening as we speak, there will always be a few die hards for longer. But the Joke is up.
      </p>
      <p>
       How obvious did you want the synonym of cheese from the word pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will always be some nuts rattling a few heads because those screws are always loose. What has happened, baseless speculation, some circumstance, but totally reworded and misused context, in calling the current president his party and many others as pedo baby eating satanic pizza monsters. What planet do you live on.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are evil people and some are undoubtedly quite high in society, this has been investigated, sentenced, and debunked, but this pizzabait was going beyond extreme into the realms of utter fiction and make belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       I blame that culture, bombarding them with tv diner's fiction, often amounting to corn, always something religious with some redneck killing zombie demons in the name of god because of an apocalypse of some other syfi, and that media abused for its agendas those panels of smurfs. This  really doesn't help the paranoid when they are bombarded with other little pony's subverting them it spending off that advertising, so it tends to provoke those role models.

       So you didn't actually answer my question. Stop changing the subject and answer my very simple question
      </p>
      <h1>
       WHY HASN'T THE BBC, NYT, WAPO, OR SNOPES SHOWN THE SUSPICIOUS INSTAGRAM PHOTOS OR EMAILS IN ANY OF THEIR ARTICLES?
      </h1>
      <p>
       Get the fuck outta here if you're not going to engage in discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       pretty easy to say shit is baseless when you are hiding the basis of the accusations. Maybe because they are scared that if people see the evidence and make up their own mind, they will decide its not fake....
      </p>
      <p>
       But its fine, these pizzagate deniers are getting desperate, and I for one am loving it. And it's obvious that people coming here, talking the way you are aren't regulars on this board. The regulars on this board are usually talking about flat earth and lizard people being within the realm of possibility. So why the fuck are you even here if you're so closed minded that you won't entertain the prospect of a pedophile ring in government?
      </p>
      <p>
       BBC has a fucking track record of covering for pedophiles

       Now you are swearing at me. I could get you banned when you are clearly gone, don't let that happen. But let's try to be grown up. So I will let that pass this once.

       That instagram can be manipulated like everything else placed into whatever toppings trolls have put onto their pizzas. Did you even consider what pizza means, it is a slice of anything else containing a main ingredient of cheese. However they hacked illegally gaining that access using it to place whatever context they later inserted and because an active investigation hasn't charged or convicted. It was erroneous and considered fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jimmy Saville is in Jail, and those pedo rings are being investigated and convicted some had power because politicians are people and they aren't immune to injustice. A lot of shit went down in the 70s-80s the genre from those days was almost depraved, and some of that has continued and is being actively prosecuted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that turn some of the leaders of your country into a club of child molesting baby eating monsters? Obviously if you don't like them you would invent every kind of conspiracy.

       Reported you are actively threatening and harassing me and that will not be tolerated, go preach to the fish.

      <p>
       I will entertain the last word
      </p>
      <p>
       What did Podesta write, an email that you have inserted your own context. Did Assange even comment on this, and piece that pizza together, no that was your own agenda. What does spirit cooking actually mean, because it probably means a fundraiser, and it means that when you are a politician that you are going to be gathering support at a private function.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did he have some weird art pictures, probably because he is into fetishism, and that could mean that he is gay or masochistic, and he perceives himself as the victim of power.  And perhaps that makes him guilty of your own association. Until he is convicted and proven of any guilt, you are committing crimes that make you guilty, which is exactly why powers have been enacted to trace you, and halt fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis instagram could literally mean anything, has it been tried or convicted of guilt, other than the context of the association that you have placed into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jimmy Saville is dead and many of his associates were convicted, sadly not soon enough. What has that proved here in this pizza attempt?

       The mods will be on you, it's not my place but I have defended myself, you swore at me repeatedly, also calling me hostile names, even from the start of your attempts at conversation if it could be called that, when it was hate speech, and I was threatened and harassed, seen by you down voting every comment I made. This isn't conversation, it is somebody juvenile who doesn't want to entertain speech, or just another angry redneck. I took one, and tried suggesting to be reasonable, however you ignored and have continued to become even more unreasonable.

       Immediately after Savile's death, Meirion Jones and Liz Mackean from the BBC programme Newsnight began to investigate reports that he had sexually abused children. They interviewed one alleged victim on camera and talked to a number of others who were willing to be quoted about alleged abuse at Duncroft Approved School near London, the BBC, and Stoke Mandeville hospital. The headmistress of Duncroft was Meirion Jones's own aunt, Margaret Jones.[27] The Newsnight team, which included former police detective Mark Williams-Thomas, also found out about the Surrey police investigation into Savile. The report was scheduled for broadcast on 7 December 2011, but a decision was taken to cancel its transmission, which ultimately developed into a major crisis for the BBC when the ITV documentary was screened in October 2012. The subsequent Pollard Review found that
       <strong>
        Jones and MacKean assembled cogent evidence that Savile had a history of abusing young women and Newsnight was in a position to break the story in 2011.[28] No mention of the dropped Newsnight report was made in public at the time.

       It's mind boggling to have to wonder where is the concern for the children who if any of it is remotely possible are being ignored. Child protective services have to take every report of abuse serious and would remove a child from their parents first and ask questions later.
