        first post from /r/The_Donald that appears on /r/all
       </a>
       is on the 5th page (I browse with 25 links per page, so that means it's over 100 submissions in) with 5300 upvotes in 8 hours. I've gone through over 300 more submissions and can't find ANY other thread from there.

       looks like, as you can see there are multiple posts with over 3000 upvotes that AREN'T appearing on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all

       I noticed it as well...but, what do you expect from a site ran by an overly emotional child like Huffman? His feelings got hurt for being outed as a homosexual, so he got married(put on a beard). Pizzagate exposes his/his masters sexual proclivities,  bans subs. His infantile behavior is called out by
       <a href="/r/donald">
        /r/donald
       </a>
       and he removes them from
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       ...he's obviously too much of a pussy to just ban them all together.
      </p>
      <p>
       These idiotic measures almost scream that he's already securing a new job,

       I'm not saying it's right that spez was outed as a homosexual, I merely noted it. If you don't like the timeline of reality, avert your gaze. Internet privacy is up to the individual. Privacy pants? I'm not incontinent, so it's not something I've never considered. If the CEO's pants get in a bunch because people find his sexual proclivities suspect, I don't really care one way or another. The CEO shouldn't be playing around with code like a mildly retarded pizza child. Try to keep your 'pants talk' in the bedroom,

       I'm surprised Reddit didn't force this bitch to resign. I guess I overestimated the intelligence of your average Redditor. Sadly most still read r/politics. I really think people this dull deserve to be duped. For Christ's sake its staring you right in the fucking face

       What I don't understand is how reddit is okay with marginalizing it's users. As if one opinion could be worth more, if people are using reddit to promote Donald Trump that is their business.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand how this got muddied. There are upvotes and downvotes for a reason. Banning The Donald is like admitting reddit doesn't function as intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority rules, get over it. If the majority of people who use reddit are visiting The Donald, that should have nothing to do with administration. They are using the site exactly as it was intended.

       Good, fuck r/the_Donald. u/Medically and team spew all this shit about being censored, then go around quietly banning people for "concern trolling" who say things they don't like. Pure hypocrisy. Especially considering that whole sub has devolved into "OMG Reddit censored us!!11!!"

       I got banned from donald early on and thought the same,  but i stayed subscribed.  Over time i realized the onslaught of ctr, especially when the wikileaks investigation was going on.  Ive never seen anything like it.. massive downvotes instantly to anything posted, every thread being bombarded with disinfo and distractions... i realized why they were so trigger happy on bans.  Sure it makes for a louder echo chamber, but its not like they aren't straight forward about its purpose
