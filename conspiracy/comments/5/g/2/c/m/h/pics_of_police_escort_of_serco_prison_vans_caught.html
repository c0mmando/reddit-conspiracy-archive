       I've been really worried about Julian's whereabouts, so I looked up London transport surveillance cameras and found pictures of a police escort and serco prison vans half a block from Ecuador embassy. They are timestamped the night of Oct 17 2016, same day Julian's internet was cut and dead man switch was activated. The roads look like a ghost town so maybe they put up road blocks so there would be no witnesses?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the anon YouTube video:

       I pulled up pictures of Julian's transport in 2010 and it's identical to the police escort found on the surveillance camera on Oct 17, 2016. 1 police van and 2 serco prison vans. (SERCO is his detention company, they are also are the worlds largest transport company)
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a video explaining Serco detention and transport:

       The WH has been trying to label Julian as a terroristic threat to US National Security for a long time. Even Hillary had spoke about droning him in one of her Wikileak emails.  John Kerry visited Columbia, next door to Ecuador, on September 26. Then UK and Ecuador embassy on Oct 16-17 to put pressure on them to stop Julian from publishing anymore leaks and cut his internet. Deadman switch went off and the names that were listed in the hashes were John Kerry, UK, and Ecuador. This is Julian telling us Ecuador and U.K.  caved into John Kerry to take him. The same night a covey of SERCO prison vans are  being escorted by police leaving the embassy.

       After john Kerry left U.K. On the oct 17. Two weeks later he goes to naval base in Antarctica.  Did he take Julian there to torture him?

       Here is a timeline of events. If you add in the pictures found from surveillance camera, it matches perfectly in the timeline. The armed guards were outside the embassy oct 18, the morning after they took Julian. That day they confiscated WL employees phones and computers. On Oct 17 FBI Anon warned us on 4chans that this was going to happen. No one listened or media blacked it out and covered it up :(

       The media has been telling the public Julian is inside the embassy for his safety. For 47 days he has not even peaked out the curtains at the window. It's bc he's not there. Only embassy Cat is there. If Julian willingly left the embassy to escape, he would take the cat with him. He did not do that. 
The cat tweeted about Cuba so I was thinking maybe one of his employees has access to that twitter account giving us a hint CIA is taking him to GITMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the proof of life's that have been given to the pubic have been fake. The interview with John Pilger was edited. His lawyer said she saw him face to face but gave us no proof that happened. Julian did a live audio interview last week but that doesn't prove where he's at? He could be in a CIA torture chamber. His friend Craig Murray said he had lunch with him but again, no proof... just a statement.

       He wants to kill Snowden? 😳 I didn't know that...
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep wondering this...
      </p>
      <p>
       Sept 26 John Kerry went to Columbia (near Ecuador)
Prob made a deal to take Julian from the embassy
      </p>
      <p>
       Oct 16-17Kerry went to U.K. And Ecuador embassy to shut Julian's internet down. This is when Julian went missing
      </p>
      <p>
       Nov 12- Kerry goes to Antarctica which we have 2 naval bases at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did he take Julian there to torture him and worst case... killing him? 
If they let him go then they made a deal with him. But in order to do that they have to scare the living SHIT out of him so he doesn't rebel when they release him. That means TOUGH torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been losing sleep over this. Bc a lot of people have forgot about him. After we won the election they tend to go on with their lives and forget the man that saved our democracy, exposed PIZZAGATE is missing for the last 48 days.

       He wanted to kill Snowden, like a lot of Americans when the news first broke and Snowden was being treated as a spy/traitor by the MSM. I guarantee Trump has softened on Snowden considerably, especially after Julian and WikiLeaks during the election

       Yeah I bet he does bc the MSM painted Trump like a Nazi pussy groper. So I'm sure he feels like MSM could of done that to him too. Do you think Julian is still alive? I just can't see them killing him bc how are they gonna answer the world where he is? It does seem the MSM is having a black out of Julian hoping people will forget. I think Trump will pardon him... that's if he's not a puppet.

       Assange hasn't been charged with anything by the US... so no reason to need to pardon him... Snowden took what he had directly to China and then Russia... Thats not the right way to whistleblow.

       He has a valid point. Snowden tried to sell his secrets twice... then blew the whistle. Compare to Manning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Makes me suspicious of Snowden's true motives... seeing that treason was not a problem for him (offering secrets for $) Anyone remember Robert Hansen... Do you feel he is a patriot or a hero... or a traitor?

       Shit, I'm sure Snowden was offering secrets to trade in exchange for his life.  Have you realized how close Snowdens life could have came? Russia and china are the only nation states large enough not to have direct influence from America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had Snowden ended up in England or anywhere else, he would have been extradited

       He was and it would be understandable to negotiate something beyond protection, for such information. I mean, it's not like his job prospects with the US will be pristine after such an event. So I do understand why he did what he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if he had blown the whistle, without receiving protection... I'm not sure Russia or China would try to protect him after that fact (Or I'm remembering wrong and that's exactly what happened.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't change the fact that his self-preservation was more important than getting the information released (That is all I can determine based on the evidence available.) and again, that was probably the correct choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't invalidate NinjaKick's claims, which was my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to imagine some more perfect scenario that Snowden could have taken... but honestly, as you have pointed out, he'd probably be dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while I'm still suspicious of his initial motives, I still support what he ended up doing.

       I'm just basing my opinions of Snowden's situation from what an ex-CIA asset turned whistle-blower said about him. She said that a pardon was extremely unlikely... cause what he did was so close to espionage/treason. She definitely put him in a separate  category from Assange and Manning from a CIA standpoint.

       So again; just a hypothetical question, what country would you run to having stolen NSA secrets from America, and fearing for your life?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, she goes on to defend assange, and I'm sure she feels the same about manning.  But look where they are now, Snowden is still alive and free as far as we can tell.  I think we can call him selfish for selling out to americas enemies (it's not like any nation state is without corruption) but he obviously did it to survive. I don't think it could be argued he chose them because they are enemies of the state, but simply because America wouldn't be able to just walk right in to the country and snatch him which is back to the initial question, where would you run to?
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, he got the info out and he is alive. That's doing a lot better then assange is right now.

       To the left is when Julian went into custody in 2010 2 white fans and a police van escort. Which looks like the same thing caught on camera on oct 17

       That van you've linked to is a transport police van who handle stuff on railways and busses etc, looks like a cctv monitoring van or something, not what they would send on an early morning operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The van in the top right of your op doesn't look like a police van either, the lights on the roof are at the back rather than the front and there seems to be some writing on the left rear door panel. Looks more likely to be a motorway maintenance, gas company or as the other guy mentioned a water company van. All these vans have the same markings on the back.

       <strong>
        why? I don't know
       </strong>
       I lived there, worked in a water van for years, been in a serco van multiple times (The top van is not standard serco, they traditionally don't have hi vis patterns) and you are not accepting or making a case against my post. OR you just linked your sisters rabbit hole? Ctrl v whatever is relevant. I don't know what your replying tbh

       Can you tell me someone that intelligent didn't have an escape plan? People keep questioning and they are asking to please stop brining attention to it. Now he will need to find new diplomatic immunity before he can disclose anything however the plan was flawed obviously. Just a theory. Think about it they helped Snowden and he's living the life so why would Julian not plan an escape. Now if he's in Russia he also would not want to say due to the whole Russian propaganda crap and another way to discredit WL. Again just a theory.

       I appreciate your response. I've been going back and forth on this one. Did you read the reddit post I wrote above this comment? 
It just makes me wonder why he left the cat behind? And didn't he say to always worry about him if something wasn't right. 
I just feel like I'm gonna fight for him and demand answers bc what if he is taken and we are all quiet. Too many people are already quiet bc the election is over, trump won, our democracy is saved, people are moving on with their lives and forgot about him. The ones that are still activate are investigating PIZZAGATE bc it's so massive and bizarre.

       Yes I did read the other post. It was good research and I do understand completely. It's kind of like the saying goes your damned if you do and damned if you don't in this situation. Cause what if we are the ones messing it up by asking? We could be putting him in danger but on the other hand it's good to investigate to be sure he's safe. I say keep researching and digging though 100% just be careful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just have a gut feeling cause he was smart enough to know the leaks needed to be slow and steady so they couldn't cover it up quick which was brilliant AF! I just think there are to many that would come out if he wasn't safe and with so many associates saying stop and he's ok I feel like it's a hint. I think again they didn't expect so much attention to screw it all up. Again though just theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did do some searching myself on associates to make sure the 4chan post and gag order idea wasn't true and have found them to be posting on social media and acting to normal for this.

       The Great Wizard Of Leaks
      </p>
      <h2>
       A Blockchain Fantasy-Action-Adventure Epic
      </h2>
      <p>
       (This is purely a work of fiction. Any resemblance to real persons or events are purely coincidental.)
      </p>
      <h2>
       Background
      </h2>
      <p>
       "If the password is ever released ("Whatever happens, even if there's video; it was murder"), the files are encrypted via OpenSSL file encryption. "
      </p>
      <p>
       The Great Wizard of Leaks had been exposing the corruption of the Kings and Rulers for a long time. But one day after exposing their treasonous actions in foreign lands, they decided that he had gone too far. As a result, The Great Wizard was forced to take refuge in a castle that the Kings and Rulers did not control. The Great Wizard resided here for five years and continued to cast spells that upset the people's tyrannic rulers.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, on October 15th in the Current Year, the Rulers had had enough and decided to unplug the source of the Great Wizard's power (the Internet), thereby preventing him from interfering with their rigged election which favored the Great Witch of the West (aka: The Cunt). Despite this, The Cunt still lost to the Almighty Knight Sir Trumpador Maximus Decimus Meridius III, who claimed he had plans to bring peace to the Lands and "drain the swamp" that gave The Cunt and her cronies their power. Although sensible people were not all trusting of Trumpador, most of them realized that he still represented their best hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things started looking better in the West, but there were still some problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well known and generally despised Gargoyle $oros was trying to sow seeds of division amongst the people in order to regain control. He had managed to split the people of the land broadly into two opposing groups, The Left and The Right, exploiting their fears by exaggerating everything unkosher that Knight Sir Trumpador Maximus Decimus Meridius III had said. The Gargoyle even went so far as to fund civil rebellions, using the same techniques of subversion that were used in other lands to the East to overthrow Governments that the Gargoyle did not like. "Divide and conquer!" he had told The Cunt and her cronies. "It is far easier to conquer a land if the citizens are divided and cannot put up a unified resistance!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, The Great Wizard may have had his own woes. Since his source of mana (Internet) was cut, the people had not heard from him and his group of apprentice wizards (belonging to a noble order known as WizardLeaks). They had become seemingly incommunicado. Rumor has it that their order was infiltrated by treasonous goons working on behalf of The Cunt and the Gargoyle and it was entirely possible that the Great Wizard himself had been captured.
      </p>
      <p>
       The King and his Alphabet Stooges may have been clever here though. Instead of letting the people know that the Great Wizard had been illegally abducted, they may have chopped previously unreleased interview footage to make it appear as though the Great Wizard was still alive and well. This is not confirmed, but the people have good reason to speculate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Great Wizard always knew that his capture was a possibility and thus dispersed gold to the people which could only be unlocked with a key that would automatically release if his Wizardly Magic was to cease.
      </p>
      <p>
       On October 22nd in the Current Year, this may have occurred. The well-established MagiRealm known as Readit and the sensitive town of Twithurt were attacked and brought down while the keys were allegedly getting dispersed. Most mentions of the alleged keys on Readit and Twithurt were also removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some citizens that frequented the horrible lair known as Forchan, believed to be the dwelling place of the notorious hacker known as Forchan, also reported that The King's Alphabet Stooges were even removing the alleged keys from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       They started wondering where else The Great Wizard may have hidden the keys to this gold. A place where the Alphabet Stooges would have a hard time removing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       After much thought, some citizens agreed that the most likely place was in a thing called the "Blockchain" that resided in the MagiRealm. This would be hard to for the Evil Alphabet Wizard's to censor as it is mostly controlled and determined by the people themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is: Are you a bad enough dude to help rescue The Great Wizard?

       I am hoping he had help escaping and has people who are pushing that he is still in the embassy safe. If it were me I would leave the cat behind to help with that narrative. Ecuador was probably filled in on what he has and would probably help him as long as they can pull it off without endangering themselves.

       I'm hoping too Julian must have known the danger he was in with what he thought was going to be a Clinton Presidency and with the new elections in Ecuador coming up. I'm hoping he left before that day and he might have left as early as late Aug.

       Yeah that has been suggested or maybe just a general somethings up message. Or there was a specific message that we don't know what it was about. Or even maybe he wasn't there and they were trying to make it look like he was and she was helping with that. Or...So many possibilities. I can't think she just went there to feed him vegan food lol but of course it is possible.

       I've heard this. He works for the CIA and helps push their agendas. But, his deal fell thru which is why he started releasing PIZZAGATE 
I go back and forth on this one. 
But at the end he's being tortured either way. He def went off script with PIZZAGATE and exposing Hillary murders

       He has a valid point. Snowden tried to sell his secrets twice... then blew the whistle. Compare to Manning.
