       I have read the theories surrounding Comet Ping Pong.  While I do not feel that the rumors are true, I understand that there are people who feel strongly about their opinions and can not be dissuaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       For anyone who is considering visiting the location, I would highly discourage you from doing so.  If you believe that your information is genuine, please share it with the FBI or the Metropolitan Police Department.  I know that some of you have no faith in either institution and may choose to take action anyway.  If you do, please do not be armed.  Even if your theory is true, the majority of the patrons and employees are innocent people.  Taking justice into your own hands could result in innocent people being seriously hurt or even killed.  They may be nameless and faceless to you, but they are my friends and neighbors and I do not any harm to come to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that my plea may fall on deaf ears but I hope that, as a fellow human being, you might be willing to show a little understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you to all those who listen.

       I have no intention of ever going there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aren't the themes of the restaurant strange to you?  They seem to not match.  For example, it bills itself as a family friendly pizza place that has ping pong tables.  This is a fun-for-children theme to me.  However, they have artwork depicting adult nudity, which is a theme that does not match the fun-for-children theme.  Then they have artwork depicting human sacrifice, which also does not match the fun-for-children theme.  Actually, none of these three themes go together.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does not mean that there is anything illegal.  It is not illegal to have poor taste.  It is just bizarre to me.
      </p>

       What am I missing?  Is this the community standard for the DC area?

       It's "progressive."
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason, normalizing pedophilia and satanic themes, in some places, is considered progressive or trend-setting. Chic. 'Cause you have to have balls to push the norm, or something. Doesn't work out so well when you stir up all this shit with it though.

       That's like saying you could be a progressive vegan by putting up pictures of a steak on your living room wall.

      <p>
       The only reason you put up artwork is you or your spouse like it. When is the last time you saw a picture in someone's house and they said, yeah I don't really like that picture, but I'm keeping it up to broaden my horizons.

       Thank you for the answer.  This is what I am wondering.  It might just be a local custom that outsiders find bizarre.

       "Doesn't work out so well when you stir up all this shit with it though."  Ummm... Yeah!!!  It is easy to be misunderstood on such topics.  LOL.

       It just occurs to me that they could have easily painted cartoon characters, lollipops, unicorns, and rainbows instead of nude adults and people wearing antlers and holding severed heads.

       Yes, but I have not seen anything like that at a "family friendly" place.  I guess that is where I get stuck...

      <p>
       If they had the adult sex theme and human sacrifice theme together at an adult only club, then that is one thing.  It is still bizarre to me, but whatever floats your boat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not mention a fourth theme, which involves the male and female figures wearing antlers and each holding severed heads.  My guess is it represents something in the Occult, but I am guessing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just what I want to look at while munching on pizza and watching people play ping pong.  Call me old fashioned for not be turned on by it...  I prefer my women antlerless and with their heads attached.  This is why I do not live in DC. LOL.

       I assume it is not made for people like you. I'd feel right at home there. Have you watched Fantasia? Read Grimm's fairy tales? Strange otherworldly illustrations and themes are very common in children's books and media.

       I assume you are right.  I believe I saw Fantasia a long time ago, but I will rewatch it.  I love Grimm's fairy tales, so I see what you mean.  They can be very violent and gory.  I do not recall if they are sexual, though.  I will have to check to refresh my memory.

      <p>
       Yes, I have been to the Denver airport many times, but I do not recall seeing the artwork people talk about.  I was in a hurry traveling, but I will look again.  Maybe I am just dated for what is considered edgy in artwork.

       Right!  But, that is not the issue.  The issue is mixing children themes with adult themes.  Right?

       The Denver airport is crazy, and yeah the artwork there is also completely inappropriate for the location.

       Sure is, some people have bad taste when judged by other people. The spirit cooking shit is ridiculous, but it is also ridiculously popular. Lady Gaga. People love being a part of something strange and new to them. Art is supposed to push boundaries. Whether it crosses into evil or porno or whatever is in the eyes of the each beholder.

       I've never bought artwork to push my boundaries, I buy it because I like the way it looks, it reminds me of something that makes me happy, or because it matches the rest of the furniture in the room.

       that is the beauty of art, there is something to fit everyone's tastes. My comment about pushing boundaries is more for the artist. Art can be a way to express things that are socially unacceptable otherwise.

       In the dozen or so times that I have been there, I don't remember anything anything about the art so it couldn't have been that strange from my perspective.  I looked at some of the art in question and I don't see the controversy.  Symbolism is a difficult concept for children and, honestly, without context, I'm not certain that I would have come to the same conclusion about the content of the work.  As for the nudity, it was of adults in their underwear which is no worse than one would see at the mall or on advertisements.  I'm not a parent but if I were I would prefer my children to see the painting rather than advertisements.  At least the paintings were somewhat closer to what average people look like. At least he or she might develop a healthy body image that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know for certain how the average DC resident thinks, but I would like to believe that my perspective is similar to most.  I also don't think that DC is too different than the average major city.  It is probably typical if not a little more conservative compared to other places of similar size.  I hope that I have provided some perspective.  The United States is a big place and we haven't been doing the best job communicating with one another lately.

       It is a risque but it won't bother me.  Young kids probably won't understand it.  Older kids have access to internet which has far more graphic material.  I only saw a handful of pieces that contained paintings of people in their underwear and one of figures surround another figure which looked like it was bleeding.  Are there others that are being questioned?  Would you be able to link them?

       I don't spend much time around kids so that might be part of the reason why I won't realize they might react in the way you describe.  Like I said, my perspective is probably typical, most people who can afford to eat out in DC probably don't have kids.  The kids that I have seen in D.C. don't behave like my brother and I did when we were young.  Most are glued to a screen and probably for good reason.  People keep describing Comet Ping Pong as kid friendly but it is only kid friendly relative to the other restaurants in that neighborhood.  If a kid ran around and screamed like my brother and I when we young, they would probably be asked to leave.  From that perspective, it may be better described as kid tolerant.  It is also one of the few kid tolerant places in the neighborhood.  I would also mention that most of the schools in DC are crap and that the restaurant is one of the two good ones.

       I don't know anything about sexually theme art.  I never noticed any when I was there.  If they have any, it is likely rotated in with other art probably more tame art.

      <p>
       Yes, you are correct.  Most of the people who play Ping Pong are adults.  It is one of the few places in the city where you can play.  Real Estate is expensive so few people have the space for them in their homes.

       I wonder if the guy who actually did that was an investigator or an actor. Personally I find your comment condescending and remind you that if a business is open to the public than the public may go there. I would personally not waste the staff's time and resources unless I were a paying customer but I would not presume that anyone is necessarily disqualified from being in a public place because of what they believe. As for being armed that is not against the law either according to the second ammendment. Anyone who carries a gun also carries the responsibility of their actions and the safety of their weapon.

       Carrying a gun in D.C. Is a bad idea without a concealed carry permit. There used to be a ban until 2008. There is no open carry allowed and having a gun on you will likely result in a bad outcome.

Since you are familiar with that area, and the people, perhaps you can add some insight regarding the local customs.  Maybe us outsiders just do not understand what the locals consider normal.

       Can you think of any reason why he would be on the GQ list of the top 50 powerful people in Washington?

       Is the pizza so magically good that it can make the powerful politicians that may frequent there put their differences aside and share a pie?

      <p>
       Before pizzagate, was it famous in DC or something like Giordanos in Chicago?

       The GQ top 50 list isn't what you think.  At least from what I understand, it has come out biannually since 2007, so there a lot of people on the list.  When people see the title top 50 powerful people in Washington, they assume that everyone on the list is important nationally.  Some are just important locally especially those towards the bottom.  Alex Ovechkin, who plays hockey for the Capitals, and Jose Andres, who is probably DC's most success restauranteur, were both on the listed at least once.  I don't think that either are important to the rest of the nation.

       Honestly, that is the most baffling part of this theory, Comet Ping Pong is not even that well known.  Unless you live in the neighborhood, you probably never go to Comet Ping Pong.  The only reason why I have been is because I dated a girl who like in Tenleytown.  Pizza Paradise, 2 Amy's, or We the Pizza compete for the top pizza in the city, not Comet.  While Comet would probably make a top five list, it is nothing special.  It is known but not known well enough to be considered a DC institution.

       I've never met the owner but, from what I have read, he is a friend of a former Clinton critic turned supporter.  I know that this might sound like an important connection, but it is actually pretty typical.  I think that people forget the size of Federal Government.  There are 435 Reps, 100 Senators, cabinet members, the President, Vice President, about 1,000 political appointees who need to be confirmed, plus others who don't need to be confirmed.  Most of these people have staff and their own circle of friends.  Also, DC has a judgenental and cutthroat culture especially in politics.  For that reason, people tend to limit the time they spend with their coworkers outside of work.  You don't need to be important to be connected to someone in Government.  The Clinton's may have at one point been a political powerhouse but they are far from the only game in town.

       At any given point, at least half of the House and a third of the Senate is up for reflections.  Everyone who is up for reflection fund raises and most have at least one fund raising event in DC.  A Restaurant hosting a fund raiser, especially during a Presidential Primary, is not unusual.

       I get the impression everyone thinks that politicians are monolythic.  This is far from the case. Their opinions can vary greatly within their own party.  Even among the staff of a politicians, opinions can vary.  Just like opinions, tastes vary too.  There isn't one place or even a handful of places where everyone goes.  Some of the places along Pennsylvania Avenue between Eye Street NW and 8th Street SE are more frequent destinations but that is only due to their proxity to the White House and Capitol.  For reference, Comet is in upper NW closer to the border with Maryland.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your last question, Comet was moderately popular prior to Pizzagate but it was not an iconic destination like Ben's Chilli Bowl or the Hawk and Dove.

       Maybe you right. Honestly, I don't care if the guy is a professional or not.  I'm just hoping to deter anyone else from trying something similar.

       Carrying a gun in D.C. Is a bad idea without a concealed carry permit. There used to be a ban until 2008. There is no open carry allowed and having a gun on you will likely result in a bad outcome.

       You think a picture of two adults performing oral sex on each other atop a slice of pizza is fine? For a "family" restaurant?
