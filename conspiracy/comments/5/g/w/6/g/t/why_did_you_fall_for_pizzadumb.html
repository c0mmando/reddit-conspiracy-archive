       Reddit is compromised, they keep certain discussions on certain subs up but they are heavily pruned. This is so the larger public doesn't realize this and they can keep you all under their thumb. Shills are having conversations with themselves, defending pedophiles, obfuscating the issue, while my comments simply questioning their motives for say, having their entire post history be pizzagate concern trolling are deleted. This is disgusting.

       I'd like to call attention to the fact that there is either incredible narrow mindedness or deliberate sabatoge of the credibility of the investigation by calling anyone with a differing opinion a pedophile. You are not furthering any cause by doing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other side of the coin is that it is not ok to call someone stupid for supporting the pizzagate investigation, no matter how stupid you think it is. The gunman was not sent to comet ping pong by pizzagate investigators, the people harassing employees are in the wrong but people looking for information or asking questions are not. Let's have some civility here.

       Calling someone a pedophile because they disagree with your point of view is as asinine as someone telling you not to investigate because they don't think it's real. Your not helping pizzagate by doing that, in fact your normalizing the word by overusing it and undermining the credibility of the entire investigation by associating it with false allegations.

       exactly. Nobody is calling people who disagree pedos (how do you not understand) we're calling you naive at best and shills at worst, either way your concern trolling does nothing to move the investigation forward. I can tell you're purposefully misunderstanding me to push your talking point. Cute

       By creating an us vs them mentality using phrases  like concern trolling, referencing shill activity and naiveness, asserting that I'm purposefully misunderstanding you and just generally swearing and acting like a child instead of having a rational adult debate. Why don't you try uniting everybody in the interest of supporting pizzagate instead?

       This is the main problem I have with a lot of you. Nobody has to hold your hand through this and nobody should. The manipulation of information is not something I will ever meet with a fucking inviting demeanor.  If coordinated attempts by the media, politicians, and citizens pulling out all the stops against an investigation into pedophilia doesn't make you angry then fuck you.

       Yes my friend you did. I'm genuinely curious though, why did you call it pizzadumb

       I'd like to call attention to the fact that no one here is calling anyone with a differing opinion a "pedophile" nor calling anyone who supports the pizzagate investigation "stupid"

       Both are definitely happening. I posted a link above to one user, that I had a genuine conversation with, of a differing opinion and right in the middle of it another user jumped in, linked his name and said he was probably a pizza lover. If you want to see someone call another stupid for believing in pizzagate, look no further than your nearest pizzagate post. People on both sides of the argument are being ridiculous.

       I think there was a misunderstanding on me and OP's part that you were telling OP he should stop calling people with a differing opinion a pedophile, you meant reddit users in general though, I apologize and I agree with both you and OP

        I'd like to call attention to the fact that there is either incredible narrow mindedness or deliberate sabatoge of the credibility of the investigation by calling anyone with a differing opinion a pedophile.

       Ahh yeah that is a misunderstanding, I meant specifically online like the linked post. I guess it's a good thing he already declared his win. Thanks for pointing that out.

       this is why they say reddit is dying. I gave up participation here to participate in Twitter wars (banned there, too). The funny thing is that we keep finding new places and ways to spread information, once it is deemed dangerous to Joe Public. The MSM is so assed out right now, it's tough to say what's going on. I wanted to propose a temporary cease-fire in the Twitter wars until January (when there might be DOJ ppl who might investigate). We need to get away from reddit, which will help to destroy their power and relevance.
