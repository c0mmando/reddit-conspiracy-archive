<p>The other side of the coin is that it is not ok to call someone stupid for supporting the pizzagate investigation, no matter how stupid you think it is. The gunman was not sent to comet ping pong by pizzagate investigators, the people harassing employees are in the wrong but people looking for information or asking questions are not.

    <div class="md"><p>Calling someone a pedophile because they disagree with your point of view is as asinine as someone telling you not to investigate because they don&#39;t think it&#39;s real.

    <div class="md"><p>exactly. Nobody is calling people who disagree pedos (how do you not understand) we&#39;re calling you naive at best and shills at worst, either way your concern trolling does nothing to move the investigation forward.

I posted a link above to one user, that I had a genuine conversation with, of a differing opinion and right in the middle of it another user jumped in, linked his name and said he was probably a pizza lover.

    <div class="md"><p>this is why they say reddit is dying. I gave up participation here to participate in Twitter wars (banned there, too). The funny thing is that we keep finding new places and ways to spread information, once it is deemed dangerous to Joe Public. The MSM is so assed out right now, it&#39;s tough to say what&#39;s going on. I wanted to propose a temporary cease-fire in the Twitter wars until January (when there might be DOJ ppl who might investigate). We need to get away from reddit, which will help to destroy their power and relevance.</p>
