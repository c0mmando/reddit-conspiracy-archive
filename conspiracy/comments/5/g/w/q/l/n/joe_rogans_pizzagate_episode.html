       I've been pretty slow to give anyone a chance when it comes to PG because it's far too frustrating when they can't get their facts straight. But, I decided to give Joe Rogan a listen. And I was not disappointed. Not because it was a good discussion of PG, but because it immediately exposes what you are up against.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bryan Callen is a perfect example of the kind of denial and lies that you need to be prepared to deal with. Within the first few seconds of the discussion he is already shouting down any dissent or alternate viewpoint. He says it's "crazy" to think that the whole power structure of the elites is based on pedophilia. Whatever, that's not really unexpected. But here is what really got my attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joe started to try to explain pizzagate and mentioned Dennis Hastert. Hastert, for those who don't know, was the United Stated Speaker of the House who arreseted and convicted of child sex crimes*: pedophilia. To which Bryan Callen says "There are always going to be pedophiles in that group."
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSYpzB4Wc4Q&amp;t=250">
        TimeStamp Link @4:10
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Think for second how fucked up that is - that the guy who yells the loudest about how PG is "debunked" and a "joke" immediately turns around and says "There are always going to be pedophiles in that group." How sick is it normalize child sex crimes so non-chalantly, so flippantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is Bryan Calllen, anyway, and why is he so upset about PG?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: thanks u/tongue-n-groove - Hastert was not convicted of sex crimes. The sexual abuse came out as a part of his conviction when he "pleaded guilty to the felony "structuring" charge,and the charge of "making false statements" (lying to the FBI) was dismissed." You can read the details here:

       Hastert wasn't arrested or convicted for sex crimes - he was busted for structuring cash withdrawals from accounts to avoid reporting to IRS. As it turned out the withdrawals were for making payments to boys he molested when he was a high school wrestling coach in the 70s. He paid a couple million so they wouldn't rat him out.
      </p>
      <p>
       But OP is correct - Hastert

        was

       is a big time pedophile.

       u/elcad is correct, statute of limitations on the molestation had expired, but all those fed fuckers take care of their own... like Corny letting Hitlary walk on espionage.

       Still chapped about this one. I Wanted them to dig into it a bit! Even if they are meat heads, i'd still like to hear them roll through it a few times. 
Really surprised and upset about BC terminating the discussion so forcefully. Hope they bring it up again soon.

       Joe Rogan also said today on his podcast with Kevin Smith that a universal income for everyone is a "good idea" too. Joe is slowly getting dumber with each toke.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for PG: Callen is an egomaniac who thinks he's way smart than he is. I'm pretty sure he's also the friend of Joe's whose dad was/is in the CIA. Not surprising Callen thinks conspiracy theories are all nonsense.

       He got big, so he got contacted. I don't think it has anything to do with reefer, but that's neither here nor there. Once you get attention from The People, you get attention from Their Owners.

       That's certainly a possibility, and a logical assumption.

       Joe thinking about universal income certainly and his newfound appreciation for socialism does slightly come from too much weed. Dude got rich off hard work and some luck, and now he thinks people should get basic income? Nonsense. I bet dollars to donuts if socialism really kicked in and he got taxed 99%, and his existing wealth was redistributed he'd go apeshit. He's lost in the Hollywood mentality, and doesn't even know it.

       It's stupid and unwatchable.  I've unsubbed Rogan Josh because of this episode. Bunch o gd turkeys gobbling would be more useful of a video, and strangely, similar

       This was a great episode .... Give Joe Rogan some credit. .. He layed some info on people, but "he really didn't investigate into it" (aka. covering his own ass just in case)  , but here's a thing "a lot of people are talking about this"  ... Very , very good, and also very , very preplanned and staged episode.

       Very disappointed when I heard Callen's take on it. To be fair though, I was never aware of his political leanings before that. He is a funny comedian though. I saw him at a small show a few years back..real nice guy back then.

       You can tell Joe wants to be more open but with more success he has to the line more. Still s big fan of the JRE.
