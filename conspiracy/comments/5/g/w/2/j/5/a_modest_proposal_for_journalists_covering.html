        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">81</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-06 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LucifersHammerr.html">LucifersHammerr</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The entire corporate media has worked itself into a frenzy on the subject of PizzaGate.   We are told that &quot;alt-right conspiracy theorists&quot; are involved in a witch hunt against an innocent Pizzeria owner and his associates.    These &quot;crazy conspiracy theories&quot;, which are actually Russian propaganda designed to undermine the pillars of American society, were created by &quot;fake news&quot; websites.   </p>

<p>The above claim has been made by the likes of the Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN, Salon and even Fox.  </p>

<p>Tech giants like Google, Twitter and Facebook are so concerned about &quot;fake news&quot; that they intend to begin filtering this content.   There is even talk of overt censorship from the state.  Included on ProporNot&#39;s blacklist is Wikileaks, which leaked John Podesta&#39;s emails.   These emails are what started the PizzaGate investigation. </p>

<p>Given that the power elite and their media mouthpieces are so hellbent on quashing rumors about the highschool dropout and pizza joint owner James Alefantis, who for some reason visits the White House on a regular basis, I have a radical idea that will quickly put an end to this sordid smear campaign: </p>

<p>Perform an act of journalism.   I know this is a lot to ask from journalists -- that they investigate something and write down their findings in a journal -- but it&#39;s just crazy enough to work.   I dare say the whole thing could be nipped in the bud with one article.  </p>

<p>Here are my suggestions: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Acknowledge that people no longer trust law enforcement agencies to do their jobs when it comes to power elites.   Not a single banker went to jail over the financial crisis.   No one has gone to jail over the illegal and genocidal invasion of Iraq.  No one has gone to jail over CIA torture programs.  A JP Morgan heir was given no jail time for raping his three year old daughter.   Clearly there is one set of laws for the people and another for the rich and powerful.  </p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge that elite pedophile rings exist and have consistently been covered up by the authorities.   This is not a matter for debate.   Whether the Franklin Coverup, Elm House, Dutroux, Saville etc. there is an unmistakable pattern.   If you want a recent example pick Jeffrey Epstein.   Epstein was involved in a child trafficking operation where girls were procured from European modeling agencies and used as sex slaves for elites on Jeffrey&#39;s private jet and island.   He had hidden cameras throughout his florida home, implying a blackmail/intelligence link.   Published flight logs reveal that Bill Clinton took two dozen joy rides on the &quot;lolita express&quot; without his SS detail.   Despite molesting at least 40 girls Epstein was not sent away for life or executed.   On the contrary he spent 16 months in a country club &quot;prison&quot; where he was allowed to leave during the day.   </p></li>
<li><p>While you&#39;re at it, ask your colleagues Katie Couric, George Stephanapolous and Charlie Rose why they dined at Epstein&#39;s NY apartment the day of his release (along with Hollywood&#39;s beloved Woody Allen).   (Said &quot;apartment&quot; is more like a castle, eight floors, the most expensive in NY; according to the pre-scandal Vanity Fair article, the entranceway is flanked by glass eyeballs, an apparent inside joke about the cameras behind the walls; Jimmy Saville also collected glass eyeballs, in his case from the Leeds mortuary where he apparently engaged in necrophilia.   Saville was given the highest level security clearance by MI5).   </p></li>
<li><p>The above can serve as an introduction to explain why so many people think elite pedo rings are a thing even if the Podesta brothers, the Clinton Foundation, the CIA and the Comet crew are not involved in such horrific activities.    <em>It&#39;s no wonder people think this is a thing</em>, you might say. </p></li>
<li><p>Moving on to the Podestas, journalists can post the police efits of the abductors in the Maddie McCann case alongside photos of John and Tony.   A journalist might say, <em>&quot;well, it&#39;s no wonder people think they were involved -- the pictures are an exact match, right down to the mole on Tony&#39;s forehead, but here&#39;s why they should not be considered suspects.&quot;</em>   You could ask the McCann parents what they think; you could try to obtain records about where the Podesta brothers were on the date of her disappearance; you could inquire into any relationship they may have had with Clem Freud, and so forth.   </p></li>
<li><p>Re: Alefantis and the Comet crew.   This one&#39;s a no brainer.  Simply ask them what they meant by sayings things like &quot;chickenlovers,&quot; &quot;hotard,&quot; &quot;must have&quot;, &quot;baby...yum&quot;, &quot;ping pong in London sounds tempting,&quot; &quot;why does daddy like in the butt&quot;, &quot;put her on a menu&quot; etc etc when talking about kids.   Surely there&#39;s an innocent explanation for making so many pedophilic references about babies and toddlers.  </p></li>
<li><p>Ask Tony why he collects artwork about pedophilia and dead kids and even has photographs of naked kids in his bedroom.   Perhaps there&#39;s an innocent explanation.   </p></li>
<li><p>Ask Amanda Kleinman why her work with the &quot;Apes&quot; centered around pedophilia, cannibalism and child murder.   Ask her if she thought that appropriate given that she works (or used to work) with mentally disabled children.   </p></li>
<li><p>Ask that billionaire friend of John Podesta&#39;s what he meant by &quot;dominos on cheese or pasta&quot; or the other guy why he dreams about a &quot;hotdog stand in Hawaii&quot;.   </p></li>
<li><p>Find out who owns Besta Pizza and the businesses surrounding Comet and Besta.   Name the individuals.   Ask them questions.  Allow them to refute these sinister allegations.   Find out who the individual was who bought the properties for Comet, Besta, Politics and Prose and Little Red Fox on the same day.   </p></li>
<li><p>Perform a statistical analysis of how many businesses and NGO&#39;s involved in child protection, child trafficking, daycare, &quot;at-risk youth&quot; and so forth have pedophile symbols for their logos and/or have been caught abusing or trafficking children.   For example, <a href="https://i.sli.mg/jg6KfI.jpg">this guy</a> donated an awful lot of money to the Clinton Foundation.   Ask him to fire his graphic designer because that logo is an <em>exact match</em> for the FBI&#39;s leaked &quot;boy lover&quot; symbol.  </p></li>
<li><p>Contact Twitter and ask them why they allowed all that child porn on their platform while having a zero tolerance approach for people who say mean things to feminists.  </p></li>
<li><p>Ask the folks at the Pentagon what ever happened to that internal investigation about thousands of employees downloading child porn.   A bunch of degenerates or are pedo rings part of an ongoing blackmail/honey pot operation?   </p></li>
<li><p>Ask the folks at Dyncorp why no one was ever punished for trafficking child sex slaves in Serbia.  </p></li>
<li><p>Contact David Brock and ask him who at CTR posted child porn on the Bernie Sanders Facebook page.   Where did they get it? </p></li>
<li><p>Ask the most powerful man in Hollywood, Steven Spielberg, why he hasn&#39;t said a thing about the fact that pedophilia is an open secret in Hollywood.  Ask him where he got the DreamWorks logo...</p></li>
<li><p>Find out who that David FlintStone/Mr. Potato Head guy is in Hawaii.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on, but I think I&#39;ve made my point.  If journalists are so concerned about the &quot;harassment&quot; of these individuals, why not write an article where the concerns of Pizzagate researchers are addressed?    Saying &quot;fake news&quot; over and over again is merely making this look even more suspicious than it already is.   Why is the entire corporate media ignoring the relevant information and instead pretending that these rumors are completely groundless?      </p>

<p>An article stating, &quot;Top D.C. Democrats obsessed with pedophilia, occult&quot;, but &quot;no hard evidence they have molested or killed children&quot; would be accurate.   (note that I do not believe this to be a partisan affair; the Franklin Coverup involved mostly Republicans, and Tony&#39;s close friend Denny Hastert was a Republican).    </p>

<p>So there it is.   Believe it nor I have no formal training in journalism!!   I came up with these groundbreaking ideas all by myself ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post! Agree a million% 
They are not doing this because they don&#39;t want to get labeled and commit career suicide! I have a friend that is an editor, he knows something is up but can&#39;t/ won&#39;t publish on the topics. Weather he doesn&#39;t want to be attacked by all the left leaners or his publisher won&#39;t allow it, I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, this is an excellent post.</p>

<p>I was lurking in some of the first threads about the connection to the reddit story in Hawaii, and podesta email about his hotdog stand. </p>

<p>I was very skeptical then and have remained so. But the attacks from the media sealed the deal for me. The fake news nonsense coming from mainstream is the pinnacle of hypocrisy. I hope this buries them permanently. It&#39;s so goddamn obvious they have orders to squash this story. </p>

<p>And at the end of the day the very sane and rational questions brought up in this post are not being investigated.  </p>
