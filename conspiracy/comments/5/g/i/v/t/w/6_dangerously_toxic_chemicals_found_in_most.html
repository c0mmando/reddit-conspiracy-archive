<p>Let&#39;s face it, as we play our roles within society we love to smell great while doing so. </p>

<p>In fact, it&#39;s been estimated that around 90% of Americans alone expose themselves to toxic chemicals most unknowingly on a daily basis. </p>

<p>It&#39;s time to take a closer look. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really.  When you smell people it&#39;s the bacterial growth you&#39;re smelling. So if a person had more oily skin or sweats a lot then they&#39;re going to smell without deodorant within like 6 hours of showering </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I switched to the crystal deodorant, there is a stick form and a roll on.  I love it, no smell and no harsh chemicals.  It took me a long time of trying many natural deodorants until I finally found this one that not only works but doesn&#39;t irritate my skin.  Love it and lasts for about a year.  Also doesn&#39;t leave residue on clothing, the salt crystal neutralizes or kills the bacteria under your arms so you naturally don&#39;t smell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally a thread where I can say that I haven&#39;t worn deodorant in ten years! No one noticed. My husband was in shock when I mentioned it, recently.</p>

<p>Antiperspirants interfere with your body&#39;s natural cooling system and cause you to produce more sweat, in order to compensate. Deodorant screws with your pH and creates a Petri dish for stinky microorganisms. It&#39;s a vicious, toxic, cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a teenager I had constant skin irritation from deodorant and kept trying different things. One day my very old grand uncle was at our house. He was an interesting dude. Grew up through the depression. Lived in the same old house which once had dirt floors until they put real floors in at some point. </p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s not the point. He was just a real salt of the earth guy who spoke his mind and swore like a sailor.</p>

<p>I was complaining to him about how I kept breaking out in rashes and whatnot and he told me something like this:</p>

<p>People smell, it&#39;s a fucking fact of life. When I was growing up we never even had deodorant. People didn&#39;t even know what that shit was. It&#39;s all this made up crap by the big companies to make you think you need something else to buy so they can make more money. That stuff will screw with you. Stop using it and your body will be just fine. If you really stink you&#39;ll know it so be a good guy and clean yourself up in the sink or shower. </p>

<p>So I stopped using deodorant and haven&#39;t looked back. It was interesting though because it was like my body had this adjustment period. It had become used to it even though it was irritating my skin. After about a month I didn&#39;t really notice any stink coming off me anymore without it (<em>except on especially hot hard working days</em>) and I rarely ever touch the stuff. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking toxic. I don&#39;t want it on my body and when I&#39;m with other guys and smell it on them I hate it. I can&#39;t stand the smell of that shit. I&#39;m a smoker and people think that smells bad (<em>it does</em>) but to me deodorant smells just as bad. </p>

<p>Also, I have never once had a single person (<em>very close friends included who will tell me if I have lettuce in my teeth</em>) recoil or say that I smell. My body has somehow adjusted to a more natural state and I don&#39;t need it. Sure, somedays I stink after whatever work I did but that&#39;s when I do the natural thing and clean myself up. Magic... smell is gone. </p>
