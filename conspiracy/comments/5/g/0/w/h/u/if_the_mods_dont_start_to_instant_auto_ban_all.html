       Their is no testimony of an identfied victim / raped child in this pizzagate bs. Have you seen any interview / testimony of a raped kid ? no. Eventualy maybe there is something / dirty stuff about this Weiner guy but its somthing isolated/marginal. There is no such thing as a "pizzagate" / huge pedo ring involving HRC etc. This is bs.

       She looks like an old crazy cow / total wacko seeking for attention rather than a raped kid to me. So what about her ? did she went to the "police" to make a testimony about her (pretended?) rape / abuse ? She had about 15 years to do it in due time (she claims it happened in 1978), but it seems this didn't happened. I would definitly need something more recent and consistent / established to be convinced about pizzagate existence.

       Are you familiar with child rape victims? Do they not look like "crazy cow/ total wacko seeking for attention" or something?  How are they supposed to look? I was just giving you an example. Who are you to say that her story isn't true? It seems to me like this whole pizzagate thing isn't something recent, and has been going on for a long time now.

       Enjoyed ????? Are you fucking kidding me? You re either seriously trolling, or are a seriously misinformed person. Also as for the case you mentioned them coming forward when it was no longer under criminal charges why do you think that it? Or all the women in the Bill Cosby case( I don't personally believe all of them, some yes all no)? It's because it takes victims years/decades even to come to terms with what happened and to be able to tell others. And kids for the most part believe everything an adult tells them up to a certain age. That with trauma, rape,and threats aimed at them or their parents , you get a fucked up mind. Who won't talk because of fear, and shame.When the Catholic Church thing broke it was people in their 30s telling what happened, not the 5-6 year olds.

       Guys I think I know quite well what a "pedo ring" can be  (I have a personal interest on the  topic) and for sure they exist. But let's be clear: pedos "rings" don't use emails, even with coded words (or pgp) to chat about their rendez vous. Also pedos rings often involve the parents / family relatives or else in other situations / locations organised crime / mafia who make business of it. Sometimes those 2 criminal groups mix/interact together, sometimes no. Also free masonry groups are often a medium / nest for pedos (think about eyes wide shut and such). Also unfortunatly schools and profession such as sport teacher are often pedo "nest". This is the real "pedo world" and it has nothing to do with this pizzagate forged story. 
If there is any serious / established testimony of an identfied victim / raped child in this pizzagate Im ready to believe it, but there isn't and there won't be because all this story is bs.
And just saying but with darknet child porn and this pizzagate bs , all this crap just makes pedos and child abuse more and more "mainstream" which is (I think) a real (society) concern.

       Let's pick out some of the things you say make up pedo rings shall we. Mafia---- our government is run like the Mafia, you have people and corporations that buy off government employees to get their agendas passed. masonry------ most people in power in this country are or have been Masons, our first president was a mason. Schools/teachers------ comet pi$$@ has ping pong, most if not all children would have to be taught how to play the game, just like how gym teachers teach volleyball and other sports.Darknet child porn----- it has been proven that the FBI  ran/hosted a child porn server on the darknet. And finally serious testimony from victims------- This one I can't give you proof but look at how hard it is for grown women and men to come out and say they were sexually abused, or army/navy people to say something happened while in basic training or due active service. So if it's that hard for adults to process the abuse, how more so do you think it is for children or their families to come out and say, a high ranking  government official abused them? People in positions of power are intimidating, these government people could threaten children and adults with jail time, pin false crimes on them, and just plain make their lives a living hell by speaking out. Finally why is it so hard to believe that this could happen when the U.K is in the the middle of not one but two different pedo ring scandals involving  same type of people in powerful positions. And let's not forget the Catholic Church abuse cases they people did not want to believe we're so wide spread

       Sometimes I get the idea that these people are plants, and then I realize that if I was buying plants I wouldn't buy one that is braindead... but then maybe only braindead plants are for sale? I think that's far to optimistic though, so I'm left baffled.

       I agree.  I support their investigation, but it would be smart to play dead, lay low, go undercover, survive.

       Direct people to voat.co for pizzagate and use this forum to drain this swamp.

       Nah... most of the users and mods of this sub are on the ball to prevent the pizzagate stuff from getting us in trouble without having to totally avoid the subject. Most of it now is just reposts of like dozens of random youtube recaps... easily ignored. Not much "unearthing" is going on over here.

       I'm thread filtering every keyword related to pizzagate, satanism or paedophilia that I can think of.  Contrary to what you might think, that isn't because I don't want psychopathic paedophiles to go to jail.  It's because I don't want to get greeted with a wave of potentially vomit-inducing, sensationalistic gore porn every time I enter this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a sensitive individual, and to a certain extent I
       <strong>
        <em>
         do
        </em>
       </strong>
       need to psychologically protect myself from material which stands some chance of causing me to become at least temporarily suicidal.  You might tell me that I'm a sheltered, gutless wimp for that, and you might be right.  As much as I'd like to be, unfortunately we can't all be Spartans.  I'm closer to Ephialtes than King Leonidas, and I've had to accept that.
