    <div class="md"><p>Hi. I am glad you watched the David Icke video. It sounds like you really got alot from it. When people actually watch his lectures they understand what he has been saying about Reptilians. I wish more people would actually watch his presentations, instead many just insult Icke. They never learn the truth, because they do not know his actual explanation of things. You sound like a very creative and visionary person. Mechanical Engineering is perfect for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read the satanic bible a few times, and I have the works of Anton LeVay &amp; as he was the leader of the Satanic church for satanists, I cannot for the life of me figure out how paedophiles are linked with Satanism? 
Are we talking about an older satanic group or LeVays? 
Obviously there can be paedophiles in any form of religion so why is this such a big thing about satanists? 
Sorry if I&#39;m missing the point here but I&#39;m just not understanding.
Even the Hollie Greig story in aberdeen(I&#39;m from Aberdeen) I have never heard of that until now...
THE FUCK IS GOING ON? </p>

<p>From the description: Crowley wrote a chapter on ancient blood sacrifice in his book ‘Magick in Theory and Practice‘ the chapter headed ‘OF THE BLOODY SACRIFICE: AND MATTERS COGNATE‘, “There is a Magical operation of maximum importance: the Initiation of a New Aeon. When it becomes necessary to utter a Word, the whole Planet must be bathed in blood. Before man is ready to accept the Law of Thelema, the Great War must be fought. This Bloody Sacrifice is the critical point of the World-Ceremony of the Proclamation of Horus, the Crowned and conquering Child, as Lord of the Aeon” (Paedophile Aleister Crowley, 1911).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be careful with that stereotype, I attend a Christian church and I was not taught this,  in fact many biblical churches teach the truth about Satan himself,  we don&#39;t waste time on covering those who devote themselves to an organization worshiping Satan because the Bible says that any who aren&#39;t saved are children of the Devil so technically everyone worships Satan who doesn&#39;t serve God. People love to talk for Christians but have been decided by false professors and those who don&#39;t even know themselves</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just making me wonder if any of these people have ever read any satanic books. Out of any religious book I&#39;ve read(bible &amp; Quran) the satanic bible is the one that doesn&#39;t force you to believe any made up story. It&#39;s actually specifies that you are your own god and you should do what makes YOU happy. 
All they have to do is look at the 9 satanic statements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LeVay was simply a devoted follower of Satan. The church of Satan doesn&#39;t work like the church of the living God. Satan is in charge and has his hand in almost everything outside if the biblical churches. To understand this stuff more I invite you to listen to some Christians go into detail such as RoundSaturnsEye on YouTube. One can only understand this stuff going on by understanding what God tells us about the spiritual realm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Military &gt; secret society &gt; government/corporation (same thing these days) &gt; rich people &gt; normal people</p>

<p>The secret societies would have killed us off by now if they were capable of seizing control.  They are of weak genetic stock, and they only ascended in the first place, because of societal changes after the medieval age; they exploited these changes and came into a deal of power.  Now they are grasping and clawing to hold onto what they have, it&#39;s over for them, it&#39;s over for our treasonous governments, and it&#39;s over for the rich.  Might makes right, and we will retake our lands</p>

<p>Do not be passive.  That&#39;s their only remaining weapon - the cowardice of the population.  Once enough of you are ready to kill, then we will have our day</p>

<p>Many of the Pedophiles are old, and will die soon. The focus should be on not creating more of them through initiations such as sports.</p>

<p>Time out.  By your logic, sports leads to being a pedophile.  lol.  Really?  I&#39;ve been in sports all my life and the thought of molesting a kid is as horrible and abhorrent as they come.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not true. Satanism is nothing more than a mockery of society/religion/&#39;The mass&#39;. Satanism also has nothing to do with Satan himself, it&#39;s merely the name they give to a &#39;religion&#39; to spread fear unto others and mock religions for believing in false gods while doing so.
In Satanism, there is just one god; me, myself and I, and your puny god can&#39;t do shit about it.  A true satanist is in reality just another atheist</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. I am glad you watched the David Icke video. It sounds like you really got alot from it. When people actually watch his lectures they understand what he has been saying about Reptilians. I wish more people would actually watch his presentations, instead many just insult Icke. They never learn the truth, because they do not know his actual explanation of things. You sound like a very creative and visionary person. Mechanical Engineering is perfect for you.</p>
