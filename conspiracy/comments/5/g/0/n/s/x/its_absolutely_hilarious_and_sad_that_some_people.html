       People clearly don't know how to think critically if they seriously consider Trump to secretly be pulling strings for Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       People also must know absolutely nothing about Hillary's past/present - BECAUSE OF TRUMP primarily, the Clinton name (which is alllllll about large swaths of illegal $$$$$, domination, secrecy and extortion) is slowly being eroded in a very public bathtub full of acid. Clinton and her cohorts are going nuts atm - quite a spectacle. They're panicking. Billions have been lost to Clinton because of Trump and his people. Clinton was in the pocket of hundreds of extremely wealthy and sinister people - does anybody SERIOUSLY consider that they'd all pull these kinds of strings and willingly set out their own destruction?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, because of Trump's victory, the DNC and democratic party in general has undergone a HUGE CRISIS, unlike anything seen in its centuries-old history. Again, Clinton would never engineer this. Not only has her family's name been put through the deep fryer and back again, billions and billions of dollars, and a reputation she spent decades building, is all being dismantled violently before her eyes. She has been HUMILIATED- and if anybody knows anything at all about HRC, she is not the kind of person who takes being humiliated lightly. Research the trail of bodies (hundreds of murders) if you need any kind of reassurance. Nobody, and I mean nobody, crossed the Clintons and lived to tell about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think critically, people. This is infuriating to have so many armchair warriors burping while scratching their balls and writing ridiculous, unfounded claims that Trump has somehow duped us and is just another puppet for the NWO. The NWO is terrified of Donald Trump - they are sneaky, yes, but if they "somehow are pulling DT's strings" then they have COMPLETELY, completely shot themselves in the fucking foot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of Trump, millions of people are actually sincerely interested in uncovering the vast pedophile/satanic network that spans the globe. Think the elites engineered his victory? Well let me tell you something else, then - the sky is fucking purple and rains giraffes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me - Trump is not bought out by these cronies, even if some of his cabinet desicions are unpredictable. They (the global elite) have absolutely been reduced to a pile of blithering, stunned invalids because of his victory. Insiders (people who are actually in the political/military arena) absolutely know this...believe me, beyond a shadow of a freaking doubt. You can rest assured - thanks to the internet and other factors, there has been an absolute incredible, 1776 revolutionary-tier mass awakening across the globe. The NWO is collectively shitting their proverbial pants over this - and it's only going to get crazier and more beautiful with every passing second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Follow the money - Trump is NOT being bought out. He is going to drain the swamp. TOO MANY PEOPLE are already woken up because of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that this is the /Conspiracy sub people...but jesus H, we need to draw some fucking lines in the sand here. Critical thinking, folks. I have a very strong gut feeling that all of these shills bashing DT are the people who refused to vote for him, because of "racism...and like, stuff guys"

       I don't worship anybody - but I also don't jump off planes in mid flight because I refuse to understand the plane has already taken off.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, for the past 3 centuries or so (probably a bit longer than that) globalist bankers have used this planet for a pissing pot - starting wars, enslaving masses to debt, and committing atrocious crimes against humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's victory was a slap to the face of these global elites, and never before in HISTORY has such an underdog defeated the "most qualified politician to ever run for office", in such a public arena and under such intense 24/7 media scrutiny. It truly was an epic uprising of the people - and trust me, nobody saw this coming from a mile away. Hillary was simply the go-to extension of Obama/Bush/Etc etc - and the volatile, severely unpredictable nature of this revolt is the exact proof we have of the fact they did NOT see this coming. They'd never bet on these odds, and they (the elites) would never gamble such stakes while their little princess poster child (Hillary) had her entire reputation on the line. Yet, it was beyond the perfect time for such an uprising - beyond perfect - because the elites still viewed us as docile sheeple zombies, while we had a new, secret sleeper weapon on our side (the internet/social media). The monster, fattened with past victories over the sleeping masses, got lazy and in turn got blindsided. They got punched straight in the throat with his victory. They're stunned. Priceless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, by the way - Trump is a hero, but not quite Jesus AKA a perfect knight in shining armor. There will be some infiltration of his office. But the damage has been done, and the evil dragon has already been lanced right in the gut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having ANY professional, world-stage political office without the interference of these jesuits would be like buying a car without it's engines and still expecting it to magically start driving anyways. They're fucking vampires - they will still find ways to infiltrate, confuse, intimidate and scratch wildly and violently. They're like one, big virus. We can't have a perfect administration - but again, we've already experienced an epic victory with the slap to the face of the global elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       No reason to get lazy though - we still need to fight.

       I have to admit, I was one of those people that assumed Trump was on Hillary's side.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I still think he may have started that way.

       But, with money comes power and ego.

       I think Trump went to work for himself at some point.

       There is no way Hillary would have allowed Trump to say a lot of the things he's said about her.

       Exactly - you're right on target. Trump, when building up his reputation/business/money, was absolutely in "cohorts" with Clinton, Epstein, and others. He had to be, or he would've been a nobody. It was the only way to play the game, and to survive with your monetary interests in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somewhere along the line he dropped them like a sack of hot potatoes and went rogue. Now he's planning to dismantle them, one by one, until they scatter like vermin under a flame thrower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin did the exact same thing - he played the game, and pretended to be a puppet of the global elite. Then he got into power, and BOOM - started wrecking them.

       Clearly. And what's the most important factor to Donald Trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not his cabinet, not his future presidential choices; the greatest &amp; most important thing about this entire spectacle was the REPUDIATION AND REJECTION of the global elite. That's something extraordinarily epic, something money will never match.

       I'm telling you, people. Something great has happened and a century from now, people studying this kind of stuff will consider November 8th 2016 to be the greatest moment in America's free history....greater than 1776, more than 1864.

      <p>
       The same could be said of Bill Clinton, who did not "run" the Mena CIA operation.  He was governor.  He had the choice:  turn a blind eye, or play ball.  It's idiotic to say Bill Clinton was more powerful than the Director of the CIA, George H. W. Bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also idiotic, according to your own scenario, that Trump won't end up exactly where Bill Clinton is today.  Faustian bargains don't help you "go rogue."  Trump is compromised, or he wouldn't have been part of the Epstein operation.

       Anyways, yes people have crossed the Clinton's and lived to tell about it. Ever heard of a guy named Newt Gingrich. Face it man, you got duped. He sold you a dream and it was just that, a dream.  This isn't the first time and it wont be the last time that he sells people a box of bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wait until he sells a version of this speech again. It will be ridiculous, very ridiculous.

       Nothing inherent. But we live in a world dominated by a spectrum of color. Only seeing a few of those colors is going to limit you in some way or another.

       But nice bait. Its high time we stop asking stupid bait questions like this and realize being politically correct is another form of limiting yourself.

       Yes we do live in a world dominated by a spectrum of color. Similarly, "Political Correctness" has a spectrum as well. Using the veil of anti-pc to promote half truths, all out lies and hateful shit is pretty ridiculous. Using anti-pc rhetoric to sell people on the idea that you are anti-establishment is also pretty ridiculous. I mean, just logic through this for one bit. How can you be anti-establishment and you are genuinely friends with the very family that you have painted as the embodiment of the establishment? Why should I not believe you are scamming American people when you have a documented history of scamming American people?  Why should I not believe you are selling people bullshit when your mannerisms and speech patterns are very similar to individuals who do sell people bullshit? If you believe we live in a world dominated by a spectrum of color how can you support someone who frequently speaks in authoritative absolutes?

       His potential cabinet is entirely set up to carry out the Vatican's agenda, just like every other presidency of our lifetimes.

       Now since he can't make any actual decisions yet, his cabinet picks are obviously subject to change. So I guess we'll see.

       Thank you for your post - but I feel like you're thinking in terms that are too black-and-white.
      </p>
      <p>
       For one, you assume that ALL ROTHSCHILDS are evil, hand-rubbing scheming Disney villains. I disagree. I believe the Rothschilds are simply sluts for money making opportunities. Where the power goes, they follow and profit. Sure, some are evil and want to see many lives ruined- but not all. I'll use an old saying to illustrate my point: "All Knights are men-at-arms, but not all men-at-arms are Knights."
      </p>
      <p>
       NWO is largely comprised of these Jesuits/Zionists, but not every incredibly rich Jesuit particularly cares about their allegiance to these crooks. You can bet on it. Most of them are simply survivalists. Like most human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing. If he (trump) was seriously invested in destroying America further, then believe me, he would've been very sneaky and careful about getting "good, clean, 'innocent'" cabinet picks. AKA he'd be as deceptive as possible to fool as many people as he could at once. These NWO's operate in shadows and darkness/deception - think 9/11 and the vast coverup that followed. Trump is the opposite of that. He is like a wrecking ball swinging wildly around a gigantic house of cards. His rhetoric has caused hundreds of millions to snap themselves awake,  turn on their computers and pay ATTENTION - even if they are for or against him. Trump is the demolitionist, and he has pressed the big fat red button. He has begun a mental war - and wars of the mind will always unfailingly bring some sort of truth to the surface, in ways that are orchestrated or not. To these Zionists, any "attention" to "anything" is BAD attention. These global elites hate those types.
      </p>
      <p>
       He seems to have made a casual blunder - or so it seems - and for that, we should be breathing a sigh of relief.

       Eh this doesn't have anything to do with the Rothschilds. They're just bankers. The Vatican is the bank.

       Read the
       <a href="http://www.reformation.org/jesuit-oath.html">
        oath all those Jesuits in his cabinet have taken

       and decide for yourself.

       I don't have an allegiance to any party or person and I largely expect the country and the financial system to completely fail before anything in this fuckhole gets better, but I'm glad Trump won anyway cause at the very least it'll be entertaining. But again, we'll see.
