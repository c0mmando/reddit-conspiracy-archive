       Listen, i dont doubt that there is a lot more to Trump than MAGA behind closed doors.  Its almost guaranteed.  But I think the fact that the the ENTIRE system was against him, the media was against him, fuck his own party was against him- I think that speaks volumes.  I don't think you people give enough credit or acknowledgement for those things.  I honestly don't believe that he is AS corrupt as Hillary is (I do believe he is corrupt to an extent tho) - people on here seem to hold a certain level of credence to fbianon, and even the fbianon said that trumps worst endeavor was paying bribes for permits (and honestly, i believe he has done worse).
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead and downvote me, Shills - but i think the fact remains that he was by far the least of two evils - i think if hillary was elected, this country was blatantly dead in the water.  At least with trump, there may still be an illusion left

       This is the best explanation. Anyone paying close attention to the mainstream can see the majority of these "news" articles are really just the writer's opinions. They are very often very crafty hit pieces with catchy click bait titles. "Trump is now the worst candidate in history" is not news, it's propaganda. That's just an example though. I'm sure I could find one in 10 minutes or less.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's gotten to the point for me that anything in the mainstream should be watched, but with the knowledge that the other side of the story is what is actually true. Trump is corrupt. He is a business mogul who didn't get his way there by being squeeky clean. If you think you get far in business by playing by the book, you're delusional. But as the above commenter said, you have one shady guy who doesn't want to play with the other corrupt guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while I agree Trump is corrupt, I don't think he's going to continue the same exact course. We'll see though. It's too early, but I do think the system itself is the culprit and typically if you get into that web, you're going to either get caught by a spider or become one yourself.

       The media was against trump? Cuz to me it looked like they were "against" him and just gave him all the free advertising to the world in a way that made him seem appealing to people who didn't like the system. That's the narrative they wanted people to buy, that a man who has been paying into the corrupt system his whole life, and has been long time buddies with the Clinton's was an "outsider". Now he's filling his cabinet with similar people to what Clinton would have. They control both sides of the election, which is why we are still allowed to vote. The sooner you get this through your skull, the sooner you can stop inadvertently furthering the agenda of Tptb

       Both of you are arguing points you can't prove.  You have no idea what TPTB's intentions actually were because you're not one of them.  And if you think they are so stupid that they would continue using the media to 'attack' Trump despite the fact that it was very obviously only helping his popularity then you are vastly underestimating them.  Do you think they are drooling retards who can't tie their shoes properly? Because even someone of that level of intellect could see that the end result of the medias actions was benefiting Trump..

       Do term limits, foreign money out of elections, renegotiating harmful trade laws and lobbyists restrictions sound like TPTB? I can't see either Bush doing any of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have thought long and hard about Trump being in the middle of it and just playing his part. If he is, it will be the greatest acting in my lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the end of the day and going back to the 80's, he has maintained the same message and ideas instead of changing with political landscape. Many policies he campaigned on are in direct conflict with known elite agendas. His first official appointee is a step in the right direction.

       Yup, clear as day, they were giving him exposure to help him round up people disgruntled with politicians/rhetoric/the government, so that no matter what it's TPTB vs TPTB come election time. CTR is very much alive, and now they're pushing the "Trump is going to save the day; disregard his connections to the elites, to the lolita express, and him filling his cabinet with swamp men".

       There wasn't only 1 option though. There was 4. If everyone who voted Trump or Hillary under the "lesser evil" guise, 3rd parties would have pulled in so much support. But I guess a billionaire elite warhawk is better than a billionaire elite warhawk.

       My reply was flippant but your last line was pretty bad too.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal take on all this is that the "two party system" mentality is to blame, the Dems and Reps are the same shit again and again but there is little to no push in replacing the both of them with something new/different.
 This mentality is destroying American politics, more choice for the electorate is seen as stupid or pointless but this swamp won't be drained until the people get rid of the two giant gators shitting up the place.

       Well it wasn't aimed at you but I've amended it. I agree, it wasn't necessary but....frustration, I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I agree completely about the two-party system. The founders warned us about these things and it's why, I believe, there has been a systematic and concentrated effort to dismiss them as racists, degenerates, etc.

       Yes exactly.  I'm starting to think that the way this election was constructed was to definitely have Hillary lose and Trump win, and then just sit back and have Trump betray the people who voted for him.  This way TPTB still get 4 years of helping their cause, and at the end of it all, because Trump gets demonized for being a liar, populist movements will become discredited.  Anyone saying "I want to stop corruption in DC" will have "drain the swamp" comparisons drawn and be assumed a liar.  Which is ridiculous, because we will start saying "If somebody says X, they really mean NOT X"--if this is our belief, how can anyone espouse support for X without being labeled a liar?  The new call for the future will be "Anyone talking about helping the common person is a liar, so nobody should talk about helping the common man."  Welcome to doublespeak nation.

       They didn't paint him like an outsider - in fact, all they have done and all that they are doing is trying to tie him to special interests and prove that he has an alt agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media wasnt trying to paint him as an outsider, they were trying to paint him as an IDIOT.  The system pays millions on sponsored ads that are all over the internet/social media that basically try to showcase Trump as thats bumbling idiot who can't even sip from a glass without dribbling on himself.  And honestly, a LOT of people bought it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again- is he corrupt?  More than likely, yeah.  But was this WHOLE thing just the media and system practicing reverse psychology?  I think its highly unlikely and i don't see how people can be SO sure that it was just that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think their funds and time would be better spent trying to simply establish contingency plans in the event that Trump won, rather than playing this ridiculous game of "lets pretend we are going one way all in, but really be going the other".  It was a close race in the end, too - so if it didn't matter to them who won, it would be stupid to waste money trying to sway it either way

       My confirmation bias senses are tingling.. In a world where it was attempted to place HRC on the throne, exactly what would've occurred has occurred in the media. The only reason to assume otherwise would be a vast underestimation of TPTB's power through technocracy. It's possible, but I imagine there are simply too many variables/unknowns to orchestrate success with who will actually come out and vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason why I think this is false is that it seems to be strictly bad for TPTB for trust in MSM to drop which has happened as a result of the tactics during this election. Also Trumps' kids talking about wikileaks supported this for me.

       FOX wasn't against him.  Limbaugh, Hannity, Ingraham, Savage weren't against him. This community and the broader infowars-Brietbart-wikileaks community wasn't against him.  Whoever gave him debate questions was on his side.  Russia certainly wasn't against him and boosted the exposure of those other sources.  The Macedonians played a role too.  You say he isn't corrupt but we don't actually know because he wouldn't release his taxes or even outline all his business interests.  Trump University was clearly a scam and he has already used the office to further his personal business interests.

       To put it in a very simple manner, he is taking the leadership role from an angle that "it is OK to have pride in your country and love your flag and everything that it stands for".  The biggest problem that our country has right now ISNT that our leaders are corrupt as fuck; its that Americans stand more divided than ever before, to the point where people are willing to hurt/kill each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are united and educated as a people, it doesnt matter what our leadership does; we can work together to bring them down and enact change, because despite all their money and power THEY NEED US.

       When I listened to Trump and Hillary speak, there was a stark difference: regardless of what the media tells you, Trump's campaign message was a message of unity as Americans.  But it felt like everything that came from Hillary and her camp was about color, sex, wealth, red/blue, left/right, ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw Trump supporters trying to educate their peers (red pilling), but meanwhile hillary supporters were making accusations of racism if anybody disagreed with them (they wouldnt even make an argument for their side!)
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump is corrupt and intends to destroy the country, so be it - but it would be really stupid to run on the platform of uniting the people and reviving classic America, and then turning against the people that you just empowered; makes no sense to me.  And it is much better than the other candidate that was willing to sell out the country and ran her campaign with divisive messages that were geared towards alienating groups of people from one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, we cant count on the government at all.  All we have is each other.  One candidate seemed to understand that, while the other was clearly trying to undermine it

       I agree with you to an extent, but where I disagree is that you put so much faith in Trump. I admire your desire for change in this country, but as a fellow conspiracy subredditor, I would encourage you to keep your eyes open to what Trump does, not just what he says. I am hoping he will prove me wrong, but if he really is a conman then he would have said anything to the people he "empowered" just to get into the most powerful seat in this country and run his own personal interests and the interests of his billionaire friends.

       I don't think having "faith" is a problem.  Everybody in this country should have some faith in our new leader, simply because nobody knows FOR SURE that he is absolutely going to go against his word.  If nobody has faith, we might as well not even have a leader (which, despite the tendency of government to be corrupted, i believe leadership is good).
      </p>
      <p>
       And believe me- I HATE HRC; i was praying she would lose.  But I was also bracing for her victory.  And as much as i hated her and believed that she was corrupt, there were still a lot of people supporting her.  And that says SOMETHING. I think when you lose, you are still an American and need to find a way to rally with the other side a bit and have a bit of hope and faith that your leadership will guide you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if I am done being gooey- what we really need is to be realistic, logical and wary.  We have to be ready at all times to be fucked over, regardless of who our leadership is.

       Fair enough. I absolutely hate HRC too. I'm not defending her. When Trump won, I was  fractionally happy that he won, not necessarily because I supported him, but rather I saw it as an end to the Clinton/Bush dynasties. I know that a lot of people on this sub, if not most, hate her and the system, so it makes me a little disappointed that many people here will probably continue to support Trump even if he fucks us all over in the end. I'm just hoping people will keep their eyes open, so that if Trump does fuck us over, this sub will be ready. That's all I'm concerned about. But like I said before, I hope he does prove me wrong, but with the appointees he's been selecting, my hope is quickly diminishing.

       Roger that. Love Trump, but I will be at the chopping block if he doesn't fight for this country as promised. OP, you shouldn't jump to conclusions and lump all Trump supporters together as ignorant. Contrary to popular belief, we are some of the most red-pilled people on Reddit, even if we are wrong about Trump. It's not like there was a better choice, so for know we will support him. Don't forget that you have been wrong on more than one occasion.

       No, the media and the establishment divided us.  Empowering people to kill law enforcement, accepting illegal immigration, injecting racism and sexism into every argument, and painting trump as some cliche rich guy drama villain character who hates blacks and women.

       There is much to attack Trump on, racist and sexist are not any of them. All I can think is you have not watched any Trump rallies or even seen the Project Veritas tapes.

      <p>
       If you don't like Trump, look in to his history, there is much to attack him on but hating certain races and genders are nonsense. You realize his campaign manager was even a woman right? THe first woman in history to run a successful presidential campaign.

       His stance on illegal immigrants (people) and his stance on Muslims is what I am against, so far basically his stance on anyone considered a minority. Im sure you know about his new secretary of state. MAD DOG, what are your thoughts as a trump supporter? I know old white veterans, their exact words and ive heard from multiple men I respect but dont agree with, kill them all. Mattis sounds just like one of them

       Firstly, you wish to label me as a "Trump supporter", I voted for Trump as he was better than the alternative. I would suggest, as someone that was once on the left, you drop the monolith approach. Perhaps you do not realize you do it but it's a cancer where you treat everyone the same so it is easy to disregard their views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, you are confused, Trump has not revealed who he picked for Secretary of State yet, Mattis was nominated for Sectary of Defense. As I worked as intelligence analyst, I can say he seems like a typical general, what triggers you is his nickname clearly and you don't know how he got it yet take it literally and use it to infer recklessness. What you clearly do not know is that Mattis was appointed by Obama to be the commander of US Central Command previously, Sec of Defense is a just a promotion from that position. I prefer him to Robert Gates, Bushes old Sec of Defense which Obama kept on in his first term.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am against illegal immigration, the answer to why is in the name. I am perfectly happy with legal immigration, which I think is a fair solution to all. I'm an atheist and think all religion is quite strange and damaging, as I still have a left viewpoint I am against some tenants of Islam, it's a far right ideology that badly needs a reformation. I think women are equal to men for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       However Trump's remarks about banning Muslims from entering the US until things can be figured out is unconstitutional and unhelpful but is not without

       From what you have said it is almost a gurantee that you voted for him. I was right. Sometimes Stereotypes work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump nominated him, what triggers me is not his nickname, its this quote "It’s fun to shoot some people", obama did appoint him, then removed him if im not mistaken
      </p>
      <p>
       How much do you know about the process of legal immigration? Do you think its as easy as going to local courthouse and paying a fine? Or do you have an idea of the years a person can be in the process? I dont mean 2 years, I mean 7+ waiting and hoping. Obama's dream act and daca did wonders for friends of mine and Trump isnt a fan of either practice. Not all muslims are evil infidel killing swine

       This is why you lost, you want to put people in baskets and stereotype them. It doesn't work, clearly. Sorry you got all upset and resort to personal attacks, I expected it of course but still disappointing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously this is wasted on you, however, I will explain it: If you do not like immigration laws, then work to get them changed, this is how democracy works. Stamping your feet about how unfair they are isn't going to change them.

       You are confused again, no one said they were, you are just triggered as you lost the argument and resort to the "racist" card. This is exactly why I no longer say I am on the left, it lost the art to argue and uses identity politics and straw men. I know many Muslims, all good people but I still think their religion (as with all other religions) are nonsense.

       They don't want to kill them all lol.  Thats preposterous.  What they want and what we need is stricter vetting.  It really has nothing to do with looking at illegal immigrants as if they are not
       <em>
        people
       </em>
       ; it has everything to do with the fact that they are illegal and it is the law and it is paramount to the security of our nation to mitigate the inflow of masses of people pouring in that may or may not have bad intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The better solution is to strongly vet and limit who gets in, but provide resources internationally to help these people
       <em>
        where they are
       </em>
       , or where they wind up.  Thats my opinion anyway

       Yea, you are correct.  Im not that versed in it, to be honest.  But Trump acknowledged several times that the legal system of becoming a citizen is flawed and it puts people who trying to do the right thing at a severe disadvantage.  He wants to reform it.  He brought this very topic up in just about every single one of his rallies

       Again- these people are all about money and power.  They invested hundreds of millions (did they get into billions?) into this campaign, and they basically put their reputation (their VOICE) on the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they secretly wanted Trump to win, it would have just been easier/cheaper/more straightforward for them to actually talk about Hillary's crimes and vilify her, thereby propping up Trump.  The media LARGELY ignored any of Hillary's and the CF criminal activity, and still does.

       I dont think his hands are truly tied tho. He is still having a pretty good game sense tho. He appointed his side from the begining, while start to turn some of the ones that's in the circle to join his side (of course he isnt gonna think about the US folks, but still........) and also throwing smoke bombs to mask his true power.

       At this point everyone could agree that this guy isnt some low-blow weaklings that doesnt know how to fight the shadow war. He is a very tough nut to crack and having A LOT of unplayed card in his own hand. He probably surprised all of us. That said, however the fight ends, the revolution is about to happened in the West.

       I understand that - but there ARE people in this world who have accumulated personal wealth and power without any interference or assistance from an entity.  You basically believe that there is a zero chance that they underestimated the public and the public's reaction to Trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not saying Trump isn't corrupt in his own ways; but I don't see how anybody in this sub is SO certain that Trump was a plant and the media and system reaction to him was all completely staged.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to be fair, if you are willing to make that assertion that Trump was absolutely a plant and secretly propped up by the media, then you should also consider the possibility that Trump could be sponsored from a totally different (maligned?) entity and the media really was trying to do everything they could to stop him and they failed.  All I'm saying is people on here are wayy too sure about their theory, and they forget that they are just theories

       At least with Trump winning, I have some level of faith that "the system" is not completely and utterly corrupt. I honestly thought Hillary as Prez was a forgone conclusion whether or not she received a single legitimate vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The American people" put that buffoon into office. Trump's presidency will probably be remembered in history as a giant "fuck you" to Hillary Clinton, rather than for anything that occurs during his administration.

       Arebyou retarded or being a reputation management agent? The media was objectively not against him, as they gave him plenty of air time, and all of his policies, the ones that will actually happen and matter, are all establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, he will be renewing the Patriot Act, expanding the NSA, not abolishing the Fed, infringing on the Second, and loves Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can any non establishment person be for any ONE of those things?
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. he can't.

       Don't call me retarded when you are literally just theorizing about what happened - you don't KNOW what happened, just the same as me.  And I don't know where you saw that he was abolishing the second amendment - that was never his policy or angle.  And i don't even know about the other ones you said, but you didnt back any of them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media gave him lots of air time, but it was all negative.  Hillary got a lot of air time and sponsorship time all over social media and it was all positive.  Personally, I think it is likely that Trump is corrupted in ways, but i don't buy the reverse psychology angle at all

       Correct and agreed.  This means that the system we have right now in the U.S. needs to get brought down because this system is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       one that honors the constitution and most definitely does NOT honor all people equally.

       That is a strong claim I wouldn't want to bank on.

       Things are only going to get worse in the long term (automation meaning less people needed to do the same amount of work) with regards to employment.

       The system you have right now is going to need something to replace it in the foreseeable future, otherwise your looking at a new demographic similar to Japan hitting your shores.

       At the end of the day, it seems to me that integrity and honor are the real deciding factors as to whether a system works or not - not so much its size.  I've no problem with a larger centralized system if it's a good and fair and just one.  If there is honesty, integrity, and honor, then even a large system will work.  If there isn’t, however, then even small, localized systems will fall apart and not work.

       I know this is going to raise some hackles on this thread, but "Trump being part of the Establishment" [meaning: He's rich] isn't remotely comparable to Hillary Clinton's government corruption and pedophile ties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry. I know that there's a certain subset of Reddit that likes "moral equivalency" but it's intellectually dishonest.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Okay, okay, true: The Clinton Foundation was an international racketeering organization that used pedophilia to blackmail world leaders and keep the bribes flowing into the Clintons' coffers . . . but . . . but . . . Trump had neckties made in Mexico."
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry: Not equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you claim it is, you're being childish and intellectually disingenuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I know if
       <em>
        feels
       </em>
       good to pretend that they're in the same league in terms of corruption, but Julian Assange himself said that they weren't. He asserted that there was no secret in Trump's background any worse than what was in the public sphere. Hillary, however, was a world-class criminal and pedophile. (She took 6 documented trips to buddy Jeffrey Epstein's Pedophile Island, and she raped Cathy O'Brien in the 1970s when Cathy was a girl.) If you've studied Pizzagate (and looked into the dark shit she and her "friends" are into) and you still claim that Trump's real estate course having 8 dissatisfied customers is just as bad, sorry: But your moral compass is severely out of whack.)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Footnote: Hillary's into Spirit Cooking, and witchcraft and all sorts of fucked up shit. Up until the Wikileaks disclosures, I thought her battiness was limited to seances from the 1990s where she tried to summon the spirit of Eleanor Roosevelt. (Google it.) But then the intelligence community was so disgusted by her that they started leaking emails to Wikileaks about the pedophile origins of the Clinton Foundation (which was co-founded by convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein), and all the pedophile parties John Podesta (Hillary's Chief of Staff) was going to. The more you scraped back the veil, you saw that these people were surrounded by pedos at every level. Then came Bill's 26 trips to Epstein's Pedophile Island. And Hillary's 6 trips. And now there's emerging evidence that "her crew" may be into child kidnapping, snuff films and cannibalism. You can't make this shit up. The kids they rape aren't just killed afterward, these sick fucks may be ritualistically eating them (to obtain powers from the god Moloch, or some such shit). These unhinged freaks actually believe in this batshit insane stuff. Hillary has all the symptoms of a disease cannibals in Borneo get called Kuru. Remember that lesion on her tongue? That's a symptom of Kuru. As is loss of balance, memory lapses, neurological impairment, and manic laughing, etc. (In Borneo, it's called "The Laughing Disease".) People who have it laugh inappropriately--like Hillary was doing all throughout the campaign. She's got all the symptoms of a fucking cannibal disease. See Kuru tongue lesion here:

       Trump has taken flights on Jeffery Epsteins Lolita Express. He has been friends witht eh Clintons for years. He is one of them...This is all a show. Whatever, glad you're here. Maybe you'll get into more conspiracies and we will all see about Trump. It was going be him or Clinton anyway. Cant blame you for getting into the game.

      <p>
       Just remember classic Clinton methodology:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clintons (knowing how damaged they are) tried to project scandals they had onto their opponent. (They've always done this.) After Hillary had her seizure on camera, she had her friends in the media run stories asking about Trump's health. (Anyone remember that? See CNN's article "Clinton's Health Fine, But What About Trump?"
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-health/">
        http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-health/
       </a>
       ) Likewise with Hillary's illegal campaign funding paid for by foreign heads of state [not only a violation of FEC regulations, but an actual violation of the law), Hillary tried to distract from her Saudi and Moroccan benefactors by crafting the whole "Trump is a Putin agent" narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example of this phenomenon was exemplified by Bill's decades of rapes. In a bid to try and neutralize that issue, Clinton surrogates paid women within the last 3 weeks of the campaign to claim Trump groped them. Wikileaks busted out the Craig's List ads that the Clinton Foundation put out months before for actresses. They straight-up said that it was to play the part of a "Trump-victim".
      </p>
      <p>
       Several of the women backed out after they initially agreed to participate (and one of them [a former contestant on the "Apprentice"] admitted that Gloria Allred offered her $500,000 to claim that Trump groped her. Google it.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But this whole enterprise was undertaken to confuse people who weren't paying close attention, and to make Trump disinclined to mention Bill's decades of rapes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how after the election all of Trump's accusers vanished in the mist?
      </p>
      <p>
       (Bill's haven't.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The same phenomenon was in play with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. After it came out that Epstein wasn't just a close Clinton friend, but that he came up with the idea for the Clinton Foundation (and was a co-founder), the Clintons knew they had a problem. News stories were breaking about Bill taking 26 flights with Epstein to Rape Island. (Hillary, it later developed, took 6.) As even the mainstream media was reporting on Epstein being the chief architect behind the Clinton Foundation (which is significant as hell when you learn later about Pizzagate and its pedophile dimension) the Clintons had to try and silence Trump about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Method?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as in every other one of their distraction gambits, they tried to do what psychologists call "Projection". They accused Trump of being the one who was friendly to Epstein because he was one of 10,000,000 people Trump knew back in New York. But Trump only knew him casually (meeting the convicted pedophile only a handful of times) when both men attended charity dinners, along with Snoop Dogg, Mohammed Ali and Mike Tyson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as Trump (as a showman) says diplomatic things about every celebrity and billionaire he knows, he said something about Epstein (before his pedophile scandal broke) like, "Yeah, I met him once. He's a nice guy."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton team ran with that, and tried to spin it into "See? Trump is buddies with Epstein, too. Just like the Clintons."
      </p>
      <p>
       Except he's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Epstein has zero to do with Trump's businesses (in stark contrast to his role in the Clinton Foundation as co-founder). See article "Billionaire sex offender Epstein once claimed he co-founded Clinton Foundation":
       <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/07/06/billionaire-sex-offender-epstein-once-claimed-co-founded-clinton-foundation.html">
        http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/07/06/billionaire-sex-offender-epstein-once-claimed-co-founded-clinton-foundation.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And Epstein was never a personal friend, or confidant of Trump's.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two men (as fellow billionaires) would occasionally be at the same charity fundraisers or dinners. (Trump would occasionally run into him like he occasionally ran into Bill Gates, or radio shock-jock Howard Stern, or Willis from "Diff'rent Strokes".)
      </p>
      <p>
       But as for Trump and Epstein, they never buddied around on a personal basis, nor is there any record of Trump ever riding on Epstein's airplane. (Why would he? Trump has his own private jet.)
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said: Wikileaks has all of Trump's personal information, and they straight-up said that there are no bombshell secrets about Trump. He was a hyper-busy [therefore hyper-boring] private citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       With his 592 businesses and hit TV show, he didn't have the leisure time of the Clintons to attend Spirit Cooking dinners, and attending seances to raise the ghosts of Eleanor Roosevelt or Gandhi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the contrast between Trump and Hillary was that Trump worked for a living. Hillary used the government to enrich herself, and (according to Wikileaks) worked roughly an hour a day . . . when she showed up at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       One person's schedule was jam-packed, and the other had lots of leisure time for stupid bullshit and perversion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summation: Trump made his wealth the old-fashioned way: In the private sector, by making things: Buildings, golf courses, hotels, etc. Hillary made her wealth through creating a racketeering organization packed with pedophiles, who threw pedophile parties (using Clinton influence to get heads of state and powerful people to attend) whereby they filmed them and blackmailed them. These blackmailed politicians would then steer lucrative contracts to friends of the Clinton Foundation (who would then give a cut . . . a service fee . . . to the Clintons.) The Foundation was not just tied into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann (and thousands of other children), but into the pedophile scandals that rocked Washington DC [with Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert] to the pedophile scandals that hit the UK, the Netherlands, and most recently Norway. (Google the stories from last week, regarding Norway.) Heads of state in Italy, France, and a number of other countries are also implicated (but thus far have managed to stay ahead of the shitstorm). But just barely. As new developments emerge every day, they get more and more nervous (and more and more suspicious deaths are occurring as these people try to cover their tracks). But make no mistake: The "Clinton" Foundation is not really the
       <em>
        Clinton
       </em>
       Foundation. It's the Epstein Foundation, with Bill and Hillary as front people because they had access to powerful people and a massive rolodex. The Foundation was actually Epstein's idea, and it was Epstein who provided the initial lawyers and paperwork to put it together. The Clintons are probably as blackmailed as the other heads of state, with pedophiles Epstein and John Podesta being the real powers behind the throne.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As I understand it Trump and Epstein had a kind of friendship, mostly though from what I think, a friendship where Epstein goes to Mar-a-Lago and spends some time there talking with Trump or someone when he was still allowed in. I somewhat think that if Epstein was/is a part of Mossad or the forces that seeks to gain dirt on a lot of people they would want to go after Trump

       Not to put too fine a point on this issue, but you have to remember that the classic Clinton tactic is the "But-My-Enemies-Do-It-Too" strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Clinton was busted for Monica Lewinski in the 1990s, he had surrogates flood the news cycle with "newly discovered assertions that Thomas Jefferson impregnated a slave girl". The press was rife with "But other Presidents had scandals, too".
      </p>
      <p>
       After the Jeffrey Epstein scandal broke and three underaged girls signed affidavits in the Miami-Dade County Sheriff's Office about Bill Clinton sleeping with them, the DNC swung into action to manufacture a similar scandal for Trump. Thus began the saga of "Katie Johnson," who charged Trump with raping her as a 13 year-old decades earlier. "Katie Johnson" took the strange step of waiting many years to air this claim (even while Trump was an extremely famous figure with a Top-Ten rated TV show), waiting only till he ran for President. She also took the strange decision to not file the charge in a criminal court, but in a civil court. (Why? Because criminal courts demand actual proof. Civil courts have a lower threshold. For, instance, I can go down to a civil court this instant and claim that you assassinated John F. Kennedy, and I can sign my name Winston Churchill. ESQ on the complaint.)
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's why I put the name "Katie Johnson" in quotes. It was a phony name. Furthermore the phony accuser used a fake phone number and an address that led to a building that had been abandoned for decades. Because it was so clearly fraudulent, the judge threw it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Miss Johnson" then re-filed the claim in three other courts--all with the same result.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the fake scandal was leaked to sympathetic elements in the media with ties to the Clinton campaign, and a whisper-campaign began to try and equalize this bogus claim with Bill Clinton's more-substantive (and well-documented) real cases of rape and sexual assault.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was around this time that phony claims that Trump may have been on the Lolita Express were floated around. Claims that were never substantiated.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Why would you have to substantiate them? The charge should be enough, right?)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like witchcraft in the Middle Ages. Just to make the charge at all should be enough to ruin someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Or so they thought.)
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, the whole "Katie Johnson" strategy collapsed, and an actress that the DNC dug up to try and appear on camera with Gloria Allred backed out and vanished into the Ether.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point in this? To date, no one has ever produced a plane manifest with Trump on Epstein's jet, or any records of him ever visiting Pedophile Island.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shockingly, among the island's many celebrity guests was none other than scientist Stephen Hawking. See him in the photo here:

       This article sums up my thoughts on Trump. It seems like Trump may not have been involved but it also seems like he was much closer to a dude that owns a pedophile island than i would like. He has said hes a great guy and acknowledged his taste for younger girls in 2002. He has been to business events and dinner parties. Now even if Trump
       <em>
        did not
       </em>
       fly on his plane, i highly doubt he wasnt aware that this guy had a sex island.... He absolute could never have been involved.... He's still much more involved with Eckstein than i would prefer.

       Fair point and certainly suspect. However, when Epstein isn't taking children to his island, he does actually conduct business.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you purchased weed from a dealer who also molest kids, would you want people thinking your a pedo just because you bought weed from one?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you have evidence that Trump went to the Island, at best you have a theory of what he might be involve in because he was on a plane that has been used on other occasions for nefarious pedo shit.

       True, but with Trumps love for younger women it really wouldn't surprise me. I'm just tired of people pretending Trump is just like buddy in the country that works in a coal mine and pays his daughters college. Trump has been privileged and connected his entire life. He is not one of us lol.

       Lol, I wouldn't be completely surprised, but it'd be unexpected. Heck I'm 34 and dating a 26 year old. However, an 18 year old looks like a small child to me and I have no interest in them. Yes Trump has been privileged his entire life, more than we can imagine. But he has also worked very hard to get where he is. He started higher than us, and he worked hard to get even higher. My girlfriends parents immigrated here from China and work in construction and at the post office, their daughter(my girlfriend) is a bio-technician student finishing her masters and eventually Phd. Point is, while he may have started higher than most of will ever get, he also worked hard to get much higher than he started.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think most people think he is like a coal miner paying his daughters college by any means, but I acknowledge that he has worked tirelessly to get much higher than where he started and the fact that he started so high doesn't undermine that fact.

       the fact that you even give validity to this political system puts you and your upvoters in the same class of people we are going to have to save after you allow it (by your inaction and faith in a system that does not work) to destroy the entire planet.

       You're not going to get any argument from me. You're 100% right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yours is the adult position. (It's the unrealistic, idealist's position.) But it's still the
       <em>
        adult
       </em>
       position.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem?
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't an adult world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pascal had this great quote that always remained with me. I can't remember his exact words, but it was to the effect of: "Any government based on the assumption that people will be noble, kind and generous will be very ill-founded indeed. It is safer to assume that people will be greedy, lazy and unjust. Any king who rules based on the premise of human weakness will rule for a long, long time."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's cynical, but it has a deeper understanding of human nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Built into that axiom is the knowledge that most human beings are lazy, that most people
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to follow a "leader".
      </p>
      <p>
       Human beings are pack animals, as a species. Like wolves (and other predatory species) they operate through coordination and leadership structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       That inclines the population to group-think.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Hence they'll always be easily manipulated by people assuming the [false] mantle of authority.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's why the most successful criminal syndicates mask themselves by pretend they're governmental (when they're not). Like the Federal Reserve. Most Americans assume this organization run by the banksters is part of the government (when it's not). That misapprehension is fostered by the cartel (and promoted by the media that the cartel owns and runs).
      </p>
      <p>
       The recent Pizzagate scandal showed the same methodology in usage. We learned that the Center for Missing and Exploited Children is NOT part of the government, but is run by a private group of people (who are almost certainly pedophiles themselves). The Wikileaks emails showed how Twitter is leaving pedophiles on its platform, who trade pictures. Their excuse for doing so? "It's part of a larger sting. We allow them up because we're secretly sending their photos to the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, who will then share it with the FBI."
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with that?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Center for Missing and Exploited Children isn't sharing the material with the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're keeping it for themselves. (And these very same pictures are ending up all over the world, in the sewers of the pedophile hubs of the Dark Web.)
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the same pedophiles with ties to Pizzagate and the Clinton Foundation are board members of the Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they rigged the system to funnel pedophile material to them (and to mask their activities by impersonating a governmental organization).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ordinary American citizens fall for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unscrupulous monsters understand how this passive human psychology works, and they know how to exploit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short: You're right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you're saying is right.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can only (as a species) advance out from the shadows of this horror-show by refusing to act like pack animals, and to evolve upward into thinking human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       By refusing the play along, we deny these monsters their power-base: i.e., the willing foot-soldiers who obliviously do the bidding of evil men.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we had the system you suggest, a Hitler could never have come to power. A Stalin could never have mass-murdered the people he did. A Mao in China could never have amassed the world's largest death-toll due to democide.
      </p>

       Sadly, the only thing you can do is act as a light to those around you: Train your children to be skeptics and questioners like you are.

       I agree with you. The only thing that stood out was that I dont think we need to drop that system entirely. im just saying lets redirect our efforts toward something more positive. We can still have people following good leaders instead of people following bad rulers. There is a difference.

       Ok this is interesting. But what about the south African president Mandela? That story systems to run counter to that ideology you just described. He didn't run his country based on that model, he went the other way and saw the good in people and that started to change people. Also I think Gaddafi also lead is people with good intentions. I think its better to assume that people are going to be good, because when you do that you create the very thing you set out to see in your world and in your mind. That ideology you just described is the fools way of looking at things because the world is only as good as you see it. We are traveling up in vibration with the planet earth and the universe. If you assume the worst in people you allow yourself and convince others to travel against the designs of the universe IMHO.

       Yes, I do write walls of text. (I'm a blowhard.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But let me add one last thing. (I was going to say this in my first write-up to you.) What you're really asking for is a revolution in consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the abolition of slavery. That happened for the first time in human history in the West. (Why the West? It was due to certain sociological and cultural conditions not found elsewhere in the world.) But the reality is: Slavery existed in all lands, in all times, among all cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the West, however, something happened to the people: a revolution of consciousness. Suddenly what was always accepted as normal by other races was suddenly questioned by Westerners. Due to the development of a pivotal concept [the Rights of Man] people eventually turned on what was an age-old institution that the rest of human accepted passively as a fact of reality: like gravity or magnetism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only in the West did people stop accepting the rationale that slavery was good for the economy, and set up an objection, saying, "I don't care if there's money in it; it's a moral evil."
      </p>
      <p>
       When enough people woke up, slavery was abolished.
      </p>
      <p>
       (While it still exists in Africa, the Near East and Asia . . . with more slaves existing globally in 2016 than in 1860 . . . it has been eradicated in the West.)
      </p>
      <p>
       That was due to a revolution in consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Not all humanity has caught up yet. And it will likely take millennia for it to be truly global.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact that the revolution started in the West is a beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're advocating is related to the same revolution in consciousness rooted in "The Rights of Man" [which was first adduced in 18th Century France].
      </p>
      <p>
       It is your claim that, as a free man, you refuse to be subject to cults of personality, religion-like dogmatism and the dictates of a fiction: The State.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is: You've made the leap in consciousness, while most in humanity haven't.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're ahead of the curve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your frustration will be that of the caveman who first came up with a conception of Time, while the rest of the clan saw reality as one long moment. "Why do you use past-tenses when you speak?" they ask you. "What is this future tense you use?"
      </p>
      <p>
       To them, you sound like a madman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, they'll come around.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, being part of the vanguard, you're in a lonely position.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I agree with you: I actually liked a lot of what Gadaffi did in Africa. His people had Africa's highest standard of living and only functioning economy. He was murdered because he wanted to pull the rest of the continent out of poverty by creating a gold-backed currency (that would free Africa from the Anglo-American banking grid). His people legitimately admired and liked him.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're right: It is possible for a leader to actually try and inspire a revolution in consciousness in his people.
      </p>
      <p>
       All
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       leaders do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The false leaders are the ones who want a dumbed-down population. The ones who want zombies, serfs. We learned that from the Wikileaks emails, that Hillary Clinton was calling for a more disengaged, uneducated populace. My jaw dropped when I saw her talking about it in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
       She openly said it (serene in the assurance that no one would ever read the emails).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the traditional leadership model: Kings and queens with uneducated, illiterate slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all our institutions are designed to keep it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       "A fool and their money are soon parted".
      </p>
      <p>
       All advertising is based on that premise. All corrupt government leadership is, too, as they try to separate "fools" from their money in the form of illegal taxation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I'm rambling again.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wanted to congratulate you for being part of the revolution of consciousness. Now get out there and wake up as many people as you can.

       In racaketeering scandals like this, rarely does such a wealth of emails and documentation surface to connect the dots like what we're seeing now. This is only happening because the Intelligence Community is disgusted and turning on these people. Hence they're leaking boatloads of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       In usual pedophile scandals, we don't get oodles of documentation like what we have here. This can only be happening because the NSA, CIA and FBI have turned on these monsters.

       Let's all agree on something: Anyone who is dumb enough to think that Trump and Clinton are somehow equivalent evils has no right telling other people what they should think. if Trump turns out to be a Luciferian Jesuit mole, I'll be the first to turn on him, and I'll have plenty of company...but I'm willing to give him a few months to prove himself first.

       They say the devil you know is better than the devil you don't, but I'm pretty sure "they" never met the Clintons, or the Pedostas, or any of these other sick, disgusting cocksuckers.

       His Dad was a real estate developer and left him an established business. Trump knows how to play the game including paying politicians and I'm sure others to get his way. I don't think he is some benevolent go loving man, but he isn't remotely comparable to Hillary based on what we have currently seen.

       Absolutely. A lot of his success was timing and partially luck. Things were much different in the 70-80's in Manhattan. Heck, things were much different pre-911 when I used to live in NY. I've been back a few years ago and so much has changed.

       Trump and Hillary are 19th cousins and are related just like every other president in american history. It's all a game. Trump is just charismatic as fuck and is a billionaire elite who has managed to somehow convince conspiracy theorists that he isn't elite and that he doesn't have connections to other powerful people and groups. Hell the man supported Hillary's presidential campaign in 2012 and they've been great friends going back decades and decades now he wants to throw her in jail? Give me a fucking break. You MAGAtards love to shit on Hillary but don't realize your political Jesus was and still will be her good friend.

       I hope you have proof and documentation. I know it is a stretch but Trump may have a plan in place to pardon Snowden and make him head of intelligence. He could be cool, pardon Assange, legalize pot, I am willing to give him a chance. Of course it is more likely that monkeys will fly out of my butt.

       Do you know anything about economics? Conservatives may hate weed, but they love money. If the price is ripe and the tax money is a better offer than the private prisions are offering then there is room to discuss legalizing it. It's mainly a financial decision at the end of the day.
If the Feds offered a million dollars to every gay marriage that a conservative state allowed, you better believe at least a few would reconsider strongly.

       When that happens, I'll believe you. Marijuana profits in legal states are pretty high, but you need to take the weed tourism into account. Tourism is a huge industry, and i doubt the profits would be that high were it not for the weed tourism craze

       Haha, if it were only that easy... Trust me, Trump's team will not allow pot to be legal. Trump was best friends with Chris Christie, a very well known anti pot politician. Trump has appointed and will appoint people who have their hands deep in the pockets of the pharmaceutical industry. Trump is a businessman, and knows very well how these things work

       Yes, it literally is that easy.

       Do you know why Trump hired Christie to be on his transition team?
      </p>
      <p>
       So Christie hires all of his cronies and Pence can round them all up and fire them so they know who to stay away from.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have no factual evidence that will happen. Its more likely to be legalized because Trump said it with his own words, which is all we can go on. I even believe he talked about rescheduling.

       And yet he has not yet acted and you are already judging. Look when the time comes if your right, then your right. But all your doing is speculating, and it's no different that Trump supporters that disagree.

       We will have all the evidence that is needed soon enough, once the rest of his cabinet takes shape.  But I'm guessing then apologists like yourself will probably fall back on the "4D chess!" or "keep your enemies close" lines of logic.  I suppose we'll see.  As it is he has already gone back on his word and filled some of his positions with lobbyists representing the establishment.  Tell me, how do you reconcile the inconsistencies between his choices thus far for cabinet and his claims to be an outsider?

       I don't think he is an outsider. I think he is further outside than a politician whos entire wealth was built on our tax dollars. He is it to make a profit and we will benefit in the process. He isn't completely selfless or doing this just for America, but in the process of bettering himself we will all have more than we would have had otherwise. Think of it as a big game hunt, the larger the deer he takes down the more meat on the bones there will be left for each person in line. It's impossible to predict why he has hired certain people and I admit there are a number of questionable things that he has done so far. But just because Goldman Sachs or another company is horrible, it doesn't  mean that every single person there is horrible. I work in Finance and I've worked for a number of "bad banks" but when the opportunity arose to work for a more ethical bank I left. Bottom line, it good to keep an eye on him, I for one will certainly be watching closely, however, speculating and trash talking is a bit premature at this point. Let's wait and see. As I've said from the beginning, If I'm wrong I have no qualms owning it.

       Evil is just a term used. Most people who run for president arent necessarily evil. Greedy, ignorant, and some evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that you have to have some sort of like narcissism to run for president. Some people apply their narcissism to positive things, but alot are just plain old narcissistic

       Narcissism can be good. Regardless of what i think, you have to have narcissism to want to be elected into a position of power.

       Are you claiming you have never done something evil? Better question something that someone else might say is evil?
 Lied to a girlfriend after cheating on her, and let her go crazy trying to catch you? Torture insects as a kid? 
BA in Psych, trust me nearly all of us are at least a tiny bit evil at one point or another, I've seen more than enough to accept this a fact. It's moral relativism unless worshipping satan. But who's to say satan isn't a swell guy, I mean god does sound pretty evil himself, and we have never heard satans side of the story. God created a  special place where you burn for eternity if you don't worship him, sounds evil to me.

       You're going off topic. Not everyone is evil. We all know what evil is, it's not lying to a girlfriend... It's manipulating populations into war for profit. It's killing innocent children with airstrikes to topple governments for their own benefit. It's poisoning food, water. Creating diseases, drugs to control and kill off the population.

       Let's show out like in South Korea. When that happens and nothing changes, then everyone will know what we say and want, does and has never mattered. Then, drastic things will have to happen. We are nothing but pawns. If we want to take our world back, yes, it will probably be violent.

       My take on it is he is apart of the establishment. On election night, I was quite shocked at the lead he had. Everything was setup for Hillary to win, the media knew it, and Hillary knew it. Then they gave it to Trump at the last second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports have stated that Hillary went crazy after she found out that Trump was going to win. In her "greenroom" reports of her attacking people and verbal abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       They got a better reaction from "the people" since Trump took it, they were in shock, they were pissed. The media had told them Hillary had it in the bag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look at the recount, and the electoral college bombardment. If they flip it back to Hillary once again, an even more monumental chaos and rioting will happen from the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I could be wrong. All we can do is theorize and wait...time will tell.

       Agreed. Stop mucking up the waters with false ideas that things are going to change by supporting more of the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way this is going to change is for people to refuse to consent to any laws or actions from any central government. U.S, and the crown are both acting like criminal organizations, they dont deserve any credibility. Work in your local areas to nullify all relationships with these governments. Democratic central governments rely exclusively on consent of the people, once a critical mass is reached that no longer support these institutions though taxes, or obeying its laws it becomes illegitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't win this game by playing by its rules. Petitioning central governments is a form of begging or complaining for them to stop do something they shouldn't even be able to do in the first place. We will continue to lose if we dont stay within our power:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Make claims, not complaints.
       </li>
       <li>
        Learn how to write notices in the capacity of a man and inquire about a: cause and b: findings of fact that gives a man the authority (interfere with your rights) to do what ever it is that man thinks he/she has the authority to do. (Getting the man behind the office on record forces that man to come out from behind his position and become liable for his or her actions if that action is illegal or something goes wrong.)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       They work for you, treat them like employees not rulers. If you ran a company would you really have any regard for a request for feedback from an employee? They are using an institution you created to wrong you and every other owner of the company, take action by demanding an account for these actions and then use it against any man or woman that cant prove they have said authority, see what happens.

       Thanks to the Russians for their tireless work during the past few years in exposing corruption among America's oligarchs through alternative media, but no country is immune to these problems. The Russian Communist Revolution was financed by elite bankers, and millions of Christians were killed in the USSR during the 20th Century. Look into the Camp Artek abuse scandals for a peek into Russian pizzagate culture. Mankind is corrupt and we cannot save ourselves. God's only son, Jesus Christ, will truly "drain the swamp", when he returns to judge this world, and we must place faith in Jesus for our salvation through forgiveness of our sins.

       I absolutely agree that Trump is a part of the establishment but i'm also almost certain that he competitively turned his back on them and then proceeded to destroy them at their own game, by using the discontent of mainland USA. For now i think he's pandering to them in order to actually make it alive for his inauguration, where the real games will start being played.

       The evidence is out in the open. It's not hidden. It's no secret. If you've been paying attention to Trump since he's been in the public eye, you would know he has connections with so many businesses and politicians. When is he going to drain the swamp?

       First of all, there isn't anyone talking about the CIA, FBI, or NSA.  Why are you including those in this? It's about Wall St and political parties, not the intelligence/law enforcement community.  Stop lumping them in with bankers for the sake of trying to make your argument more palatable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also your "well everyone in banking or Goldman Sachs can't be corrupt" isn't proof in any way, shape or form that those involved with Trump aren't themselves corrupt.  Your suggestion that they aren't is just as naive and ignorant as the people you are crying about who are saying they are.

       And as for the "not everyone in banking is corrupt" comment is more than likely true. Not every banker or person whos worked for Goldman Sachs is evil. And although i cant prove this 100 percent, lets use some common sense.

       Would you rather he make them enemies? It's called negotiating. Good people can become bad and vice versa. It all depends on what's on the table. Time will tell, so lets watch and see what happens. There is no point speculating. Even Soros(fucking wretched) has done good things when he benefited from it. Additionally, Goldman Sachs has a huge number of people, are they literally the exact same people as Hillary, or merely from the same company?

       Evil is just a term used. Most people who run for president arent necessarily evil. Greedy, ignorant, and some evil.

       The point is that you have to have some sort of like narcissism to run for president. Some people apply their narcissism to positive things, but alot are just plain old narcissistic

       I don't think having "faith" is a problem.  Everybody in this country should have some faith in our new leader, simply because nobody knows FOR SURE that he is absolutely going to go against his word.  If nobody has faith, we might as well not even have a leader (which, despite the tendency of government to be corrupted, i believe leadership is good).
      </p>
      <p>
       And believe me- I HATE HRC; i was praying she would lose.  But I was also bracing for her victory.  And as much as i hated her and believed that she was corrupt, there were still a lot of people supporting her.  And that says SOMETHING. I think when you lose, you are still an American and need to find a way to rally with the other side a bit and have a bit of hope and faith that your leadership will guide you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if I am done being gooey- what we really need is to be realistic, logical and wary.  We have to be ready at all times to be fucked over, regardless of who our leadership is.

       Fair enough. I absolutely hate HRC too. I'm not defending her. When Trump won, I was  fractionally happy that he won, not necessarily because I supported him, but rather I saw it as an end to the Clinton/Bush dynasties. I know that a lot of people on this sub, if not most, hate her and the system, so it makes me a little disappointed that many people here will probably continue to support Trump even if he fucks us all over in the end. I'm just hoping people will keep their eyes open, so that if Trump does fuck us over, this sub will be ready. That's all I'm concerned about. But like I said before, I hope he does prove me wrong, but with the appointees he's been selecting, my hope is quickly diminishing.

       lol the FBI and all the other people monitoring this sub just took notes about your post here and are salivating over calling you an extremist and stuff, they will probably include your post in some presentation they give to their bosses about the online extremism boiling over on the internet and 'what they need to do to protect us from it'.

       for the record I disagree with you and I think the current social system in the US is the best in the world and should never be replaced by anything. thanks.  the government of the US is the best and anyone who disagrees is wrong.

       This is an opinion. You have stated no evidence to support your claim anymore that those who say he will. Bottom line, you disagree and that's ok. But don't claim that you are omnipotent.

       Are you claiming you have never done something evil? Better question something that someone else might say is evil?
 Lied to a girlfriend after cheating on her, and let her go crazy trying to catch you? Torture insects as a kid? 
BA in Psych, trust me nearly all of us are at least a tiny bit evil at one point or another, I've seen more than enough to accept this a fact. It's moral relativism unless worshipping satan. But who's to say satan isn't a swell guy, I mean god does sound pretty evil himself, and we have never heard satans side of the story. God created a  special place where you burn for eternity if you don't worship him, sounds evil to me.

       Thats more of what I've been worried about with Trump. I don't see his agenda being the same war hawk plan as Hillary's. I think he'd like to lay groundwork to favor his own businesses down the road.

       Both of you are arguing points you can't prove.  You have no idea what TPTB's intentions actually were because you're not one of them.  And if you think they are so stupid that they would continue using the media to 'attack' Trump despite the fact that it was very obviously only helping his popularity then you are vastly underestimating them.  Do you think they are drooling retards who can't tie their shoes properly? Because even someone of that level of intellect could see that the end result of the medias actions was benefiting Trump..

       We will have all the evidence that is needed soon enough, once the rest of his cabinet takes shape.  But I'm guessing then apologists like yourself will probably fall back on the "4D chess!" or "keep your enemies close" lines of logic.  I suppose we'll see.  As it is he has already gone back on his word and filled some of his positions with lobbyists representing the establishment.  Tell me, how do you reconcile the inconsistencies between his choices thus far for cabinet and his claims to be an outsider?

       Yup, clear as day, they were giving him exposure to help him round up people disgruntled with politicians/rhetoric/the government, so that no matter what it's TPTB vs TPTB come election time. CTR is very much alive, and now they're pushing the "Trump is going to save the day; disregard his connections to the elites, to the lolita express, and him filling his cabinet with swamp men".
