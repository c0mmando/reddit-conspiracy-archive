       With a lot of people seemingly in denial to even accept the possibility that a giant pedophilia ring pervasive throughout the "elites" can exist, let me remind you what happened in South Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       President Park Guen-Hye (PGH), daughter of dictator Park Jung-Hee, was elected president under very suspicious circumstances, including voter suppression and denial of recounts.  She was criticized most heavily for Sewol Ferry incident, where hundreds of high school kids were trapped inside a sinking ship and died; in particular, she was "unreachable" for 7 hours, and no one, not chief of staff, chief of security, secretary, could provide info on where she was.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this in mind, let's start from the beginning.  There was a big outrage at Ehwa University, a prestigious university (Korea's college admission competition is
       <em>
        insane
       </em>
       ), over a special treatment of a student named Jung Yu-Ra.  Yu-Ra was given full marks on her grades despite never showing up to class, doing work, or passing tests.  Her colleagues found out about it, did some digging, and learned that Yu-Ra was granted admission under equestrian scholarship, something that has never been given before.  Seeing something is off, students began digging deeper, and found out about Choi Sun-sil, Yu-Ra's mother.
      </p>
      <p>
       Students discovered Sun-sil and started digging on her, since not anybody could pressure a president of a prestigious university to do her bidding, and found her laptop full of confidential information and presidential speeches.  Connection was made to the president, and this blew up to be a national issue.  Choi Sun-sil was found to have stolen millions of tax money from the government as well as forcing megacorps in Korea like Samsung to accomodate her based on her friendship with the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are certain similarities already here, including the absurd reason as to how the investigation was begun, the method of investigation (crowd-sourcing), and tenuous connections that would have been deemed as conspiracy has there not been any proof.  Thankfully for the Koreans, irrefutable evidence to prove this survived and came to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, my main point is not these smaller/minor similarities, but on something much bigger (and sinister) related to PizzaGate: sacrificing (or blood-farming) babies for youth.  A recent investigative journalism program brought into light President PGH's secret life: illegal medical procedures for anti-aging.  PGH and Choi Sun-Sil were found to visit certain VIP-only hospitals that administered unauthorized stem cell injections (and god knows what else) for anti-aging purposes, and it is highly likely that PGH was in middle of her "treatment" when Sewol Ferry incident broke, and that's why she couldn't appear in public for 7 hours, due to swelling after injection that is generally taken care of by hours of massaging.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, there is one more parallel to draw: occultism.  These pedophile rings were theorized to be connected to satanic (or occult) groups.  Choi Sun-Sil's father was an incredibly popular cult leader during Park Jung-Hee's dictatorship; the friendship between the two were strong.  There are no evidence (that I am aware of) that gives insight to the cult's rituals and secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        tl;dr
       </strong>
       : Daughter of a giant cult leader was found to have everyday effect on decision-making of the president of South Korea, with both of them attending exclusive hospitals to receive illegal medical procedures to reverse aging process.

       that was a nice breakdown.  I hadn't heard about the crowd sourced student investigation, no wonder they don't talk about it much in western media; it represents everything they fear.
tl;dr "...and I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for those meddling kids"

       "following Cheryl Mills-can link to Clinton/Haiti/S Korean SAE-A Trading Co/ CEO  James Ha/ can some anon link him or company to Park Geun-hye, the soon to be removed cultist in charge of S Korea?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Can`t believe this- Did some research this morning about Cheryl Mills- I linked her to Haiti where she was involved with the Clinton Foundation building an industrial complex in the Northern part. The main company there is -S Korean SAE-A Trading Co/ CEO  James Ha- They sew clothes for places like Walmart-the pay listed was less than 4 dollars a day- Am trying to link this company to Park Geun-hye. Anyone out there care to help?
      </p>
      <p>
       A revelation!- Are we nothing but a bunch of slaves being bred to serve the elite? The deeper I dig into this, I find more and more credible leads going in all directions. The money being funneled out of the economy for personal use is incredible. All my life I was told I could be anything I want- I now realize that it was ok to do what I wanted as long as it fit their agenda. Fake news? Propaganda. Failing economy? Not for the elite. Prosecution under the law? Yea right. I have seen over 50 years of subtle manipulation with the past 15 in overdrive. This shit is going to blow up in their crooked faces.

       That being said, I couldn't find any links between the founder and his bloodline to PGH.  The only speculation I can make,
       <em>
        if there were any connection
       </em>
       , is Sae-A's start and success in 1960s, which was when PGH's father and dictator Park Jung-Hee ruled.   However, it is entirely possible (actually likely) that PJH helped Sae-A, he was certainly capable and also known to the old guys for bringing economic prosperity under dictatorship (a lot of beautification).  Now, if above is true, then PGH might have ties to Sae-A.

        This is a really far fetched conspiracy without a speck of evidence

       Very interesting connections indeed. I spent a week in South Korea this year right after that college had a protest by the students on this very subject. The police had gone out there to suppress the protestors. This only emboldened their desire to seek justice. At the time that I was there, I had no idea that this was so big, so it's very interesting to see the protests now because only four months ago everything was relatively peaceful there.

       Well the story broke like, 6/7 weeks ago?  There have been protests ever since.  And btw, even now, it is still "peaceful".  The protesters worked extremely hard to keep the protests organized and peaceful, to rebut any excuse that the government can throw to shut it down.  However, it is more like the peace before the storm, as the Parliament is voting on impeachment on friday, I believe.  Either Koreans will rejoice and gain faith in the government (a little) or there
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       be a revolt.

       This is a rather unstable time in history all around. Not to say that isn't the norm, but it seems to be happening all over the place right now due to worldwide corruption. I hope good things come from all this truth output and people wake up to create a healthier and more positive chapter in human history.

       Couldn't read all but seems to have a fair summary on PGH and CSS relationship, including the cult.  As for the stem cell one, I saw it on the Korean investigative TV show 그것이 알고싶다 (literal translation: We'd like to know it - "it" could mean answer, truth, etc).  Don't know if there's an English version out :(

       Interesting that there are 8 "largest" tycoons.  The laptop mentions "8 Goddesses (8선녀)".  The 8 Goddesses is/was actually one of the biggest and one of the most lowkey consipracy in Korea, dating back to the beginning of modern Korea after fall of Josun.  Numerous low-level politicians and military members were apparently locked away and ridiculed for mentioning 8 people running the country.
      </p>

       Somehow mentions of this was erased entirely from the discourse, with all the attention on PGH and CSS.  CSS is confirmed to be one of the 8.

       Hmm, my mistake I guess, although I always assumed satanism to be under the umbrella of occultism?  Besides, the cult was pseudo-Christian, so I wouldn't put satanism too far...
