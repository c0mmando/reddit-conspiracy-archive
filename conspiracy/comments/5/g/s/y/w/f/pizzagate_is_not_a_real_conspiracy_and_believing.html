<p>People, pizzagate is <em>the</em> conspiracy. Don&#39;t believe that the majority of people are against you, or that almost no-one believes the pizzagate story, like I said - this is psychological warfare.

    <div class="md"><p>Probably just coincidence that a Department of Justice prosecutor whose specific wheelhouse is handling child trafficking and child porn cases liked the most questionable of the posts on alephantis&#39; instagram, right?  Just coincidence that Clinton speechwriters own the bookstore &quot;politics and prose&quot; down the street, and across the street there is a non-profit charity called beyond borders proclaiming to combat child sex-trafficking in Haiti, of all places.  Probably just coincidence that Clinton herself was proven, through the wikileaks emails, to be personally involved in the pardon of Laura Silsby who allegedly was caught trying to grab 33 sum-odd kids out of that very same disaster-stricken country, most of whom weren&#39;t even orphans.  Probably just coincidence that Podestas emails refer so much to pizza out of context, and that there are articles from years ago about his and his brother&#39;s weird taste in artwork.  Probably just a figure of speech when they were referring to the torture chamber in their own home.  Probably not unusual that there are proven to exist TUNNELS under these businesses.  Probably not weird that Alephentis has been caught in a lie about the existence of a basement under his business, and that there used to be controversial artwork on the walls depicting strange acts with children.  The video of majestic ape speaking at Sasha Lord&#39;s (a woman who self-proclaims to work with at-risk kids and books most of her events at comet ping-pong) is TOTALLY normal nothing to bat an eye at there.  Should I keep going?  The evidence is circumstantial, yes, but it is more than enough cause for reasonable suspicion, which is the central pillar of any serious investigation.  This is a serious investigation, you cannot refute it just by saying &quot;fake news&quot;.  I resent you so much.  </p>

<p>edit: oh and spirit cooking that&#39;s normal practice too.  And alephentis&#39; name translating to I love children.</p>

<p>more: Oh its just a coincidence that the Podesta bros don&#39;t even deny their connections to convicted pedophiles Dennis Hastert and Jeffery Epstein and that they appear in Epstein&#39;s butler&#39;s little black book, along with the Clintons, other politicians (including Trump), famous Hollywood and music industry icons.</p>

<p>More for <a href="/u/truth_kills">/u/truth_kills</a>: Someone is going to unearth the hard evidence and then there won&#39;t be enough money in the world to pay people to cover this up.  Rot in hell.</p>

<p>Also watching the vote count on this comment is hilarious.  Doesn&#39;t have enough alternate accounts to downvote the truth.</p>

<p>Which posts do you think are most questionable? Who is it that liked these images?</p>

<p>Just coincidence that Clinton speechwriters own the bookstore &quot;politics and prose&quot; down the street, and across the street there is a non-profit charity called beyond borders proclaiming to combat child sex-trafficking in Haiti, of all places. </p>

<p>These are two separate places. They may be close to each other but that doesn&#39;t make them connected. &quot;Politics and Prose&quot; seems like a good name for a bookstore in D.C.. The bookstore has to be somewhere, as does Beyond Borders. D.C. is a relatively small city, where would you like them to relocate to that would&#39;t be a problem? No matter where they go, there are bound to be other businesses in the area. </p>

<p>This is false. <a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf</a></p>

<p>&quot;In the course of a month, President Clinton brokered the release of all the missionaries, except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.&quot;</p>

<p>I am not sure Silsby is guilty of anything more than not following protocol here. Which is bad, but that doesn&#39;t mean she wasn&#39;t genuinely trying to help these kids, whom were mostly given voluntarily by their parents. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Probably just coincidence that Podestas emails refer so much to pizza out of context, and that there are articles from years ago about his and his brother&#39;s weird taste in artwork. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are two separate things entirely. There are a few references to pizza in the Podesta emails but none of them seem nefarious. Can you explain to me why you think Podesta talking about eating pizza is somehow a code that we can only find reference to on urban dictionary and 4Chan?</p>

<p>I love weird artwork too, doesn&#39;t make me a pedophile. Have you ever seen Ray Cesar&#39;s art? It&#39;s beautiful and disturbing. The way he creates these pieces and the detail he manages to put in is absolutely phenomenal. Was he abused as a child? Yes, these are his companions in his dream world. Shouldn&#39;t we celebrate his ability to find such an amazing outlet for his mental anguish? If I had the money I would own several pieces by him.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.raycaesar.com/">http://www.raycaesar.com/</a></p>

<p>Does this make me a bad person?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Probably just a figure of speech when they were referring to the torture chamber in their own home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I work from home, I can totally related to this email. It doesn&#39;t seem odd to me at all. Additionally, why would someone, with an actual torture chamber, use bizarre food code words for certain things but just come right out and say &quot;torture chamber&quot; in an email? Seems a valid question to me.</p>

<p>Sidenote: I have also referred to my children as entertainment to friends and family both in person and via text/FB.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Probably not unusual that there are proven to exist TUNNELS under these businesses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one I have to question outright. How was this proven? I haven&#39;t seen this in any of my reading about Pizzagate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Probably not weird that Alephentis has been caught in a lie about the existence of a basement under his business, and that there used to be controversial artwork on the walls depicting strange acts with children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you are lumping unrelated things together.</p>

<p>Is there a basement? Same with your previous statement. How was this proven? I am genuinely asking for evidence here.</p>

<p>The artwork, from what I have seen, seems like good provocative art. I am not sure there was a controversy over the artwork, prior to Pizzgate being a thing. Was it? Is there an evidence for this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The video of majestic ape speaking at Sasha Lord&#39;s (a woman who self-proclaims to work with at-risk kids and books most of her events at comet ping-pong) is TOTALLY normal nothing to bat an eye at there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will have to track this video down. Can you tell me anything about why you think it&#39;s a problem or somehow connected with Pizzagate? I don&#39;t recall Podesta being involved with this band in any way. booking events at a favorite location seems a smart thing to do, so I am not sure why this is being spun as a negative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>oh and spirit cooking that&#39;s normal practice too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spirit cooking, while odd, seems like a pretty cool performance art. I would certainly partake given the opportunity.</p>

<p>Does that make me a bad person?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And alephentis&#39; name translating to I love children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have seen this claim made a couple of times and it seems quite a stretch because his name doesn&#39;t actually translate that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh its just a coincidence that the Podesta bros don&#39;t even deny their connections to convicted pedophiles Dennis Hastert and Jeffery Epstein and that they appear in Epstein&#39;s butler&#39;s little black book, along with the Clintons, other politicians (including Trump), famous Hollywood and music industry icons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, as far as I can tell, is the most solid piece of evidence for the Podestas having done something questionable. However, you cannot say someone is guilty of something simply because they know or associate with someone who committed an illegal act.</p>

<p>For example: I am a photographer. I regularly photographed a local band who&#39;s lead guitarist and I became friends on FB. When I opened my studio, he and his wife would stop by regularly and we even did some fantastic pinup shots of his wife.</p>

<p>A few months ago, he confessed to molesting an underage girl (teen but not 18) whom he was giving guitar lessons to. He&#39;s now in jail, as he should be. </p>

<p>Am I guilty of anything for knowing him and hanging out with him? What about his band or his wife? The answer is no, we did nothing wrong.</p>

<p>So, was Epstein guilty of having sex with underage girls? Yes. Does that mean everyone that spent time with him was doing the same? No. Same thing with Hastert. We can&#39;t make guilt by association a thing. We need some evidence an actual crime was committed by Podesta, Clinton, or Trump while with Epstein to make that connection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh FFS, I&#39;ve been sent that link like 6 times already. Do you really think I haven&#39;t read all that? I would like to talk about some new info, if it exists. </p>

<p>Jesus...</p>

<p>OK, start at the top.</p>

<p>The &quot;handkerchief code&quot; is NOT used extensively in the gay or BDSM communities at all. It had some relevance years ago but it&#39;s really not much of a thing these days. Maybe at a public event like Pride but even then, it&#39;s not prevalent.</p>

<p>Secondly, the email that this website is attempting to say is referring to this &quot;handkerchief code&quot; doesn&#39;t appear related to such a thing at all. Clearly, where ever they were that the handkerchief was left, was a private event of some sort. I am not sure there are any clues about what sort of event it was.</p>

<p>For the sake of argument let&#39;s assume it was some sort of depraved sex party. I can assure you there would be no need to use a handkerchief to tell others what you are into at such an event. By the time you are at a private sex party, everyone knows why you are there. Seriously, there is no handkerchief code used at private sex parties. I guess you will just have to take my word for it. ;-)</p>

<p>Now, to assume that it was a private sex party is quite a leap since we don&#39;t actually know what kind of gathering it was, it could have been a tupperware party for all we know. If I am wrong here, please do fill me in, but I don&#39;t think we know what type of gathering resulted in the misplaced handkerchief.</p>

<p>So, if it&#39;s a large leap to assume this gathering was a sex party, it&#39;s an even larger one to assume it was a sex party with children present. Let alone, one where you need to use a handkerchief code but everyone already knows you are there to fuck children... it&#39;s so non-sensical it&#39;s bordering on insane and we haven&#39;t even gotten past the fold of the page yet.</p>

<p>Back to the handkerchief... it has a map, it&#39;s pizza related and it is colored white and black. That&#39;s all we know for sure. Correct?</p>

<p>My first thought when I read this email was that it was some sort of print advertising on a handkerchief. This is clearly just my assumption but since we don&#39;t have an image of the handkerchief, we have to assume quite a bit, no?</p>

<p>Thus, both ideas hold relatively equal validity. Either this is a handkerchief with some pizza parlor advertising printed on it. Or, it was a handkerchief used in a Satanic rape ritual. Or, some other possibility of equal validity that neither of us has proffered as an option so far. One of these options is clearly more plausible than the other and I would like to propose that the Satanic rape ritual is a slightly less likely scenario than some advertising and a map printed on a handkerchief. </p>

<p>For future reference, later on down the in the website, conveniently away from this part of the &quot;evidence&quot; presented, the idea is floated that this &quot;map&quot; is actually semen/blood that has been spilt on the handkerchief during said Satanic ritual. This very narrow and specific definition of &quot;map&quot; is put forth by a woman who was allegedly a victim of ritual rape during her childhood. I believe this definition was intentionally put far away the initial discussion of the handkerchief to purposefully confuse the reader by the publisher of this website. This is just my opinion, however, it is a common tactic used by people publishing these types of conspiracy pages. It serves two purposes, 1) to confuse the reader and possibly hide contradictory information and 2) get the reader to scroll as far through page as possible to keep them engaged with the site and increase the value of ad space on the page. </p>

<p>This woman&#39;s testimony may or may not be true, we don&#39;t really know for sure. Regardless, it is relevant to point out that she in no way has any connection to the Podestas, Clintons or anything vaguely retailed to pizzagate. The primary purpose for her story here is to create the impression that this term &quot;map&quot; has an alternate definition from anything we might normally think of as a map.</p>

<p>However, there is problem. She clearly talks about the handkerchief or cloth for the &quot;map&quot; should be white. We know Podesta&#39;s handkerchief is white and black. This website is attempting to create the impression that this handkerchief is use as part of the &quot;handkerchief code&quot; and they circle &quot;black&quot; in their code key and in Podesta&#39;s email to suggest this a BDSM signaling handkerchief. The email clearly shows that it is &quot;white w/ black&quot;. So, if this handkerchief is being used to signal Podestas sexual preferences, it would be kind of useless for this &quot;code&quot; since, as you might note, there is no white on the list and the handkerchief is clearly not mostly black.</p>

<p>So, in short, you can&#39;t have it both ways. </p>

<p>To review: the idea this lost handkerchief was used by Podesta to signal he is into BDSM is stupid because the handkerchief code really isn&#39;t a thing anymore and since it&#39;s mostly white, it wouldn&#39;t signal anything in the first place even if it were being used for this purpose.</p>

<p>YAY! We made it to the fold. I will discuss the next part at a later date, I have a busy day ahead of me.</p>

<p>If your convictions against this are so strong, prove it. If you can prove this wrong, or at least debunk a good deal of this &quot;conspiracy&quot; as just that, you will be the hero of the century.</p>

<p>I will continue to lurk and await your response.</p>

<p>Edit: Remember - Dismissing everything as anecdotal because you believe X or Y is an anecdote itself because you&#39;re attempting to substitute your personal experiences for facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the onus is not on me to provide any proof, because right now there is no evidence of wrong doing. the burden of proof lies on YOU to provide evidence such events are happening. Not saying things like &quot;there are tunnels under the businesses!&quot; and &quot;this picture of a kid with tape on her arms means hes a sick twisted fuck!&quot; and &quot;the guy was wearing a shirt saying &#39;I love kids&#39; in french!&quot; (when in reality that&#39;s just the name of a local business literally blocks away from where that picture was taken)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I do not necessarily think anything presented is concrete, I do acknowledge that there is no statistical probability in the world that would allow as many coincidences as these to exist surrounding a single issue. It&#39;s just not probable. Asking everyone to ignore this because it&#39;s all a big coincidence is the only looney and asinine thing I see.</p>

<p>You would have better odds convincing everyone that you were an actual alien than you would getting people to back away from this.</p>

<p>In any criminal investigation, the important thing to remember is that most of your evidence starts out as circumstantial. Only after investigating can you weed out the BS and find the facts. Asking people to not investigate is only going to drive this train faster to it&#39;s destination.</p>

<p>The &quot;gunman&quot; doesn&#39;t help things either. Seriously who walks into a restaurant and shoots the floor? If he legit felt that strongly about the issue and legit wanted to hurt someone and intended to pull the trigger, he would have shot someone. Hands down. I have lived in the DC area in the past, and I know for a fact that the gun laws there are NO fucking joke. He might as well have shot someone if he discharged a firearm in DC. So this only makes the whole thing seem staged.</p>

<p>Using a (potential) false flag against a conspiracy has got to be the dumbest thing I have ever seen. If there really were no substance to these claims, people would let it run it&#39;s course.</p>

<p>Instead, they fight it. Which means that they may be hiding SOMETHING. It may be a pedo ring, it may be something else, but they are hiding something. It&#39;s psychology 101.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/conspiracy is the last place on reddit that pizzagate is still welcome to be discussed. Let&#39;s not forget the CEO of CTR has a history with Alefantis. I&#39;m sure they were told to completely destroy any discussion on reddit. It&#39;s not even welcome on r/the_donald anymore.

<p>Everyone here should watch this video. It debunks some of the evidence. I used to be hardcore in Pizzagate but after this it shows how much of it is out of context. Just so you know the other side because i havent seen Mainstream media go piece by piece and debunk. They just say oh its fake news because we arent covering it so it is.</p>

<p>I still cant get over a few things. </p>

<p>First off the fucking creep artwork at the pizza place. Oh I&#39;ll make a kid friendly restaurant with art of demons jizzing on ping pong tables. </p>

<p>Then ill post creepy pics of kids on instagram never thinking to myself :</p>

<p>&quot;Wow if it ever gets out to my family or whoever that im posting this shit people might legitimately think im a pedo. Artwork is whatever because thats just some &quot;edgy&quot; artist. But actual kids makes me look pedo-ish&quot;</p>

<p>Secondly the supposed code. What i&#39;d like to see is convicted pedos or someone credible say that that is actually code. Because this whole thing started because of some rando on 4chan. Supposedly a Fbi agent but you cant prove it. Call Chris Hansen, nigga. Or someone else in that world that can verify. </p>

<p>Playing dominoes on cheese or on pizza? Thats the sentence that doesnt makes sense to me. If it was about food youd say : do you think id play dominoes better after eating pizza or cheese. Which still doesnt make sense. </p>

<p>Last of all its the logic of pedo rings. Where ever there is power over kids there is pedophilia. Hollywood, Jimmy Saville, now lately football clubs have been exposed for covering up pedo stories.</p>

<p>DC is the most powerful place on earth. Virginia has a disproportionate amount of kids missing. That says to me that there might be a pedo ring. I believe there is.</p>

<p>James Alefantis is either a pedo or some guy with a very fucked up sense of humor. Not just throwaway joke about fucking kids humor. Actual deep inside joke pedo humor. He is also supposedly one of the top 50 influential people in DC so if he is a pedo, he is probably in that ring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nowhere in the Podesta email code is &quot;cheese pizza&quot; mentioned. I am referring specifically to this chart here: <a href="https://i.sli.mg/eoWIeB.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/eoWIeB.jpg</a></p>

<p>specifically &quot;The Code&quot; on the left side. It does not mention &quot;Cheese pizza&quot; at all, but rather says &quot;hotdog&quot; is code for boy, &quot;ice cream&quot; is code for male prostitution, etc. I have been unable to find a single instance of any of these words being used in the manner described anywhere on the Internet, and have been able to trace the source of this &quot;code&quot; to a single 4chan post. People didn&#39;t bother to verify it and ran with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think there are some mistakes in the &quot;code&quot;</p>

<p>cheese pizza = child porn, well established slang for many years</p>

<p>probably used for &quot;child prostitution&quot; as well, </p>

<p>so therefore &quot;pizza&quot; would be &quot;porn&quot; and &quot;prostitution&quot;, which if a person was into child pornography, then it stands to reason that they may be inclined to have sex with children themselves. </p>

<p>copy-pasta? follow up </p>

<p>hot dog = little boy, makes sense</p>

<p>walnut = person of color, i think is wrong</p>

<p>i heard elsewhere that &quot;walnut&quot; is slang for a little girls genitals, which if you look at a walnut and use your imagination you can see where this slang makes sense. </p>

<p>sauce seems to code for semen or other bodily fluids, </p>

<p>so &quot;walnut sauce&quot; could be bodily fluids from a  little girl, or to put bodily fluids into a little girl</p>

<p>perhaps most incriminating is the &quot;Haitian Special Pizza&quot;, which according to comments i have read is not even a pizza that exists in most pizza shops, and has no known recipe. </p>

<p>combine this &quot;Haitian Special&quot; slang with the fact that Hillary Clinton and Laura Silsby were caught trying to kidnap kids out of Haiti for God-knows what reason, it starts making sense in a sick, perverted way that makes you want to vomit. </p>

It&#39;s a fucked up concept, plain and simple. We, as individuals, decide what we think about, what we give merit to, and ultimately what we believe. You don&#39;t believe in pizzagate and that&#39;s fine, but what if MSM came out and said it&#39;s real and you as a denier are reading fake news...It&#39;s just beyond fucked </p>

<p>Those pictures you&#39;re talking about I never really understood lol. Chickenlover seemed like it had something to do with eating chicken, like everyone else who has used the hashtag on instagram. Maybe there was some chicken special that night? There could be a lot of reasons when you&#39;re talking about a restaurant owner. I can only find uncommon definitions where that even has to do with children. &quot;Hotard&quot; seemed like a joking insult aimed at him. I don&#39;t even see how that&#39;s evidence of anything lol. I&#39;ll call a friend a hoeish ass bitch and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not in a sex ring. </p>

<li><p>Whether he&#39;s heterosexual or homosexual is irrelevant.  What matters is that he does not have children, yet posts pictures of unrelated, young children on his Instagram account.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I don&#39;t think so. Besta&#39;s link to pizzagate was flawed from the start, with the owner (who&#39;s not even the owner) being mistaken for someone with the same name. The link to Besta World Group is extremely flimsy as well, and I don&#39;t even understand where the connection came from other than the name. There seems to be a lot of things named Besta. Even a TV bench from Ikea</p>

<p>I&#39;m not calling you a shill, I&#39;m just very curious as to why you don&#39;t view at least some of these theories as being plausible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I don&#39;t find any of it plausible is because it follows the same formula as any obscure conspiracy. It began with flawed and false assumptions (Comet&#39;s logo being extremely loosely tied to a pedo symbol, non-existent code words being used in Podesta emails about food), and from there it worked backwards to find evidence for an already-drawn conclusion. You could essentially tie any public figure to this with enough work. If you already have your own conclusion about something, any theory can have evidence created with loose ties to other individuals and &quot;x could mean y&quot; types of things, circling back to each other when pieces are discredited or have more reasonable explanations. That&#39;s exactly what this is, with absolutely no hard evidence of child abuse, missing children, etc tied to this pizza place. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;crazy&quot; for someone to look at a pizzagate infographic and believe it&#39;s real. It&#39;s really easy to fall into something when your only information sources are pushing this narrative with their interpretations. But it doesn&#39;t hold together under scrutiny, and pretty much everything has much more normal explanations than being evidence of a sex ring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said there was no similarity, just that we&#39;re already using a fair amount of flexibility to say the written versions are similar.</p>

<p>&quot;James&quot; is an extremely common first name in English. &quot;J&#39;aime&quot; is an extremely common phrase in French, meaning both &quot;I love&quot; and &quot;I like&quot;. &quot;Jaime&quot; is also a common man&#39;s name in English though much less so than &quot;James&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Les enfants&quot; and &quot;Alefantis&quot; - similar but not that close. Different consonants, superfluous vowels and syllables, sound nothing alike when spoken.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;quite the coincidence&quot; tbh, not with the amount of flexibility needed to make this association. If the dude&#39;s name was Jaime Lenfant then that would certainly be significant.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly my problem with this whole thing.  You guys keep making logical leaps to satisfy your own narrative.</p>

<p>I never said I was unconvinced of pedophilia in government/ elite circles.  of course it exists.  maybe it&#39;s part of their ritual sex cults.  it&#39;s almost certainly used for blackmail.  there are plenty of elite pedos and psychopaths.</p>

<p>But the evidence that thus far unconnected pizza shops has anything to do with that is far from linear.  It&#39;s one of the most disjointed theories i&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just gonna be honest, the snopes article is what made me dig into it in the first place. I found it absolutely hilarious that snopes claims that the instagram photos were from facebook, when there&#39;s clear archive links <em>to instagram</em>. Not only did it completely destroy snopes&#39; credibility (I was a big fan before this), but it also reinforced pizzagate for me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a big conspiracy fan (which is why I hardly come here), but <em>damn</em>. TBH, the creepy kid photos and those weird comments are the most damning evidence. Doubly so that not only snopes denies it, but they try to claim it&#39;s from elsewhere, <em>and</em> the photos were removed. If they&#39;re harmless, why remove them? Quickly responding and removing content and changing logos makes you look guilty. If there was truly nothing going on, they&#39;d just put out a thing that says &quot;no, you&#39;re all full of shit.&quot; and be done with it like any sane business.</p>

<p>Part of what I am challenged with right now is that I feel pretty strongly about many of these conspiracy theories, and they definitely resonate with me in many ways; but there is no HARD evidence yet, and that is really throwing me off.  There are lots of little clues, ect - but the fact that there isn&#39;t any hard evidence available that really implicates a portion of this thing in some way is really mind fucking me - there is basically a lot of theories that make a LOT of sense and are intertwined just right - but there is no conclusion, nor a hint at one</p>

<p>This is the entire joke with all this.  You can use your own senses, trust your own thoughts and perceptions and know that something is wrong, resonates with you.  But because you are a rational, at least of average intelligence person who got an education of some sort, you need HARD evidence because that&#39;s what our court system uses.   You&#39;re in conflict because you can see for yourself this is fucked but the government, law enforcement and judicial system have not presented &quot;hard evidence&quot; to you so you cannot believe it.  </p>

<p>What hard evidence could there be?  If you&#39;re talking about semen, DNA, blood, hair, videos on hard drives, bodies, remains, witnesses and victims then you will never, ever get it.  Ever.  In order for you to see that the law enforcement, the government and the judicial system have to investigate it.  The people we&#39;re talking about are all extremely wealthy and members of the DC elite and this is being completely dismissed outright.  </p>

<p>I love how the standard everyone expects for evidence is unlike that of virtually every other crime, in that even possessing the dirt necessary to bury one of these people is illegal in and of itself.

<p>if you don&#39;t, you&#39;ve already exposed yourself as sloppy at best. when an issue is as shocking as pizzagate, little mistakes like these are the kiss of death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be suspected of something is to be guilty of anything. To be guilty means you are guilty of whatever charge is applied. The worst charges are so indisputable that they need no evidence. Lack of evidence is evidence of a cover-up. Critics are dark forces, not disinterested observers. The media don&#39;t take it seriously, therefore it must be true. The nut we provoked into nearly shooting the place up was sent to discredit us. The media are in on the &#39;false flag&#39; because they&#39;re reporting it as though it really happened. They&#39;re ignoring the evidence that we have found and withholding the evidence that we can&#39;t find. Lines on a map are evidence, especially if they cross. Lack of confession indicates guilt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the real deal on what has been dubbed &quot;pizzagate&quot;. None of you are going to glimpse any comprehensive truth from your amateur sleuthing. What *will&quot; happen is that in 10-15 years an actual hardcore investigative journalist will release 1000+ page comprehensive book chock of *actual&quot; evidence that could stand up in court. None of you will read it. The only people who will are members of alphabet agencies, other real journalists, and poltical and history academics. No one will get indicted or killed. The journalist will notice that his FOIAs take even longer to process. The academics who talk about it will be dismissed by colleagues that are alphabet assets. The alphabet guys will have fun seeing how much he got right. Maybe they&#39;ll tell the writer to stay away from the topic in the future. And nearly all of you will have forgotten about it by then.</p>

<p>This is what happened with &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;, Gulf of Tonkin, Bay of Pigs, Pearl Harbor and 9/11. Maybe someone will repost or mention it from time to time, but it still won&#39;t matter because the masses are so throughly brainwashed.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Pizzagate is NOT a real conspiracy</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>If you are correct...</strong> </p>

<p>...why did Twitter™ shutdown 100&#39;s of pedo accounts ...as a <strong><em>DIRECT</em></strong> result of the 4chan/reddit/online investigation of John Podesta&#39;s emails (aka. the pizzagate &quot;witch hunt&quot;) ??</p>

<p>/sorry, folks.  pizzagate is very real.  and to not acknowledge these national leaders as the criminals they are is <strong><em>very very dangerous.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>#pedosgate</strong> (or #pizzagate, as it is more commonly known) is a criminal conspiracy theory fueled by wikileaks&#39; (1) release of John Podesta&#39;s emails (2).  (Jon Podesta is Hillary Clinton&#39;s &quot;right hand man&quot; and Campaign Manager.(3))  The conspiracy theory places Podesta (and his brother Tony(4)) in a ring of criminal activity involving the abducting(5) and trafficking(6) of children for sex(7), bloodletting(8) and serial murder(9) - Madeleine McCann(10) among the theorized victims.  James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong(11) (and friend to Podesta&#39;s(12)), is also theorized to be one of the central power brokers(13). (James Alefantis has publicly refuted these theories to be untruths from &quot;fake news&quot;. (14)).  The online investigation led to the exposure of 100’s of twitter accounts that were trafficking photography documenting the entire supply chain - from the abductions(15), to the coffins (16).  It is unknown is Twitter was aware of the account prior to the disclosure form online investigators, or if these accounts had been able to slip through Twitter - hence #twittergate.  In the rush to purge Twitter of the associated accounts, the personal Twitter account of Jack Dorsey (founder of Square and Twitter, and who also sits on he board of Disney) was accidentally banned - but quickly re-activated.

<p>In a normal timeline, the Onion would be running a piece how it&#39;s no big deal that Tony Podesta has pictures of children in their underwear tied up being punished, and that our washington elite were just doing some spirit cooking on the side and it&#39;s no big deal.</p>

<p>I mean, all &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; claims aside, these people are downright weird, and since when does the media go OUT OF THEIR WAY to not call someone weird or highlight something as messed up as spirit cooking?</p>

<p>The fact that there&#39;s a massive effort to suppress and discredit all of this only gives it more credibility.  If they had just let it play out organically and debunked all the evidence/claims, people would have packed up and moved on in short order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. To truly enter the rabbit hole, and avoid the anger and fear while dancing on it&#39;s edge, to awaken to the terrible ancient truths inherent to our wartorn and malfunctioning world, takes a plunge into what normies have to consider crazy in order to keep their fragile worldview intact. Meanwhile the ancient agenda continues to pulse strongly. I advise anyone not afraid to be considered insane by the truly normalized insane read a book by Icke to get started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check him out. He&#39;s responsible for articles like this: 
&quot;The intense struggle at the top of the world’s power structure will not end on November 8th no matter who wins the so-called US Presidential election, US agency sources say. However, there is strong likelihood the issue will be settled by January 20th, 2017 when the new President is supposed to formally assume the reins of power, they say. At the highest level, the battle is between the 13 bloodline families who have ruled the West for centuries, if not millennia and their age old opponents, the gnostic illuminati who are opposed to bloodline rule. The people behind Hillary Clinton are the bloodlines, who report ultimately to Baron Evelyn de Rothschild as well as to the old Italian aristocracy behind the P2 Freemason lodge. This can be confirmed by endorsements from bloodline controlled media such as the Economist Magazine owned by the Rothschilds and the P2 Agnelli brothers. It can also be confirmed by wikileaks e-mails showing Hillary Clinton is intimately subservient to Lynn Forest de Rothschild, who is the wife of Baron Rothschild. The main source of the bloodlines’ power is their control of the process for creating and distributing money, ie their ownership of most of the world’s central banks. They have used this money power to bribe, blackmail and assassinate people at the top levels of power in order to ensure their control. They also control the corporate media and have been using every propaganda tool in their hands to create the appearance that Hillary Clinton will win a close race against Donald Trump. You can also confirm this by holding your nose and watching election coverage on CNN also known as the Clinton News Network. The people behind Donald Trump include the gnostic illuminati, who recruit geniuses of each age who are not part of the ruling bloodlines, sources in the illuminati say. The illuminati favour meritocracy and, since the world’s government agencies and military are meritocratic, it means they control most of the people with guns with the exception of a few mercenaries on the bloodline payrolls. Direct reporting from a White Dragon Society member in the US also reveals overwhelming support for Donald Trump at the street level. Here is his report: “I went to a Hillary ‘rally’ two weeks ago…there might have been 1500 people tops. On Friday night I went to a Trump rally in Hershey PA. It filled up a hockey arena, at least 15,000, plus 7000 outside…Trump is turning rednecks into peaceniks. Hillary is turning dovish liberals into warmongering self-loathing retards.” This is what Pentagon sources had to say about the US Presidential election: “The election will be allowed to proceed to not spook the public so vote fraud and other crimes will be exposed. Immediately thereafter the Republic will be announced, Hillary and cabal arrested, and corrupt agencies like FRB, DOJ, FBI, IRS, DHS and CIA abolished or reformed.” The agencies have being doing their bit by using the internet to pump out a flood of information about pedophilia, corruption, human sacrifice and other outrages perpetrated by the bloodlines. Click on the links below to see examples of this. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/L9bA1">http://imgur.com/a/L9bA1</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfL5KwUuvMc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfL5KwUuvMc</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UYYZA4DxDw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UYYZA4DxDw</a> The bloodline families are now in a state of absolute terror, literally fighting for their lives, fleeing to Antarctic bases and trying to pull off something horrific. This writer was accused by many trolls of “smoking something,” when he started writing recently that many members of the elite were fleeing to Antarctic Bases. Well now you can confirm on the official US State Department website that US Secretary of State John “Skull &amp; Bones,” Kerry will be flying to Antarctica on November 8th election day. <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2016/11/264091.htm">http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2016/11/264091.htm</a> The corporate media whores at the press briefing were told Kerry was going there to study “climate change,” however sources in the CIA say the real reason Kerry is flying to the South Pole is to attend a secret meeting of top bloodline power brokers to plot civil war. Here is a direct quote about the matter from a senior CIA source in Washington DC: “These assholes WANT civil war. Why else would JK be out of the country. Climate change my ass – He is meeting the elite boys in Antarctica for instructions.” Here is what a CIA source in Asia had to say about this: “I was called last night on a secure line. My contact in…wanted to let me know that his team was leaving to Antarctica for a very important meeting with several heads of State and senior diplomats from various countries and would be out of touch for about week. He is going as an observer on behalf of… This is all kept on a need to know basis. No media on this one. He told me that they were going to ‘The Special Off the Grid Base.’ Several countries have their permanently stationed representatives at this Above Top Secret Installation.” The main topic of discussion is likely to be the imminent ratification of the Paris accords which would mean a transition of the world’s financial system away from bloodline control. The negotiations that begin on November 7th (as this newsletter goes online) in Morocco are supposed to ratify these agreements. Pentagon sources, for their part, are saying “The counter-coup against Hillary has gone kinetic with spacecraft flying cabal members seeking to escape justice shot down, underground bases in Italy destroyed by quakes, while a skirmish in Antarctica caused Kerry to visit.  The illuminati are saying the bloodlines have a submarine in Guam that is going to be used to fire a nuclear missile at Tokyo in an attempt to blame the attack on the illuminati. The bloodlines may also try to stage a fake alien invasion or else use an EMP attack on the US power grid to stave off a change in government, CIA sources say. The bloodlines are also trying to buy their way out of trouble. That is why Evelyn de Rothschild has been trying to create $41 trillion based on forged gold backed certificates, as reported previously by this writer and by Neil Keenan. In fact, last week a Rothschild agent approached the White Dragon Foundation and offered them whatever amount of money they wanted to start up their proposed meritocratically staffed future planning agency. However, if the WDF (Part of the WDS) accepted this funding, it would mean acknowledging the Rothschilds and the bloodlines would retain their god-like power to create money out of nothing and thus their control over this planet and its inhabitants. The WDS believes any new financial system needs to be based on reality (and thus the creator) and not on fraud. It further believes the process of creating and distributing money should be a transparently run public service and not a private monopoly. Pentagon sources agree saying “The Paris agreement entered into force globally on November 4th which means the cabal must be terminated right after election so the Global Currency Reset can proceed to benefit all of humanity.” They add that although the “FBI punted on the e-mails Hillary is still on the hook for pedophilia, Clinton Foundation pay for play, obstruction of justice, racketeering and IRS violations.” Not to mention mass murder in Fukushima, Iraq, Haiti and elsewhere. NSA and CIA sources say Bill Clinton now has full blown AIDS and may not live long enough to face justice. In Japan, meanwhile, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Shinzo Abe slave regime are “waving the white flag of surrender,” royal family sources say. Michael Greenberg, the head Rothschild agent in Japan, is now in custody at the Yokota airbase in Japan, the sources say. In South Korea, cabal stooge President Park Gyeun-hye’s government is being rocked by exposure it was de facto run by a religious cult. This information has caused Park’s support rate to fall to 5% and sent hundreds of thousands of protesters on to the streets to demand her resignation. <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/11/06/south-korea-protest-park-geun-hye/#xTNZFPmQouqt">http://mashable.com/2016/11/06/south-korea-protest-park-geun-hye/#xTNZFPmQouqt</a> Meanwhile, NSA sources reveal Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is a drug dealer who works for the Ayala and Tan crime syndicates and that his so-called war on drugs is just an excuse to murder the competition so that his gang can monopolize the drug trade in the Philippines. In China, for its part, sources in the military and intelligence community say while President Xi Jinping has secured support at the very top of the ruling communist party, a weak economy means he has little rank and file backing. His crackdown on corruption too, although popular at first, is now seen as an attack on rivals, they add. There are also signs that increasing numbers of people in the Russian government are beginning to realize President Vladimir Putin is not real. This can be seen in the fact that Russian diplomats use an ET emoji in their communications to describe Putin. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3908668/Vladimir-Putin-alien-Diplomats-use-grey-ET-emoji-Russian-leader-private-WhatsApp-chats.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3908668/Vladimir-Putin-alien-Diplomats-use-grey-ET-emoji-Russian-leader-private-WhatsApp-chats.html</a> “[US President Barack] Obama, Xi Jinping and Putin are all freaking out because their entire power structure is crumbling around them,” was how a senior illuminati member described the situation. In these circumstances, it is worth noting there will be a “once in 70- year super moon,” November 14th. It should be an interesting week. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably just coincidence that a Department of Justice prosecutor whose specific wheelhouse is handling child trafficking and child porn cases liked the most questionable of the posts on alephantis&#39; instagram, right?  Just coincidence that Clinton speechwriters own the bookstore &quot;politics and prose&quot; down the street, and across the street there is a non-profit charity called beyond borders proclaiming to combat child sex-trafficking in Haiti, of all places.  Probably just coincidence that Clinton herself was proven, through the wikileaks emails, to be personally involved in the pardon of Laura Silsby who allegedly was caught trying to grab 33 sum-odd kids out of that very same disaster-stricken country, most of whom weren&#39;t even orphans.  Probably just coincidence that Podestas emails refer so much to pizza out of context, and that there are articles from years ago about his and his brother&#39;s weird taste in artwork.  Probably just a figure of speech when they were referring to the torture chamber in their own home.  Probably not unusual that there are proven to exist TUNNELS under these businesses.  Probably not weird that Alephentis has been caught in a lie about the existence of a basement under his business, and that there used to be controversial artwork on the walls depicting strange acts with children.  The video of majestic ape speaking at Sasha Lord&#39;s (a woman who self-proclaims to work with at-risk kids and books most of her events at comet ping-pong) is TOTALLY normal nothing to bat an eye at there.  Should I keep going?  The evidence is circumstantial, yes, but it is more than enough cause for reasonable suspicion, which is the central pillar of any serious investigation.  This is a serious investigation, you cannot refute it just by saying &quot;fake news&quot;.  I resent you so much.  </p>

<p>edit: oh and spirit cooking that&#39;s normal practice too.  And alephentis&#39; name translating to I love children.</p>

<p>more: Oh its just a coincidence that the Podesta bros don&#39;t even deny their connections to convicted pedophiles Dennis Hastert and Jeffery Epstein and that they appear in Epstein&#39;s butler&#39;s little black book, along with the Clintons, other politicians (including Trump), famous Hollywood and music industry icons.</p>

<p>More for <a href="/u/truth_kills">/u/truth_kills</a>: Someone is going to unearth the hard evidence and then there won&#39;t be enough money in the world to pay people to cover this up.  Rot in hell.</p>

<p>Also watching the vote count on this comment is hilarious.  Doesn&#39;t have enough alternate accounts to downvote the truth.</p>

Not saying things like &quot;there are tunnels under the businesses!&quot; and &quot;this picture of a kid with tape on her arms means hes a sick twisted fuck!&quot; and &quot;the guy was wearing a shirt saying &#39;I love kids&#39; in french!&quot; (when in reality that&#39;s just the name of a local business literally blocks away from where that picture was taken)</p>

<p>so let&#39;s see some evidence instead of these opinionated anecdotes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh FFS, I&#39;ve been sent that link like 6 times already. Do you really think I haven&#39;t read all that? I would like to talk about some new info, if it exists. </p>

<p>Jesus...</p>

<p>OK, start at the top.</p>

<p>The &quot;handkerchief code&quot; is NOT used extensively in the gay or BDSM communities at all. It had some relevance years ago but it&#39;s really not much of a thing these days. Maybe at a public event like Pride but even then, it&#39;s not prevalent.</p>

<p>Secondly, the email that this website is attempting to say is referring to this &quot;handkerchief code&quot; doesn&#39;t appear related to such a thing at all. Clearly, where ever they were that the handkerchief was left, was a private event of some sort. I am not sure there are any clues about what sort of event it was.</p>

<p>For the sake of argument let&#39;s assume it was some sort of depraved sex party. I can assure you there would be no need to use a handkerchief to tell others what you are into at such an event. By the time you are at a private sex party, everyone knows why you are there. Seriously, there is no handkerchief code used at private sex parties. I guess you will just have to take my word for it. ;-)</p>

<p>Now, to assume that it was a private sex party is quite a leap since we don&#39;t actually know what kind of gathering it was, it could have been a tupperware party for all we know. If I am wrong here, please do fill me in, but I don&#39;t think we know what type of gathering resulted in the misplaced handkerchief.</p>

<p>So, if it&#39;s a large leap to assume this gathering was a sex party, it&#39;s an even larger one to assume it was a sex party with children present. Let alone, one where you need to use a handkerchief code but everyone already knows you are there to fuck children... it&#39;s so non-sensical it&#39;s bordering on insane and we haven&#39;t even gotten past the fold of the page yet.</p>

<p>Back to the handkerchief... it has a map, it&#39;s pizza related and it is colored white and black. That&#39;s all we know for sure. Correct?</p>

<p>My first thought when I read this email was that it was some sort of print advertising on a handkerchief. This is clearly just my assumption but since we don&#39;t have an image of the handkerchief, we have to assume quite a bit, no?</p>

<p>Thus, both ideas hold relatively equal validity. Either this is a handkerchief with some pizza parlor advertising printed on it. Or, it was a handkerchief used in a Satanic rape ritual. Or, some other possibility of equal validity that neither of us has proffered as an option so far. One of these options is clearly more plausible than the other and I would like to propose that the Satanic rape ritual is a slightly less likely scenario than some advertising and a map printed on a handkerchief. </p>

<p>For future reference, later on down the in the website, conveniently away from this part of the &quot;evidence&quot; presented, the idea is floated that this &quot;map&quot; is actually semen/blood that has been spilt on the handkerchief during said Satanic ritual. This very narrow and specific definition of &quot;map&quot; is put forth by a woman who was allegedly a victim of ritual rape during her childhood. I believe this definition was intentionally put far away the initial discussion of the handkerchief to purposefully confuse the reader by the publisher of this website. This is just my opinion, however, it is a common tactic used by people publishing these types of conspiracy pages. It serves two purposes, 1) to confuse the reader and possibly hide contradictory information and 2) get the reader to scroll as far through page as possible to keep them engaged with the site and increase the value of ad space on the page. </p>

<p>This woman&#39;s testimony may or may not be true, we don&#39;t really know for sure. Regardless, it is relevant to point out that she in no way has any connection to the Podestas, Clintons or anything vaguely retailed to pizzagate. The primary purpose for her story here is to create the impression that this term &quot;map&quot; has an alternate definition from anything we might normally think of as a map.</p>

<p>However, there is problem. She clearly talks about the handkerchief or cloth for the &quot;map&quot; should be white. We know Podesta&#39;s handkerchief is white and black. This website is attempting to create the impression that this handkerchief is use as part of the &quot;handkerchief code&quot; and they circle &quot;black&quot; in their code key and in Podesta&#39;s email to suggest this a BDSM signaling handkerchief. The email clearly shows that it is &quot;white w/ black&quot;. So, if this handkerchief is being used to signal Podestas sexual preferences, it would be kind of useless for this &quot;code&quot; since, as you might note, there is no white on the list and the handkerchief is clearly not mostly black.</p>

<p>So, in short, you can&#39;t have it both ways. </p>

<p>To review: the idea this lost handkerchief was used by Podesta to signal he is into BDSM is stupid because the handkerchief code really isn&#39;t a thing anymore and since it&#39;s mostly white, it wouldn&#39;t signal anything in the first place even if it were being used for this purpose.</p>

<p>YAY! We made it to the fold. I will discuss the next part at a later date, I have a busy day ahead of me.</p>
