       Regardless of its origins, is it not possible that Pizzagate is now actively being used to sow discord among the community and discredit it to outsiders?

       And if Pizzagate is the distraction, then what is it distracting from?

       A possibility exists that something tremendous is being missed.

       All I am doing is considering the possibility. At this time we are flooded with information. Valuable signal could easily be obscured by noise. If a majority of individuals are fixated on a specific topic, then what is actually important could be missed entirely. I think we owe it to ourselves and one another to at least ask the question.

       Sorry, was a little rude, and I do agree with you that there's all kinds of other shit going on that we should also be looking at. But my point remains.

       Keep pushing pizzagate like we depend on it, because we do. We don't stand a chance in hell if large amounts of people don't wake up, and soon.

       Anything with sufficient evidence to remove them from power, which would disempower related organizations and impede any nefarious activities. Power protects offenders. If Pizzagate is true, we need to consider that the topic of Pizzagate itself may not be what would be most effective in bringing about its end.

       be compromised? I think the HBGary leaks drive home that that is always a possibility.

       Are you suggesting pizzagate was fed to us a fake story? Because then you're not understanding that we literally started the story. Discovery after discovery, it grew into Pizzagate and is now being reported not just by alt news but MSM as well.

       I think Pizzagate could be driven by a mix of both well intentioned people and fundamentally bad actors. Channeling community momentum, subtly, can be a means of exercising influence. If a company was hired to bury another story, then bringing attention to Pizzagate would be enormously beneficial. In addition, it would most likely serve their interests to play
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       sides, for and against, using controversy to raise the profile of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not the above is actually occurring, I see benefit in giving deeper consideration to what are currently minor stories in the community. Pizzagate has become so dominant that it is hard to know what else is important. Certainly, other topics are important---and a possibility exists that they may be of even greater importance.

       Fake concern for children, with no actual action taken or evidence to use. If you cared about children so much you'd be investigating the tens of thousands of actual cases of disappeared children, and children's rights and care across the globe.

       I don't think pizzagate is a "distraction" wether true or false.. but either way, it's flooding MSM while there are Antarctica files/images wikileaks released we can simultaneously be discussing/investigating? It's definitely taking away from Standing Rock coverage. They've used the elections as an excuse for their lack of attention towards Standing Rock, and I'm sure they'll now use "fake news" &amp; pizzagate as excuses..

       it is possible they designed everything and then they will prove pozzagate is fake and they ban all alternative media... but they don't need to. From that all of you will question everything and you'll stop beliving in anything, especially on internet. You live will be empty and meaningless, like russians not so long ago.
