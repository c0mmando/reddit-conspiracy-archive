<p>All I am doing is considering the possibility. At this time we are flooded with information. Valuable signal could easily be obscured by noise. If a majority of individuals are fixated on a specific topic, then what is actually important could be missed entirely. I think we owe it to ourselves and one another to at least ask the question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do u mean? </p>

<p>Of course there are elements of &quot;compromise&quot; in the &#39;conspiracy&#39; community</p>

<p>Are you suggesting pizzagate was fed to us a fake story? Because then you&#39;re not understanding that we literally started the story. Discovery after discovery, it grew into Pizzagate and is now being reported not just by alt news but MSM as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Pizzagate could be driven by a mix of both well intentioned people and fundamentally bad actors. Channeling community momentum, subtly, can be a means of exercising influence. If a company was hired to bury another story, then bringing attention to Pizzagate would be enormously beneficial. In addition, it would most likely serve their interests to play <em>both</em> sides, for and against, using controversy to raise the profile of the story.</p>

<p>Whether or not the above is actually occurring, I see benefit in giving deeper consideration to what are currently minor stories in the community. Pizzagate has become so dominant that it is hard to know what else is important. Certainly, other topics are important---and a possibility exists that they may be of even greater importance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is possible they designed everything and then they will prove pozzagate is fake and they ban all alternative media... but they don&#39;t need to.
