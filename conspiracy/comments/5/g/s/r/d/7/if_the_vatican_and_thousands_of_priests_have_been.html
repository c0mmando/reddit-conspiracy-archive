<p>the idea that a politician could do it.</p>

<p>We have literally dozens of examples of pedophile rings occurring in governments around the world.</p>

<p>UK Parliament? Dutroux Affair? Franklin Boys Town scandal?</p>

<p>In Canadian assimilation schools run by the government for Natives back in the early to mid 1900s had death rates in the 70th percentile. There were frequent reports of sexual abuse. This isn&#39;t even refuted nowadays, people just forget apparently. The government admitted to it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system</a></p>

<p>Anderson Cooper said on live air over three thousand pentagon employees were charged with possessing pedophilia, then not a news report happened on it ever again.</p>

<p>Queen Frederika was a cruise liner that brought 1,400 kids from Greece to be illegaly adopted after the country was ruined in WW2. The Greek aristocracy sold children that had parents and families to Americans looking to adopt. A prominent American lawyer was actually arrested too, but of course not the people he worked with, like the government officials that allowed this to happen and coordinated the logistics. In several cases, it was rich families who couldn&#39;t get kids in America for various reasons. One kid who went through this process said her mother couldn&#39;t adopt in the U.S. because she had obvious mental issues. Regardless, the point is Greek was just selling babies with families to other people. 90s NYT article about it : <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/13/nyregion/tales-of-stolen-babies-and-lost-identities-a-greek-scandal-echoes-in-new-york.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/13/nyregion/tales-of-stolen-babies-and-lost-identities-a-greek-scandal-echoes-in-new-york.html</a></p>

<p>The funniest connection is Queen Frederika actually had an affair with Allen Dulles, head of CIA at the time the CIA was fucking around with every world government there is, particularly South and Central America. If there&#39;s a hell, Allen Dulles is one of the guests of honor.</p>

<p>How are the people brigading us not seeing that? They act as if this type of things hasn&#39;t been proved before multiple times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which makes me wonder if it will ever be truly stopped. I&#39;m not convinced on pizzagate. I think that even if there is truth to it, so many normal citizens can&#39;t or won&#39;t believe it. No matter how strong the evidence. </p>

<p>The where is assange question seems like a better one. It&#39;s also black or white, with no pre-existing bias for the average citizen. If we can prove assange was kidnapped or killed, we can prove that the deep state is capable of heinous crimes..  Sovereignty destroying crimes. From there, many more will be capable of seeing further down the rabbit hole. </p>

<p>Just my 2 cents. I think that pizzagate is getting played on both sides by disinfo. Emotion based decision making is not what we should be about. This sub has always been fucked with, but this election has left it utterly unrecognizable.</p>

When the boys finally came out it was a huge media smear campaign plus no political divide and it goes up high. If our judicial system is involved what case can they bring? If Some FBI &amp; police involved what kind of investigation can you have? I could keep climbing but I&#39;m sure you get it. Look up what I&#39;m talking about.

    <div class="md"><p>Because the church gets accused but those people never ever go to jail.  Instead the Church pays out, and takes care of it internally, which means the priests are moved around or defrocked, which then means they become a smuggler / human trafficker full time.  Jesuits never go to jail.  They are immune and above the law. If they are compelled to go to jail then they die in jail, get carted out and then end up serving their death in sunny aruba.</p>

<p>Similarly, these politicians get caught and they do almost no time like the wrist slap that Dennis Hastert got.  </p>

<p><del>Your argument is an attempt to discredit pizzagate</del>  I apologize I misinterpreted.  I get it now.   Yes politicians are not exempt</p>

<p>The fact is that pedo networks do exist and they are being taken down all the time, and so to think this is left field is to deny reality.  There&#39;s enough evidence here in pizzagate to give probable cause to authorities to investigate further.</p>

<p>The simple fact is:  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gol2a/verified_pedo_networks/">yes there are large pedo networks that involve many in the police, intelligence, politics, government and clergy.</a>  They might get caught, but never punished in the same way we do.  And in fact, many pedo networks taken down are not the &#39;real&#39; pedo netorks, only small time, off brand rape gangs.  Look at the list of confirmed conspiracies under global pedo networks for details on this--it&#39;s not inclusive, but the uk is mostly complete.  You&#39;ll see most of the busted sex gangs were pakistani gangs, but you know through operation yewtree (Savile) that there is a VAST network of baddies at the BBC and beyond, into the higher eschelons of the political elite there, going back to the hellfire club </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we are forgetting that if there are victims to a government pedophilia ring, they are most likely MKULTRA&#39;d. If these victims show signs of recovering from being controlled, they will most likely kill them. If they don&#39;t kill them, they will do an excellent job of destroy all credibility (or they go to rehab). This conspiracy is definitely up shit creek without a paddle. And comet ping pong is taking up most of the focus while the bigger connections that should be focused on are getting buried. </p>
