    <div class="md"><p>Random news articles about people in government being convicted and tried do not show that there is a government wide conspiracy. </p>

<p>Power corrupts i agree, though what you are proposing with pizzagate is a system of abuse run by various organizations and people to maintain power and control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those were not random news articles. They are of ex state dept officials who were working in the state dept while under the head of Secretary Clinton. All except the military lawyer at the bottom had that connection.</p>

<p>Also the first site wasn&#39;t necessarily a news site, it&#39;s from the FBI archives</p>

<p>My point being obviously people in the government have been proven to molest children, particularly these people.</p>

<p>Further more, to see something interesting pull up the sex offender maps by family watch dog and look up D.C. , 
That&#39;s hella red dots all over the. Nations capital. And compared to other cities or even the city I live in. Not nearly as many considering the population density. </p>

<p>Yes, again they are random in that they do not show causation, if you take a pool of people(ex state dept of said years) and find a certain amount did this it does not prove some higher up &quot;Dr. Claw&quot; orchestrated it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m simply saying it&#39;s pretty obvious there are a lot of people who worked for the govt, who have molested children.  There&#39;s actually a lot more. Look up the family watch dog map of sex offenders in DC and notice how red it is compared to other similar cities.</p>

<p>I guess you will only ever think It&#39;s random they all worked for the state dept, and ended up being sick people. </p>

<p>I&#39;m def not saying higher up people &#39;orchestrated it&#39; 
But these are the people who got caught. Low level individuals accused of transporting loads of CP where the investigations end with the conviction of one. Reading those documents and seeing how he transported it tells me obviously he must have been sharing. But this with the podesta emails and suggestive and weird images of kids eating pizza, the sketch of madelines abductors matching the podesta brothers whose johns emails were erased the day before the abduction back in 07 seems hard not to draw these conclusions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying every govt official is a Satan worshipping child molester.
In simply saying it seems as though the speculation of a pedophile ring involving govt officials can&#39;t be too far fetched considering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRObgttIyeg&amp;amp;app=desktop">this</a> 60 mins doc and the fact many govt officials have been arrested for sex crimes involving childern. How can one not start to question it?</p>

<p>A lot of people who haven&#39;t worked for the government have molested children. A reasonable person would compare crime statistics of government workers to the general population (or populations with similar positions of power) before concluding that something is up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fact checking doesnt stick. People repost, regurgitate the same bogus, debunked claims over and over. They simply want to believe. They have made up their minds that there is a conspiracy to dismantle pizzagate because it is so damaging, not realizing that the damage it causes is to the innocent people being targeted. There is no fear by the msm or elites from the sad, asinine pizzagate investigation. </p>

<p>Pizzagate has no evidence of any wrongdoing, it is a witchhunt, just like previous Reddit witchhunts (the bumbling daycare and boston witchhunts). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give you the perspective on a unqualified outsider:</p>

<p>Pizzagate is nothing new. </p>

<p>The same thought patterns and (il)logical traps are present in staunch believers of any conspiracy. People who&#39;ve concluded that the moon landing was faked will believe anything that confirms their beliefs and refuse to consider anything you have to say. Some will go further and take take your opposition of their beliefs as evidence that that theirs are valid. It&#39;s run of the mill confirmation bias, combined with jumping through any hoop necessary interpret things favorably.</p>
