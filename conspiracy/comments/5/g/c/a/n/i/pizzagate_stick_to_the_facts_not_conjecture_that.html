        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">44</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/BransonOnTheInternet.html">BransonOnTheInternet</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Please remember that when discussing Pizzagate people need to stick to the facts that have been found, and not the random accusations that will only embolden those that disagree and provide ammunition for them to discredit it as a whole.  </p>

<p>What I am talking about is the claims that keep popping up of satanism and cannibalism.  Now, where as you may think that these claims are true and have merit (and they may) it doesn&#39;t matter right now.  The more you pile on top of the already hard to swallow for the general public claims of mass sex abuse, the easier it is for that same public to tune you out and discount you as nothing but a bunch of crazies.  </p>

<p>We need to stick to the facts, to what was said in the email leaks and what has been found out.  We don&#39;t need to be saying things like &quot;they eat babies and they worship Satan&quot;.  These types of claims, no matter of evidence at this time, do not help your cause.  As stated, they only hurt it.  </p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying that these things haven&#39;t happened, I don&#39;t know.  What I am saying though is for right now we need to stick to the facts.  There has been plenty of hard evidence in the past that pedophilia exist in large scales. This is undeniable and can be backed up, credibly, by multiple sources.  Ergo it&#39;s harder to discount this claim as it has happened before, on a large scale, such as is being claimed here.  What has not been proven in such a way, except outside of fringe groups which have already largely discounted by the public, is claims of ritualistic Satanism and cannibalism.  Have these things existed in the past?  Yes.  But are there large swaths of recorded documentation of it to back this up?  No.  Especially not in the modern world.    Hence when these types of accusations are tied to Pizzagate they only further the notion that all of it can be discounted as a whole.  </p>

<p>So please keep this in mind going forward, that when discussing this matter with people outside of this sub (or hell even in this sub honestly as there has been a lot of traction here from outside of the sub itself) stick to the facts.  Don&#39;t exaggerate, don&#39;t add what you think may be the case, don&#39;t exaggerate or over play your hand.  Remember you are working from behind on this, against a machine that has far more control and far more resources than you and as such you have to approach situations with this in mind.  Let the facts speak for themselves, then after that is done, we can begin to discuss the more factually questionable aspects of this case.  </p>

<p>Edit:  Since some of you think this is encouraging censorship let me present you a perfect example of this and how it works and how this is NOT censorship but rather a psychological tactic used the world over to ensure that people are not written off.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s use Scientology as an example, as they use this all the time.  Not because they&#39;re insane (they are) but because it works. </p>

<p>When someone joins Scientology they are not told the truth about what it is right off.  They are slowly introduced to the concepts of Xenu or L Ron being god, etc.  Why is this?  Because if they came right out and were like Xenu is the ruler of the universe and L Ron is god they would be discounted as fucking insane.  They do this because they know that introducing people to these ideas right off would turn them off to the entirety of what they are saying.  This has been proven time and time again to work.  It&#39;s really fucking simply psychology honestly.  </p>

<p>So no, it&#39;s not censorship.  It&#39;s saying we need to use the tools that are being used against us against them.  Use some tact when discussing this matter and don&#39;t just blow your load right out.  Introduce the believable and factually accurate sides of the story first, and then once you have someone attention, then you can introduce the more questionable harder to swallow aspects.  At no point am I saying, don&#39;t talk about it at any time, ever, not once was that said, nor would it be.  Anyone reading into that is doing themselves and others a disservice.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brilliant post!</p>

<p>Can&#39;t believe you were accused of trying to censor people :/</p>

<p>You are right that it&#39;s not about converting people by exagerating or getting emotional but by simply showing them facts... and trust the people to get to their own conclusion on it. The way pizzag8 was handled by the horde was terribly wrong and put off a lot of people indeed. It wasn&#39;t the conspiracy people did not believe, it was the people pushing it at some point!</p>

<p>I think this post is a good example of how information could be presented in a more objective manner:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your post. It&#39;s like the 9/11 stuff. </p>

<p>People start talking about remotely controlled planes and holographic planes or even blatantly accusing George bush of orchestrating it. Which just gives the opposition fodder to say we&#39;re all dumb. When in reality it&#39;s just a few dumbasses making us all look dumb.</p>

<p>We sound much smarter bringing up the obvious facts that lead to intelligent people to connect the dots, compared to looking for stars and symbols and claiming Satan worshipping. Let&#39;s stick to the facts that are undeniable proof our govt is being ran by sick people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me as you a question you fucking idiot, if you are walking down the street and someone is standing on a corner screaming about the end of the world and saying all kind of hyperbolic shit with nothing to back it up are you going to believe them?  </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s say that someone walks up to you, with facts in hand, and says here is whats happening, here is how it&#39;s effecting you, and here&#39;s what you can do.  There&#39;s something called tact, learn it and use it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same method that religion uses.  Especially something like Scientology.  And yes, they are horrible, but this works.  They don&#39;t start off with &quot;L Ron is God and Xenu is real&quot;, that would come off as fucking insane.  No. They start off with the facts that they know they can hook you with, and then once they have you, then they start to present you the more questionable aspects that are harder to prove (can be outright disproven).  They don&#39;t do this becuase it&#39;s easier, they do this because it fucking works.  </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t self censorship, this is using the same tactis used to control others against them to ensure that your point isn&#39;t discounted whole sale.  If you can&#39;t see that then you are doomed to fail and they have already won.  </p>

<p>Learn how to use their own games agains them, and maybe you&#39;ll get further.  If you refuse to do that, then good fucking luck ever getting out from under their control.</p>

<p>&quot;Self censorship&quot;.  No.  Use your fucking brain you goddamn idiot.  </p>

<p>You want to know why no one is taking this shit seriously?  This type of fucking thinking, that&#39;s why.  There&#39;s a way to use what they do to us against them.  You will never win fighting the system head on, it is bigger then you and designed to push you down.  So you have to learn how to use it against them.  This isn&#39;t rocket science, this is literally day one teaching of The Art of War.  Maybe study up on this and psyops and you will learn a thing or two, and maybe then you can actually start to make some semblance of a difference not just screaming into the wind on Reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually quite a lot of people are taking this seriously, as they should be. I do agree that perhaps coming out of the gate with the Satanism and cannibalism might not be the best strategy. That being said, I&#39;d love to ignore that stuff too but unfortunately it&#39;s looking to be quite a serious part of the case. We should all be careful how we present this information indeed. We also must not hold back on presenting the evidence as it appears and Hillary literally says in one email that she will be &#39;in her backyard sacrificing a chicken to Moloch&#39; So you see how this whole thing is a bit difficult to deal with.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am in no way advocating for the ignoring of these issues.  I&#39;m just saying a bit of tact needs to be used.  Introduce people to the more believable and proveable aspects of the case.  Once that is done, and they have bought in, then introduce them to the more outlandish and harder to prove aspects.  </p>

<p>You couldn&#39;t give a better example ;)</p>

<p>People don&#39;t realize they need to adjust the message to the audience too if they sincerely want to be heard. That&#39;s not censorship that&#39;s just logic. It certainly won&#39;t work by calling anyone who disagrees to fck off!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do raise some good points. I agree with a lot of what you are talking about but there is also an acute need for a public awareness campaign so the public is on the right side. Call it COINTEL, call it me being an idiot and pissing in the wind. Any type of censorship is bad censorship. There is a need for transparency in all institutions. Scientology engages in human trafficking and forced labor, possibly torture, depending on the definition. Anonymous raising awareness of that on 4chan wayyyyy back when, was an amazing thing. It was transparency where there was obscurity, and a lot of people were deterred from potentially joining a cult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, don&#39;t call me &quot;bud&quot; I&#39;m not a child, nor do I appreciate being spoken to as such. </p>

<p>Secondly I never claimed Scientology was good or wasn&#39;t up to horrible things. I think you missed the ENTIRE point of that being brought up. </p>

<p>I also NEVER said don&#39;t discuss these things. Once again you&#39;ve seemingly missed the entire point of my post. In fact I am saying you can discuss these things, but you shouldn&#39;t lead off with them. </p>

<p>At NO POINT did endorse or encourage censorship. Honestly i am concerned at this point you don&#39;t even know what that word means. The only people who brought up censorship were people who woefully misinterpreted the point. Something I may add quite a few other managed not to do. Which makes me think the message may not be the problem, but maybe your own inherent biases at play. </p>

<p>Either way, believe what you want. I&#39;m done after this as the condescension and refusal to acknowledge the basic facts of the post , even as you may agree with some of it, are enough to make me realize any further discussion with you regarding this is a waste of my and your time. </p>

<p>Edit:  I will add, sometimes there is a need for censorship actually. Such as times of war. Do you want to broadcast to your enemy everything you do?  Saying something is &quot;never good&quot; is just as, if not more, dangerous to the larger whole. I don&#39;t advocate censorship, as stared, but I also understand that sometimes there is a need and reason for it. Another example, should the police let someone know they are investigating them?  Should they show their hand or be tactful about it?  Call it censorship call it operation security call it whatever you want. Sometimes its about choosing when and how to address a situation. Its not always best to just take to the streets and start screaming about everything you can. You catch more flies with honey and all that, after all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what the fuck would you call what I&#39;m doing?  I&#39;m calling for people to be smart. You are telling me what to talk about, all while telling me not to do that exact thing to others. The height of hypocrisy might I add. So what example would you be referring to?  Your hypocritical one , the one I have laid out, or something else entirely that we have yet to discuss?  </p>

<p>You can call that crying. I like to call I educating a stupid to fuck on reddit. I guess we can agree to disagree as you can&#39;t win em all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe keep reading instead of discounting people after one sentence. That&#39;s just ignorant and highly dangerous. </p>

<p>Honestly why would you even admit that?  It just makes you look ignorant and unwilling to see any side but your own. Sorry, but I doing believe in living life that way. If someone writes something I disagree with I don&#39;t just read one sentence and then launch into an attack. That just makes me the asshole not the other way around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am in no way advocating for the ignoring of these issues.  I&#39;m just saying a bit of tact needs to be used.  Introduce people to the more believable and proveable aspects of the case.  Once that is done, and they have bought in, then introduce them to the more outlandish and harder to prove aspects.  </p>
