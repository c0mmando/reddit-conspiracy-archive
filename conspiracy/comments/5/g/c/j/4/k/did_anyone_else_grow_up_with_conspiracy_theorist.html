        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This has always been a little interesting to me.</p>

<p>Sometimes I&#39;ll see people comment about how hard it is to talk about any kind of conspiracy theories with their parents or family members. I&#39;ve also seen a lot of people mention that they have no one outside of the internet that they can talk to about this sort of thing without people thinking they&#39;re crazy.</p>

<p>Whenever I see those comments, I feel very grateful that I grew up with a mother who is very into conspiracy theories as well as stuff like UFOs, ET, abductions, etc.</p>

<p>I know that I would have grown to be an entirely different person than I am now, and possibly less open minded, if I hadn&#39;t had a mother that encouraged me to question everything. She always told my brother and I to not automatically believe everything we see or hear, even if it&#39;s from the government or even from her.</p>

<p>She never told us what to believe. As an example, if the assassination of JFK came up, she&#39;d tell us what the official story is and then tell us about the various theories that are out there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very glad that I&#39;m able to share a lot of the posts and comments from this sub with her and have really great discussions about them.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m just curious how many others here grew up like that also.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also curious about the people here who <em>didn&#39;t</em> grow up in that kind of household, and how and when they discovered the wonderful world of conspiracy theories or when they started to question the narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in the 50&#39;s and have vivid memories of my father telling me that he thought the earth was hollow and inhabited, and that ufos were very real. Immediately after Kennedy was assassinated, he told me that he thought the CIA was responsible. He was appalled at the Warren Commission report. He researched this for years and actually gave speeches to local groups like Rotary Club to try to get the word out.
I also recall watching tv on our big black and white console television with tubes, (20&quot; screen housed in a furniture cabinet)  and he told me that someday televisions would be so thin that they would hang on the wall like pictures. Sadly, he died before this became a reality. He taught me to always question everything, to always seek the truth. I miss him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aww, that really sucks that he never got to see that thought of his become reality. </p>

<p>He sounds like an awesome man who was way ahead of his time!</p>

<p>Also, that&#39;s crazy (not in a bad way) that he thought about the hollow earth theory back then. For some reason I assumed that it was a relatively &quot;new&quot; theory, no idea why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what makes this even more incredible, in retrospect, is that there was no internet then. There were very limited sources for investigations of this sort. No YouTube, no Wikipedia, only three network channels on tv, and they sure weren&#39;t covering anything like this. News came from the local newspaper and tv. He had to really dig and read a lot of books to do his research. He was not an educated man, having only completed the 8th grade before leaving school to work in order to help his family. I don&#39;t know who encouraged him in his quest for truth, but I&#39;m so grateful to have had him as my dad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Grew up brainwashed like most American children, believing everything I was taught and never questioning anything. I think what got me started was the Lochness Monster when I was about 11. I was obsessed for some reason, I <em>knew</em> it was real but everything telling me that it wasn&#39;t only made me want to find more proof and I picked up every book I could on ol&#39; Nessie. </p>

<p>Fast forward 14 years and I think I&#39;m backwards brainwashed now. Refuse to believe anything anyone tells me and always looking for the darker underside to everything. It&#39;s a blessing and a curse. I don&#39;t get to just <em>think</em> anymore, rather hyper analyze to death.</p>

<p>Lochness Monster is still real as fuck though I don&#39;t care what you people say</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how I was as a kid...Bigfoot, Yeti, Nessie, UFOs- I couldn&#39;t get enough of it. I have always felt that it was more beneficial to learn all sides of a subject, even the sides you aren&#39;t necessarily on board with, in order to make a well educated decision as to where your belief lies. There aren&#39;t many people I can talk about these with, I feel they think I go home and put on my tinfoil hat before bed lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was super obsessed with the loch Ness monster as a kid too. It&#39;s pretty much what started my 5 year obsession with dinosaurs, lol.</p>

<p>Instead of barbies or dollhouses, I&#39;d ask for those big bags of tiny plastic dinosaurs to make dioramas with.</p>

<p>Atlantis was a big one too. My whole family would sit around very often to watch shows about atlantis, Bigfoot, loch Ness monster and the Bermuda triangle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! Atlantis still fascinates me as well as the Bermuda Triangle. That&#39;s awesome you grew up where that kind of thinking was encouraged, it was probably very helpful long term in the &quot;seeing through the bullshit&quot; realm, I&#39;d imagine. </p>

<p>Oh man, me too. Those kind of things were what made me even look for this sub in the first place.</p>

<p>This account is one of my newer ones, but I&#39;ve been on reddit for probably 7 or 8 years now at this point. (I just don&#39;t like sticking to one account for too long.) Weirdly though, I didn&#39;t look for a sub like this one for a few good years, like it just didn&#39;t occur to me reddit would have this community.</p>

<p>I do think the government and political stuff is important, but I get excited and happy when other topics pop up. I check <a href="/r/aliens">/r/aliens</a> and <a href="/r/ufos">/r/ufos</a> pretty much daily, like I do here, but it&#39;s rare anything really good pops up there. </p>

<p>Edit: totally forgot was I was gonna say half way through my post. </p>

<p>I am a parent now, and this topic has been on my mind as far as how to handle it with my children. I don&#39;t wanna be like &quot;Santa isnt real, 9/11 was an inside job and dystopia is nigh&quot; lol, but I will definitely encourage open dialogue, for them to think critically and question the information and views they are presented, to take into account biases and to make decisions for themselves. May also pass them down certain literature of mine as they get older (1984, We, etc). </p>

<p>Yeah, that makes sense. You want kids to be prepared for reality and adulthood, but not so much that they&#39;d have to carry the burden of all the bad shit going on, or end up worrying when they don&#39;t need to. </p>

<p>Definitely seems like a tricky balance, but your plan, in my opinion, sounds like the perfect way to go about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My parents pretty much fostered open discussion for most topics and conspiracies weren&#39;t a problem. So here are some from my dad, a WW2 vet who is now deceased. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pearl Harbor was an inside job and Tojo was <strong>IN</strong> the White House when it was planned. </p></li>
<li><p>Patton wanted to invade Russia after Germany fell, his superiors didn&#39;t want that so they killed him. His death was no accident.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Aside from this, my dad would often tell us stories about how my uncle, his brother, was a mason and would flash his ring and get out of shit. </p>

<p>As for my mom&#39;s side, my grandfather (in title only) and his wife (not my grandmother) were Eastern Stars and my mom often spoke of strange rituals she heard they did. </p>

<p><strong><em>11 October 1963</em></strong> - 5 weeks before the coup.</p>

<p>McNamara and Taylor&#39;s recommendations included an appraisal that &quot;great progress&quot; was being made in the Vietnam War against Viet Cong insurgents, that 1,000 military personnel could be withdrawn from South Vietnam by the end of 1963, and that a <strong><em>major part of the U.S. military task can be completed by the end of 1965.</em></strong> The U.S.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Action_Memorandum_273">National Security Action Memorandum 273</a></p>

<p><strong><em>26 November 1963</em></strong> -  one day after former President John F. Kennedy&#39;s funeral.</p>

<p>The immediate response of the U.S. government to its sudden realization that the political and military situation in South Vietnam was not good was to expand the U.S.&#39;s role in the Vietnam War. NSAM 273 had defined the &quot;central object&quot; of the U.S. &quot;to assist the people and Government [of South Vietnam] to win their contest against the externally directed and supported Communist conspiracy.&quot; Escalating the U.S objectives, on 22 January 1964 the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent McNamara a memo declaring &quot;victory&quot; to be the U.S. objective and recommending that the U.S. <strong><em>put aside many of the self-imposed restrictions which now limit our efforts and undertake bolder actions which may embody greater risks.</em></strong> </p>

<p>I was 13 when it happened and the whole thing just didn&#39;t sit right with me. I mean, more the way the media talked about and the reaction of my peers and adults. It wasn&#39;t until about a year later when I met my best friend (still is) that I got &#39;initiated&#39; into everything.</p>

<p>His parents were of the full blown variety and he was a very critical thinker in his own right. The absolutely awashed me in shit as soon as they found out I had questions about this stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up brainwashed with brainwashed parents. But I was blessed with having a way of thinking outside of the box, to question everything, and to think of any situation from as many angles as I can.</p>

<p>[True story]</p>

<p>One day when I was 17 (2007), I was hanging out at a friends house. We were smoking weed and he pulled up a youtube video that he said was crazy and I had to check out. It was an interview with Bill Cooper on some Canadian radio station. I was fascinated by it. So I decided to start looking into some of the stuff. Never stopped. I ended up buying his book (behold a pale horse) a few years later. That was my first read. I researched many topics after that. Then found out who Alex Jones is. People doubt him, and mock him, but a lot of the stuff he covers I already knew from my own research. So it&#39;s out there to be found if you look hard enough. </p>

<p>Since then I have been able to get my dad into everything. Mom is very stubborn and thinks it all <em>might</em> be true but doesn&#39;t want to think about it. My 2 younger brothers are starting to understand a small fraction of what I have been saying is true during this election year.</p>

<p>One of the things I am big into is all the hidden hints, messages, warnings, ect.. that are in movies, TV, shows, and especially music. It&#39;s wild once you wake up and actually listen to lyrics, there is so much that comes out and nobody realizes.   </p>

<p>Side note: I do believe that there are alien beings on this planet, but I tend to lean more on the side that they are fallen angels (I am a christian.)  But I do not know for certain. I only believe when I see clear proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My parents were poor but average and rarely discussed politics . We watched network tv and news every night and that&#39;s where we got our information.  When I was around 14 the internet became available to me and 9/11 happened around the same time. I seen some signs protesters had that said 9/11 was an inside job. And that got me going. Then YouTube happened and it was all over. I have been sucked in ever since. And probably have read on every topic.I fell off the conspiracy wagon for a few years. But then I found reddit . I am sort of new to reddit. Only a couple years and it has renewed my interests in conspiracy theorys. I have never been as interested though in a conspiracy topic as I am to pizzagate.  I believe it is what will be the end of their reign. Typical Americans let alot of shit slide. But not pedophilia </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTbIu8Zeqp0">Zeitgeist</a> with my sister probably got the ball rolling. Also just general anti-authoritative-knowledge, i.e. when I told my 10th grade science teacher that lightbulbs (incandescent) emit sound energy in addition to heat and light energy, and he denied me my smug satisfaction by saying they didn&#39;t. Just because your old deaf ears can&#39;t hear it doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t heard. There&#39;s even fucking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-ymYOanCgI">ASMR videos</a> now to prove my point.</p>

<p>I bet he has no clue what he started inside me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up brainwashed by TV. But then I gave up TV completely in 1993. In 1998, stories on the web of Vince Foster sounded believable given the long list of other Clinton corruption. 1999 was the last time I voted for a major party candidate (except for Ron Paul).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never had anyone near me who questioned anything on a deep level. I started questioning things in my teens, just not blindly buying anything I was told. I understood how incredibly fucked the world is and in my late teens I also realised that it didn&#39;t need to be. I started to look for answers for why this is. And into the rabbit hole I went. </p>

<p>Honestly, a blue pilled existence is preferable. Knowing all this shit and the theories surrounding it probably increases the odds of me surviving when SHTF. But if shit never hits the fan it&#39;s wasted knowledge because none of us will every be able to change anything. I&#39;m planning on trying to leave all this shit behind and continuing to live out my existence with a solid disaster plan in place. It&#39;s fucking addicting though because I think all of us who spend time here crave answers. But I think the reality is that we won&#39;t ever get any real answers unless TPTB want us to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a freshman in high school (2005 i think) in English class and somehow 911 got brought up and this less popular but really cool kid (funny how that works) mentioned how 911 might not have happened according to the official story...the entire class laughed at him and he mentioned there was some evidence...I thought what he did was really brave and I went home and looked into it and I&#39;ve never been the same since...very grateful for him I&#39;m not sure how long it would&#39;ve took me to wake up otherwise and on top of that I started smoking weed around then and realized quickly it was being suppressed as a safe potentially medicinal alternative to alcohol and all the hidden corruption started getting very clear</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I learned about it while working on my Monte Carlo outside. My friend that I had not met before was outside downing a huge glass of Crown Royal and coke. He called me over and we got to talking. He told me about all the crazy shit going on and informed me he was a former Army Ranger which gave credence to his information. I never took it serious till I got out of the Navy and started to really think for myself. </p>

<p>Edit: that and some serious Peyote sessions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Grandfather loved telling me horror stories of an astroid, and the effects it would have in my mid 30s. Told me to get a hammock so could sleep through aftershocks from chain-reaction earthquakes from impact. And that man made &#39;cough fracking cough&#39; earthquakes were intentional and necessary to remove &#39;stress knots&#39; in geological plate tectonics. These were to make global impact less... severe.
Also something something about an entire hidden civilization in the Yucatan covered by forests, guarded by cartels. They would later be revield via wildfires. Oh the treasures within.</p>
