        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They are real. I studied this extensively in college. The main purpose is to reduce self esteem so that we buy stuff to make us feel worthy again or to turn us into savages to divide us or to convince you that your paycheck determines your worth. This has been going on for decades and it works. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Mind = Garden</p>

<p>Garden needs nutrition and positive elements to be luscious. </p>

<p>90% of media acts like poison on the mind. This is intentional for the most part. </p>

<p>Poison destroys garden and creates a wasteland. </p>

<p>The end goal is destruction of the mind. </p>

<p>Best bet is to shut down TV especially with kids around so the mind can heal. Stay away from anything that induces fear or reduces self esteem or is physically/psychologically violent. Be careful even with comedies and children&#39;s flicks. These media are meant to distort the mind. </p>

<p>My theory is that there is some sort of a final approval group for media. The private sector makes the films and the government approves them. Either that or the government let&#39;s everything go through without discrimination so that the bad stuff flows unhindered. </p>

<p>Note: This is way worst than what the average American believes it to be. Wayyyy worst. Poison media has done much more damage overtime than can be understood. Media poison makes 9-11 look like no big deal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>heh..the first comment says some guys teacher said it was anti-antisemitism. </p>

<p>im actually a jew and unlike most of the JIDF trolls that watch this place and downvote everything thats &quot;anti-semitic&quot; , i try to actually discuss things here and not try to persuade people with talmudic logic and word play. </p>

<p>The elites are indeed the ashkenazim- or better yet the &quot;khazars&quot; ...as to whether or not we&#39;re an alien race of peoples..that i am not so sure about, but i am 100% sure we are VERY, very different than you gentiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Duuuude, I just watched this video about Jewish ritual child sacrifice throughout history, and it&#39;s fucking compelling. I mean they had conviction after confession after <em>race-wide nation-wide ostracision</em> after a whole lot of the cases, and they showed cases as recently as the 1980s, with Jewish peeps trying to pass vials of human blood through customs. </p>

<p>How the fuck do I look at you guys the same way. Seriously, I don&#39;t wanna feel this. So... You guys quit all that shit, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought that movie was really silly aside from the subversive narrative behind ads. I just watched it yesterday, too, and oh man.. &quot;I&#39;m here to kick ass, and chew bubble gum, and I&#39;m all out of bubble gum&quot;. It was like, he was in a grocery store five minutes before that, then he sees the gross old lady, so he&#39;s like &quot;eww gross, your face is fucking disgusting&quot;, and she calls the ugly police because uh oh, so then he fights &#39;em real good, then goes the bank and decides he&#39;d better start killin&#39; the gross things. </p>

<p>Plus the whole <em>bajillion minute long</em> &quot;<strong>put on the glasses!!!</strong> fight scene. Or the gratuitous &quot;I&#39;m shovelin&#39; so hard with ma shirt off right now&quot; scene. Or the love interest as played by ice-eyes lady, and all that silliness. They did have smokey-voiced black guy, though, which was really cool in a nostalgic way.</p>

<p>I just felt no connection to any of the characters, I guess. I feel like I could have made a much better movie with the same resources. </p>

<p>I do wish it would have been done better, though, because it&#39;s a good idea that needs spreading. </p>
