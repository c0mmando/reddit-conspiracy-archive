       They are real. I studied this extensively in college. The main purpose is to reduce self esteem so that we buy stuff to make us feel worthy again or to turn us into savages to divide us or to convince you that your paycheck determines your worth. This has been going on for decades and it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind = Garden
      </p>
      <p>
       Garden needs nutrition and positive elements to be luscious.
      </p>
      <p>
       90% of media acts like poison on the mind. This is intentional for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poison destroys garden and creates a wasteland.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end goal is destruction of the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best bet is to shut down TV especially with kids around so the mind can heal. Stay away from anything that induces fear or reduces self esteem or is physically/psychologically violent. Be careful even with comedies and children's flicks. These media are meant to distort the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that there is some sort of a final approval group for media. The private sector makes the films and the government approves them. Either that or the government let's everything go through without discrimination so that the bad stuff flows unhindered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: This is way worst than what the average American believes it to be. Wayyyy worst. Poison media has done much more damage overtime than can be understood. Media poison makes 9-11 look like no big deal.

       I remember watching it a long time ago, and thinking it was a strange and shitty movie.  It is still a shitty movie, LOL, but the message is not so strange anymore.  Watch it for the message, and not the acting.

       Yeah no that was actually really terrible. lol Are you maybe an 80s kid? I watched it yesterday and I physically cringed when he said that. Like when they had the lead actress in Alien say "so who do I have to fuck to get a drink around here?". Like it's a fetish for bad one-liners that lasted a decade..

       yea man nostalgia really warps perception of things. I think its a john carpenter movie too, and the music from the film is something im really fond of too.

       That whole fight scene was an allegory of our struggles in trying to get a 9/11 faither to look at contrarian evidence like nanothermite. Those glasses are to my experience, essentially the 'beyond-misinformation.pdf' -- read it dammit.. READ IT

       This is a thread matches my recent question....  I thought of Foster Gamble and how does he now . Why did he conduct 'Thrive ' while he's such a rich? Is it natural to concider that he's rather a member of elite constructing the world order , so he needless to do that .

       heh..the first comment says some guys teacher said it was anti-antisemitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       im actually a jew and unlike most of the JIDF trolls that watch this place and downvote everything thats "anti-semitic" , i try to actually discuss things here and not try to persuade people with talmudic logic and word play.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites are indeed the ashkenazim- or better yet the "khazars" ...as to whether or not we're an alien race of peoples..that i am not so sure about, but i am 100% sure we are VERY, very different than you gentiles.

       Duuuude, I just watched this video about Jewish ritual child sacrifice throughout history, and it's fucking compelling. I mean they had conviction after confession after
       <em>
        race-wide nation-wide ostracision
       </em>
       after a whole lot of the cases, and they showed cases as recently as the 1980s, with Jewish peeps trying to pass vials of human blood through customs.
      </p>

       How the fuck do I look at you guys the same way. Seriously, I don't wanna feel this. So... You guys quit all that shit, right?

       I dont doubt that the elites/religous ones  get involved in that shit. Id say most jews in the USA though are not involved in any of that, let alone even religous. But..im sure the numbers are over represented when it comes to that stuff

       I thought that movie was really silly aside from the subversive narrative behind ads. I just watched it yesterday, too, and oh man.. "I'm here to kick ass, and chew bubble gum, and I'm all out of bubble gum". It was like, he was in a grocery store five minutes before that, then he sees the gross old lady, so he's like "eww gross, your face is fucking disgusting", and she calls the ugly police because uh oh, so then he fights 'em real good, then goes the bank and decides he'd better start killin' the gross things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus the whole
       <em>
        bajillion minute long
       </em>
       "
       <strong>
        put on the glasses!!!
       </strong>
       fight scene. Or the gratuitous "I'm shovelin' so hard with ma shirt off right now" scene. Or the love interest as played by ice-eyes lady, and all that silliness. They did have smokey-voiced black guy, though, which was really cool in a nostalgic way.
