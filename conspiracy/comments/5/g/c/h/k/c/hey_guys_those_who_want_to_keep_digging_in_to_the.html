<p>I&#39;d like to point out this information is pretty hard to uncover using google. But point being, it seems rather clear a lot of pedophiles have been working for the government. For awhile now</p>

<p>Edit: spelling corrections </p>

The organization doesn&#39;t particularly care about losing small fries. Any attempt to expand the investigation is suppressed and anyone who starts singing is either painted as a crazy or killed. That is how they get away with it. It is so brazen as to be unbelievable.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that too, especially when recent discussions get in the way. I like to use lots of double-quoted phrases and then also subtract double-quoted phrases, and then also set the date range to before Pizzagate was a thing.</p>

<p>No other search engines seem to have this functionality. It&#39;s a little disconcerting defining my search so much that Google knows exactly what I&#39;m looking for, but meh.</p>
