       I'd like to point out this information is pretty hard to uncover using google. But point being, it seems rather clear a lot of pedophiles have been working for the government. For awhile now

       That's the worst bit, these people operate in plane sight and do get caught from time to time, but the investigation always ends there. The organization doesn't particularly care about losing small fries. Any attempt to expand the investigation is suppressed and anyone who starts singing is either painted as a crazy or killed. That is how they get away with it. It is so brazen as to be unbelievable.

       Or they become the fall-guy doing jail time to protect the network and stop the investigation from going higher up the predator chain like Jared Fogle.

       I've noticed that too, especially when recent discussions get in the way. I like to use lots of double-quoted phrases and then also subtract double-quoted phrases, and then also set the date range to before Pizzagate was a thing.

       No other search engines seem to have this functionality. It's a little disconcerting defining my search so much that Google knows exactly what I'm looking for, but meh.
