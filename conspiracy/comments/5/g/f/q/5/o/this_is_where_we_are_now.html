        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t post this here unless I believed in what I&#39;ve heard and seen, from the rational and educated folks that research their opinions, and do a good job of illustrating them. </p>

<p>There are definitely some whack jobs on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  It&#39;s unfortunate.  But this is the best position I can find to post my opinions, and hope that they will be well received.  It&#39;s obvious that there are entities that attempt to subvert this forum... but I can only hope that someone, somewhere can benefit from my thoughts. </p>

<p>The problem regarding child exploitation is one of the most important issues we will ever deal with. </p>

<p>This is one of the most important issues of the 21st century and it&#39;s getting no coverage at all.  I&#39;m talking about the problems regarding pedophilia, and the security of our nation regarding the overwhelming corruption of our traditional media. </p>

<p>WE are the journalists. And a journalist&#39;s prerogative has to be presenting facts in a manner that is defensible and strong. Emotional outbursts do nothing but hurt us.</p>

<p>It is extremely important, at this PARTICULAR point in HISTORY, to be both vigilant and RATIONAL. There&#39;s never been an internet before. We are at an inflection point. If we allow ourselves to become overly emotional, it will completely deflate the facts and research that so many of us have worked on.</p>

<p>I love all you guys. I know I&#39;m just a talker among many talkers. But this is really important shit that we are dealing with. Like I said, this is an inflection point the likes of which we have never seen, because we can all communicate with relative freedom. It&#39;s very possible that if we cannot convert on that freedom, we might never see it again.</p>

<p>But we are at a turning point, and each one of you are way more important than many think you are, possibly including yourselves. We need to have a major obligation to humanity to do the right things, right now.</p>

<p>And before I get a ton of questions, yeah, I&#39;m talking about Rome, and I&#39;m talking about Pizza, and I&#39;m talking about the very likely scenario that we have worked out, which makes an awful lot of sense in light of recent history. That is the key to everything: trapping someone powerful in a perverted web, and then using that as a brute-force blackmail technique to exert control.  And I&#39;m not extolling that method, but that is the method that some of our most powerful political entities are utilizing. </p>

<p>EDIT: In response to what someone said, I&#39;m not saying we should blackmail anyone.  I&#39;m saying that&#39;s how TPTB are enforcing their will on the people they instill in power.  My statements are a reinforcement of what I&#39;ve seen and researched.  I could have probably worded that better.  </p>

<p>This is NOT a call to action.  It&#39;s a reinforcement of the efforts that this sub has shown, and I&#39;ve been enlightened by the things I&#39;ve seen here.  But I certainly am not advocating any kind of particular action at this time.  I&#39;ve got my eyes open though..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I 100% back what you are saying. We can&#39;t stray form this and need to keep up the research on this because of how important this is. Not only that, but we NEED to get this information out there to as many people as possible. I&#39;ve been posting regular updates and articles on my facebook page about it because that is definitely the best way to reach people, despite this attack by the elites concerning fake news (e.g. Pizzagate).</p>

<p>We are <em>so</em> close to unearthing this monumental issue and waking up the public of America, I mean it happened in Parliament in the UK years ago and involved very high ranking members of the House of Lords. It has happened in Canada. It does happen and has been happening in the country for a long time, and we have to try to help people understand that the American government is not devoid of evil or corruption, and this is the best way to show that, IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The crux of my argument is I guess that we need to be professional about it.  The burden of proof is actually on us even though we are innocent (as a whole).  By us, I mean the people who are willing to investigate this kind of thing, to our own detriment.  To be clear, I thought your post was much along the lines of how I think. </p>

<p>I found it amazing that Jimmy Saville got away with what he did, and that was just the tip of the iceberg.  He was a TV star who was molesting cancer kids and the entire media and government was willing to look the other way.  And that&#39;s just the one single most popular example, and no one ever even mentions him, on either side of the pond.  It&#39;s like it never happened. </p>

<p>Then you consider that those kinds of perversions go deep into government... it&#39;s a VERY scary thought</p>

<p>We are facing an enemy that is so strong that we NEED to be professional and thorough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course we need to be professional and thorough, but what worries me is what could come about from this if it goes south. Yes, people have brought a MASSIVELY important issue into the light thanks to citizen investigation and journalism, and I do have very high hopes for this, but what if people/news media/law enforcement looks the other way? That thought scares me, especially because these people are arguably some of the most powerful in the world. I just hope this investigation and the evidence accumulated so far can help people come to a realization of what kind of people are residing in this government, and brings about the justice and change that is needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might come down to personal sacrifice that doesn&#39;t amount to anything.  There&#39;s a non-zero chance that you will disappear and not effect a thing.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the decision you&#39;re making when you talk about and poke into this kind of shit</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not willing to die, then just get as far away as you can.  I strongly, personally believe that this pedophile ring is the crux of the whole fucking show.  </p>

<p>Me personally, I have little to lose.  I&#39;m willing to die for these kids, and the FUTURE kids that are surely going to be exploited unless there&#39;s a sea change.  Don&#39;t take that as a challenge or a statement of strength, or weakness.  I wouldn&#39;t blame anyone for just getting the fuck out and living their life.  There&#39;s little chance that we will make a difference on our little forum, compared to the risk we are taking, RIGHT NOW.  And I hate that risk. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no judgment if you&#39;re not willing to sacrifice yourself, at least not from me.  But yes, you are on the firing line talking about this kind of shit.  This is the front line of corruption. </p>

<p>EDIT:  I re-read your post and it&#39;s smart.  The problem is, they are ALREADY looking the other way.  We&#39;ve passed that point. </p>

<p>I love the term citizen investigation.  I&#39;m keeping that. </p>

<p>I have no doubt in my mind that many will come under scrutiny for spreading this information. Quite honestly I am sure I&#39;m already under scrutiny and am ok with that, but if I were given the opportunity to die for this and these children I definitely would as well. </p>

<p>My only hope is that if we get enough people to see this information and talk about it, that they have no choice but to not turn their heads away from this. And thanks! I like the term as well.</p>

<p>And yeah.. we&#39;re being watched.  Hell, my MOM is probably being watched for her roast beef recipes.  </p>

<p>Anyway, if I could figure out what to actually do, I would do it.. not that I would do violence or &quot;break the law&quot;.. but the web is so convoluted and deep and dangerous that I don&#39;t even know where to start. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s strong evidence that the elite are using child sex as both a tool and a weapon, and I&#39;m just not willing to tolerate that anymore. </p>

<p>I wish I could do more than just talk.  Don&#39;t take that as a declaration of violence or treason. </p>

<p>Ohh god I know right? I&#39;ve definitely gotten more paranoid this past year about being watched for various things. Even just for visiting wikileaks. </p>

<p>There is certainly strong evidence for it, and I think it&#39;s just a matter of time now before something significant happens with all of this. And no, I personally wouldn&#39;t do anything irrational right now with all this. Violence is definitely the wrong way to go about this right now; they could easily declare martial law and start gathering people up for pretty much any reason they seem fit. No, I think we need to be careful, but thorough. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, you&#39;re not. You might think that mainstream journalists are letting you down, but that doesn&#39;t mean you get their jobs by default.</p>

<p>Journalism involves actually going out and contacting real people, not endlessly re-jiggling old photos around and &#39;reading the tealeaves&#39; from cherry-picked documents. </p>

<p>It involves the risk of finding out that your theory is wrong. But it also provides you with the chance of improving your theory to reflect the facts better.</p>

<p>Has anyone at all who is contributing to the Mount Everest of speculation called &#39;Pizzagate&#39; actually picked up a phone, or sent an email, or gone to a building to speak to anyone who might be able to tell them what&#39;s going on?</p>

<p>Your task is not to ignore journalists, but to beat them at their own game.</p>

<p>The world is a lot smaller and more easily connected than it used to be.  </p>

<p>And do you think a fucking child molesting cult who runs the country is going to pick up their phone?? Get real.  Investigation by computer and networking, with real hard data gleaned from other computers and networks, THAT IS the future of journalism.  It&#39;s just not pre-packaged by some stooge who gets to process it and tell you what you get to hear anymore. </p>

<p>Ever seen Good Morning Vietnam?  Full Metal Jacket?  The cleansing of the news has been going on for a very long time.  In fact, modern-day computer users are the most pure journalists that we&#39;ve had in the modern era.  You just have to aggregate your sources and use your head, just like when you&#39;re trying to pick which lying bitch-ass news channel or mainstream paper you want to read.  The only difference is that there&#39;s no overriding filter telling you what you&#39;re NOT allowed to see. </p>

<p>The real risk is in the investigation.  People like Seth Rich, Chelsea Manning, Snowden, Michael Hastings, etc,. have shown that if you poke your nose into the wrong hole it will get shot off.  There&#39;s absolutely no personal benefit to propagating an unpopular theory or story, and everything to lose.  And when this community is wrong about something, we are quick to admit it.  The thing is, we&#39;re not often wrong. </p>

<p>Those two sentences are not related. No, of course the Wikileaked emails aren&#39;t fake. But that doesn&#39;t answer why none of the Pizzagate crowd are sending feelers out into the real world, as in <em>&#39;not the internet&#39;.</em></p>

<p>No, you ninny. Obviously evil-doers don&#39;t just cough up the truth when you go near them with a notebook. This isn&#39;t a fairy-tale.</p>

<p>I guess I hit a nerve somewhere</p>

<p>I never said you couldn&#39;t &quot;say what you said&quot; or whatever ridiculous strawman you&#39;re trying to construct.  It&#39;s actually pretty funny how indignant you are. </p>

<p>Also, how is my simple response over-reactive?  You are projecting harder than a movie theater</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contacting real people can happen over the internet now.  Do you think Wikileaks is fake?  Do you think the Hillary emails are fake?</p>

<p>The world is a lot smaller and more easily connected than it used to be.  </p>

<p>And do you think a fucking child molesting cult who runs the country is going to pick up their phone?? Get real.  Investigation by computer and networking, with real hard data gleaned from other computers and networks, THAT IS the future of journalism.  It&#39;s just not pre-packaged by some stooge who gets to process it and tell you what you get to hear anymore. </p>

<p>Ever seen Good Morning Vietnam?  Full Metal Jacket?  The cleansing of the news has been going on for a very long time.  In fact, modern-day computer users are the most pure journalists that we&#39;ve had in the modern era.  You just have to aggregate your sources and use your head, just like when you&#39;re trying to pick which lying bitch-ass news channel or mainstream paper you want to read.  The only difference is that there&#39;s no overriding filter telling you what you&#39;re NOT allowed to see. </p>

<p>The real risk is in the investigation.  People like Seth Rich, Chelsea Manning, Snowden, Michael Hastings, etc,. have shown that if you poke your nose into the wrong hole it will get shot off.  There&#39;s absolutely no personal benefit to propagating an unpopular theory or story, and everything to lose.  And when this community is wrong about something, we are quick to admit it.  The thing is, we&#39;re not often wrong. </p>

<p>Those two sentences are not related. No, of course the Wikileaked emails aren&#39;t fake. But that doesn&#39;t answer why none of the Pizzagate crowd are sending feelers out into the real world, as in <em>&#39;not the internet&#39;.</em></p>

<p>Gosh.</p>

<p>No, you ninny. Obviously evil-doers don&#39;t just cough up the truth when you go near them with a notebook. This isn&#39;t a fairy-tale.</p>

<p>That sort of conceptual limitation betrays why you are not a journalist.</p>

<p>Haha. No. Or at least, you&#39;d better hope not.</p>
