       Bruh. You don't get to be a real estate tycoon in Jew York City unless you've already passed the establishment exam. You also don't get to be POTUS unless you're already a puppet. The elections are rigged but not by either candidate. Voting does not matter. The person the powers that be want will
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       be the person that wins. No exceptions to that rule.

       Learning the truth actually doesn't depress me, it makes me feel a whole lot better. It's just afterwards when I feel like there is not much I can do or that people think I'm kind of a crazy person fmu. Lol, that's probably all of our trouble. But I'm doing what I can to try and open up more people-trying to get them to ask questions about msm, etc.

       Calling yourself left, a liberal, a socialist or whatever else doesn't work anymore because of how warped our political landscape is. Better to pick new words that means what our current words used to mean so that people don't have all the cultural baggage confusing them.

       What you are saying is true first because the conservatives created and defined what they would identify as liberal, all lies or at best simplified exaggerations and miscellaneous abstractions based on lies about facts.  That all began in earnest soon after Watergate, with full blossoming during Jimmy Carter's Presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       More recently by the libertarians attempting to claim the word liberal as their own where it has a nearly opposite meaning, liberal there being the owner class ruling without any interference from church or state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The national dialog since the 90s when that pissy word progressive was introduced and no one even knows what a conservative government is, has amounted to a successful elimination of what any of the words defining various forms of government means.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me there are only two basic form of governance,
      </p>
      <p>
       One is government from the top down,
      </p>
      <p>
       the other receives  significant direction from all the governed.

       /lol, if you read through political literature from the 40s through now,the word was used only in a historical context, then when the conservatives decided to take over the Democratic Party, feeling the word liberal to be well tarred, they introduced progressive, along with some very not-liberal ideas.

       Oh ok I'll spell it out.  The spectrum of "admiration" goes from lots to none.  You strawmanned my opinion by claiming I have an opinion on this spectrum with regards to you, and inferred the opposite with your comment "viva la difference" as it would relate to your admiration of my opinion.  So you're inferring a negative value judgment on opinions without stating any reasons.  That's shame, in other words.

       I think you forgot it all started because you asked me to do something that is impossible. You wanted me make a point by point statement explaining my avoiding Alex Jones, something made impossible because I have never heard or read enough to do so.
Nor will I. I think of it as leaving that mushroom alone since it seems mighty toxic to me.

       Wow you sure like to strawman.  I didn't ask you to do anything.  I'm not sure where this invention comes from.  You made some rhetorically questionable statements - I called them out.  And now you've created this entire false narrative about what I did.  Awesome.

       Also, out of curiosity, how could you have such strong feelings about AJ but aren't familiar with his work, as you admit?  Maybe that's something to ponder.

       First you must understand there are two groups, not one group trying to gain control of the economies and people of our planet, both are top down control efforts,
      </p>
      <p>
       One wanting to use cooperation between governments and the wealthiest of those governments, and the other group
      </p>
      <p>
       Who prefers to dispense with the idea of nations at all, in favor of direct control by the wealthiest.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Trump talks MAGA, he is actually voicing the message of the anti-national folks, and that vision of America as being the competitive economic winner is not in any way related to the well being of ordinary citizens.

       ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason for this is that the underscore character (this one _ ) is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does (this guy * ).  Since the "face" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the "face" (this guy (ツ) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first "\_" is just saying "hey, I don't want to italicize (ツ)" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type _italicize_ or *italicize* in order to get
       <em>
        italicize
       </em>
       .  Since we put an escape character we have \_italicize_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You
       <strong>
        <em>
         would
        </em>
       </strong>
       need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.
