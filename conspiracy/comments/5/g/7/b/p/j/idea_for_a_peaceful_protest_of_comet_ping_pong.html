<p>Make sure its balanced in the sense that it addresses all the defenses being brought up, and emphasize that no conclusions are being drawn, we just want to raise awareness until the most suspicious aspects are explained. Things like #hotard #murder #killroom, where this digging was taking place, etc etc </p>

<p>Most importantly NO VIOLENCE OR HARASSMENT OF ANY KIND</p>

<p>I think in order for this to be successful you&#39;d need rock solid evidence to be able to show people &quot;LOOK - ALEFANTIS RAPES KIDS&quot;</p>

<p>Ideally this would force the mainstream media to show these instagram photos which they have seemed very reluctant to do</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Did you read my post? I said stand there silently and give them a pamphlet if they ask about the pictures. Don&#39;t say anything about rape or satanism, just show the images and let people decide for themselves. </p>

<p>If you do this, please make sure there are no kids&#39; faces in the pics as to not give them reason to silence us.

    <div class="md"><p>If a protest was to happen it would definitely have to be peaceful because violence automatically discredits whatever information you have gluing the story together. What would happen most likely is that customers would just think &quot;oh those crazy pizza gate people are at it again.&quot; A way to get people interested and away from this thinking would be to print or say something along the lines of &quot;Give me 5 minutes of your time&quot; or &quot;If you look at the all of the information and still don&#39;t believe then...&quot; this will of course will lead people to want to see the information just to disprove it. Maybe having something like a poster board with all of the connections and info or a powerpoint would make it easy for people to &quot;see&quot; the &quot;coincidences&quot; which will I think have a greater impact on the audience.  These are all ideas that unfortunately I wouldn&#39;t be able to take part in :( I live too far away. Also the clothing that the protesters wear will have an impact as well (yes I know it sounds dumb but society is like that) If people see a group of individuals with t-shirts/jeans/sneakers/messy clothing they are more likely to ignore them than a group that is nicely dressed and looks well put together.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a big fan of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for a long time and have posted a lot here myself. I comment on a few and when people post hoaxes like flat earth or no planes then I disagree for a bit then move on. But this whole pizzagate hoax stinks to high heaven. It&#39;s a psyop to push for the public banning of what they&#39;re calling &quot;fake news&quot; sites. The lack of real evidence and the timing makes it all too clear if one really pays attention to such things. </p>

<p>You claim pictures and words are your &quot;evidence&quot;. Similar pictures can be found in art museums all over the world. The words would only be incriminating if you &quot;decoded&quot; them using some alleged pedophiliac code, and even then they don&#39;t really match up. Neither is actual evidence of anything. It&#39;s all innuendo and speculation. There&#39;s no actual evidence of any child ever being hurt by your alleged pizza = pedophilia code.</p>

<p>People speculating on the internet is one thing but once you start with that kind of stuff in real life there will be real consequences. You&#39;re claiming that you abhor violence but actions you say you&#39;re going to take can have no other possible result. It&#39;s what always happens. </p>

<p>Surely ole Jimmy gave him a call?</p>

<p>Podesta could really help him out by explaining wtf hes talking about in these emails.</p>

<p>What stinks to high heaven is that in one day, 2 puff pieces were posted, in the NYT and WaPo, neither of which addressed specific allegations, both of which were deliberately confusing in their description of the allegations, and both of which labeled the accusers as racists and homophobes. The same day snopes puts out a debunking. And the same day <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> is banned</p>

<p>If this was nothing, there would not have been this kind of obviously coordinated response. If you can&#39;t see how fishy it is that&#39;s on you, but if you&#39;re just going to do the same thing as the media - label us as violent, hobophic, or racist then you&#39;re no better than them.</p>

<p>Either engage in discussion or don&#39;t, but don&#39;t try push the MSM narrative of &quot;pizza gate believers are all crazy&quot; because the media&#39;s response is what made me truly believe something was afoot.</p>

<p>No, pizzagate is organic, I&#39;ve been following it from the get go and there have been attempts to stifle and derail it from the get go.
