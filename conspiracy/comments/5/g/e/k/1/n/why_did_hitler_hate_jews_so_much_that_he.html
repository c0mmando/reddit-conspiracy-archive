       That's cute. Can you get me a good source on that, and not some Alex Jones type thing? I need more evidence than a Google page linked to me. I've looked into it which is why I know it's bullshit.

       You're seriously that much of an empty shell that you need to be

       This is the literal definition of a human sheep.  You've shown no ability to think critically thus far.

       I gave you a page with a

       of information in it.  READ THAT.  Some of it will have a better information in it than some other areas.

      <p>
       Again, it's called critical thinking.  Try to use the empty space between your ears for more than eating what the MSM's spoon fed you all your life.

       The Jews actually declared war on Hitler, not Hitler declaring war on the Jews. Just in case you didn't know. People often don't know this tidbit.

       Massacred????  I am sorry to inform you, but those saying Auschwitz was an extermination camp for Jews is an outright fabrication. labor Camp, yes, extermination camp, no.   Hitler ordering the extermination of Jews in these so called ‘death camps’ cannot be found referenced or found in ANY German researched archives, despite the Germans being famous for their meticulous record keeping. No mention of prisoners being gassed were revealed by the code breakers of Bletchey Park and their Enigma machine, Nothing, a big fat Zero!

       There are photographs of German soldiers murdering hundreds of Jews and burying them in mass graves.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what you think about Auschwitz, the fact doesn't change that there was a systematic campaign to murder Jewish men, women and children in German occupied territories.

       Well I suppose the mainstream explanation is that Jews were (according to Hitler) amassing disproportionate amounts of economic power and promoting social degeneracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The explanation put forward by Matt Marriott is that Hitler was an Illuminati agent attempting to destroy Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Matt Marriott, the Bible describes Jews as being God's chosen people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Illuminati wants to destroy them, in order to prove the Bible wrong...

       Jews were a very small percentage of the population in Germany yet they controlled over 50% of media, a large portion of government, and they ran the banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were turning Germany into a wasteland for their own financial benefit.

       There were plenty of Jewish Germans pre WWI. In 1916 Germany was already winning WWI and actually offered peace to Britain and France and said they could basically all go back to pre-war boundaries and let it all go (even though they were winning). The allies turned them down and the war went on. It went on because Britain made a deal with Zionist Jews to basically give them Israel in exchange for getting the US into the war to shift it in Britain/France's favor. To make a long story short the Zionists made good on their part and Germany ended up losing the war just as the Great Depression was hitting. As bad as it was in the US it was way worse in Germany. Hitler came into power by promising to get them out of poverty and blaming Jews for their tipping the scales in WWI. When he came into power he took Germany out of International Banking and did away with the central bank (Jewish ran) in Germany. As Hitler and Germany began to do better there were still Jewish people living fine in Germany. In 1933 there was an international Jewish Declaration of War against Germany. They were basically carrying out an international boycott of Germany to cripple their economy. You have to realize the banking system was run by prominent Jewish figures. Many media (newspapers) even in Germany were Jewish run as well. At this point there were still obviously Jews in Germany as WWII didn't start until 1939. Did Hitler hate Jews? The short answer is yes, but the long answer is that it was a progression and mutual hate that was instigated on both sides by the German powers and the Jewish ones. He didn't just hate Jews because he was some crazy bigoted racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is heavily condensed down but if you research for yourself you will see that Germany would have won WWI if the US had not gotten involved on the opposite side. You will also see that Britain promised Zionists Israel in exchange for getting the US involved in WWI, as well as the Jewish Declaration of War on Germany in 1933.
