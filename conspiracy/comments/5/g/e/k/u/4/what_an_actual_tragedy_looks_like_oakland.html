       First off, here's
       <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-oakland-fire-nine-dead-warehouse-20161203-story,amp.html?client=safari">
        what happened
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no conspiracy here that I've seen. An art collective inside a warehouse in Oakland caught on fire while hosting a dance party with 60-80 people already inside. The poorly constructed building went up in flames which used scrap wood and a choke point makeshift wooden staircase during a rave trapping many of the people in attendance on the top floor. According to multiple witnesses the fire took less than 3 minutes to consume the entire structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is no conspiracy here, why am I posting this?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a perfect example of an actual news story. It's just now getting mainstream traction, and it happened Friday night. It took a tragedy of this magnitude nearly 12-18 hours to gain international media coverage. In fact, the foreign press covered this story faster than the American media.
      </p>
      <p>
       The victims are actual people. I have several close friends who knew people at the venue and who are currently missing. Most of the dead or missing are DJs, musicians, photographers, and event producers who had just finished setting up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been able to find several witness reports in the media, as well as on social media and all the stories match up, and describe the same events.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been able to find multiple eyes witness videos on Twitter, and YouTube as well. Something you almost never see with false flags or terrorist attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't appear to be a false flag, these aren't actors,  and this appears to just simply be a giant tragedy resulting from multiple fire code violations and hazards that unfortunately caused this disaster when combined with some kind of spark or combustion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to study what an actual news story and tragedy looks like this is your chance. Learn from this so you can later distinguish from false flags and fake news narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it's still too early to tell what caused the fire,
       <a href="http://sfist.com/2016/12/03/pre-fire_photos_from_inside_oakland.php#photo-1">
        the building wasn't exactly up to code
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Research this fire, and you'll see what real news looks like. It's so painfully obvious compared to the shit we've been fed this election cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I'm from the Bay Area and my heart goes to everyone affected by this fire. RIP. Please keep the trolling to a minimum, this isn't a conspiracy it actually happened.

       From what I'm hearing, the buildings owner sounds like he has a " I don't need no goverment building codes telling me what to do" mentality.

       I wonder how he's gonna feel about building codes when he's facing several dozen charges of manslaughter.

       Unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most eye witnesses claim the fire started either on the first floor or in the basement. The event producers had just setup for a night of rotating DJs, which means there was probably thousands of dollars worth of DJ equipment and lighting that was brought with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the odds of an electric fire or power surge are high.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing could have easily also been the result of someone smoking inside. The place was a tinderbox.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cause of the fire is currently under investigation, but the party had just started at 11, and the fire started around 11:20ish and had consumed the building by 11:24. So if this was arson why would they set the building on fire before another hundred or so people were about to show up? If the intention was mass casualties had they waited an hour they could have done far more damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was probably just a freak accident.

       Death tolls already at 30 people and they've only searched 20% of the building. So it's still too early to tell what caused the fire. We might not know for weeks or months.

       Why does the city of Oakland demand 30K permit for a basic fire safety sprinkler system. Shouldn't the city encourage fire safety by making it as easy and cheep as possible to comply with safety standards. I received solicitations for money to help build this ship. But how can we build creatively when the cost of a basic sprinkler system permit is outrageous. 30k for a 4" pipe or 50K for a 6" pipe. Safety permits should be free and inspections should be priced on cost of preforming them not a source of income. Other inspections can be do as part of the cities income but not safety.

       Sorry, amigo. Check out the

        east bay MUD "fee schedule"

       for sprinkler hookup.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many organizations in play. If you want to know the total cost on a project, talk to a builder, not the city. 30K in fees is about right, depending on the size of the system.

       You probably are if you believe everything that's told to you without examining it critically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look into the history of the US education system and it's roots in the Prussian model if you still earnestly believe a degree alone makes you an authority.  You should also know that there are exceptions within academia to these dogmatic beliefs as well - so it would seem to me that you need to do some more research and stop trying to rationalize your ignorance :)

       Going to college is a VERY good way to learn or grow the ability to think critically. Not sure where you are getting the "authority" bit, might need to re-read the comment. Anyway, the fact that 60% of the country hasn't completed college means that many people who are - to use your words - going to believe everything that's told to them without examining it critically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: facebook is a great example. The kids I went to school with who share the bulk of conspiracy theories tend to be those who least valued their education and failed to put in significant effort. Or have they discovered some new model of which I am ignorant? Obligatory :)

       Do you know how you pass tests?  You put the answers down that your professor told you to put down.  If you put down the wrong answer, or challenge the conclusions the professor has drawn or the assumptions made then you don't pass the class.  Do you understand that?  Our education system does not encourage people to think critically - it encourages them to memorize and regurgitate.  It sounds like you have no clue what the education system is actually composed of - have you ever studied it's history?  About the Prussian education system as I mentioned?  Here, why don't you prove to me what a good student you are (because from your statements it seems to me that this is completely new material to you) and read The Leipzig Connection if you're unfamiliar - here's a link:

       I don't really care what niche topics you've studied regarding the history of education. You can follow two young Americans from Kindergarten all the way up and come to two completely separate outcomes. Some will fail miserably and may not pursue higher education and others will learn to think critically, as I have. Same education system, entirely different outcomes. You can't blame the education system alone. Family culture, support, and values strongly influence an individual's will to learn and grow. Our education system has produced some of the brightest people in the world, and many not so bright individuals. It's far from perfect, but is not solely to blame.
Edit: I'm not claiming to be a genius, but I think you are making our system out to be far more rudimentary than it is.

       You might want to read that short booklet sometime and stop arguing from a point of assumption - did they teach about that fallacy in college?   It's less than 100 pages and it chronicles the history of our educational system for over 100 years.  If you're earnestly arguing that the American education system hasn't been spiraling downwards into oblivion you not only are not well read on the subject but you're also painful ignorant of today's world.

       The system is not responsible for producing straight A students. Students are responsible for producing straight A students. Maybe I'll get to your 100 page chronicle, though hindsight is always 20/20. Wouldn't you agree that it's more important to be examining, with critical thought, where we are now?

       I don't know where the original comments went, but that's not a swastika, that is a sun symbol.

       The west coast is a very rad place. A lot of people will never understand what's happening there until they go for themselves. It's naive and stupid of people to consider these folks degenerates simply because you don't understand what it is and attribute it to 'pagan deities'

       Right, I've been out to the Bay Area multiple times, (I'm from NY) and people don't understand what hip actually means. These dudes so quick to see a pagan symbol and immediately think animal sacrifice. I use Masonic and mystery school symbolism in all of my music and art projects and it has nothing to do with how I worship.

        Burning Man started next to SF’s Presidio military base, as did the Church of Satan. Later it moved to another military zone, the Lovelock Gunnery Range in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada. Temple of Set founder Michael Aquino was running psychological operations at the Presidio at the time that Burning Man kicked off. The early founders of Burning Man used to spend a lot of time exploring the underground tunnels and bunkers there, which are riddled with Satanic, Nazi, and LSD-related images and paraphernalia.

       The yard had technically been rezoned as a recycling center. The inside was remodeled to become residential without permits and was likely constructed by the people who lived there. They were Burning Man / bohemian types and simply collected all kinds of crap from old musical instruments to wooden statues of Buddha, art, and anything of possible sentimental value.

       I don't disagree with you at all, just find it funny when I catch myself thinking, "Ope, better not do this unless I wanna die like the guy in that one video" when most people don't really think about those types of things at all. I always remember the video of the guy on the moped in an Asian country who hit a concrete road block pretty much full on, got back up and started to drive around it only to just miss it again and fall directly in the hole it was blocking. Not sure if he died, but it's mindless things like that that constantly make me aware of my surroundings. The internet shaped me in some weird ways.

       I never accused them of doing "weird shit" I was simply observing symbolism that was found on their social media, never made  judgements on it.

       There are other comments reaching as well. But for future reference it would look a lot better on your part if you said swastika instead of Nazi symbol.... it's as if you're dismissing its past and assuming these people are using it in a negative way. Understandable explanation though.

       Of course, my friend. No harm done. I just happen to be Buddhist and seeing misconceptions made of such beautiful symbology irks me at times, and to see the association of Nazism with the deaths of all of these beautiful souls saddens me. Thank you for understanding.

       In modern culture, it is also still linked to peaceful religions.. just because Nazis hijacked it in the '40s doesn't mean it lost all previous meaning. It is still a religious symbol, and was used as one in the picture of the altar. Why are you reaching so far as to try and associate these people with Nazis?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: in simpler words, you referred to the skull in the photo as having a "Nazi symbol," when you know damn well swastikas have thousands of years of peaceful history before Hitler fucked it up for all of the religions using it

       <p>
        The motif (a hooked cross) appears to have first been used in Neolithic Eurasia, perhaps representing the movement of the sun through the sky. To this day it is a sacred symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Odinism. It is a common sight on temples or houses in India or Indonesia. Swastikas also have an ancient history in Europe, appearing on artifacts from pre-Christian European cultures.

       Why does the city of Oakland demand 30K permit for a basic fire safety sprinkler system. Shouldn't the city encourage fire safety by making it as easy and cheep as possible to comply with safety standards. I received solicitations for money to help build this ship. But how can we build creatively when the cost of a basic sprinkler system permit is outrageous. 30k for a 4" pipe or 50K for a 6" pipe. Safety permits should be free and inspections should be priced on cost of preforming them not a source of income. Other inspections can be do as part of the cities income but not safety.

       Were there ambulances and actual EMTs at the scene giving real medical help? With all the fake attacks and shootings you don't usually see that. I know at Sandy Hook you had the medical tarps and all that but it was sort of different because they allegedly kept all the injured and dead inside the school which was ridiculous and you didn't see anyone on the tarps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in the Ohio State thing you see lots of cops and even a fire engine (the fire alarm was pulled) but no real medical personnel.

       There wasn't really many injured according to eye witness reports. Only a few people were taken to a hospital.

      <p>
       People either made it out safe or died.

      <p>
       My guess is most people trapped upstairs died of smoke inhalation long before the fire actually got to them.

       It doesn't matter. The guy said he has friends who died there and the top post is " I heard they were all degenerates ". It doesn't matter if he thinks it or not.

      <p>
       The guy
       <strong>
        personally
       </strong>
       lost friends.. You accosted him for saying "fuck you". Think about someone you have lost, if someone immediately commented "I heard

        /u/trump4prez2020

       's dead family member or friend was a degenerate ". It would be hard to expect someone not to react.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, you know, good thing there's someone with wisdom like yours to tell him how adults act, and to "grow up".

       Once again, he never said that is what he believes.  He asked a question.  Perhaps you also need to grow up and stop encouraging being overly sensitive.  I couldn't imagine the world you and your buddy want.  One where personal tragdey warrants everyone to lose all sense of logic.

       I've been to events like this before, and have friends who knew many of the victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       These were mostly Millennial's of the Great Recession. They were typically sound of mind, and generally good people who had been disadvantaged due to globalization and inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who lived there were mostly young adult artists who couldn't afford Bay Area rents and had likely been displaced or priced out of their homes in recent years. Mostly people in poverty with artistic inclinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people attending the event were just young adults looking for a night out dancing and hanging out. Many of the missing are event promoters, DJs, photographers, musicians, and the people who helped setup the upstairs dance area. This group was mostly local event people who are well known in the community and their closest friends who came out for a night of fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       These events usually don't peak capacity wise until midnight, sometimes later, so at 11:20pm many people had just arrived and the party was just getting started.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make of this what you will, this is simply the reality of wealth inequality. I don't think it's fair to label these young adults as degenerates.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's any blame to place it is on the building manager who's responsibility it was the make sure the building was as safe as possible, and the building owner who ignored fire codes. The building had no functioning sprinkler system, fire alarms, or fire extinguishers.
