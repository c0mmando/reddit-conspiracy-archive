       Let me just take this opportunity to say do not let up on this. Stay on these people. We're in great shape right now because we have tons of pizzagate related posts making it to the top of the front page, which will bring tons of attention from the new visitors here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep investigating and just FLOOD this fucking place with anything you find, upvote it, and discuss thoroughly each piece you bring in the comments. I'll admit I know this is a general conspiracy related forum, but I still truly believe Pizzagate, when brought to light, will finally bring these people down and destroy their credibility with the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to drown out Pizzagate related posts with other "rabbit holes" and "dead ends" and upvote them to the top (We've already seen that Upvotes can be purchased online for 10c each). Just stay on it and don't let the momentum die down is my main concern. Doing a killer job so far mates, keep up the good work.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I've noticed the top post about Antarctica is close to the top with 350ish upvotes right now, did you read the first line? "Pizzagate is a distraction from something big!"..There may be some legitimate information worth looking at, but didn't it come at an extremely convenient time? This new random interest in Antarctica? This post is what i'm refering to when I say look out for "Dead End's". Please, judge for yourself, but i think it could potentially be just a little side rabbit hole they're gonna try and lead you down to divert your attention from our investigation into the Elite's involvement in human trafficking. Just be skeptical of every post and comment, but know that probably 90% of us on here are still doing god's work here, and we're behind you all the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Not sure exactly what this means, but I recieved a PM from user "anon31903" who asked me to remove this post. When I refused, he simply replied with "72 hours". Is this a mod? There is no post history with this user when I click on his name.   72 hours for what exactly? Weird....Thought i'd bring it to everyone's attention.

       I think the one problem with leaving reddit (or anywhere else that's overcome with censorship) is that every place people run from is a bit of lost ground in the battle. Eventually you run out of corners to run to. At some point we have to stay somewhere and stand our ground.

       anyone who says there is no evidence doesn't understand what constitutes evidence. He needs a big daddy mainstream authority figure to hold his hand and tell him what to believe because he is a little consciousness baby who should go fuck himself. I admit Pizzagate looked silly at first, but holy fuck is it plain as day if you even take a minute to examine some of the crazy shit that has come out since the beginning.

       Start your own website and leave it unmoderated. If someone has a website and they want to censor, are known to censor, it's their business. You have no more right to tell them how to run it than they would to tell you to run yours.

       It is true that Reddit is openly involved in censorship, and that the main discussion for Pizzagate should take place at Voat, but we should definitely try to dominate the front page here still, because theres at all times at least 300-500 people here on this sub, and around 8:00pm-12:00am there can be as many as 3,200! So think of all those new visitors we can reach. There is a pretty large audience here compared to voat, and many of them are new people who are just sparking an interest in pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Them seeing pizzagate posts at the top of the front page will spark their interest in learning about the elite's involvement in human trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, request to the mods, whats up with this green duck graphic? Could you put the old graphic back up? What was the reasoning for removing it?

       This is a conspiracy related forum. If you're into conspiracies enough to frequent this board, why the hell would you be encouraging other people that they are "kooks" and "crazy" to investigate pizzagate?

       I would think the potential for some of our most prominent world leaders being involved in a human trafficking ring wouldn't be something I could simply "brush off", but I would never discourage anyone from doing research into ANYTHING. That makes me just as bad as the people who call you crazy for thinking 9/11 was an inside job or that JFK was potentially murdered by the government...

       Thats what leads me to believe there is some other motivation for these anti-pizzagate posts.

       Is online conversation ever "open"? If I am at a dinner party and start talking about pedophile conspiracies (not a great dinner guest) people can say what they want, mostly. Some might agree, some might disagree and I will sit there and listen to all parties involved. Or, supposing I don't want to listen to this open conversation, it will take some effort for me to break with social niceties and yell at the person who disagrees, or interrupt others when they speak, or get up from the table to leave. Here's the thing. Online, it is easy to shut people down and shut people out. There is no such thing as an "open" discussion when you can ignore those people who disagree with you by down-voting them, or by closing a window. Having an "open" discussion on this forum requires that individuals intentionally seek-out dissenting opinions, and this (I think) is not a very common practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there is a good general question of whether criminal allegations should be "open" for discussion or whether false allegations should be censored. But such a question, on this forum, presupposes that something like r/pizzagate is an open discussion, which it certainly is not. I have very little trust in the ability of reddit users (people in general - including myself in most areas where i operate without being critical of myself) to seek out those viewpoints that diverge from their own to reach a measured and tentative conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       An aweful lot of the supposed "evidence" in this case seems to be based around the interpretation of swirls (there is an ice cream shop near my house that needs some serious investigation), ties between actors seem largely based on geographical proximity (is the neighbour of a criminal necessarily a criminal as well?), much seems the result of cherry picking a few sentences/images that seem most nefarious or confusing from lists of thousands (if you go through a photo album in my house you will find naked pictures of me as a child getting a bath, pictures of me sleeping, probably pictures of me with injuries, probably some topless groups of men standing around, but out of the hundreds or thousands of photos in my archive this is entirely normal... only by picking them out side by side would they appear to have some nefarious connotations). Still, there are some portions of the evidence that seem to be obviously related to pedophilia and occult imagery (though I wonder how far such themes can be written-off as "art"), and some connections between these actors that seem to indicate high concentration of such imagery (though such concentration may be a result of digging through mass amounts of information), and there do seem to be some oddities that are otherwise highly coincidental (though coincidence can also be the result of combing through mass amounts of information and picking out only the bits that support a certain narrative). It is easy to get caught up in the quality (or lack thereof) of evidence online because there is no "open" discussion here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't think the question of whether conversation should be allowed to be "open" on reddit or other digital forums has much relevance. It is the individuals therein who are the real agents of censorship. We shouldn't be looking to blame reddit or other attempts to control conversation, we should be looking at ourselves and asking if we can be better in seeking an open discussion.

       While at first what you say sounds right, I'm concerned that what is considered substantial is defined by organizations that are outside of our control. For example when CNN does falsely reporting military tactics near Russia (as seen on the front page today), Fox News and MSNBC distort reality to fit Their audiences biases, who am I to decide what is substantial or not. In fact, one might argue that having free and open conversation especially on outlandish topics is the only way to ensure that there is a check on the power of the media.

       Conducting a pedophile witchhunt in public with no evidence is unreasonable. If people are serious about the investigation they would gather and weigh evidence until they discovered something concrete.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far there is nothing even remotely resembling reason for assuming pedophilia. The whole thing it based on a 4chan post randomly assigning code words, then you have to view the world through that code for any of it to make sense. It's outlandish in the extreme.

       That is an excellent point. I agree that MSM really distorts and 100% pushes it's own agenda. Honestly, you're right an open discussion is healthy, but I think when the discussion seeks to paint someone as a pedophile and guilty of running a child sex trafficking ring out of a pizza shop without any concrete proof is harmful to the discourse. By allowing such a thing you are opening the door for anyone to launch such a claim and detract from the true issues that are facing this country right now. This topic in particular really seeks to divide us further and as someone who love this country and want to do anything I can to make it even better, I don't think this discussion serves to do that.

       I'm mostly neutral on the pizzagate thing, but there is the concern of the lack of evidence.  Only going by emails and "supposedly" related pictures.  it only takes one person to pull a snowden.

       Won't lie, I've been following mostly headlines and discussions from here on the subject. I've heard there's no proof and then rebuttals calling them out as shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm asking in complete sincerity, what is the smoking gun here? Is it all just circumstantial? I'm actually curious because if it's real there's channels you can follow to move the process along. If it isn't then I feel like this is deceitful in the worst way that leads to a mob mentality that takes over and becomes its own pandoras box.

       You'd assume if there was direct proof the police would be already investigating. Dismissing things with "there is no proof" is stupid because usually the goal of any investigation is to get proof in the first place, and there's enough weird "just a coincidence" shit going on to investigate this in the first place... Starting with the pedo symbol logo then abruptly changing it. Unless you claim they unintentionally picked a pedo symbol as logo from the literal billions of possibilities for a logo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway back to the big picture: powerful people being into pedophilia is not exactly a conspiracy theory and I bet the same people who dismiss pizzagate will love to talk about the Catholic Church in the same regard... Maybe just your bias showing. If pizzagate is all fake then you still have people around like Jeffrey Epstein or Dennis Hastert, both convicted pedos.... But see, its always just a big coincidence.

       Look, you are having a logical problem here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are right, police investigate crimes and find evidence. In the case of pedophiles they need a victim or images of such abuse or evidence such as cctv footage of suspicious behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you have in pizzagate is a load of isolated information that you have built into a narrative of an elite pedophile ring you already belive exists. It is not evidence of anything. Like how many heavy metal bands would be in prison if their lyrics/instagram /album symbology were taken as evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Until there is actual evidence of a pizza restaurant based crime, there is only a witch hunt to be had.

       I didnt say this is evidence, Im saying its a bit more suspicious ALL TOGETHER just to be a coincidence. The police could decide if they want to investigate based on this plus the fact that some of these people are connected to already convicted pedophiles...

       What is suspicious? Are any children missing? I have pictures of my toddler nephew tied in a towel on my phone (it's pretty funny) , that is not evidence I'm a fucking pedophile.

       I listen to cannibal corpse who have songs explicitly about having sex with dead infants. Nor does that make me a pedophile.

       I've read it. It's trash. The intro fools you into believing all these "coincidences" add up to a greater whole. They link stories about Jimmy Saville and the Dutch pedophile ring but they are separate cases. What is the point of them in this post?

       Then later talking about the artists spirit cooking  next bullet point talks about Corey feldman and his recent disclosures. Like these things are not related in any way.

       The actual "evidence" against podesta and Clinton is a joke. That epstein guy hosts a big science function on his island, that's why so many big names have been associated with him.

       There's also the series of links to child agencies. Silsby is linked to the amber alerts (no matter what your opinion is a convicted child trafficker should not be involved) The international center for missing &amp; abused children is staffed by people connected to the Clintons and Epstein while at least one of the board members (Belgian one I think) has an organisation linked into the nefarious shit as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill brought in CPS reforms which provided financial incentives for children to be taken off parents. Nancy Shaefer was investigating it. She ain't around no more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently a woman investigating child trafficking and the clinton foundation died in Haiti after a 2 year investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many coincidences would it take for you to suspect it's something more?

       We are not in front of a court that evidence needs to investigate something. I dont know what you mean by "circular argumentation" at all, and I'm pretty sure you made that up just to dismiss my argument, which is based on circumstantial evidence, unless you mixed those two up.

       You don't "get" (as in create) it. Unless you're doing science you don't set out to prove something you have no evidence for. You have some evidence, either because it's public knowledge or somoene brings it to you, and you investigate.

       Your argument is that god must exist because he hasn't been specifically disproven, it's a tired logical fallacy as old as dirt.

       You see, the goal of an investigation is to find evidence to convict a suspect. But to start an investigation you need evidence that a crime has actually happened. These are usually bodies, witness testimonies, or missing items.

       But that's not evidence of a crime. Once you have evidence of a crime, that can certainly lead you on to a suspect, but knowing somebody who committed a crime doesn't mean you have commuted a crime, especially with no other evidence.

      <p>
       in a murder/rape,  there is a victim,  or a missing person.    Right now,  on pizzagate we got a lot of creepy circumstantial "talk",  but none of that is illegal.    What we need is something a real investigator would want to investigate,  a lead,  a real victim,  a real perpetrator with damning alleged physical involvement.    The strange symbols,  postings etc.  are not a lead.   They are a "matter of possible interest".     It has to get warmer than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the amazing thing is that even at these tepid temperatures,  there has been this much interest diverted from normal conspiracy concerns,  like a new Goldman Sach treasurer,   or new developments in Syria,  new leads on 9/11,  and people being extremely emotional about the conjecture they are dealing with in pizzagate.    It seems like there is a psychological shift,  evidence of a psyopp.   On the other hand,   I am always glad to see the exposure of pedophilia,   Hastert,    Savile,  and other proven cases,  because it is at near epidemic levels as shown by real cases.    Where was the outrage at Hastert and those who had been covering up for him during sentencing here at r/conspiracy?    r/conspiracy didn't care,   and it had real witnesses,  real victims,  higher ups involved in a cover up,  interfering with justice.    And then pizzagate comes along and r/conspiracy goes ape shit as if this time it is sure to take down Washington.   I don't get it.

       “The level of pedophilia is just unprecedented right now,” Campbell said. “We have so many cases constantly of individuals in all walks of life, from the very wealthy … to all other levels engaged in child pornography, child exploitation … it just seems to be almost an at epidemic level.”

       We may not be able to say "It's true! They're pedophiles!" But we have the right with all of the "coincidences" to have a suspicion and maybe look further into it.

       There is no proof, yet targets have already been labeled pedophiles. Pizzagate peeps toss the pedo word around constantly, regardless of how irresponsible and damaging that can be to the targets, and all of this without any evidence of pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal is to get proof you say? You start with the assumption that they are pedophiles and there is a huge coverup, then you shoehorn everything to fit that narrative. Thats not how an investigation works, Thats how a witchhunt works.

       if you start with "these guys arent pedos" then there is nothing to investiage... You start with the suspicion then go from there. Your point is therefore meaningless. And we DO know there are pedos around this whole thing, I just listed them, those guys were convicted in court you know... I'd say its alone pretty suspious if someone's 3 closest friends ALL turn out to be pedos and that'd already require investigation alone, and no I wouldnt mind if the same happened to me, because I dont think I know a single pedo, its statistically very unlikely that 3 of your closest friends turn out to be pedos... unless you are one as well, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please tell me if having pedos around you is a reasonable doubt for you to start asking questions or not. Mind that in any police investigatio just seding emails to a pedo might make them question you, that alone does not mean you are a pedo.

       There is no such thing as pedo by association. There is zero proof that Alefantis or Podesta have ever harmed any child, nor is there any proof that they are involved in pedophilia even in a peripheral manner.

       I've had office jobs I could call torture chambers. And if I did call them that no one would think I literally had a chamber where I tortured things, because that would a ridiculous assumption to make. It's more likely he means he's at work or at the office.

       The thing is those symbols are all similar or equal to basic graphic elements that will appear all over. A line receding into itself, common, hearts, super common. Those are not proof of anything, and it would be silly to assume that a global pedo ring advertises itself to the common gutter pedos via well-known and exposed symbolism.

       And no evidence at all that Alefantis or Podesta have ever harmed or been involved in harming anyone.  Yet they have been publicly labeled as monsters based on
       <em>
        zero evidence
       </em>
       . That is incredibly uncool, that is so cruel. These people have not been proved to be guilty of anything, yet there lives are being bashed about like they've been caught red-handed. If a serious investigation is what is wanted, this is not the way to go about it. Pizzagate is hysteria, moonbarking frothing-at-the-mouth hysteria.

       Hastert is a sicko, and there was tons of actual evidence (victims, witnesses, physical evidence, payments) of it -- and he helped cover-up Mark Foley's crimes with Congressional pages.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is still zero evidence of "Pizzagate" i.e. victims would be a good start, but witnesses would be good, anything. That the Podestas are both art collectors, that means absolutely nothing.

       With the two convicted criminals you mentioned there was evidence and victims. They weren't exposed by Reddit or 4chan threads, they were exposed by our justice system and charged even though they were powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real criminals here are those who are labelling and harassing a pizza joint without anything to go on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post evidence if I'm wrong. Someone posted the movie eyes wide shut as evidence. After weeks of asking for evidence that is the best piece of proof I can get? Critical thinking is running out of oxygen around here.
      </p>

       No more calling pizza places pedophile rings without evidence.

       I dont think you understand how investigations or police detective really works mate... You dont need any evidence to investiage, only reasonable doubt and an official inquiry. The goal of the investigation is to get evidence, not the other way around. An investigation does not make you guilty either.

       Here's what the police don't do when they investigate something.  They don't go home after work and start posting online about how the people they are investigating are DEFINITELY GUILTY, that is not an investigation it is a lynch mob.  That's why people aren't taking this seriously, if you want to call it an investigation then you can't accuse people until you have actionable evidence, otherwise it is slander.

       Do you think police have certain procedures for investigation because it makes it more fun?  Or do you think that they have them because they make for more effective investigations?  I'm convinced it's the latter but you're welcome to disagree.
       <br/>
       If you honestly can't wrap your head around the "innocent until proven guilty concept" that I'm asking you to acknowledge then I don't think we can have an honest discussion, you just aren't paying attention.
My point is that you are free to conduct your "investigation" however you want, but if you don't conduct it effectively then people will assume that the information you uncover is bs.  Now I think we all know why that won't happen, if you conducted this thing like professional investigators would conduct it then you wouldn't get anywhere because there probably isn't anything to find.   So when those tried and true methods come up empty, you have to compromise a bit and use more and more questionable methods.  I've had almost this exact same conversation over on

       Innocent until proven guild does not refer to police investigations. You seem to confuse just like the others two things: police prodecures and due process/legal proceedings. The police can investigate anyone reasonably linked to a case. This can include questioning them for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone says he saw you at a scene of a murder the police WILL question you, that doesn't mean you get charged with murder... I dont understand why this is a difficult concept for you.

       Police would still need a reason to question somebody. And what everyone is telling you is that the evidence you and others say proves the validity of pizzagate is not even close to enough. The necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges, and the pizzagate conspiracists have not produced true proof of anything, by any legal or logical understanding of the word.

       Oh I'm with you. We're here in a conversation where you believe there is evidence that suggests the Clintons and Podestas were involved in a pedophilia ring, enough that you believe they should be investigated for it. What are you insinuating if not that? I disagree with you. Clearly law enforcement disagrees with you.

       I know they investigated Jeffery Epstein. Unless you have evidence to prove otherwise, I will continue to say there's a reason that investigation never lead to a Clinton or Podesta.

       But the people who actually conducted the investigation do know. And with all they uncovered nothing ever lead them to a Clinton or Podesta. Until some evidence or statement or crime or report or anything implicates them, I can certainly understand why. The burden of proof is on the accuser I this country.

       "Nothing lead to Clinton" except the fact that Bill Cilton went to Epstein's private island several times and nobody asked him what they were doing there or if he saw anything suspicious? Seems legit. That's bad detective work.

       You mean Besta Pizza? They changed it because assholes were harassing them and calling them pedophiles. It was not a pedo symbol, it was a logo containing pizza for a pizza parlor. That it somewhat resembled a known pedo symbol probably never occurred to them.

       Exactly. I feel like pizzagate is a huge distraction. There is absolutely no solid evidence yet the obsession has gotten out of hand. I have no doubt that the cp rings exist in higher society and even within our government, but this particular "scandal" is just one giant dead end that I see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no problem with people doing research, but to see a video of people outside of that ping pong place basically harassing the owner when they have no solid evidence is cringy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile in Dakota protesters are being sprayed with freezing water and abused with pepper spray. This is something that is actually happening and is being actively ignored by msm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'll probably get downvoted, like I said if you feel that there is something more there by all means keep researching, but when I come to this sub and see 18 pizza gate posts on the front page rehashing all the same thing with no solid evidence its gets a little old.

       "Asking" for evidence? Dude, why don't you do some actual research for yourself like the rest of us do? Why do we have to plop a platter of all of our findings right in front of your face? Do I have to hold your hand throughout this entire thing and show you all of the findings like a little kid?
If you are going to frequent a conspiracy related forum, shouldn't you know how to do your own research and come to your own conclusions by yourself, instead of letting the tide of public opinion steer you?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why are you discouraging an investigation into ANYTHING that implicates the elite? This is a conspiracy forum, right? Aren't we supposed to encourage critical thinking and an "outside the box" type mentality? Then why are you telling everyone to sit down? Are you the supreme ruler here or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your post history has a bunch of pizzagate attacks just like a bunch of the other shills on this post, so you clearly have a bias on this topic and you definitely aren't contributing to a constructive discussion here, so why are you here? I just don't understand, some of you guys are literally echoing things the mainstream media is saying...And you're on a conspiracy related forum! Something isn't adding up...

       Your actually attacking a business where people work. This isn't a game, it's people's livelihood. I've done research on this. There is nothing convincing. So I've asked again and again for at least something that points to this as being true. All I get is long rants like your post.

       Comet Ping pong is merely one focus of Pizzagate, but like everybody else on here has said, the entire investigation is much wider ranging. It is clear that you are ignorant to that basic rudimentary understanding of this investigation, so why should your input hold any merit? You clearly have a bias here, and your're discouraging people's independent research, dude...Why are you on this sub then? Isn't

       I'm not discouraging research. Research away. I'd think though that the accusations before evidence is terrible. It makes the sub look bad and harms possibly innocent people in real life.

       That said, if it turns out that there is evidence that proves comet pizza is doing what everyone is saying they are doing then I hope they are stopped and punished.

       It's entirely circumstantial, based upon a couple of people reading emails that dealt with a pizza party and italian food and deciding that because
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       don't have long email strings involving busy govt officials trying to the plan a party, that means it never happens. Then they decided, because obviously, people from the govt planning to eat pizza together
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be doing something more, applied other scenarios, picked the ugliest they could find, then decided real words were actually code words that supported a wholly made-up scenario.

       Well, given we've got really, really, really little contextually to go on in the slightest, my best guess is one of the well-off people in attendance - unlike the average shmoe - has fancy handkerchiefs, and left one behind after the party. At some point, they or someone drew a map on it. Perhaps even - OH MY GOD - a map to the pizza place. That's a much more reasonable thing to think than assuming a hanky someone left behind is
       <em>
        proof
       </em>
       of a major, worldwide child rape conspiracy.

       Next thing you'll be shilling is that Obama spending a bunch of money on famous food from his hometown for a party is "more reasonable" than a worldwide satanist pedophile ring run out of the White House that flies little kids all over the world. Why would they order pizza from Chicago if they had pizza at the "pizza" place in DC, huh?!?

       Who I suggest wasn't the point of asking you. The point was to help you move past the question of "Is Pizzagate legitimate", and accept that child sex trafficking is a real problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our next step will be to help you realize that judges and prosecutors are blackmailed by these traffickers.

       Or is that something you already understand, and we can skip that part? That would make things easier.

       The condescension only makes you look like a putz. Of course I'm aware
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       human trafficking is a real problem, nor would I doubt for a second that cops, prosecutors, and judges are blackmailed by, or in the pocket of, traffickers at times. That does not, however, support Peegate at all, and if anything, the "crying wolf ALL THE LIBS ARE RAPISTS" thing only goes to work against awareness, as people turn away from the topic as a whole over stupid allegations.

       I told you, I'm not looking for Democrats or Republicans. You just admitted that the Saudis certainly have sex slaves, and that the government is obviously not doing anything to stop them.

       I never said anything close to the words you just made up. I said I certainly wouldn't be surprised if they did, and I think it's fair to say there are sex slaves in every country. Russia certainly has them, for instance, and I'm sure you could find sex slaves in some of the tiniest countries, as well.

       So Bill Clinton made it easier to CPS to take kids off parents and provided a financial incentive to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schaefer investigated this and died.

       Silsby gets pulled for child trafficking in Haiti
      </p>
      <p>
       Silsbys legal advisers turns out to be a fugitive wanted for his connections to trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary intervenes to help Silsby.
      </p>
      <p>
       Silsby ends up working for the company that provides Amber Alerts system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NCMEC is the organisation that is in charge of the amber alert programme.
      </p>
      <p>
       When images turn up online that match certain hashes they get flagged and sent to NCMEC. NCMEC verifies that they are CP and then makes the decision to send them on to the authorities or not. The internet company themselves never sees the images. This means that NCMEC gets the final word on whether or not the images get passed to the authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ICMAC was founded by NCMEC, Hillary was at the launching of this. Jeffrey Koons sits on the board and is a friend of both Alefantis and David Brock. Brock's company CTR was given $50,000 by Koons and Alefantis knows Koons through the DC art scene. Koons is also on side with the Clintons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of ICMAC includes Koons. It also includes Bagley who donated $1,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation and Lichtbuer whose organisation Child Focus is linked to child abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The money connections extend to known ME child traffickers, A woman investigating the Clinton Foundation and child trafficking in Haiti died recently etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       One family happens to be linked to a disturbing number of child trafficking/abuse rings and also connected to child protection organisations. How peculiar. Must all be a coincidence.

       Amber Alerts don't do child porn, they do missing children alerts.

       What is ICMAC?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is Koons, and why does he matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       Given there's been absolutely
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       beyond conjecture regarding Alefantis and Brock, they're irrelevant, as of yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is Bagley?
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, you've got all of 1 actual connection to someone actually connected to child trafficking, maybe 2, depending on who Bagley is. Given the Clintons, by virtue of being established politicians, know and come into contact with a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of people, it's not surprising they've come into contact with a couple of genuine creepy shitty people without ever knowing how shitty they are. You never see a news report featuring the neighbor of a apprehended molester saying "Oh yeah, I knew he was fucking kids for years." Generally speaking, molestering isn't something one shares with people they meet.

       To look at it from another angle, is Trump tied to human trafficking? He had a company VP busted on a boat with underaged prostitutes, used Polish workers who had been trafficked in, Hung with Epstein on his island, at Mar-a-Lago, and in his apartment in Trump Tower, spoke of Epstein's taste for young girls, and worked with - and allowed his daughter to work for - John Casablancas, who trafficked in models/escorts. That's every bit as much evidence - likely more, since there's actual supporting documentation - as there is of Clinton being involved with such things. But a pizza party is the end of the world.

       Your assumption. The guy can't work technology. The person giving directions can't explain technology. Can't put an address in his phone and and tell him to press a button. Can't write the directions in his phone. Doesn't have an aide or wife who can use technology. Doesn't have any paper around to write the directions on.
      </p>
      <p>
       My assumption. He can use technology like a normal person. Or knows someone who can. Wouldn't have a pizza related map on his handkerchief. Therefore it probably relates to something else.

       I do use a pen to write on paper. I can honestly say I have never written anything on a handkerchief. I don't carry around pens that can write on handkerchiefs. Never. I can't tel you the last time I saw someone handwrite directions. The last time I saw paper directions was a printout of mapquest 10 years ago on a road trip.

       My question is, with there being only a couple of actually weird emails such as the hanky one, which definitely seemed weird to me, how do we even know those are legit leaked emails? I know, "bc Wikileaks" but is anyone actually validating these emails because I haven't seen it, I've just heard that they're legit "bc Google, bc Wikileaks".

       Then why was the autopsy report (available online) signed by Juan Carrillo?  Does the LA county medical examiner go around signing things he wasn't taking part in? And also LA county said Cormier had nothing to do with Breitbarts autopsy. He was just an autopsy tech who happened to work there, not even a medical examiner. Like so much conspiracy bullshit, this one is close to being truthful, but completely missed being actually true.  Maybe Cormier was actually poisoned to silence him about Corey haim's autopsy, did you think of that?

       There's clear foul play regarding that whole situation. The coroner's brother said no one would touch his case for fear of repercussion, too. Also a witness to Breitbart's death up and disappeared. This info. is all readily available if you care to dig.

       None of that is info. It's the opposite of info. Who specifically declined to take his brother's case? There was an investigation into the toxicology and possible sources of arsenic to find out who did it. How the do you know he was poisoned with arsenic otherwise? A guy disappeared? Ok. That's not evidence of anything. We don't even know who tried to find him or how hard they tried.

       I remember that people were claiming Breitbart was killed because of video he had of Obama with the weather underground, but now suddenly it's because podesta is a pedo and Breitbart knew. Somehow podesta can manage to rig a giant conspiracy involving Breitbarts own father and the la county medical examiner's office.

       Yeah, this isn't going anywhere. Not going to bother linking because you seem like the type to argue sources. Again, it's all out there. If you don't think there's reason to be skeptical about the entire situation, you haven't done enough research of your own. Good day.

       The info is only out there on conspiracy sites that don't bother fact checking anything, like the "fact" that Breitbarts coroner was murdered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy isn't even internally consistent. They have an untraceable poison they use to murder Breitbart, but to silence an autopsy tech they use good old arsenic instead. The world's most obvious poison.

       He wasn't even Breitbarts coroner, that's the goddamn point. He was just a guy who worked at the medical examiner's office. The actual medical examiner who did Breitbarts autopsy is still alive and well.  But somehow conspiracy theorists have latched onto this as a fact that his coroner was murdered.

       No, he died young. That's unusual, but not suspicious - my ex wife died when she was 34, for instance. Is that suspicious, or was that the cancer that ate her apart slowly from the inside? Six years ago you likely said something shitty about someone else...does that automatically mean the shitty thing you said is true? And why haven't many, many, many more people died besides Breitbart? Is he - after tweeting it - the only person who "knew the truth" he was killed over? Or did he just say something assholely about a guy he didn't like and unfortunately died younger than average?

       I'm willing to bet the proportions are likely something in the area of 80% CTR/15% undecided and 5% deniers. Any rational person who actually does their own research (and doesnt expect the people on this board to plop their findings in front of them on a silver platter and hold their hand through the research) will come to the conclusion that their is SOMETHING to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will look into that user. By tonight or early tomorrow I will try to have some sort of an organized rough database posted, so we can discuss. Anything that brings potential CTR to light is going to aid us in our cause.

       There isn't one. We have a foreign government plain as day fucking with our election and these guys are focusing on this nonsense. This is why we are fucked as a country. Conspiracy types cast a big net and occasionally are right about something important, like the DNC rigging for Hillary. That's useful. But when they get so in the bed for one candidate we all lose out. This is an example.

       Have you paid attention to his cabinet posts? This is as swmpy as it gets. He's got a Goldman guy as fucking Treasurer.

       I have. Would you rather he pick a Taco Bell janitor for Treasurer? It was going to be a financial person, since (news flash) it's a FINANCIAL position. The guy isn't a long time government freak. After Dodd-Frank, the "too big to fail" got bigger. If not Goldman Sachs, it would have been Chase, or another big institution. I expected that. Same with Mad Dog. I don't want a tree hugging Islam sympathizer over the military. No thanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Petraeus was simply tossed out there to get the shills spun up and have them admit Hillary wss unqualified. The media and zealots made his case for him. It was brilliant. You should have been paying attention long enough to know that Trump will use judo against the media and establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should probably pay closer attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to ask. Who is your savior of America? Is it the scammer Stein? Is it the man who made back room deals with the DNC and was simply a money raising conduit between millennials and Hillary? Was it Hillary (LOL)? Or was it the GOP establishment backed Johnson and his long time Republican running mate? Do tell.

       How convenient. Trump says something and you claim that's why you are voting for him. He does something different and he's a genius for not doing what he said he'll do. He literally can do no wrong with you guys. Unreal.

       There is no savior here. That's what you are deluded into believing by media disguised as "alternative" by the global elites. And you are swallowing it whole. You are bending over and dropping trou, ignoring the giant blinking, flashing lights on the dashboard screaming swamp people.

       Yep, conned...lol. Once again, you're pretending to have a crystal ball. The guy hasn't even been sworn in. And, once again, you provide absolutely nothing but criticism over something he doesn't even have the authority to do. Kind of like giving a guy a Nobel prize before he's sworn in. I'll wait and cast judgment in a few years, after he's had the opportunity.

       That's pretty light on evidence, but thanks anyway. This thing could use all the bullshit calling it can get. Not saying I'm convinced either way, but the less distractions, the better. Though his explanation for "hotard" was kinda lazy.

       I never understood the whole "pedo symbols" thing. Why would a secret pedophile ring put a known "pedo symbol" in plain sight? If you're doing something nefarious and need to keep it secret, you're not going to put your logo everywhere.

       Well, the idea is that they have their people in all the right places to obstruct investigation. So, if that's the case, then they can freely advertise to each other without worry.

       It is all circumstantial evidence, but circumstantial evidence shouldn't be ignored. Sure no one is asking to start cuffing people, but I think there is enough evidence to warrant an FBI investigation.

       The vast majority of the evidence IS circumstantial at this point, in my opinion that necessitates more investigation. The answer to circumstantial evidence is not to stop investigating, there is no truth in that tactic. My biggest question is from this email

       Why does the real estate agent refer to the handkerchief as black and white, while Susan Sandler describes it completely differently? A handkerchief, that she thinks has a map, that seems pizza related? Obviously these would be highly identifying characteristics, why does the real estate agent not use them in her description?

       Aside from the FBI documents outlining the symbolism I personally have chosen to leave "code words" on the back burner until there is more concrete evidence for it. It is an interesting thought though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just can't reconcile the fact that if the handkerchief did in fact have the graphics like the one you linked, they would be included in any and conceivably every description. 
For example when someone leaves an article of clothing at my house, my effort to find the owner includes description of any information on tags, colour, size, description of graphics, stains or holes etc. Anything less than a complete description is illogical. In the case of this email we have two vastly different descriptions with no explanation. For me right now, I must know why, and I feel that if a person can't answer this one simple question they cannot say it's not worth investigating.

       Right, so you say you're leaving symbology on the back burner then take some from an email between two people tidying up a business visit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking your point seriously, how many other handkerchiefs do you suppose were left? It seems quite reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And its one email. This is one of the core pieces of evidence along with liking weird art? It doesn't hold up to any serious scrutiny.

       I'm choosing not to speculate on "code words" at this time as I believe there's no hard evidence to support them, that does not mean that I don't think they're being used. I also believe that it is unfair to speculate as to the nature of the "business visit" as you put it, or to speculate on the number of handkerchiefs. They're talking about one and anything other than that is not based in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do believe is that there is a verifiable breakdown in logic, due to the vastly different descriptions given by the two individuals in the email. This behaviour is completely the opposite of what you would expect to see from a professional, especially one who makes their money based on their descriptive abilities.

       It doesn't. It's confirmation bias working at its finest. It's crazy on so many levels. No evidence of wrong doing that will lead to the arrest, prosecution and conviction of anyone. But the biggest laughable matter in all of this is they believe, within their hearts, that puppets will arrest, prosecute and convict their puppet masters based on 4chan posts.

       Think of it like the mafia - they do absolutely everything to hide their actions and dealings, but you can see the hints of it everywhere you look. You're not able to deal with smoking guns because there's no way that is just going to conveniently appear on the internet. You only have the shadows that they cast, and can slowly put it together to make out the silhouette. If you want to start physically knocking on doors and examining hot spot areas, you might find more stuff to sort through, but you're not going to find it by combing through the internet.

       You do realize though, that seeing connections at that level and believing that people are speaking in code, are common symptoms of schizophrenia.  Conspiracies can stay credible to a point, but when it's making a narrative out of people just making references to other conversations, or emailing their inside jokes, it's a little insane.  Especially when the code that people claim they're using originated on 4chan in the first place.  People in government positions don't browse 4chan, and people on 4chan don't understand how normal people talk.

       It's terrible, because there are proven child abuse coverups out there that would be much easier to hack wide open.  It hurt me that we finally saw someone upvoted for connecting pizzagate to the Catholic Church, only after the first shots were fired over Comet.

       It will fizzle out now.  Look up Satanic Panic, this has happened before.  The people behind it were labeled as tinfoil crazies, and pedophilia was rampant for 30 years.

       What made me believe in pisagate was this video that was posted on youtube. Its back from 2007 I believe. Some dude working in the insurance industry stood across the street from comet ping pong and placed his camera on the ground and filmed two people playing ping pong outside of coment, trying to figure out liability issues like who would be responsible if the ball hit a car or something. If you turn up the volume in that video you could hear kids screaming "help me" "im down here" "heeelllpp". This is a youtube video that was uploaded in 2007 and also has a caption in video stating the date, 2007, so this was before this pisagate thing blew up. They say that cometpingpong has an underground system of tunnels where they have the kids and do their pedo shit so to me this video gave more evidence of it possibly being 100% real. If i can find the video ill post it, should have saved it before :(

       If it really IS in the video, in front of comet ping pong, in 2007, then that is suspicious. That is assuming it's not like those ghost shows where they hear static or breathing in the mic and say "oh he said get out!". If it is, I agree that he's looking for it. If it's pretty obvious what they're saying(if they're saying anything) then that's suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we have to wonder how the fuck he can hear them, because you can't really hear stuff from at least 10 feet underground, unless there was some sort of vent or something nearby(which I doubt there was).

       While it is circumstantial, it is a large amount of circumstantial evidence. The fact that it is met with such fierce opposition suggests there is something larger at play. What is happening now and what has been happening has been an obvious cover up. If they had an explanation, they would have come out with it. However, they continue to deflect, dodge, and ignore any evidence pertaining to this. I mean here's a block in D.C. with a majority of the businesses having FBI recognized pedophilia related symbols, it was a
       <em>
        gift
       </em>
       involving Saudi groups, and it implicates government officials. It all seems pretty fitting of a conspiracy theory. But if you bring it up, there is a large group who completely dismiss it and argue that it should not be discussed. I just think everyone should be open minded and look at any possibility. And look at the possible
       <em>
        reasons
       </em>
       the elites have for doing what they do.

       Maybe there is no smoking gun yet because the people behind all of this don't want the smoking gun to be found so easily/at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a fan of the X-Files, as are alot of other people probably,  and the biggest issue for Mulder and Scully was finding the hard evidence before Smoking Man or the Syndicate or Krycek got to it first. All of their paranormal experiences, alien encounters, conspiracy leads from members of higher levels of govt,  didn't mean anything without the actual
       <em>
        hard evidence
       </em>
       , the scientific mathematical, biological proof (of an alien virus or dna for example).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the people behind those conspiracies got to the smoking gun first using tactics that included murder,  spying, discrediting,  distracting,  etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Why is it so absurd to think that these people are making it impossible for us to find that smoking gun?  Especially since they have the power,  the influence, the connections, the money, the tools, the necessity and determination and fear (of not being exposed).

       Not sure what a "smoking gun" would be, but there's been a lot of shadiness found that demands further investigation. Unfortunately, we got hysteria-prone christians and disinfo agents spamming BREAKING, and other similar attention grabbers, that turn out to be the same "creepy" photos that everyone's already seen a hundred fuckin times!

       There isn't a smoking gun yet, but there are definitely things that cause suspicion. More recently,  the BBC article said that we think this pedophilia ring is being operated under ground in comet pizzas basement. The owner in the article stated that
       <strong>
        they don't even have a basement.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Web sleuths then found an interview with the pizza place owner from a much earlier date stating that
       <strong>
        his tomatoes are homegrown,  in the basement of his establishment.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So which is it?  Is this a schrödingers basement where it only exists when pedophilia isn't involved?

       The fact that you had to ask for concrete evidence to be placed in front of you, shows that you havent even taken the time to research the topic and investigate it yourself. I suggest you start digging or looking at one of the pizzagate graphics or some youtube videos, I'll try to find a link for you : )

       It is all circumstantial. STRONG circumstantial evidence however.
      </p>
      <p>
       To find proof there would need to be a search warrant, which is all we're pushing for. A true investigation by LE, not a coverup.
      </p>
      <p>
       However do note that most criminals are convicted on circumstantial evidence. There is no doubt in my mind that Pizzagate has uncovered the nexus of the worlds largest human trafficking operation. Most can't be posted here though due to site bans on "doxxing". Go to voat and subscribe, there are new breakthroughs literally every day.

       There is no proof of any wrongdoing. When you examine the underpinnings is built on you find it has no validity whatsoever. We have people beung labeled as pedophiles, being targeted and harassed, with zero evidence that any has ever even had an untoward thought about a child.

       Again, you have to look at this instragram through pedo-colored glasses to see that at all. Friends and family share photos of kids, it's something that people do, routinely. There is nothing in the photos you are referring to that contain even a hint of abuse, just adults engaging in playful banter and normal facebook-like shit.

       Wait, so this sub no longer believes in say the JFK assassination or 9/11 being an inside job, but it does believe in a conspiracy literally invented by trolls on 4chan based on the idea that a pizza joint owner would never use the word "pizza" in a sentence unless it was a code for child rape?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you saying this sub still believes in those other things but a child sex ring is more important than government forces killing the president to allow for the Vietnam War or those same forces killing over 2000 people to start two endless wars we are still involved in 15 years later?
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly when your evidence is comprised of a single 4chan post claiming pizza is a code for child molestation, that families who liked a pizza place on social media also have pictures of children on their feeds, and there is a vague, vague connection to a NY performance artist who does weird shit rural voters in Indiana and Kansas don't quite understand...um basically you'll believe anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, it is said that Scientology was started with a bar bet that it couldn't be done. This alleged scandal is made from the same cloth. Anti-Clinton trolls were sitting around saying let's make up something super damaging about Clinton with whatever evidence we can scrape up. You guys are being trolled, hard core. You're missing the true conspiracy here, which was to plant this fake crap in the first place. You have been duped hook, line, and sinker.

       A conspiracy theorist use to be someone with an extreme amount of skepticism for everything. Sadly, it appears now a conspiracy theorist is someone with not the tiniest ounce of skepticism at all.

       This isn't even a conspiracy, it is a passive aggressive bandwagon aimed at hurting real people, productive people, who happen to be gay and/or Democrats (in any case, certainly not Trump voters). The people who are prolonging this sick game know in their heart of hearts that that is precisely what it is, and quite sadly it may not die down until someone gets hurt, until another crazed, fallen-through-the-cracks "underground man" surfaces and does something unspeakable as a result, thereby adding to the long list of crazed lone wolf atrocities that have come to plague and characterize the U.S. in recent years. And the people who are fanatically intent on perpetuating this game will be secretly gleeful if this most unconscionably (passive-aggressively) weaponized and personalized of "memes" ends up culminating in just such a tragedy.

       I hate to sound like Chicken Little, but this pattern is unfortunately not new. Early beginnings of the fascism often begin with thuggish devotees of the autocrat concocting imaginary, unbelievable, and incendiary gossips about out groups, particularly political opponents and minorities like homosexuals, as an excuse to bully and scare dissent.

       Does this whole thing seem really bizarre to you, like the fact that thousands of redditors all latched onto this very specific theory with zero credible evidence? And how they all behave the same way, like super emotional and unwilling to have an actual conversation about why they are so convinced? I have never seen anything like this before. So many people just obsessed with pedophilia and satanism seemingly overnight.

       It strikes me as 'think of the children!' hysteria, complete with nonsense 1980s satanism thrown in. Considering the whole thing falls apart the moment you look at it, this definitely is fueled by hysteria.

       Most of these user accounts did not exist prior to Pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of these user accounts are in the habit of waging "u are organized CTR shillery" accusations at any questions or requests for evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such an "accuse others pre-emptively of what you're doing already" is a known strategy.

       Meanwhile, anti-pedo subreddits that existed before
       <a href="/r/Pizzagate">
        /r/Pizzagate
       </a>
       still have only 300 subscribers and zero interest from Pizzagate believers, possibly because there's no anti-Hillary angle in other historical pedophile rings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does it seem so obvious that the impetus of Pizzagate is partisan warfare?

       what's bigger? the amount of morons trolling around the internet like little zombies mumbling about how they can never eat pizza again? or the vast satanic pedophile cabal that has an underground network of tunnels under pizza places and a worldwide sex trafficking ring?

       We all know JFK was killed by the government, and that 9/11 was an inside job. Whats odd is that you are discouraging us from investigating this NEW conspiracy (pizzagate), and saying all of the same things people probably said to you when you were initially investigating JFK or 9/11. You're saying all the same things the media is saying dude...This post made it to the top of the front page, you know what that means? It means you're in the minority dude, and most of us on here are gonna continue to investigate pizzagate regardless of you closed mind.

       This post essentially translates to:
      </p>
      <p>
       "You're a kook! a Lunatic! You're never gonna find anything"
      </p>
      <p>
       That sounds a LOT like the average "sheeple" who is always telling you to "stop looking into all that conspiracy stuff"
      </p>
      <p>
       You have essentially become what you probably swore to defeat; An ignorant public who discourages critical thinking and taking a closer look at things we believe to be true. Why are you on a conspiracy related forum if you're going to discourage a citizen investigation? You're just as bad as everybody else who has ever called you crazy, man. Thats what doesn't make sense to me...That, in conjunction with your recent campaign against pizzagate. Thats why I think you are very suspect right now. What is motivating this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, good luck in your little campaign...The rest of us will continue to research and post our findings while the skeptics slowly dwindle out.

       Government and powerful private interests can get away with nearly anything when those who dare ask questions are so easily associated with goofus moonbeam theories that were imagined out of thin air. A real conspiracy theorist attempts an objective take on the facts.

       You'd feel a lot less weird if you accepted that when people talk about cheese pizza, virtually all of the time, they're talking about just that, cheese pizza, and there's nothing more insidious happening when they eat it as there is when you eat it.

       There's really nothing
       <em>
        to
       </em>
       know about the Podesta emails. People had a pizza party. They talked about it, and they had one. Because the emails were released, the public knows they got together to eat pizza. Then, because a few members of the public don't have multiple email strings to plan their own pizza party, they decided it
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       mean something else. And then they picked the ugliest option possible, and played a game of mad libs with it, picking certain words and attaching meaning to those words as code words to support the ugly conclusion they'd already reached. They could've just easily decided cheese pizza meant "Chevrolet," and then ascribed other car-related meaning to other words. But that wouldn't be dramatic and evil, so they went with meanings that
       <em>
        prove
       </em>
       they have a better reason to dislike the people they already dislike. Cheese pizza could actually, and very likely does, mean cheese pizza.

       That's confirmation bias, my friend.

       However, those who consider the fight to shut down the #pizzagate movement as definitive evidence that it's true are actually hurting the movement. Circumstantially it supports the argument, but there are a couple reasons people would try to shut it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a fallacy of logic to insist that the only possible reason is one that corroborates and validates your view.  To outsiders and skeptics, seeing arguments like this will scare them away. It will also alienate you from some people who hold belief or some suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's okay to use this as a supporting theory, but it's doesn't 'prove' everything.

       Yeah, they're crazy (and they are) if they think we're just going to forget that a massive satanic Paedophile ring is running the world. I genuinely can't think of anything more reprehensible then what these sick f-ks are up to.

       This is the oddest mass delusion ever. Why are so many people just absolutely fixated on pedophilia and satanism? Did this all spawn from how 4chan refers to CP as cheese pizza? Is the satanist thing all from Alex Jones? Why are so many people frothing at the mouth about pedophilia with zero actual evidence?

       I just wanted to put the image in everyone's mind of a child being consumed and vomited back up so a lesser can consume it again.  This is, in fact, as much as we may all question God for it, what we're really talking about with Pizzagate.  Evil so taboo we don't speak its name.  Fucking and eating kids.  And then throwing them back up for others.  I'm genuinely sorry.  But this awakening that's going on also requires an awakening to horror.

       Wait.... is this really the extent of the evidence? A Hollywood movie, some rumors, and people talking about food? You think purchasing pizza and hot dogs from Chicago--a place famous for its pizza and hot dogs--is somehow corroborating evidence of a worldwide pedophilia ring?

       I clicked on the links to the tabloid articles. Must have taken me to a different site than the one you're referring to because all I saw was a random nonsensical tweet from a fat hate-filled man with hardened arteries who died after having a second major heart attack in the span of a few months.
      </p>
      <p>
       What possible basis do you have for saying his death was other than a heart attack? How in the world does that tweet establish anything other than the dude liked to rant on twitter about his political adversaries? Breitbart gets killed for tweeting but Alex Jones' tubby ass gets to spread his insanity far and wide for decades?
      </p>
      <p>
       You all have truly picked the perfect conspiracy. There is literally nothing that could prove your theory wrong. Everything can be misconstrued to fit the narrative. Innocuous emails about food can only be about 1 thing: a massive satanic pedophile ring. There's never going to be an investigation based on this "evidence" so that must just be further proof of how deep the conspiracy goes.

         Because they were investigating Anthony Weiner when they asked the FBI to reopen the case. Anything the FBI currently has that caused them to reopen the case was originally under the NYPD. Multiple officers have come out saying they found some damning evidence that would make anyone nauseous.

       So if the NYPD has something, and it's a part of a state investigation, what is the problem? More importantly, who are these NYPD officers you're referring to?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Prince is a radio talk show host who says that officers were willing to give a press conference but DOJ told them to stand down. Officers are being told that if they release this information they'll be charged with obstructing an open investigation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They're conducting their own investigation at a state level. If the FBI didn't take everything they have what would be the grounds on charging them with obstructing an open investigation? Who exactly is Prince? You are quoting the guy or someone who wrote about him but not citing sources. Who are the officers involved?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Do you really believe the FBI reopened that case just to make sure they were accurate? They were protecting the DNC and Hillary before a presidential election in hopes of running out the clock. The NYPD has everything the FBI has, they're simply unable to announce anything.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I believe they reopened it to keep the public focused on the emails.

       And you know this how? Again, if they are conducting their own investigation at a state level, the FBI is not going to issue a gag order as they have no jurisdiction over the states investigation as the two are independent of each other.

      <p>
       Incorrect. The FBI can't assume jurisdiction when a states investigation conflicts with an ongoing investigation. That is what you see on TV and the movies. What will happen, in the case of malfeasance and corruption, is they will remove those people and have others come in. But the two are different because, in a lot of instances, they're looking at different crimes and using different statutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what the FBI has said about your claims:

       <p>
        They simply had to reopen a case to claim jurisdiction, which the FBI did.

      <p>
       So you are saying the NYPD asked the FBI to reopen the case? So they could have jurisdiction?

      <p>
       There are two links. The first is a pdf and the second one isn't. Both explain, in detail, what obstruction of justice actually is and it isn't what you and your uncited sources are saying.

       You make a lot of assumptions here, mate. Where do I say I believe everything you THINK I believe? 
You just insult us all here because you can. I never listen to anyone who can't form an intelligent sentence but instead reverts to childish insults. You sound frustrated. Therefore I was asking why you put yourself through so much anguish and come to this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally do not have to give you any evidence at all, you have eyes, you have fingers, go and do some actual research and then answer me if you'd be happy for people like the likes of Pizza gate to  babysit your own children.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the answer is yes, then either you have not done any research whatsoever and are just parroting your opinion without knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you say No, then I assume it may be alright to ask for someone to have a closer look at these people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that paedo-rings don't exist at all. If we were going on about yetis or aliens, then your infantile, unresearched opinion may be warranted. But come on man, these things are quite common. 
You'd probably would have defended Jimmy Saville. Because there was no evidence either [apart from a couple of victims].
Problem is that the evidence you want can only be obtained if the police were allowed to 'take a quick closer look'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something you are obviously against.

       If you decide to answer me, could you do without the swearing? it isn't very becoming and adds nothing. Thanks

       One look at your post history and all you've done is criticize and attack pizzagate posts. You clearly have a bias on this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you on a conspiracy forum if you're going to attack and badger people who are trying to question social norms and use critical thinking to get a picture of whats happening in the world? Doesn't that seem a little ass-backwards? Just because you don't have the ability to look at evidence and make connections, doesn't mean you have to drag everyone else down with you. Why are you here? I just don't understand?
      </p>
      <p>
       This post made it to the top overnight, so you are clearly in the minority. Like I said, about 90% of what you minions say against pizzagate goes ignored anyway. Theres too many of us and too few of you. We will keep researching.

       One look at your post history and it's filled with tons of attacks on the Pizzagate investigation. Clearly you have a bias on this topic, and you obviously aren't going to contribute to a constructive discussion, so good luck with whatever the hell your cause is...

       I don't think I have a long post story of anything regarding Pizzagate, so you can take it from me instead.

       ""damaging scandal" with scant evidence as of right now.."
      </p>
      <p>
       Is correct. There is no real evidence right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of getting agitated and resolving to personal attacks you might want to think on which postition it puts you in, when you try to explain your theories to other people. Without evidence you have nothing and you will need a lot of evidence to convince people.

       That last link doesn't show that email, so where did you actually see that email? My main issue with the Pizzagate investigation is things that people think they've seen because someone told them it existed and that becomes a "legit" point of investigation when it never happened. Like the picture of Podestas hands that someone photoshopped.

       While I agree we should investigate PG, I disagree that you should "FLOOD" this sub with Pizza material. I say that because there are other conspiracies happening. Things far greater than their practicing occultism. War of Light and Dark is soon to be upon us. A meta human war is on the horizon. We must also stay vigilant for those signs, and the other "conspiracies" that will arise.

       This is probably the largest force of amateur investigations there has ever been (at least recently) against the elite.  If it's true, then you know they are scrambling to cover this up, create distractions and shill on reddit.  When it comes to other conspiracies, there's nothing we can really do.  Are we all going to travel to Antarctica and look for aliens?  No?  Then keep digging into pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       spez:  Worst comes to worst, pizzagate isn't real, but we might find other child abduction rings or pedo rings in the process of looking.  We could actually do some good instead of prepping our tinfoil hats.

       Dude, why are you on a conspiracy forum if you're going to encourage people to NOT think critically and question their reality? One look at your post history and all you've done is criticize and attack pizzagate posts. You clearly have a bias on this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post made it to the front page overnight, clearly you are in the minority. Why do you care so much? Aren't you supposed to support critical thinking and questioning of the norm, not DISCOURAGE it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck in your campaign....

       Because conspiracies really exist, they really do. I even gave you an example of one in my original comment (Watergate). You are NOT thinking critically, and your wording betrays your cognitive bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're offended by me challenging
       <strong>
        <em>
         "your reality"
        </em>
       </strong>
       , it's because there's no such thing as
       <strong>
        <em>
         "your reality"
        </em>
       </strong>
       , there's just reality. Reality doesn't change because you give it a silly label, or because you
       <strong>
        <em>
         choose
        </em>
       </strong>
       to believe in something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm offended that when I bring up real issues, with real evidence, I get dismissed because of people like you. There are so many people like you making shit up and polluting the waters that real issues are dismissed because they get grouped with bullshit like "pizzagate".
      </p>
      <p>
       You are NOT thinking critically, and there is no such thing as subject reality. Why am I here? Because years ago there were interesting discussions
       <strong>
        <em>
         and evidence
        </em>
       </strong>
       provided in links regarding political conspiracies and back-door dealings. But now it's full of people like you making us all look bad.

       Yes, I'm biased against bullshit and fantasies based on nothing.

      <p>
       I've now explained why I care, it's because the truth,
       <em>
        the reality
       </em>
       of a topic is important. There is no reality to this pizzagate bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I AM supporting critical thinking skills, but you haven't demonstrated any critical thinking. You're simply getting defensive when challenged. If you had evidence for "your reality" you'd have presented it. But you haven't. Because there is no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what critical thinking skills are about, the ability to recognise what your biases are
       <em>
        and address them
       </em>
       . You think I'm biased because I've only ever said negative things about pizzagate?
       <em>
        Please tell me why I should believe it.
       </em>
       I don't choose what I believe, I'm driven to believe what I see to be evidently true. You've given me NO reason to think pizzagate is based in any demonstrable reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I get the shits with bullshit like pizzagate, because you poison the well and make it harder to expose
       <strong>
        <em>
         real
        </em>

       It's not just Comet PingPong though, folks. It's everywhere. In the highest levels of government, charitable organizations, church, etc. Dig beyond PizzaGate. Go back to the Penn State cover up, the Catholic church cover up, Franklin, Cathy O'Brien, etc. It's an interwoven fabric of depravity, greed, and pure evil. They have been the hunters for too long and we, the prey. Get to the bottom of it all. There are bits and pieces spread all over, they just have to get tied together.

       If nothing become of pizzagate, all those tortured and murdered children will never forgive you. They trusted us to protect them, and we failed. We can't let their deaths and suffering be in vain. Do this for teh sake of the children who are still alive. Some are being held by the cia at safe houses.

       It's almost nakedly obvious that the way to kill any public interest in authentic pedo-rings is by creating a Pizzagate-style "citizens investigation movement" that has low standards for evidence, wages accusations easily, and can be easily infiltrated Cointelpro-style to inject poisonous fake evidence that will discredit the movement.

       Don't give into hysteria and never lose hope! By taking an ethical, fact-based approach to exposing the truth anyone can contribute to the cause!

       Yeah you're the one being hysterical, not to mention there is no proof on that page. Just a list of people who have been arrested proving that child abuse is a real thing, which nobody was ever arguing. What it doesn't prove is any connection of pedophilia to the pizza restaurant beyond modern art which people find creepy and the fact that they said the word pizza in an email referring to a pizza place.

       The Wiki itself is obviously a work in progress, but quite a bit of research goes into sources themselves and verifying information used in its pages. As you demonstrate, a much higher standard is held to prove something's authenticity than a given Reddit or Voat post.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing hysterical about solemn facts. Could you honestly refute either of those statements? I meant that to be thought provoking because strangely enough human trafficking exists on a scale more prolific than that of violent crime and international terrorism, but nobody ever hears about those crimes or their perpetrators.
      </p>
      <p>
       For various reasons, John Podesta's connection to a bizarre pizza place was the first time Americans openly discussed and published information on the subject without being completely censored and belittled. In its own way Pizzagate has been one of the best exercises of the First Amendment and the public's civic duty to monitor and audit its representatives. Say what you will, but the truth comes out more every day.

       You and your children will die. That's a solemn fact, but if I yelled it at you in the street it would sound pretty hysterical. Not to mention the completely misleading statistics at the start, about 800,000 children going missing every year that have been refuted by the author of the study.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you think harassing an innocent man, harassing his family, his business and now showing up at his restaurant with a fucking rifle threatening to kill him over literally nothing is a good exercise of first amendment rights?  Harassment isn't covered under the first amendment.

       to the author of the study taking about how the number is overblown. Also to add I am not saying nothing should be done because it's overblown, I still think every effort should be made to rescue kids from those horrible situations. But harassing a pizza owner whose only crime is donation to the Democratic party and posting and liking weird modern art.

       The people arguing for evidence here are completely clueless about pizzagate in general. I could ask them a series of simple questions such as, "How did the "Pizzagate" investigation start?" or "Suspect language was discovered in the emails of what important figure of the 2016 HRC presidential campaign? What was the suspect language and what was it believed to be used for?" or "Name at least 7 businesses that are potentially implicated in the pizzagate scandal", and they wouldn't be able to answer ANY of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, most of the people who deny any theory such as this, are usually uneducated on the topic to begin with. You can easily call them out by testing their knowledge of the subject with a few questions, and if they can't even give you a summary of the basic structure or present a rudimentary understanding of the topic at hand, then their opinion on the topic doesn't matter. Why would the opinion of someone who isn't educated on the subject hold any merit? Especially against someone who actually spent countless hours researching it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, since this is the internet, these idiots can just go google the information real quick and come back and pretend like they knew the answers all along and claim to have researched thoroughly, but the fact that almost everyone here is ASKING for us to present them with our links and findings, shows that they clearly haven't even looked into it at all! They were just immediately turned away by the media's shit smear with the "conspiracy" "alt-right" buzzwords, and they're echoing that same crap here (on a forum where critical thinking and questioning is supposed to be encouraged, mind you).
      </p>
      <p>
       Either that, or they're shills...I assume most of the shills here are actually well versed and have a fundemental understanding of Pizzagate and are familiar with the matrix of links and evidence we've presented. They are going to be more effective at opposing the idea if they are relatively familiar with it, so they can better attack it, learn it's points of vulnerability, and have the trust of other users on the board.

       Because you're accusing somebody of being a pedophile with no evidence. And no an Instagram post or an email with supposed "code words"that were never liked to pedophilia until this "scandal" broke aren't evidence. Neither is saying he was in a room one time with a guy who was once in a room with a convicted sex offender.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are already convinced he's a pedophile, so when you see an Instagram picture with any child your mind automatically assumes the worse, even if it's not. Put up something not tied together with string and conjecture and then maybe people will take you seriously.

       Who is "he"? who are you referring to? Seems like you are trying to promote the idea that Pizzagate investigation is only centered around Comet Ping Pong and James Alefantis. That is evidence that you clearly have not even bothered to look into this subject at length whatsoever. We're focusing on the bigger picture, exposing human trafficking at the highest levels of society. It' already been exposed in the Catholic church, and several politicians and billionaires and members of royalty have been implicated as well in SEVERAL countries, time and again. This is fact. You're thinking too close minded, the rest of us are thinking big picture. You know, you are very destructive to the free thinking environment on this sub reddit....I'm not attacking you, i'm simply pointing out the flaws in your thought process. And you're not contributing to a constructive discussion of ANYTHING on this sub, so why are you on a conspiracy forum in the first place?

       Ah so changing the goal into something vague and trying to connect to real crimes to make your nonsense seem real.

       And I'm here because the real conspiracy is the right wing getting Internet Lynch mobs to attack their political opponents and their supporters. Look where the initial list of code words came from. 
I'm here because this is all a ridiculous witch hunt that is taking attention away from actual child abuse and ruining a man's life when all he is proven guilty of is donating to the Democratic party, and posting and liking weird modern art. 
I'm here because somebody has to go against the circlejerk and ask these questions.

       Alright so i looked into all your proof and the creepiest things I've seen are those twitter posts. Literally none of that is searchable or able to be found on the internet though. So it was either all removed(even the non creep shit?) Or someone just photoshopped those to make it seem like he was posting them on twitter. Based on everything else i feel like it was made up. Can someone prove me otherwise?

       When you have some real evidence of children being hurt, and not codes from emails and fucking instagram photos, then we can have a convo about an independent investigation. I really do hope no one gets hurt because so far the closest people to being hurt were restaurant patrons. And what do you mean "you guys"? I grew up in the area and don't want fucking loonies shooting up the place. If you really want to help, give all info to the police and stop playing armchair detective.

       Also want to say that I take back the part about wanting you to get fucked. Just heated because I don't want anyone to get hurt and it's close to home. I don't believe in the evidence provided, but it does scare me that people who do (not all of course) feel the need to take action into their own hands with guns

       See ^ . I've noticed CTR on here have suddenly shifted to this "I hope everybody is ok at Comet Ping Pong" narrative following today's incident. If you're not aware, apparently some guy went into Comet with a gun today. The way the shills are now suddenly and uniformily using this as leverage and hiding behind it in an attempt to make our investigation look whacky, it's possible that it could have potentially been enacted by Comet.

       . The guys on there are essentially saying the same thing, they're looking for a connection between the "gun man" and Alefantis. They beleive this was likely perpetrated by Comet to attack the credibility of our investigation.

       I'll check it tomorrow, but just so we are clear, I am in the camp of "this is more likely someone who read about this on the internet than a false flag". It could be a false flag, but it could also be a lunatic. Oh and the gunman incident is the only reason I posted here.

       I'm really not sure how to respond to this. It's much more likely this was an unstable individual than yet another part of the pizzagate "conspiracy". Then again, regardless of what happens, i'm sure y'all will find someway to make it part of your narrative. Have a great evening!

       I'm not exactly sure about the camera deal. I've seen some screen grabs that show it looking at Nebraska ave towards Wisconsin/Reno roads and it is currently looking @ Connecticut towards md. I don't know the ins and outs of traffic camera use, but it's definitely possible that they change the view on different days/times because statistically there are more accidents, etc. So far I see no proof of it being intentionally pointed away, and I honestly have no idea if it is ever used to look at the comet side of the street. Generally cams are used facing the traffic on the side of the street where the camera is located to see license plates (which in this case would not be the comet side). It is also possible that the camera is looking for rush hour traffic so in the am we would expect Connecticut towards md and in the afternoon Connecticut towards downtown DC. On weekends there is less concern about rush hour traffic and the reversible lanes used during rush hour (instead of 3/3 it goes 4/2 to accommodate more rush hour traffic) are not in effect, so the camera may be pointed in a different direction.

       There is too much quality evidence out there for you to convince any rational person out there that pizzagate isn't real, so the "It's a psyop!" angle isn't going to work there. Maybe try the, "This has become a witch hunt" instead. That bit might be more up your alley.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by the way, you're discouraging critical thinking and skepticism by telling us to stop investigating and that we are crazy. This is a conspiracy forum, who the hell says that to someone else on a conspiracy forum? Shouldn't we encourage this investigation, not brush it off? You are in the minority of people on this board in regard to pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck.

       It's entirely circumstantial, based upon a couple of people reading emails that dealt with a pizza party and italian food and deciding that because
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       don't have long email strings involving busy govt officials trying to the plan a party, that means it never happens. Then they decided, because obviously, people from the govt planning to eat pizza together
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be doing something more, applied other scenarios, picked the ugliest they could find, then decided real words were actually code words that supported a wholly made-up scenario.

       There isn't one. We have a foreign government plain as day fucking with our election and these guys are focusing on this nonsense. This is why we are fucked as a country. Conspiracy types cast a big net and occasionally are right about something important, like the DNC rigging for Hillary. That's useful. But when they get so in the bed for one candidate we all lose out. This is an example.

       What made me believe in pisagate was this video that was posted on youtube. Its back from 2007 I believe. Some dude working in the insurance industry stood across the street from comet ping pong and placed his camera on the ground and filmed two people playing ping pong outside of coment, trying to figure out liability issues like who would be responsible if the ball hit a car or something. If you turn up the volume in that video you could hear kids screaming "help me" "im down here" "heeelllpp". This is a youtube video that was uploaded in 2007 and also has a caption in video stating the date, 2007, so this was before this pisagate thing blew up. They say that cometpingpong has an underground system of tunnels where they have the kids and do their pedo shit so to me this video gave more evidence of it possibly being 100% real. If i can find the video ill post it, should have saved it before :(

       There is no proof of any wrongdoing. When you examine the underpinnings is built on you find it has no validity whatsoever. We have people beung labeled as pedophiles, being targeted and harassed, with zero evidence that any has ever even had an untoward thought about a child.

       Think of it like the mafia - they do absolutely everything to hide their actions and dealings, but you can see the hints of it everywhere you look. You're not able to deal with smoking guns because there's no way that is just going to conveniently appear on the internet. You only have the shadows that they cast, and can slowly put it together to make out the silhouette. If you want to start physically knocking on doors and examining hot spot areas, you might find more stuff to sort through, but you're not going to find it by combing through the internet.

       Police would still need a reason to question somebody. And what everyone is telling you is that the evidence you and others say proves the validity of pizzagate is not even close to enough. The necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges, and the pizzagate conspiracists have not produced true proof of anything, by any legal or logical understanding of the word.

       Not sure what a "smoking gun" would be, but there's been a lot of shadiness found that demands further investigation. Unfortunately, we got hysteria-prone christians and disinfo agents spamming BREAKING, and other similar attention grabbers, that turn out to be the same "creepy" photos that everyone's already seen a hundred fuckin times!

       Maybe there is no smoking gun yet because the people behind all of this don't want the smoking gun to be found so easily/at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a fan of the X-Files, as are alot of other people probably,  and the biggest issue for Mulder and Scully was finding the hard evidence before Smoking Man or the Syndicate or Krycek got to it first. All of their paranormal experiences, alien encounters, conspiracy leads from members of higher levels of govt,  didn't mean anything without the actual
       <em>
        hard evidence
       </em>
       , the scientific mathematical, biological proof (of an alien virus or dna for example).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the people behind those conspiracies got to the smoking gun first using tactics that included murder,  spying, discrediting,  distracting,  etc.

        Why is it so absurd to think that these people are making it impossible for us to find that smoking gun?  Especially since they have the power,  the influence, the connections, the money, the tools, the necessity and determination and fear (of not being exposed).

       There isn't a smoking gun yet, but there are definitely things that cause suspicion. More recently,  the BBC article said that we think this pedophilia ring is being operated under ground in comet pizzas basement. The owner in the article stated that
       <strong>
        they don't even have a basement.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Web sleuths then found an interview with the pizza place owner from a much earlier date stating that
       <strong>
        his tomatoes are homegrown,  in the basement of his establishment.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So which is it?  Is this a schrödingers basement where it only exists when pedophilia isn't involved?

       While it is circumstantial, it is a large amount of circumstantial evidence. The fact that it is met with such fierce opposition suggests there is something larger at play. What is happening now and what has been happening has been an obvious cover up. If they had an explanation, they would have come out with it. However, they continue to deflect, dodge, and ignore any evidence pertaining to this. I mean here's a block in D.C. with a majority of the businesses having FBI recognized pedophilia related symbols, it was a
       <em>
        gift
       </em>
       involving Saudi groups, and it implicates government officials. It all seems pretty fitting of a conspiracy theory. But if you bring it up, there is a large group who completely dismiss it and argue that it should not be discussed. I just think everyone should be open minded and look at any possibility. And look at the possible
       <em>
        reasons
       </em>
       the elites have for doing what they do.

       The fact that you had to ask for concrete evidence to be placed in front of you, shows that you havent even taken the time to research the topic and investigate it yourself. I suggest you start digging or looking at one of the pizzagate graphics or some youtube videos, I'll try to find a link for you : )

       This is a conspiracy related forum. If you're into conspiracies enough to frequent this board, why the hell would you be encouraging other people that they are "kooks" and "crazy" to investigate pizzagate?
I would think the potential for some of our most prominent world leaders being involved in a human trafficking ring wouldn't be something I could simply "brush off", but I would never discourage anyone from doing research into ANYTHING. That makes me just as bad as the people who call you crazy for thinking 9/11 was an inside job or that JFK was potentially murdered by the government...

       Why don't you look for yourself like the rest of us do? Why do we have to plop a platter of all of our findings right in front of your face?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are going to frequent a conspiracy related forum, shouldn't you know how to do your own research and come to your own conclusions by yourself, instead of letting the tide of public opinion steer you?

       Start digging. This post made it to the top overnight, so obviously a MASSIVE amount of people who frequent this board have taken an interest into pizzagate.

       It is all circumstantial. STRONG circumstantial evidence however.
      </p>
      <p>
       To find proof there would need to be a search warrant, which is all we're pushing for. A true investigation by LE, not a coverup.
      </p>
      <p>
       However do note that most criminals are convicted on circumstantial evidence. There is no doubt in my mind that Pizzagate has uncovered the nexus of the worlds largest human trafficking operation. Most can't be posted here though due to site bans on "doxxing". Go to voat and subscribe, there are new breakthroughs literally every day.

       Hastert is a sicko, and there was tons of actual evidence (victims, witnesses, physical evidence, payments) of it -- and he helped cover-up Mark Foley's crimes with Congressional pages.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is still zero evidence of "Pizzagate" i.e. victims would be a good start, but witnesses would be good, anything. That the Podestas are both art collectors, that means absolutely nothing.
