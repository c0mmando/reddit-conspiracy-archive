<p>if someone wants to get their news from tne national enquirer, more power to them.</p>

<p>if the fake news thing is just a ploy by the MSM to stigmatize all competitive sources of information, it&#39;s nothing but a sad desperate death rattle. if it results in laws and blacklisting and censorship, it is frightning.</p>

<p>it&#39;s time for people to abandon facebook  twitter, google, reddit. they are private corporations, they can censor as the please...and they apparently are, yet people still use them.</p>

They routinely create fake news (hello CNN and MSNBC), so when something like this happens and shit hits the fan, their first assumption is something they believe is possible because they themselves have done before.

    <div class="md"><p>jesus christ, not this shit again.</p>

<p>CNN, MSNBC etc, are in no way, shape, or form  leftist. they didn&#39;t back clinton because she was on the left, they backed her because she was their parent companies&#39; bitch. </p>

<p>they are extensions of the Agro-Oil-MIC. look who advertises on them. ADM? KOCH? GE? Boeing?...these aren&#39;t companies viewers can buy from (GE isn&#39;t advertising blenders on CNN, nor are shell and BP advertising gas for your car, with their ads on these channels).</p>

<p>there is no war these channels don&#39;t cheerlead or police brutality they don&#39;t ignore or justify. this shit isn&#39;t leftist.</p>

<p>most of the news sources on the PropOrNot blacklist are the most respected true leftist news sources--truthdig, counterpunch, truthout, etc. all of which are pushing 20 years. </p>

<p>christopher hitchens was a socialist, as was george orwell. george carlin was far left, as was hunter s thompson. they&#39;re all dead. all we have left now are tom morello and jello biafra...the true left has been silenced for a long time.</p>

<p>the left has fuckall power in this country, and has always had fuckall power. go look at the political compass. this country is facist (except that now it is inverted facism). all of the politicians are right on top of each other chilling with mussolini. there is no daylight between romney, obama, clinton, bush, mccain, and it&#39;s looking like trump is going to be right there with them.</p>

<p>hillary clinton is a rabid neocon,neolib, she isn&#39;t in the same universe as the left.  obama is a smooth talkin neocon, neolib. bernie is the closest the left has, and he&#39;s still an imperialist (and tbh, russ finegold had a better record of voting in line with left, at least he voted against the predictive programming 1994 crime bill).</p>

<p>the only fights the left has ever won are your right to be able to go to the bathroom when you need to so as not to have to piss yourself, the right to scarf up a bag of cool ranch dorritos and guzzle down a diet coke in the 30 minutes you get to have lunch, the right to not have to eat cat food when you&#39;re 80 and to go to the doctor if you can eek it out till you&#39;re 65...oh, and the right for black people to not to be hung from trees for being uppity.  </p>

<p>we&#39;ve already lost the rest of the left&#39;s few victories--the weekend, the vacation, the 8hr workday, the 40hr week, clean water--on our breakneck back sliding towards gilded age dickensianism.</p>

<p>you swallow the left/right bullshit mindlessly. there&#39;s more than one red pill to be taken out there to really see behind the veil...</p>
