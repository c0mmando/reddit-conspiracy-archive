        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe I have found a correlation between the sexual abuse of children and the purpose behind it. As some of us know, the perpetual sexual and physical abuse of children is heavily carried out in satanic type rituals. Well, why would they do this? Just because they are evil good for nothing people? Partly, but also because it creates a spiritual energy that can be utilized by the practitioner for dark magic. </p>

<p>The Montauk Chair Project. This project was to investigate time travel, metaphysics, and a series of other experiments using the power of the mind intermingled with electronic devices. It was a mashup of physical and spiritual interactions to see what could be done. One of the quotes from an alleged victim(Andy Pero) said, &quot;Well, I was told that there are asexual, homosexual and heterosexual couplings that each produces a different level of <strong>orgone</strong>  energy.&quot; </p>

<p>(Bold intentional, Source: <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/superman/project_superman.htm">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/superman/project_superman.htm</a>)</p>

<p>So I researched Orgone Energy and I found that Orgone Energy is typically known to be symbolized by a spiral and pyramid type design, do a quick search on &#39;orgone energy&#39; or &#39;orgone energy spirals&#39; or &#39;orgone pyramids&#39; and you will see what I mean. So when seeing those I immediately thought of of the Pedophile Symbols which are, none other than images of spiraling pyramids as released by the FBI and seen here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/sHX0G">http://imgur.com/a/sHX0G</a></p>

<p>So it seems there is a much deeper rabbit hole than a group of perverts who want to exploit children. It appears there is a very dark, demonic, spiritual aspect to this that is becoming more and more exposed. It&#39;s as if they do these rituals to exploit this energy for some purpose, but for what, i&#39;m not sure. Any insight? Back to the research. Please let me know what you think, thanks for reading!</p>

<p>TL;DR - Pizzagate is more than perverted people exploiting children, it a ritualistic demonic spiritual practice which has something to do with orgone energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was looking into this correlation a little bit too.</p>

<p>When the FBI tweeted some of their mysterious tweets, one was on Tesla. Tesla studied many things, including mind control, time travel etc. Marina Abramovic brother is an expert on Tesla and has written about his studies.</p>

<p>I was never able to fully connect all the dots, but I still have a feeling that the FBI was trying to tell us something with their mysterious tweets. I feel that some of Nikola Tesla&#39;s projects were perfected by our government, such as mkultra mind control etc...</p>

<p>To me, this stuff is really hard to believe until conclusive evidence is presented, but at this point I&#39;m keeping an open mind because, lately, the truth has been stranger than fiction. Many &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; that were deemed crazy and nuts have actually been true! </p>

<p>Strange things are coming to light. Keep researching, keep coming up with interesting theories. At some point, somebody will connect the dots!</p>

<p>Edit: marina Abramovic brother is named velimir abramovic. He has written extensively on Nikola Tesla. He seems to be an expert on Tesla&#39;s research and life. Maybe his studies produced knowledge that Marina uses in her own spirituality, which influences the many elite members of society that associate with her. Maybe spirit cooking uses some of these theories.</p>

<p>Tesla was a master manipulator of electricity. Society knows very little about electrical energy. The human body and even trees produce minute electrical signals. The human brain has an &#39;optimal&#39; electrical property. (I know very little about this, so pardon my elementary use of terms to explain). Some scientists theorize that we are able to manipulate the brains energy and if you go higher or lower than the &#39;optimal&#39; range, it causes mental and physical sickness. Transcranial electrical stimulation has been found to instantly relieve depression in mentally ill patients. Ultra sound treatment is being studied and showed promise in curing Alzheimer&#39;s. </p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t know how this all might tie together with satanic rituals, but maybe the elite know something they are not telling the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re probably right. It&#39;s crazy how much information is kept from us.i can see why some things need to be top secret, but it seems like the government hides way too much. Knowledge that could potentially give us better health, happiness, or cleaner energy... </p>

<p>The reason they hide this stuff is for money and power. It&#39;s time they declassify all this information. The only things that should be classified are strategic stuff like spies and operatives.</p>

<p>Yes there are evil people, and yes they are blackmailing each other to hide all their dirty secrets, but it is inevitable that we will find out, they will be outed. I guess the only questions are who will be brought through our justice system and when. (Once all the systemic corruption is cleaned up of course.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of us believe the upper echelons worship lucifer as the light bearer, giver of knowledge to mankind.  Typically they will refer to lucifer not satan.  They believe knowledge and power are most important; some believe in him, some just use as a metaphor for human enlightenment.  Either way, there does seem to be sacrifice and sex magik involved in the ceremonies and belief system.  Taking a &quot; holy&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; item or ritual and inverting it into something profane is another important aspect to show they have rebelled against what they perceive as a controlling and manipulative God and accepted the enlightenment of lucifer.   Ultimately It is not used for good, however lower level initiates may think it has altruistic uses.  Think of social Darwinism on steroids... If I am enlightened billionaire/trillionaire that knows the true history of the world and you are a blinded sheep toiling in the mud, what consequence is your life or death to me?  If you start researching this rabbit hole you can really get overwhelmed.   research the founding fathers of the Rothschilds as well as the alternate history of the Vatican / Jesuits</p>

    <div class="md"><p>basically, there&#39;s a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. The wrong way to do it is the natural outcome of the human approach which is self deception based and self convenience based. All people automatically do things this way and it automatically turns out wrong. The right way to do it is to accept direction from God which will automatically occur by design if your intentions are correct. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2939ap/its_been_more_than_a_year_since_edward_snowden/cihpnux/?context=1">This post says it way better than I could</a></p>

<p>What if this dimension is really just a collection point for harvesting negative emotional energy?  Demons could be the so called grey aliens walking among us.  Running our governments and media.  You could then view the whole planet as a giant cattle lot for greys.  </p>

<p>Makes me wonder about all the disclosure talk in those emails.  Maybe aliens do walk among us, but in return they harvest our children for &quot;energy&quot;.  Why it&#39;s so covered up on such a grand scale across all countries.   Satanism could just be a play on words for human harvesting by aliens.  </p>

<p>This all like a mix between the movies <a href="http://annyas.com/htdocs/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/they-live-16.jpg">They Live</a> and <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/7a/8d/c4/7a8dc4cbd1abda1646bf88a70a9581e4.jpg">HG Wells Time Machine</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>Your intuition is correct.  Human nature is admittedly quite flawed, but even the worst offenders in prison hate the child molesters, and tend to single them out for special torture.  There&#39;s something in our core humanity that abhors harming the innocence of a child, and it takes incredible energy to overcome that protective instinct.  And when it&#39;s overcome, it literally fractures the psyche.  So why do these people do what they do if it takes such a personal toll to do so, and what&#39;s the ultimate purpose behind it?</p>

<p>This is where we get into why people can so easily dismiss the existence of such things: the answer to the above is a spiritual reality -- the existence of which people are more and more conditioned to deny.  You cannot possibly begin to understand the nature of what&#39;s going on without understanding that there is a spiritual reality, and that there is a spiritual battle between good and evil.  Specifically, a biblical Christian worldview, especially in the context of discerning the proper actions to take.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. [<strong>Eph. 6:12</strong>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These rituals -- whether its the SRA (satanic ritual abuse) method of programming multiple identities, the occult, Eyes Wide Shut-style orgies, or ritualistically raping children -- operate on the ancient practices of &quot;sexual energy manipulation,&quot; or, as Aleister Crowley dubbed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema">Thelema</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_magic"><em>sex magick</em></a>.  You can see the symbolism of sex magic in ancient Egyptian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phallic_architecture">phallic architecture</a>, the most famous of which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor_Temple">Temple at Luxor</a>.</p>

<p>Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth">Egyptian myth of Osiris</a>, the obelisk represents the phallus of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris">Osiris</a> as reconstructed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis">Isis</a> after he was hacked into pieces by the god <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_%28deity%29">Set</a> (following his resurrection after Set killed him the first time), the entrance to the temple is the vagina of Isis, and the temple itself is her womb.  In the myth, Set scatters Osiris&#39; hacked up body parts throughout the earth, and Isis seeks out and recovers all but his penis.  She reassembles his body with a fabricated stone phallus, has a sex ritual with his body, and becomes pregnant with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus">Horus</a>.</p>

<p>In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh was considered the embodiment of Horus the deity, but he wasn&#39;t born that way.  When a new pharaoh was to be enthroned, he was taken to the Temple at Luxor where the priests and priestesses had and orgy all night outside the temple while the soon-to-be pharaoh sat inside, right in the center of &quot;the womb of Isis.&quot;  When the sun rose at dawn, the sun god <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra">Ra</a> &quot;stimulated&quot; the phallus of Osiris (represented by the sun&#39;s rays going down the shaft of the obelisk), and the phallus &quot;ejaculated&quot; magical energy into the &quot;womb,&quot; impregnating it with the life that would be birthed as the god Horus.  When the new pharaoh emerged, he was thus considered to be Horus the god in human form.</p>

<p>When compared to all other polytheistic religions, this myth is seen repeated throughout time and around the world.  Babylonian, Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek, Roman, and Hindu gods and goddesses were all relatively the same entities with different names.  This is the &quot;mystery&quot; at the heart of &quot;mystery religions,&quot; and the occult center of all secret societies today.  I&#39;ve just made everyone reading this privy to the information given to 33rd degree Scottish Right freemasons, &quot;illuminati&quot; 9th Circle priests, and the ruling world elite.  Now you don&#39;t need to join them to access the &quot;hidden mysteries.&quot;</p>

<p>When compared to Judeo-Christian monotheism, however, this is the exact antithesis of the nature of God as revealed in his Son, Jesus the Christ.  The myth reverses the roles of the characters, making Set (Seth, the third son of Adam and Eve and the one through whom the Savior was promised after the murder of Abel) the evil one, and establishing an occult version of the &quot;deity death and resurrection&quot; theme before the birth of Christ.  Satan understood the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protevangelium">Protevangelium</a> enough to have established this deception in hopes of getting humans to worship him and his fellow fallen angels masquerading as gods and goddesses, and it worked very well.</p>

<p>When the Gospel of Christ began to spread, Satan used persecution to try to snuff it out.  Tens of thousands of early Christians were slaughtered, but persecution only emboldened early believers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.  Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. [<strong>Matt. 5:12-13</strong>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Satan changed tactics and began to infiltrate the church itself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.  And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. [<strong>2 Thes. 2:7-8</strong>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christianity became legal, and then it became the state religion, and then it became the Roman Catholic church.  When the church obtained actual temporal power, it &quot;made a friend of the world, and [became] at enmity with God,&quot; and was fully infiltrated by Satan&#39;s human hands, who had been driven from public pagan ceremonies into hidden secret societies, still conducting the same ritualistic orgies, sex magic, and ritual sacrifice that had been taking place for millennia.  We are fast approaching the time when &quot;the one who now holds it back will ... [be] taken out of the way,&quot; and Satan&#39;s evil will have no restraint.</p>

<p>So, very long introduction for my explanation, but it&#39;s necessary to understand the true nature of what&#39;s taken place until now to understand why they do what they do.  These rituals actually <em>do</em> have power to effect the spiritual realm.  Evil thrives where there&#39;s fear, pain, confusion, terror, etc.  During these rituals, especially the rape and sacrifice of a child, there&#39;s a significant realized potential to physically manifest spiritual energy.  In other words, the rituals literally open portals to hell, allowing those entities the opportunity to enter into our world.  What do you think UFOs really are?  Why do you think they act sometimes as if they&#39;re physical, sometimes as if they&#39;re corporeal?  What do you think &quot;aliens&quot; are?  Why do you think Aleister Crowley&#39;s <a href="http://www.excludedmiddle.com/LAMstatement.html">sketch of the entity the came through the portal he opened</a> nearly 100 years ago so closely resembles that we call &quot;the Greys&quot; today?  This stuff is real, my friend, and it&#39;s very, very evil.</p>

<p>Only the Holy Spirit of God holds it back, but where people commit egregious evil sins, God does not abide there, and &quot;gives them over to their own desires of a perverse mind.&quot;  Does it sound crazy?  Absolutely.  Because Satan has been working for millennia to condition this generation to believe that it is crazy.  But we will very soon witness the end-game, and there will be no denying it.  Though I&#39;m filled with dread as we rapidly approach the close of the age, I hold fast to the hope of Christ&#39;s soon return.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a man named Rick Renner, he lives in Russia and has been studying Greek for 30 years. He says the &quot;Last days&quot; actually started at the &quot;Day of Pentecost&quot; Which is why people have been saying we are living in the last days for the last 2000 years. And this is what he interprets this one passage to mean after going through all the different meanings of the greek words used and the way they were compounded together. It really gives a much better insight than any english bible translation ever could. Makes me wonder what else the bible says that we don&#39;t know about.....And mind you, this passage is only one areas of the N.T. talking about the last days. Jesus also talks about them being full of &quot;wars and rumors of wars&quot; Nature and animals dying ect... And that these are only the beginning of birth pains.....</p>

<p>Renner started giving this expounded version back in the 90&#39;s way before our obsession with violent video games and movies, social media, cell phones, the spread of &quot;anything goes&quot; crude and vulgar language and comedy like we have now today. (Sam Kinison is the first absolutely vulgar comic I know of from the early 90&#39;s) the massive spread of Pornography, the LGBTQI movement. ect...</p>

<p>One of the greek words actually translates into the &quot;I AM&quot; Generation or what we now call the &quot;ME&quot; generation. A term that was coined in the 70&#39;s was actually coined by the Holy Spirit 2000 years ago.</p>

<p>2 Timothy 3 Greek expounded</p>

<p>The Holy Spirits prophecy warning speaking through the Apostle Paul,</p>

<p>&quot;You emphatically must know what I am about to tell you! In the very part of the last days - at the very end of the age and at the very last of the last days, - periods of time will come that are hurtful, harmful, dangerous, unpredictable, uncomfortable, and high-risk. People will feel encumbered by it, like you are standing in the middle of it with prison bars around you and there is no way to escape it. Mankind at large will have misdirected love from godly love to being self-consumed, self-absorbed, self-focused and in love with themselves more than anyone else.</p>

<p>As a result of this self-love, they will hoard money for themselves while spending very little to help others. These boasters are so committed to their own self-promotion and agenda that they are willing to exaggerate, overstate the facts, stretch the truth, embellish a story, and even lie if it will get them the position, advantage, or goal they desire. They will be arrogant, haughty, impudent, snooty, and insolent. They will never be satisfied and will never have enough.</p>

<p>They disdain, mock, slander, and speak ill of anyone that stands in the way of their plans. Everything will be off the table, anything goes. They will think they have a right to everything and in this environment, parents will no longer be able to persuade, control, lead or exercise authority over their children. Although they were once thankful and appreciative, people will become void of gratitude and generally unappreciative of everything in the last time. As a result, impurity will seep into society and cause it to become unholy -- impure, ill-mannered, unclean, indecent, coarse, vulgar, offensive, crude, lewd and rude. Behaving and carrying on in a way that God would never sanction.</p>

<p>Love and commitment for family will degenerate; divorce will become epidemic with irreconcilable differences being the major cause for separation; and the court system will be overwhelmed as people go overboard in their suing others and in being sued. People will turn savage, vicious, uncivilized, violent, ferocious, and inhuman. A society where law is not primarily intended to protect the rights of good people but rather is used instead to protect and defend the rights of offenders. People will be preoccupied with and known for their obsession with violence.</p>

<p>People will be lovers of pleasures and creature comforts more than lovers of God. Romantic with themselves, kissing themselves, showing deep profound affection for themselves, have a deep profound love for philosophy and wisdom while wanting to do everything they can to remove Truth (God laws) from their minds. Their doctrine will be that pleasure, comforts and happiness is the highest good; addiction to and obsession for pleasure as a way of life.&quot;</p>

<p>Renner said some of the Greek words used in this one passage were so rare that they are not used anywhere else in the New Testament.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>2 Timothy 3 Greek expounded...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have read through scripture of several translations, and I find this to be incredible.  Of course, we are to be as the Bereans, &quot;[receiving] the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so [<strong>Acts 17:11</strong>],&quot; but nonetheless, I love this expounded text.  The way it captures Paul&#39;s intent here is commendable, and very well done.  I very much appreciate the reference, and will look up more of Renner&#39;s work.</p>

<p>Regarding the actual message itself -- it is quite... startling (right word?)  Even the traditional renderings (KJV, ESV, etc.) describe our current time more accurately than any previous generation&#39;s attributes, and Renner&#39;s version simply seems to highlight and underscore that fact.</p>

<p>Another convicting passage I saw as I was checking my cross reference for the Borean quotation is what I&#39;ll wrap up with.  I pray I take this to heart, and that others may as well -- I&#39;m fully aware that the Spirit called my attention to it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[<strong>Rev 3:1-5 ESV</strong>] <em><sup>1</sup> &quot;And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: &#39;The words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. &quot;&#39;I know your works. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead. <sup>2</sup> Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God. <sup>3</sup> Remember, then, what you received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you. <sup>4</sup> Yet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments, and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy. <sup>5</sup> The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments, and I will never blot his name out of the book of life. I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks brother / sister.  And I also like real maple syrup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Child abuse has many aspects.</p>

<p>Traumatize a child before the age of 6, and it will not become the child it genetically would have expressed.</p>

<p>Child abuse is a sophisticated form of &quot;human-hacking&quot;, a way to tap into the individuals sub-conscious, and create a &quot;master-slave&quot; relationship.</p>

<p>It also makes the child&#39;s psyche incredibly easy to mold later on, and through consistent repetition of trauma, the child will have an incredibly hard time contemplating another way of life, and will make it very hard to escape, physically later on in life.</p>

<p>This is the basics of the human child abuse issue - the more sophisticated topic is how these monsters in this manner create a &quot;perpetual pool of resources&quot; - with enough humans to be self-sufficient in the long run - economically, genetically, through (selective) breeding, and on top of that, they have access to unregistered humans to satisfy their every desire, which also functions as a method for blackmail later on.</p>

<p>These people are a coherent and spiritually fused entity, who do not look on humanity with eyes you and I possess.</p>

<p>But the interesting part, is when a human being is perpetually abused, it never knows what true rest (of the soul) is, nor the concept of &quot;home&quot;, like you and I do.</p>

<p>Their lives is completely dependent on someone other than themselves, which makes them extremely alert.</p>

<p>So alert, many in the long run develop &quot;abilities&quot;. </p>

<p>-Abilities are another term for alertness - much beyond what carefree humans normally possess.</p>

<p>Their alert-levels are through the roof, and because of a constant instinct for survival and potential attacks, they are mentally prepared for anything, all the time.</p>

<p>During the First World War, this symptom was very acute for many soldiers, to such a degree, that many &quot;blew their circuits&quot; due to the extreme conditions of the &quot;modern&quot; war-machinery, constant hail of bullets, bombs and mustard gas - never knowing what was actually lurking around the corner - developing a &quot;syndrome&quot;, which is just another word for &quot;symptom&quot;, which is called &quot;shell-shock&quot;.</p>

<p>This is niftly named &quot;post traumatic stress disorder&quot; in today&#39;s language, and is a way to describe how the human mind can break under severe life-threatening situations over extended periods of time.</p>

<p>The Human system has genetic traits that helps us escape a life-endangering situation - we have reflexes, a &quot;fight or flight-response&quot;, help or escape and so on, which makes us very able to escape with our life intact if need be - but this response to trauma, or &quot;extreme stress&quot;, is biologically &quot;designed&quot; to only last for a short duration - enough for us to either fight, or get the hell outta the situation.</p>

<p>The adrenaline which helps us become alert to danger in dangerous situations, are not meant to be in our systems more than a few minutes at a time. It quickly breaks down in the body, once released, but the kick that happens when a surge of adrenaline flows through the body, is the key to all this shit.</p>

<p>For the victims, they are overloaded through living under sexual abuse, physical and psychological/psychic trauma, and live a life in fear.</p>

<p>Fear releases adrenaline, and they become alert, but are unable to escape their predicament.</p>

<p>But the human mind is still a survivor - even if all seems lost. Due to extreme conditions, mental capabilities explore every nook and cranny of the situation, in order to somehow spot a god-damn light in the end of the tunnel - anywhere - anyhow - anytime. The mind may be slower than a computer, but it is infinite it capability - all it needs is time...</p>

<p>For the perpetrators, the adrenaline are mixed with endorphins and other endocrines as a physical response to their actions, which roots to the concept of control in a dangerous situation - and the power of having the life and fate of another human being in the palm of your hand is a complete chapter on it&#39;s own.</p>

<p>Suffice to say that this gives another rush all in itself for many of those who choose to break this moral barrier - and this act alone, not necessary the act itself, but the stimulation of one&#39;s own nervous system in this manner is more often than not more &quot;animating and stimulating&quot; than normal everyday living and surviving of the work of your own two hands.</p>

<p>Now I have laid the groundwork for my basis of the message I am trying trying to get across:</p>

<p>-Quantum computers = (Abused) human beings.</p>

<p>-Time-machine = A quantum-computer able to foresee what normal humans cannot - or in other words; &quot;How do we not get caught for what we have done...?&quot;</p>

<p>-Quantum-Tunneling = A quantum-computers ability to look through time and space to another dimension/reality - or in plain words: visualizing another, and preferably better scenario than which you may currently find yourself in.</p>

<p>Aliens may or may not be an actual reality - but I have to stay with what I see, and what I know - and because of the spiritual connection to things, I can safely assume that Aliens are a term coined for humans with minds &quot;out of this world&quot; - and with a perspective so beyond normal human understanding, that it reflects the term it conveys.</p>

<p>Any kind of &quot;energy&quot; term used in the culture today, derives from the very process of invisible information flowing between human-beings, causing them to relate to one another, and the environment, in every which way. Though Orgone energy is a very good attempt to describe the bio-electricity that animates us all. From my own perspective, if it is at all wanted; Orgone Energy is the closest term yet for how the Sun animates us, without getting into too much details.</p>

<p>Black Magic is a power-dynamic - always in play, and more devious in action than many dares to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Anyways - this is my way of interpreting the scenario without too much mumbo-jumbo - because there is actually shit going on - so let&#39;s try and stay with the actual facts, and thereby narrowing the playing field a little by speaking the same god-damn language for once. Babylon is where &quot;The Gods&quot; fucked up the language - these times are no different.</p>

<p>Reich established the Orgonomic Infant Research Center (OIRC) in 1950, with the aim of preventing muscular armouring in children from birth. Meetings were held in the basement of his house in Forest Hills. Turner wrote that several children who were treated by OIRC therapists later said they had been sexually abused by the therapists, although not by Reich. One woman said she was assaulted by one of Reich&#39;s associates when she was five years old. Children were asked to stand naked in front of Reich and a group of 30 therapists in his basement, while Reich described the children&#39;s &quot;blockages.&quot;Reich&#39;s daughter, Lore Reich Rubin, told Turner that she believed her father was an abuser, although she did not say she had been abused by him, and she acknowledged that she had no evidence. She believed that Reich himself had been abused as a child, which is why he developed such an interest in sex and childhood sexuality.&quot;</p>

Here&#39;s an email where he&#39;s talking about going to an expert on orgone energy: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48204">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48204</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a lady giving a talk on orgone energy named Monica Borine, PhD. In the email it says, &quot;She is a specialist in the concepts and therapy of orgone energy&quot;.</p>

<p>Check out this orgone energy accumulator, and note that it incorporates two of the symbols that the pedophiles were using: <a href="http://tajagate.com/image/cache/data/Orgone%20Energy%20Stones/Orgone%20Pyramid/DSCN1601-800x1067.jpg">http://tajagate.com/image/cache/data/Orgone%20Energy%20Stones/Orgone%20Pyramid/DSCN1601-800x1067.jpg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes sense. I have been trying to wrap my head around what makes people do this kind of stuff. And on such a massive scale? For the life of me, I cannot imagine how there are that many people that are born pure evil and pedo&#39;s, just by nature. That&#39;s a lot of really twisted people into really sick stuff.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s counter-intuitive, I know, but it&#39;s been pretty well documented that many children who are abused often grow up to become child abusers themselves. It&#39;s also a frightening fact that ritual abuse has gone on for centuries within some families where it is their own children who are both being subjected to it and taught to do the same thing to their own children when the time comes.</p>

<p>Any one of the high placed monsters involved in this scandal has had the resources and ability to easily abuse a hundred or more children with complete impunity. Children who will be warped and damaged for life and who may never be able to escape from participating in it in one way or another due to not just the physical but the psychological trauma that&#39;s been inflicted on them.</p>

<p>As you should be able to understand without a vigilant public and diligent law enforcement the numbers have the capability to greatly multiply from one generation to the next. So much so that it&#39;s no longer so easy to hide how really prevalent it is. I&#39;m very much afraid that the only reason we&#39;re discussing this now is because it&#39;s already reached that state and we&#39;re going to be seeing and hearing about a lot more of it for a long while to come.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just awful when you put into perspective of how it continues and spreads. And you are right, this goes back for centuries. The fact that it has mainly occurred in upper echelon levels of society is what has allowed it to reach such epic proportions.</p>

<p>I cannot even wrap my head around what it would be like to be raised in such a horrible way and then carry on throughout life doing the same thing because that is normal for you. </p>

<p>So now we have these twisted people in positions of power facilitating stealing children to fuel their sick ways. It&#39;s absolutely disgusting in every way on every level! </p>

<p>How do we come back from that? Is it even possible? </p>

<p>orgone energy spirals</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting. First time I&#39;ve heard of this concept and I&#39;ve been studying these topics for many years (pizza gate only since the Hail Hillary campaign / Podesta emails  brought that to light though).</p>

<p>I agree with your assessment. There are SO many factors behind this. What&#39;s applicable? Well, I&#39;ve seen some theories and even building designs where the inhabitant insists that his backyard pyramid &quot;shed&quot; produces vast amounts of energy at its peak (see the US dollar bill for the all seeing eye). One of the functions of all the pyramids found <em>around the world</em> is that they sit on <a href="http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/leylines.htm">ley lines</a>. These are like focal points of energy from our planet. Think ripples on a pond where two or three concentric waves intersect constantly. </p>

<p>The pyramids like at giza are now defunct compared to how they operated in their prime, but they nevertheless point at a completely different paradigm of energetic/spiritually aware humans in our recent past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting - I&#39;ve been grappling about the possibility of any real supernatural occurrences coming into play here with this.  It would surely explain a lot, but it is hard to seriously invest myself into it.</p>

<p>I think it is worth mentioning that the &#39;High insider&#39; / fbianon admitted a few times that they are not actually satanists and that aliens are a distraction too.  They said that the pedo stuff was literally just the glue that holds them together, and probably helps protect them from people like ed snowden, i would gather.  Its completely fucked up, but it does make sense (considering they need cooperation to so illegal shit).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m beginning to think it&#39;s a little of both.  Kind of.</p>

<p>Let me explain... Even if they are experiencing the act of consorting with demons through rituals, that does not necessarily mean that &quot;supernatural&quot; demons are literally real.  I think it is plausible that these things could manifest &quot;naturally&quot; from the interacting energies of human minds; &quot;demons&quot; generated by the developing belief in them.  They might as well be real if enough people respect their existence.  In some way the only difference is semantic.  But thankfully if this is the nature of demons, they should be relatively easy to defeat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With respect to siphoning energy, the documentary about the victim in Australia (Carol?), she said that the acts are a cover for the satanic rituals, as that is the driving motivator, where the acts themselves are just catalysts.</p>

<p>I have a theory that it&#39;s a spiritual sickness manifested as sexual perversion and murderous behaviours, which has been spreading. I have no evidence other than dozens of videos that seem to correlate. </p>

<p>It makes sense that more powerful entities than most humans are using this &quot;sickness&quot; to their advantage. Entities draw all our energies, BUT it&#39;s in the interest of highly negatively oriented beings to protect the absolutely corrupted humans by pushing them to blackmail each other so that these truths are kept hidden, so to perpetuate their own subsistence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They think it will make them live longer/stop aging if they use the fear energy from innocents, and convert it to &quot;orgone&quot;.</p>

<p>It makes it more nefarious and more human, for this reason. Everyone has thought what it would be like to live forever or to have power. I can understand their fear. Many (most, of not all) of the cultists were born into this sick, twisted circus. It&#39;s not <em>their</em> fault. </p>

<p>These people are just descendents of the first people who did this, however far back they originated; I don&#39;t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. Excellent Post. The ultimate reason that this is done is &quot;The Archons&quot;. The Archons are extremely negative beings from the Lower Astral Dimension. The Satanic Global Elite worship them. All Pedophilia, Wars and Human Suffering are to benefit them. The horrific rituals are done as energetic offerings. They also open Interdimensional Portals to allow these beings to walk into our realm for a short time. Stewart Swerdlow and Preston Nichols were both at Montauk and directly involved in the bizarre research done there. They have both talked about how this and many other projects are closely connected the Reptilians/Demons/Archons which are all the same thing. This stuff is actually real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response, I believe this stuff is absolutely real. I take on the Christian view point, but not with the boxed in religious views if that makes sense. I believe these rituals are to please the demons or archons. I like the way you put it as a energy offering. It&#39;s hard to find he right words for describing spiritual events, but that&#39;s a really good way of putting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched a video of a Rabbi who said that all this stuff originated in Israel and broke off into the various groups like Rothschild and Rockefeller and Illuminati etc etc ..but that the satanic stuff was something to do with the returning of their messiah. You do it one of 2 ways, either by being really super good (which is impossible to get everyone to do) and the messiah will return or by being a complete evil dick. The idea is to be so evil it uses up all the evil in the world and then the messiah returns. <em>shrug</em></p>

<p>The way religious extremist people think.. I&#39;d be happy to blame religion for it all. But the orgone energy theory sounds more... modern? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a man named Rick Renner, he lives in Russia and has been studying Greek for 30 years. He says the &quot;Last days&quot; actually started at the &quot;Day of Pentecost&quot; Which is why people have been saying we are living in the last days for the last 2000 years. And this is what he interprets this one passage to mean after going through all the different meanings of the greek words used and the way they were compounded together. It really gives a much better insight than any english bible translation ever could. Makes me wonder what else the bible says that we don&#39;t know about.....And mind you, this passage is only one areas of the N.T. talking about the last days. Jesus also talks about them being full of &quot;wars and rumors of wars&quot; Nature and animals dying ect... And that these are only the beginning of birth pains.....</p>

<p>Renner started giving this expounded version back in the 90&#39;s way before our obsession with violent video games and movies, social media, cell phones, the spread of &quot;anything goes&quot; crude and vulgar language and comedy like we have now today. (Sam Kinison is the first absolutely vulgar comic I know of from the early 90&#39;s) the massive spread of Pornography, the LGBTQI movement. ect...</p>

<p>One of the greek words actually translates into the &quot;I AM&quot; Generation or what we now call the &quot;ME&quot; generation. A term that was coined in the 70&#39;s was actually coined by the Holy Spirit 2000 years ago.</p>

<p>2 Timothy 3 Greek expounded</p>

<p>The Holy Spirits prophecy warning speaking through the Apostle Paul,</p>

<p>&quot;You emphatically must know what I am about to tell you! In the very part of the last days - at the very end of the age and at the very last of the last days, - periods of time will come that are hurtful, harmful, dangerous, unpredictable, uncomfortable, and high-risk. People will feel encumbered by it, like you are standing in the middle of it with prison bars around you and there is no way to escape it. Mankind at large will have misdirected love from godly love to being self-consumed, self-absorbed, self-focused and in love with themselves more than anyone else.</p>

<p>As a result of this self-love, they will hoard money for themselves while spending very little to help others. These boasters are so committed to their own self-promotion and agenda that they are willing to exaggerate, overstate the facts, stretch the truth, embellish a story, and even lie if it will get them the position, advantage, or goal they desire. They will be arrogant, haughty, impudent, snooty, and insolent. They will never be satisfied and will never have enough.</p>

<p>They disdain, mock, slander, and speak ill of anyone that stands in the way of their plans. Everything will be off the table, anything goes. They will think they have a right to everything and in this environment, parents will no longer be able to persuade, control, lead or exercise authority over their children. Although they were once thankful and appreciative, people will become void of gratitude and generally unappreciative of everything in the last time. As a result, impurity will seep into society and cause it to become unholy -- impure, ill-mannered, unclean, indecent, coarse, vulgar, offensive, crude, lewd and rude. Behaving and carrying on in a way that God would never sanction.</p>

<p>Love and commitment for family will degenerate; divorce will become epidemic with irreconcilable differences being the major cause for separation; and the court system will be overwhelmed as people go overboard in their suing others and in being sued. People will turn savage, vicious, uncivilized, violent, ferocious, and inhuman. A society where law is not primarily intended to protect the rights of good people but rather is used instead to protect and defend the rights of offenders. People will be preoccupied with and known for their obsession with violence.</p>

<p>People will be lovers of pleasures and creature comforts more than lovers of God. Romantic with themselves, kissing themselves, showing deep profound affection for themselves, have a deep profound love for philosophy and wisdom while wanting to do everything they can to remove Truth (God laws) from their minds. Their doctrine will be that pleasure, comforts and happiness is the highest good; addiction to and obsession for pleasure as a way of life.&quot;</p>

<p>Renner said some of the Greek words used in this one passage were so rare that they are not used anywhere else in the New Testament.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just awful when you put into perspective of how it continues and spreads. And you are right, this goes back for centuries. The fact that it has mainly occurred in upper echelon levels of society is what has allowed it to reach such epic proportions.</p>

<p>I cannot even wrap my head around what it would be like to be raised in such a horrible way and then carry on throughout life doing the same thing because that is normal for you. </p>

<p>So now we have these twisted people in positions of power facilitating stealing children to fuel their sick ways. It&#39;s absolutely disgusting in every way on every level! </p>

<p>How do we come back from that? Is it even possible? </p>
