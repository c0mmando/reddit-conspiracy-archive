Just sensationalizing the &quot;conspiracy&#39; side of thing.      The &quot;Truther&quot; movements.    Anyone who speaks differently than the &quot;official story&quot; is immediately shunned, and their views are &#39;crazy&#39; and &#39;misinformed&#39;.</p>

<p>They haven&#39;t shown any evidence to disprove anything PizzaGate has come up with... just saying &quot;oh, its Alt-right Trump supporters&quot;.
To me, the &#39;point the finger the other way&#39; game is as close to an admission of guilt as it gets.<br/>
It might work on the rest of the sheep out there.<br/>
 But not me..
 not us ! </p>

<p>Seems like you guys have been barking up the right tree.<br/>
Keep it up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also thought it was weird that eric prince was giving interviews the week the Hillary emails were found on Weiners Computer... where he speculated that the NYPD had found incriminating evidence about a child trafficking ring... then he disappears after than never to be heard of again.  Clinton was questioned about hiring and working w Prince for mercenary purposes during her tenure as SOS, so this guy is playing both sides of the fence for sure.

<p>The world is changing in the sense that there is no where for privacy. Not on this planet anyways. Because the NSA has lost their tools. Everyone is going to find out just how much the government tracks us. Which is a lot. Everything after 1998 has been kept and that is a lot. They just started making up names for the amount that they have at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>South Park plays just as big of a role in public opinion as the msm honestly. They just persuade a different demographic. Instead of targeting to people who actually follow news stories in depth, they target the new generation who get all their news from headlines and celebrity twitter accounts. South Park satirizes every hobby, profession, and subculture and leaves us with a negative opinion of everything. I think South Park is hilarious personally, but I think too many people take Matt and Trey&#39;s worldview as factual.</p>

<p>Debunk their propaganda with facts. For example, CNN article pushes &quot;fake news creates pizzagate, pizzagate leads to innocents being threatened I.e. fake news is bad m&#39;kay&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Who is the David Chandler,  the Kevin Ryan,  the David Griffin of pizzagate?    Pizzagate does not have any credible leaders because there is only supposition,  guesswork,  and innuendo,  and no actionable criminal activity.    Its a modern day witch hunt until it has some evidence of criminal activity.    Its not criminal what has been shown so far,  only creepy,  spooky,  and cringe-worthy.   Which makes pizzagate freaks a tin foil hat fringe.   Which sets up r/conspiracy for valid attacks.</p>

<p>Criminal justice would have taken down those responsible for 9/11 if allowed,  there is enough evidence of criminal wrongdoing.    Laws were broken.   The government lied.   The cover up would fall apart in front of any impartial jury.</p>

<p>9/11 is more comparable to Hillary Clinton&#39;s crimes,  there is enough there to convict her right now.    Its a matter of political will among the corrupt elite.    There is not enough to convict anyone under pizzagate right now.    People need to learn something about how criminal investigations work,   <strong>what the difference between hunch and evidence is</strong>.</p>
