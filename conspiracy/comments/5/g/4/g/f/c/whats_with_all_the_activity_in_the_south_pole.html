    <div class="md"><p>I watched X-Files as a kid because my mom was a gigantic fan. It started when I was 9, I think. As an adult now, I&#39;m thankful my mom had great taste and let my brother and I watch almost anything; it&#39;s one of the reasons I&#39;m a giant fan of Star Trek and have a huge interest in space, ET, etc.</p>

<p>I loved it as a kid, but mostly because it was spooky and I loved aliens and UFOs, even though they scared the shit out of me. I was never the kind of kid to have nightmares after watching stuff like Nightmare on Elm Street or Halloween but I sometimes <em>still</em> have nightmares because of Fire in the Sky, lol.</p>

<p>When the new X-Files episodes came out recently, I watched the first 2 eps but decided to binge the first 9 seasons before I carried on because I couldn&#39;t remember all that much after so many years and having watched it as a kid.</p>

<p>And holy shit. As a kid, I think I only paid attention to the &quot;monster of the week&quot; part of it and totally disregarded everything conspiratorial. It was actually really weird to me <em>just</em> how much stuff that <em>actually</em> happened/is going on was embedded in that show.</p>

<p>Seriously, if for some reason someone who hasn&#39;t actually seen all of the X-Files and is reading this, <strong>do it.</strong> Go now, it&#39;s all on Netflix, and there&#39;s quite a bit of truth in there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, they conflate what has actually happened with utter nonsense or jokes, so that the audience relates UFOs and aliens with either of those thought patterns.</p>

<p>Example: In the latest season, they depict a Roswell like crash. When agents come to do body recovery and testing, the UFO has frigging <strong>rebar</strong> poking out of its broken side, metal bars more commonly used in condo concrete reinforcement. You could imagine my scoff. Can you imagine how laughable this is to aliens? &quot;How stupid are the humans that believe that garbage.&quot; </p>

<p>Some of their conflation tactics are subtle, but in aggregate, is very effective on most viewers.</p>

<p>On March 5, 1947 the &quot;El Mercurio&quot; newspaper of Santiago, Chile, had a headline article &quot;On Board the Mount Olympus on the High Seas&quot; which quoted Byrd in an interview with Lee van Atta: &quot;Adm. Byrd declared today that it was imperative for the United States to initiate immediate defense measures against hostile regions. </p>

<p>The admiral further stated that he didn&#39;t want to frighten anyone unduly but that it was a bitter reality that in case of a new war the continental United States would be attacked by flying objects which could fly from pole to pole at incredible speeds. [Earlier he had recommended defense bases AT the NORTH Pole.] Admiral Byrd repeated the above points of view, resulting from his personal knowledge gathered both at the north and south poles, before a news conference held for International News Service.&quot; When Byrd returned to the States, he was hospitalized and was not allowed to hold any more press conferences. In March 1955, he was placed in charge of Operation Deepfreeze which was part of the International Geophysical Year [1957-1958] exploration of the Antarctic. He died, some have suggested he was murdered, in 1957...</p>

<p>This would tend to indicate that Earth technology and science is, at most, only one “major breakthrough” away from parity with the extraterrestrial cultures in question, and also explain the “urgency” of the project, as viewed by the German (and undoubtedly United States, as well...) scientists and engineers involved in such research.</p>

<p>In any case, Operation Highjump, began... The task force of over 40 ships, included the flagship “Mount Olympus”, the aircraft carrier “Philippine Sea”, the seaplane tender “Pine Sea”, the submarine “Senate”, the destroyer “Bronson”, the ice breaker “Northwind”, and other tanker and supply ships. An armed contingent of 1400 sailors, and three dog sled teams were also on board.</p>

<p>The expedition was filmed by the Navy and brought to Hollywood to be made into a commercial film called “The Secret Land”.</p>

He was suscribed since his father was suscribed to receive a copy of it every Saturday (El Mercurio is the most important newspaper in Chile, it shapes the opinion of the people, and it played a key role in Pinochet&#39;s dictatorship, because it is funded by the richest men in the country, Edwards and cia. [also Edwards had links with the CIA) , and he had a room in the backyard with a big big big lot of copies sorted by year (it was fun to read because it had a section called &quot;10 years ago&quot; &quot;50 years ago&quot; &quot;100 years ago&quot; and that stuff).</p>

<p>i can only go so far as we are probably conducting us illegal research there at best. i find it hard to buy that the south pole does not exist and its a wall of ice and behind it are just alien civilizations or hitler is still alive and is living there amassing his nazi army along with his alien technology flying saucers and lasers. </p>

<p>it is a good location for it. if youre to conduct dangerous research on biological material, even if it gets compromised youre jsut surrounded by ice there.</p>
