        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, wikileaks documents seem to show that certain democrat leaders are ritualistically fucking children and are satanists. As usual, internet sleuths have cracked their code not with any overt details but rather by piecing together circumstantial evidence. While the entirety of the story hinges on a specious reasoning and a chain of increasingly weak associations stemming from one or two cases of undeniable child rape, I&#39;m willing to, for the sake of the incredibly partisan discussion, assume for a moment that it&#39;s all entirely true. Say the democratic party&#39;s top leadership is full of child fuckers - what conclusions am I supposed to draw? How am I supposed to react? This is the party that raises taxes on the rich and redistributes the wealth to the poor, that fights voter suppression, racism, sexism and so on. Even if I assume that all Republicans are saints in their personal, private lives, their policy is overall murderous and causes more pain to millions of people than this pizza fuckery causes to a handful of kids. Now I will admit that I see this all as libelous crap stirred up by propagandists, just so that&#39;s out there. But even granted that it&#39;s all true, I genuinely think the public evils and public crimes of public officials are more concerning and cause more misery than any of this stuff ever possibly could, whether you&#39;re on the left or the right, and the fact that so many people care so deeply about what is in the grand scheme of things very small scale crimes, mere rituals as compared to mass suffering, is the first sign it&#39;s mere vaporous libel cooked up by people with an agenda that is harmful on a mass basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a story that disparages the democratic party, the party that has created welfare and free healthcare for low income children on a mass basis. That&#39;s not an image, that&#39;s millions of kids who were fed and treated of disease by public policy instituted by Democrats. It&#39;s rather open and known to anyone that follows any politics at all that Republicans have attempted to ruin the well-being of children in America by trying to vote down these programs again and again.</p>

<p>The conspiracy, the secret life of these people, what does it even matter? Are we supposed to vote down the well-being of children on a mass basis because we suspect they are secretly and on a comparatively infinitesimal scale, hypocritical?</p>

Why if you think there are so many convicted people within the government that there are still tons who haven&#39;t been caught...We do this because we care, and our eyes are open to the truth. These crimes are real, they are happening and it&#39;s wide spread across the world. </p>

<p>How should you react you ask? If you have to ask that question in the first place then your heads not on straight! How do you react? Pssh. You fucking explode with rage that there is innocence out there being stolen from 1000&#39;s of children every fucking day.</p>

<p>Why do you think some many people in politics are in charge of these programs that are helping children? I see it as an easy way in. Just like with Haiti and Laura Silsby...</p>

<p>You know what it&#39;s not just children either. It&#39;s everyone they can control, and capture. It&#39;s a fucking children, adult sex trafficking and sacrificing shit show. Get with the feaking picture or get out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they certainly have done more for the well-being of children with actual public policy than republicans ever have. The words you&#39;ve put in my mouth are truly fucked, I&#39;ll grant that, but even if the leadership were doing this pizzagate stuff not voting for them still causes direct misery for children on a mass basis. Sure they should be arrested if they&#39;re doing those crimes. But the politics, the republican vs democrat comparison, it&#39;s pretty clear on who cares about spending tax dollars on kids and their well-being, if you spend any time researching the actual policy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hence why I said the Republicans aren&#39;t better. But for the sake of argument, there&#39;s legitimate reasons to be both for and against the current welfare system (which I assume is what you&#39;re talking about. If you aren&#39;t, correct me).</p>

<p>And you realize your argument amounts to &quot;let&#39;s just allow them to keep raping kids because I&#39;d rather vote for them&quot;, right? That&#39;s fucking despicable, and you should be ashamed.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like Republicans (I don&#39;t either), kick these assholes out and vote third party. And that&#39;s not even mentioning the fact that this is likely a bipartisan scandal as it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, the words you&#39;re putting in my mouth are pretty despicable, but ultimately that&#39;s your conclusion not mine. Child rapists of course ought to be stopped. That&#39;s about as controversial as apple pie. But politics of personality, of individual leaders, it&#39;s not my bag. That stuff is for idiots. As far as I can tell, pizzagate is just a big character assassination that targets a whole party that has, by and large, like them or not, done quite a bit in terms of social programs for poor children. I don&#39;t like the state of our democracy, but I vote for politics rather than politicians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re arguing from a position of its wrong without even doing an actual investigation.

<p>It&#39;s not a character assassination, it&#39;s a series of facts, and people may be jumping to conclusions looking into them, but they&#39;re going to be investigated. The media had a chance to look into the facts and do an investigation that they deem responsible, but they declined that opportunity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m arguing from a position that it&#39;s correct, just for the sake of argument. Maybe there&#39;s something to it, despite the suspicious hype and apparently very, very loosely knit together facts.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to both vote democrat and applaud any investigation and prosecution that puts an end to child rape. One important thing to know about politics is that politicians are generally pretty evil individuals who of course don&#39;t have your best interests at heart, but their policies may have to, out of necessity, because otherwise they will be out of power. Generally I think the democrats lean more towards helping the people out, whether they&#39;re all demons or not. And we can&#39;t throw the babies out with the dirty bathwater. Sorry, that&#39;s just the way it is.</p>

<p>Two problems I have with that: a lot of people disagree with their policies and it&#39;s not indisputable that their policies help the most people, or any people at all besides the very top for that matter, and that&#39;s a fucking piece of shit thing to do.</p>

<p>If you hate Republicans just vote third party. If the Democratic Party dies I assume people will align with another party anyways (the Democrats may align with the Greens).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well certainly your broken record style of argument is not at all convincing and I won&#39;t repeat myself ad nauseum. But yes, the nut of what I&#39;m saying is that disputing policies is more fruitful than the presumption that anyone who supports certain policies should be locked up because Pizza.</p>

<p>So you just have no idea what you&#39;re even talking about? Got it.</p>

<p>No one is saying anything about the whole left or the whole Democratic Party. No one is saying this is one party. This is very specific people, and no one says this doesn&#39;t extend to Republicans. In fact most of us think it does.</p>

<p>Also, I would like to point out that in a sub where we&#39;re thinking critically your reductionist logic of &quot;because pizza&quot; isn&#39;t helpful or contributing to the conversation.</p>

<p>So, if i&#39;m to understand you.. even if politicians are really torturing, raping and killing kids, that&#39;s not so bad next to...whatever the hell you&#39;re talking about? What the everloving fuck is wrong with you? Take that shit off this planet.</p>

<p>By the way, in case you hadn&#39;t noticed, about half the people investigating Pizzagate are not republicans or Trump supporters. Parrot the MSM much?</p>
