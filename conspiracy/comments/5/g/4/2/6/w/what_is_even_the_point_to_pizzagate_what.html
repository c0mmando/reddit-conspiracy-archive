       So, wikileaks documents seem to show that certain democrat leaders are ritualistically fucking children and are satanists. As usual, internet sleuths have cracked their code not with any overt details but rather by piecing together circumstantial evidence. While the entirety of the story hinges on a specious reasoning and a chain of increasingly weak associations stemming from one or two cases of undeniable child rape, I'm willing to, for the sake of the incredibly partisan discussion, assume for a moment that it's all entirely true. Say the democratic party's top leadership is full of child fuckers - what conclusions am I supposed to draw? How am I supposed to react? This is the party that raises taxes on the rich and redistributes the wealth to the poor, that fights voter suppression, racism, sexism and so on. Even if I assume that all Republicans are saints in their personal, private lives, their policy is overall murderous and causes more pain to millions of people than this pizza fuckery causes to a handful of kids. Now I will admit that I see this all as libelous crap stirred up by propagandists, just so that's out there. But even granted that it's all true, I genuinely think the public evils and public crimes of public officials are more concerning and cause more misery than any of this stuff ever possibly could, whether you're on the left or the right, and the fact that so many people care so deeply about what is in the grand scheme of things very small scale crimes, mere rituals as compared to mass suffering, is the first sign it's mere vaporous libel cooked up by people with an agenda that is harmful on a mass basis.

       This is a story that disparages the democratic party, the party that has created welfare and free healthcare for low income children on a mass basis. That's not an image, that's millions of kids who were fed and treated of disease by public policy instituted by Democrats. It's rather open and known to anyone that follows any politics at all that Republicans have attempted to ruin the well-being of children in America by trying to vote down these programs again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy, the secret life of these people, what does it even matter? Are we supposed to vote down the well-being of children on a mass basis because we suspect they are secretly and on a comparatively infinitesimal scale, hypocritical?

       Dude you need to Google Republican and Democrat pedophiles...This will garnish a HUGE list of convicted pedophiles on both sides of the parties. Why if you think there are so many convicted people within the government that there are still tons who haven't been caught...We do this because we care, and our eyes are open to the truth. These crimes are real, they are happening and it's wide spread across the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       How should you react you ask? If you have to ask that question in the first place then your heads not on straight! How do you react? Pssh. You fucking explode with rage that there is innocence out there being stolen from 1000's of children every fucking day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think some many people in politics are in charge of these programs that are helping children? I see it as an easy way in. Just like with Haiti and Laura Silsby...
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what it's not just children either. It's everyone they can control, and capture. It's a fucking children, adult sex trafficking and sacrificing shit show. Get with the feaking picture or get out.

       So what you're saying is that asserting that pedophilia should be allowed is okay but calling someone a piece of shit for doing so is not okay? That seems backwards.

       Well they certainly have done more for the well-being of children with actual public policy than republicans ever have. The words you've put in my mouth are truly fucked, I'll grant that, but even if the leadership were doing this pizzagate stuff not voting for them still causes direct misery for children on a mass basis. Sure they should be arrested if they're doing those crimes. But the politics, the republican vs democrat comparison, it's pretty clear on who cares about spending tax dollars on kids and their well-being, if you spend any time researching the actual policy.

       If you think the left has anyone's interest in mind besides themselves I have a bridge to sell you. There's a reason Soros, Frank Giustra, and the Rothschilds all fund the party, and it's not because they give a shit about the average American. And you have to realize these are the people pulling all of the strings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their policy is terrible for the average American, and that's by design. It's really not any better (but admittedly not worse) than Republicans.

       The same can be said of special interests for the Republicans. We do not have a very strong democracy, but why throw the baby out with the bathwater? What is the underhanded, secret agenda behind food and medicine for children?

       Hence why I said the Republicans aren't better. But for the sake of argument, there's legitimate reasons to be both for and against the current welfare system (which I assume is what you're talking about. If you aren't, correct me).
      </p>
      <p>
       And you realize your argument amounts to "let's just allow them to keep raping kids because I'd rather vote for them", right? That's fucking despicable, and you should be ashamed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't like Republicans (I don't either), kick these assholes out and vote third party. And that's not even mentioning the fact that this is likely a bipartisan scandal as it is.

       Again, the words you're putting in my mouth are pretty despicable, but ultimately that's your conclusion not mine. Child rapists of course ought to be stopped. That's about as controversial as apple pie. But politics of personality, of individual leaders, it's not my bag. That stuff is for idiots. As far as I can tell, pizzagate is just a big character assassination that targets a whole party that has, by and large, like them or not, done quite a bit in terms of social programs for poor children. I don't like the state of our democracy, but I vote for politics rather than politicians.

       So you're arguing from a position of its wrong without even doing an actual investigation. Because "the point" as you phrased it earlier is to lock these assholes up. You're just approaching it from a standpoint of not even looking at the facts and dismissing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a character assassination, it's a series of facts, and people may be jumping to conclusions looking into them, but they're going to be investigated. The media had a chance to look into the facts and do an investigation that they deem responsible, but they declined that opportunity.

       I'm arguing from a position that it's correct, just for the sake of argument. Maybe there's something to it, despite the suspicious hype and apparently very, very loosely knit together facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to both vote democrat and applaud any investigation and prosecution that puts an end to child rape. One important thing to know about politics is that politicians are generally pretty evil individuals who of course don't have your best interests at heart, but their policies may have to, out of necessity, because otherwise they will be out of power. Generally I think the democrats lean more towards helping the people out, whether they're all demons or not. And we can't throw the babies out with the dirty bathwater. Sorry, that's just the way it is.

       So again, what are you trying to say? Because all I get out of it is let's not lock their asses up because you like their policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two problems I have with that: a lot of people disagree with their policies and it's not indisputable that their policies help the most people, or any people at all besides the very top for that matter, and that's a fucking piece of shit thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you hate Republicans just vote third party. If the Democratic Party dies I assume people will align with another party anyways (the Democrats may align with the Greens).

       Well certainly your broken record style of argument is not at all convincing and I won't repeat myself ad nauseum. But yes, the nut of what I'm saying is that disputing policies is more fruitful than the presumption that anyone who supports certain policies should be locked up because Pizza.

       No one is saying anything about the whole left or the whole Democratic Party. No one is saying this is one party. This is very specific people, and no one says this doesn't extend to Republicans. In fact most of us think it does.

       That's not how I interpreted his post but, even if he had, he has as much right in this sub to express his opinion as anyone else as long as he does so without violating our rules.

       Eh, whatever.  I thought it was a fair question given his position on pedophilia that's blatantly obvious from the post.  But it's your sub.

       He already humiliated himself by supporting allowing people to rape children. He said even if it's true we shouldn't do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually he was pretty shifty with his argument. He said he was assuming that it was true and then immediately did away with that and said it was character assassination. He's a moron.

       I strongly encourage you to read the short story "The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas".  Should a utopian society be powered by the suffering of even a single innocent?
