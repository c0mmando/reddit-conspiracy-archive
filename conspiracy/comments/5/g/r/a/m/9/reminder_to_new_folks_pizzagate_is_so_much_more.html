       Pizzagate is about investigating and stopping human trafficking and pedophilia linked to the human trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate involves multiple other investigations going on at once..
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is like the hub where these other investigations need to merge into one picture.

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Clinton foundation (big priority)

       <li>
        <p>
         Julian Assange (whether he is alive or not his email leaks were crucial)
        </p>

       <li>
        <p>
         Linking past investigations into this..
         <strong>
          Franklin Files, WACO disaster, Other Pedo rings around world
         </strong>
         They are all connected the more we dig.

         Clinton foundation leads to human trafficking as well as arms dealing, and possible SAP (special access programs.. above top secret clearance) programs being sold.

       Can we not clump together Julian Assange and the Clinton Foundation with each other or with pizzagate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Julian is the face of an organization that has done more than release the Podesta emails which don't prove a damn thing about pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton Foundation is
       <strong>
        real fucking evidence of corruption
       </strong>
       that should put quite a few people away for quite some time. It's right there in front of your face. There's no instagram to go to, no 4chan to use as a source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is loosely based conjecture and nothing more.

       Hastert,  Savile,  Sandusky,  the Catholic Church abuses are at the center of the pedophilia documentation.   Pizzagate so far,  represents guesswork and is increasingly a witch hunt populated by cognitively challenged individuals that the Pizzagate name will come to represent.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words,  Pizzagate was a trap,  and was accorded disproportionate attention.    Sure,  its a lead,  the Podesta e mails need to be thoroughly investigated,  but not through sensationalism and spectacle.  Investigators that do not know how to handle material in a way that leads to real evidence are exposed.    Here are some investigations that lead to real convictions,  and no,  they are not a subset of an embarrassing phase of weak minded amateurs:

       Yes,  Hastert,  Savile,  Sandusky,  plenty of the elite are involved,  as are plenty of mid and lower level types.    Pizzagate does not deserve to be at the center of this investigation.   In the big picture,  its a sideline.   Hastert by himself,  with  his protectors,  is a bigger catch (that was not followed up on).

       Until the police start doing their job and stop protecting these corrupt traitors,  there is no way to tie together the real pedophile criminals into a larger conspiracy.    The Podesta e mails may end up having their place in this larger conspiracy,  but they won't be at the center.    Comet Pizza won't be.    Hastert and a broader House of Representatives cover up would have been the better center of this investigation for 2016.   Instead,  r/conspiracy and others fell for a trap,  and the whole criminal matter has been set back,  not advanced.   There will be more resistance to outing the pedophilia epidemic in Washington DC as a result,  and it will now likely become embedded in the new Trump administration.

        “The level of pedophilia is just unprecedented right now,” Campbell said. “We have so many cases constantly of individuals in all walks of life, from the very wealthy … to all other levels engaged in child pornography, child exploitation … it just seems to be almost an at epidemic level.”
