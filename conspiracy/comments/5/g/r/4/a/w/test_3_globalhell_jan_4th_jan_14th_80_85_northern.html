       Might be on the southern side of the ishinomaki point ;  8.0 - 8.5 eq;   Jan 4th - 14th 2017 Globalhell - Test 3 (long range) estimation via reappearing coronal hole (expectancy).
      </p>
      <p>
       I Estimate solar winds to hit 650's to low 750ish next week producing a small flurry of eq / seismic activity; Maybe 6.0 range?
Wouldn't bet on it...
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet don't expect that energy to be released until the next passing of old 37 (nor re-named 42)... Maybe it will be 49'r in January...

      <p>
       Neways: (next passing / full rotation I expect a sharper magnetic complexity. Producing solarwind speeds upto 850 -950). Food for thought. Tepco You are Warned;
      </p>
      <p>
       Neways if your curious I built this website the last couple days:
Investbitcoin.com (One other thing I am predicting is a huge price uptick next year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Welp; If I get this third test I hope to be taken more seriously by the

       community.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did take it upon myself to message everyone at berkley; 
Sort of a here's what I got...
      </p>
      <p>
       no responses yet; But I hope that changes in time :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Note
       <strong>
        (there will likely be an associated tsunami in the moderate scale corresponding with this event)
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a very large quake I am assessing;
      </p>
      <p>
       kk - stay safe :)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want feel free to check out this website I built in the mean time: Investbitcoin.webs.com
Idk... ? just bored...
      </p>
      <p>
       (trying to nail something huge and the pacing seems right). So I hope this is a major contribution to the science. 
take care all - 
:)
      </p>
      <p>
       notes: Firstly if this hits anywhere after dec 26th (I'd like partial credit). Its really far out (so the test / factors are subject to change).  Just partial. It won't come before then I assure you-

       for having me on his podcast. Sort of difficult between my circumstances; Wish more users turned out. (We gotta work on the pr lol)... ok so TY sir :)
      </p>
      <p>
       You can checkout his show here on youtube. It would be cool if you guys supported him as well. He is a cool guy putting in a lot of effort; I think that should be noted. :)

       His show is here; The assessment was made live on the show. Hope that helps :)

       Glad that I updated from dec - January. Should put the 8.5 in japan directly on target near the 4th - 5th.

       Japan you are officially warned -

       Note: Future satellite concept. Cube with peripheral vision to sun to focus on solar light waves, and incoming impacts. Measuring solar material (atomic matter within winds); resonating energy &amp; wave strength as well as time to impact. This is a geocentric sun facing satellite, that would have to escape earths rotation to stay geocentrically locked to the solar disk.
      </p>
      <p>
       This satellite could likely be a very useful tool in determining the resonance in energy coming from future sunspots, and coronal mass ejection events. Calculating the very data in real time, giving additional resources to operators studying both solar plasma related sciences, as well as solar influenced earthquakes. Sorry I am just an idea guy - not a graphic designer. (Nor an engineer), As I have no idea what sensors or technical achievements this would take to launch as a working model. (Looking at you nasa'r).

       HERE COMES THE SOLAR WIND (AGAIN): 2016 might get one more blast of auroras before the year is over.  Another stream of solar wind is heading for Earth, and it could arrive before New Year's Eve. The wind is flowing from a coronal hole (CH) in the sun's atmosphere, shown here in an image from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory:
      </p>
      <p>
       NOAA forecasters estimate a 40% chance of polar geomagnetic storms on Dec. 30th when a co-rotating interaction region (CIR) is expected to hit Earth's magnetic field. CIRs are transition zones between slow- and fast-moving solar wind streams. Solar wind plasma piles up in these regions, producing density gradients and shock waves that do a good job of sparking auroras.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the CIR arrives, a stream of fast-moving (600 km/s) solar wind will follow. The combined effect could produce G1-class geomagnetic storms (55% chance, says NOAA) and bright Arctic auroras on Dec. 31st. Happy New Year! Free: Aurora Alerts.

       It looks like there was a 3.3 and a 3.4 in California and in the timeframe he predicted. Someone with a better understanding should analyze it though.

       seismologists refute the scientific principals, as they are known professionals in seismology. 
Their main perspectives are linear to their specific field. 
From IRIS, to Usgs there is a constant reluctance to touch base on the similarities, in extreme seismic events, and notable solar events.
      </p>
      <p>
       The general representation is consistent, however the derivatives and values, are inconclusive. 
My general impression is that the relationship isn't considered as a factual argument for debate, and the close minded rarely are up to discuss a "settled issue". 
Notably they *geologists, and seismic professionals, rarely have much experience in helio-observation. Let alone cosmology, and theoretical physics. 
There are several researchers making strides into this, and factually I have been one for nearly half a decade; In a rare way, I constantly wonder if another user didn't use the bulk of my conclusions to further his own research, however that user specifically is tracking (what I feel) is the wrong cause / effect.
(in relationship to solar / seismic research).
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been long known that the seismic events on earth, have been very consistent with solar events (such as cme impacts). 
Yet the bottom line is, that the factual correlation is still misunderstood. Most observers are weighing in on various elements at play. Ace monitors atomic materials within solar streams as an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose that the real problem is, that in this day and age, the bulk of humanity is compartmentalized in the extent that sharing a basic and commonality in your thoughts, and understanding isn't respected; (It is sad to say I have gotten more replies here than from the 30+ researchers, I'd attempted to contact. (notably, that was also nasa, and noaa). As well as half of the schumann resonances / cited experts from Berkeley university.
      </p>
      <p>
       So conclusion; There would be progress, if we as a species attributed more financial resources, into the common understandings of science. I fear that the slightest wrong turn, turns to a dead end. (even though we know we are headed the right direction, the driver turns around and heads home).
That would be fine only in this extent the fuel is gone, and future trips are now deemed unlikely due to their in-conclusions...
"Its a sad day and age, when everyone only stops to listen, when they are waiting for their turn to speak".
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose those that the main focal point should be the full collaboration in and between NOAA and USGS. If they both worked harder on tracking the past consistencies in the relationships between seismic/solar events; (as I urge them to do wholeheartedly); 
Then there would be a more positive value in exploring this relationship. Were a relatively young species, and eventually some day this will probably be bigger news. I get angered that people are so small minded, and feel often recluse and alone; 
So the same problems with the world, you see are the same problems with this very situation.. 
No ones listening, and those that speak, are only spoken down too.

       Amazing I can't thank you enough for taking the time to outline that, and thank you for pursuing your beliefs in spite of opposition. I feel that people willing to go that route are the reason we have been able to advance as far as we have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that response also outline why you chose to post in conspiracy? The compartmentalization of information and the fact that exploring commonalities in thought is not respected?

       agreed; I originally had a DEC 24th expectancy on japan, however updated full assessment to a January 4th expectancy date in spite of the prolonged / seismic responses. 
This is a response to test 2 via the californian quake results, and delayed / primary impact. January should be an interesting date pattern for the record! I am looking forward to the 15th indeed!

       Essentially this is again region 42 exiting the central disk.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see in the image above (7 day solar wind data). That as the sunspot region exited that the initial EQ energy was distributed nearly a week ago via sunspot activity. 
If you read the resulting text of test 1. (Which was my first exit phase test), then you would see that as these spots interact with earth, a large amount of energy seems to stay dormant within our earths core. (likely via magnetic discharge).
      </p>
      <p>
       As the region moves off the limb I feel that the energy begins to make its way back to the surface. As if the magnetosphere can finally re-stabilize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theoretically / metaphorically.
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth is like a spinning top. Quite level and spinning smoothly, until the sun blows a burst of air at it. (solar winds are filled with electrons positrons, ionic material, neutrinos etc). 
So now (imagine) a human moved his mouth towards the top...
      </p>
      <p>
       He Blows the device just enough to set it off balance. 
(This is the first initial EQ series. As seen last week. (at the peak rise as also shown in the above chart. Well That is the entering phase of the cosmic irradiate winds. Which impact us.
      </p>
      <p>
       As time progresses eventually the Top (spinning top), begins to relevel. This is the exiting phase of said series. When the winds are no longer geo centrically effective. Thus the earth can "rebalance" itself ejecting all the componets in which it initially encountered in the first place. I'd imagine post sequence (which this was) that EQ lights were present in this event. (as it is ejected material). While last weeks flurry did not exhibit this feature. (As they are incoming material).
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that all made sense. More on it via test 1.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5dal9j/75_90_within_48_hours_likely_soon_11161118/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5dal9j/75_90_within_48_hours_likely_soon_11161118/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note I would have had the region right last night, but would have been far off on the magnitude -  as I have mainly been focused on the entrance phases - so exit phases are somewhat new to my prediction models.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I have hoped to create is a prediction model for the existing solar belt. (predicting the sunspots themselves). Which would give an even larger window of advanced seismic warning. However those dreams are sidelined in my opinion. 
However watching the solar winds you can easily tell on the weekly that there was a period last week we were hit. (large eq in NZ / Cali). Then as the winds finally re-stabilized. The exiting activity took place. (IMO ejecting the initial shock / energy)-
      </p>
      <p>
       Wish I could articulate it more professionally. I'm just a guy, that has been watching this activity for years, and is finally coming to conclusions. I already knew about the EQ. I knew it was coming last night. I just didn't want to ruin the test 3, by taking my own work off  track, Or missing it enough that made users question its practicality. I am glad you asked however, for multiple reasons. 
So ty for considering me, and this research.

       Note the initial seismic thrusting on the plates are the majority of the wave leaving. The aftershocks are waves that correspond to that sequence phase. Its literally waves of "seismic" energy, In my theories respects (the seismic energy = solar energy deposits). 
Thus the majority of seismology is wrong, (In respects to the reason why some earthquakes take place), Being how consistent the data is on the events sequencing to solar events.
      </p>
      <p>
       This does not explain all earthquakes however. (Like fracking) can cause an earthquake. Or large buildups like the dam in china, can stress a plate. (As well as volcanic tubes decaying) or even eruptions themselves as examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I feel the majority of EQ activity is indeed caused by trumpet theory. So by comparison, this is just another event that mimics that model.  Of course it's just a "coincidence" in seismologists eyes. ;)

       Hope your doing ok btw :) Glad to see that things calmed down there for the most part. If japan has this 8.0 range, you might get a 6.0 but its just going to be an aftershock from them, with mild 4.0's as they decline to non noticeable levels.

       How are you fairing this week. Everything ok with friends and family I hope! The phillipines had a massive event, and I truly think that is small in comparison to what is to come in japan; 
So I've been tracking quakes all day / night on low battery. Hoping to test this theory to its maximum. Something tells me were right on the cusp to another gold star on my record though ;)

       I imagine winds may pick up again soon. So i am really really hoping for a flat line tonight. (My initial thoughts were the 4-10th. So I was really really hoping to see it today. (If not prior to the 14th).
      </p>
      <p>
       But today would be excellent so I know my last calculation checked out. I am basically trying to get as close as I can to nailing the quakes, exact date and time, and I can't dial it down without the variables all being considered. 
Another interesting aspect of all this was the winds staying primed so long? I mean that was literally unheard of :( 
Makes it impossible to really address with the situation being so conflicting to the last 5 years research. That was literally the longest hot run (high winds) that I've personally witnessed from a coronal hole. So to me, It's all cause and effect, and seeing that cause, makes the scientist in me like: Show me the effect! lol
      </p>
      <p>
       Glad to see and hear your watching. Hopefully we get a little show soon. I can say via the japan live seismic monitor they have the inner heart beat chime on, and It's palpitating; So in that regard they are in an alert mode.

       Pretty sure 300 should hit within 48 hours. I was really hoping for today though. (Just a personal thing on the math). Technically I shouldn't be "hoping" for a devastating earthquake. But when your me, and have a theory lol :)

       Glad you guys have been settling down there. You've had your run. Pretty sure, greece will be hit in a good 40 days, Followed shortly after (65-70 days) in california. Nothing too high, but high enough. Greece will likely be test 4 ;)

       What are you saying here?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm reading correctly, you're saying that a 4.5 was caused by solar winds?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude, I've been waiting for like a month now to see if this was legit. And thus far, it's not. You're predicting a 4.5-5 on the ring of fire....that's like predicting a rainstorm in the Philippines during typhoon season.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm giving you until 11:59PM to see if you're original prediction of 8.0+ is going to come true. If it does, I'll apologize for being a dick and probably ask for more explanation of such a breakthrough.
      </p>

       Oh I know. And the theory is set up to be pretty vague in case of error and yet still is wrong.

      <p>
       It's also set up in the most seismically active area on the planet. I predict there will be an earthquake of a minimum 2.0 today on the ring of fire. I'm going to be right. Why? Because there are earthquakes everyday on the ring of fire

       He's owned up to being wrong though. You can always tweak a theory and hopefully get better results, but there is so many changes going on from the time of his initial post to now.

       seismologists refute the scientific principals, as they are known professionals in seismology. 
Their main perspectives are linear to their specific field. 
From IRIS, to Usgs there is a constant reluctance to touch base on the similarities, in extreme seismic events, and notable solar events.
      </p>
      <p>
       The general representation is consistent, however the derivatives and values, are inconclusive. 
My general impression is that the relationship isn't considered as a factual argument for debate, and the close minded rarely are up to discuss a "settled issue". 
Notably they *geologists, and seismic professionals, rarely have much experience in helio-observation. Let alone cosmology, and theoretical physics. 
There are several researchers making strides into this, and factually I have been one for nearly half a decade; In a rare way, I constantly wonder if another user didn't use the bulk of my conclusions to further his own research, however that user specifically is tracking (what I feel) is the wrong cause / effect.
(in relationship to solar / seismic research).
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been long known that the seismic events on earth, have been very consistent with solar events (such as cme impacts). 
Yet the bottom line is, that the factual correlation is still misunderstood. Most observers are weighing in on various elements at play. Ace monitors atomic materials within solar streams as an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose that the real problem is, that in this day and age, the bulk of humanity is compartmentalized in the extent that sharing a basic and commonality in your thoughts, and understanding isn't respected; (It is sad to say I have gotten more replies here than from the 30+ researchers, I'd attempted to contact. (notably, that was also nasa, and noaa). As well as half of the schumann resonances / cited experts from Berkeley university.
      </p>
      <p>
       So conclusion; There would be progress, if we as a species attributed more financial resources, into the common understandings of science. I fear that the slightest wrong turn, turns to a dead end. (even though we know we are headed the right direction, the driver turns around and heads home).
That would be fine only in this extent the fuel is gone, and future trips are now deemed unlikely due to their in-conclusions...
"Its a sad day and age, when everyone only stops to listen, when they are waiting for their turn to speak".
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose those that the main focal point should be the full collaboration in and between NOAA and USGS. If they both worked harder on tracking the past consistencies in the relationships between seismic/solar events; (as I urge them to do wholeheartedly); 
Then there would be a more positive value in exploring this relationship. Were a relatively young species, and eventually some day this will probably be bigger news. I get angered that people are so small minded, and feel often recluse and alone; 
So the same problems with the world, you see are the same problems with this very situation.. 
No ones listening, and those that speak, are only spoken down too.

I do it because as crazy as it sounds, 1000+ people are in danger in japan without having read this post. that is all...
