They predict we will have a one world currency (mark of the beast) by 2018. There&#39;s 6 seals in the Bible and the 3rd one is the economic crash. The 2nd seal is WW3 which kills 1/3 of mankind, 2 billion people.  So, going off this prediction we will have WW3 next year ðŸ˜³</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I think he&#39;s a agent too. It really pissed me off 3 days ago he told his audience &quot;Julian Assange is fine and safe in the embassy working on the Germany leaks so y&#39;all focus on the GERMANY NSA leaks.&quot; 
WTF so let me get this right... Julian has been in the Embassy for 50 days now and doesn&#39;t peak once out the window to say he&#39;s ok bc he&#39;s too busy working. Gtfo lol
He spreads ALOT of truth but the min things get out of hand he can speak and help change his viewers gears bc he has their trust.

    <div class="md"><p>Right, you&#39;re trying to muddy the water. Take it straight to aliens and reptiles and angels (which you know are the topics most likely to get us ignored), based on no evidence, when we already have plenty of evidence that the Saudis own sex slaves.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol bull fkin shit!! I post every damn day on my twitter and fb about pizzagate. I was one of the first people to crack the code before the election. So don&#39;t sit here and tell me shit when you don&#39;t know me. 
I&#39;m trying to connect dots to these fkin evil ass ppl and pizzagate. 
I already know the Saudis have sex slaves. Let me give you some leads to help your Saudi investigation..
Do you research in Bahrain bc that&#39;s where the Qataris and Saudis go to &quot;party&quot; and &quot;play&quot; since they aren&#39;t allowed in their country bc of their strict religion. 
In Bahrain you will find NUMBEROUS hotels FILLED with nothing but child and human sex slaves. Each floor has a different race and the higher you go up in floors the more expensive and better the race. 
Also, Qatars population is 60% slaves. People from 3rd world countries contact recruiters to help them find jobs in Qatar. They fly them there just to find out their contract is filled with lies. They have their passports taken away from them until they are able to pay the recruiter fee. The fee is outrageous and their pay is couple dollars a day. So, basically they are stuck there and not able to leave... Each household comes with a couple maids, chefs and drivers. 
SLAVE LABOR
So, yes... Saudis are huge in sex slaves and they love little boys too bc they think if they have sex with little boys they aren&#39;t gay. 
Saudis always been into slavery either it&#39;s for labor or sex. </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to connect the dots with fallen angels who CUT UP THE CHILDREN WHILE THEY ARE STILL ALIVE AND EAT THEIR BRAINS!!! I&#39;m trying to connect the dots to people in the US govt who kidnap our kids and use them in experiments in underground bunkers. These people are in the bloodline of Lucifer  and they LOVE to hurt the children bc children are closet to God! So just imagine what kind of sick evil shit they do to these kids!! It&#39;s more then pedo rape, it&#39;s also sacrificing and experimentation. </p>

<p>So before you go troll everyone that YOU THINK isn&#39;t posting about pizzagate.. take the time to read their post first. Bc u jumping on my comments like that is stupid.  </p>
