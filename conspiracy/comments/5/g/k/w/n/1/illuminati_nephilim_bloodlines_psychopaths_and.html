       The bug eyes are the Tell of MOST psychopaths/sociopaths and the tell of how our species has been bred by the fallen ones
      </p>
      <p>
       The illuminati are serious about bloodlines because they desire to breed for sociopathic and psychopathic traits which are perfect for demonic / reptilian energy to enter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also sociopaths and psychopaths are excellent earners and holders of power. A non psychopath bloodline member told me how a human with no emotion has incredible drive and energy since without realizing it, emotions are exhausting to the rest of us. This is why he explained, many are perfectly groomed and their place of habit spotless and in perfect order.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many variations of the eye patterns and also some very very subtle ones. The more prominent the eye the more cold blooded of an animal it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       This eye variation is fully in the human genome so it can come out regardless of bloodline connection. Truly terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must remember , They have zero empathy. No remorse for any action.

       Well not sure about your luminarty stuff but yeah sociopaths have very high drive, very motivated, live in constant hypomania, it's actually a quite pleasureable existence which is why it's easy for them to rise to the top while the rest of us deal with constant shit.

       Read Michael Tsarion's Atlantis. He explains everything. Basically almost every religion on earth believes angels bred with women and created the nephilim, but those were actually aliens who have tried to keep their bloodline pure and control the earth. The snake represented the brotherhood of the snake and were a group trying to enlighten mankind. Sumerian myths were true, and humans were bred to be slaves to mine resources for aliens

       Would probably be good to clarify the way you are using the terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       For many, "sociopath" refers to someone with Antisocial Personality Disorder (AsPD) in the same way that "narcissist" refers to someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), when speaking of psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the Criteria A for AsPD, you will notice that someone only has to have 3 of the traits in order to qualify, and some of the listed traits include:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors (this could be something like a history of getting caught with weed)
       </li>
       <li>
        irritability and aggressiveness
       </li>
       <li>
        consistent irresponsibility
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Frankly, many people who could qualify for an AsPD diagnosis are just people who were severely abused as children and have PTSD among other issues, and there is a lot of overlap in symptoms with Borderline PD which is also caused by abuse. There are even studies showing that the brains of children who are just
       <em>
        emotionally
       </em>
       abused do not fully develop compared to non-abused children, which differences of multiple millimeters in areas of the brain responsible for such things as emotional regulation. So just imagine the impact on brain development in a child that is full-on traumatized by physical/sexual abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just imagine for a moment, what many imagine when they think about "psychopaths" then: the calculated, collected, non-emotional, predatory, cold-eyed types. Well "sociopaths" are anything but, again they have major rage issues, can't hold down jobs, are in and out of jail, etc. Damaged, dysfunctional people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the concept of psychopathy, which as far as I know isn't even a sanctioned diagnosis. Well at least so far there
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       been studies that show in some humans, the parts of the brain responsible for moral reasoning and empathy are essentially broke af. Now
       <em>
        these
       </em>
       are going to be the types that match the above description of a psychopath. No startle response, very calculating, have the intense "predatory stare" when not mimicking neurotypicals, as noted by the OP, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for anyone who is curious, there are definitely plenty of neurological studies and theories to browse. Even if you remove the aspects of things like, reptilians and whatnot, 'breeding for psychopaths' has a lot of merit all on its own, according to some studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might also be interested in researching the concepts of "abuser introjects" in Dissociative Identity Disorder.

       Yes, I'm pointing out that other people came up with the terminology that you are using, and also the criteria/definitions. You are far from the first person to try to theorize about certain traits that people have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also not sure if you noticed the part where some studies show that there is merit to the notion of breeding for psychopaths. Or in other words your own theory is partially derived from the material you are trash talking lol.

       So weird you mention this... I'm a high functioning sociopath... never want to lie though which is weird... I'm emotionless with no empathy, but never want to harm any one. I'm also very cold blooded... most comfortable at like 88 degrees F. People often comment on my eyes... but I don't have that weird iris thing. I took a DNA test... and it went contrary to what my parents told me about our heritage and was heavily Ashkenazi Jew... with 4% Neanderthal. I didn't even know a DNA test could say you were a Jew until then.

       People like you were historically good soldiers or even executioners. Its not simply sociopaths and psychopaths at the top, it just makes it easier for them. The top are full blown narcissists with a control freak/unbridled ambition outlook. But if they can convince someone like you to do the dirty work, you get paid and they get made.

       I'm a bit of a narcissist too but I think it all balances out... I touch upon all of the dark triad, but never fully hit the edges of any point. I lead a very zen life despite all the other issues. I think I fucked up and resisted my "Illuminati" initiation check...

       Yes you heal well. You have no emotion , lots of energy left.
Also your body uses its sexual energy to heal a night. Sociopaths and psychopaths bodies work "differently" in that regard. It's easier for you to do but more powerful for us when done correctly.

       Being a sociopath isn't automatically a bad thing. Some  realize what we would be like with a lot of power over others and reject any need or wish  for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sociopaths have  lot of very good and competitive uses for society but should never have power over others because they  feel no need to guide their subjects  away from harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sociopaths actually enjoy doing harm that they can get away with and profit from.

       Interesting discussion. I must add a point. I believe there is a difference between a sociopath and psychopath.
      </p>
      <p>
       The latter is completely unable to empathise or feel remorse and the condition is largely due to genetics. You can only be born a psychopath.
      </p>
      <p>
       The former though is conditioned by the environment so to allow someone to take on psychopathic traits, usually through continued abuse or hardship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such people end up on a psychopathic scale BUT can still feel remorse/empathy. It may be to a diminished degree when compared to a normal person but it's there. It's especially apparent for the sociopath's 'in-group' who they may feel unusually loyal too, more so than to anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what a psychopath completely lacks. Whilst the ability to pair-bond is still available to a sociopath. As a result, the psychopath is more calm and logical whereas the sociopath is more neurotic and unpredictable.
