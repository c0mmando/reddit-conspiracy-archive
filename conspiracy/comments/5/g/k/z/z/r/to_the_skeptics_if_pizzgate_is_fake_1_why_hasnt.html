        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To the skeptics: If #pizzgate is &quot;fake&quot;... </p>

<p>A) Why hasn&#39;t Hillary / Podesta ever challenged the authenticity of Podesta&#39;s Wikileaked emails? </p>

<p>B) Why did Twitter just just down 100s of pedophile accounts (resulting from the fake #pizzagate &quot;witchhunt&quot;) ??  </p>

<p>BONUS: (And why was Jack Dorsey&#39;s account shut down?)</p>

<p>My working definition:</p>

<p><strong>#pedosgate</strong> (or #pizzagate, as it is more commonly known) is a criminal conspiracy theory fueled by wikileaks&#39; (1) release of John Podesta&#39;s emails (2).  (Jon Podesta is Hillary Clinton&#39;s &quot;right hand man&quot; and Campaign Manager.(3))  The conspiracy theory places Podesta (and his brother Tony(4)) in a ring of criminal activity involving the abducting(5) and trafficking(6) of children for sex(7), bloodletting(8) and serial murder(9) - Madeleine McCann(10) among the theorized victims.  James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong(11) (and friend to Podesta&#39;s(12)), is also theorized to be one of the central power brokers(13). (James Alefantis has publicly refuted to be untruths from fame news. (14)).  The online investigation lead to the exposure of 100’s of twitter accounts that were trafficking photography documenting the entire supply chain - from the abductions(15), to the coffins (16).  It is unknown is Twitter was aware of the account prior to the disclosure form online investigators, or if these accounts had been able to slip through Twitter - hence #twittergate.  In the rush to purge Twitter of the associated accounts, the personal Twitter account of Jack Dorsey (founder of Square and Twitter, and who also sits on he board of Disney) was accidentally banned - but quickly re-activated.

    <div class="md"><p>They shut down Pizzagate because it was a witch hunt. Even if it&#39;s right, why would reddit (a private company) want to associate with you people. They&#39;re already suffering from an image problem because of this election. Pizzagate made them look bad so they got rid of it. If they hadn&#39;t they&#39;d probably be blamed for today&#39;s shooter just like with boston marathon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I was making the point that, even if pizzagate is right. Does reddit really want to be associated with a guy walking into a family restaurant with an assault rifle. My point was even if pizzagate is true, the means of getting there and the people leading the charge are not the type of community reddit claims to want to foster.</p>

<p>But yeah I was exaggerating, if pizzagate was proven true when r/pizzagate was a thing. I&#39;m pretty sure reddit, would&#39;ve pivoted into becoming that alt-right voice box it was threatening to be. Money rules everything and I&#39;m sure being the media for the alt-right is profitable for all those companies that do it and I can imagine that reddit would have loved to dominate that space, which they surely would if they were credited with blowing open such a massive scandal</p>

<p>These crazies won&#39;t acknowledge that because they&#39;re so far down this rabbit hole. They have no other option but to believe it. That&#39;s why they&#39;re calling the shooter fake. They can&#39;t stomach the reality that their witch hunt might actually get people killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Common misconception among bigots. About a hundred years ago, a Polish priest invented a few phrases that supported subjugation of non-Jews and promoted pedophilia claiming them to be part of the Talmud. The phrases were mostly inventions and intentional mistranslations with one or two taken completely out of context. For example, there is a passage in the Talmud that states &quot;It is forbidden to lie to a non-Jew, but if a non-Jew is illegally harassing a landowner and demanding money, then <strong>a Jew may lie and use subterfuge to a non-Jew.</strong>&quot; Rense.com and other untrustworthy bigoted sites repeat the old Polish quote by ignoring the sentence and only stating the part in bold.</p>

<p>So you may want to check your sources before you start claiming what other people say.</p>

<p>Breitbart died 13 months later and his death wasn&#39;t particularly mysterious.</p>

<p>Here are some of Breitbart&#39;s tweets leading up to the &quot;world class underage sex slave op cover-upperer&quot; one you&#39;ve seen. You can see that the &quot;ops&quot; he&#39;s talking about are ACORN and Planned Parenthood (I bolded them for emphasis).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, lemme try answering your 2nd question with this: are you truly and honestly surprised that CP exists on the internet, including places like Twitter(and probably even Reddit or FB; definitely on some adult websites and I&#39;ve seen posts referring to it showing up on imgur, too)? I thought this had always been a rather well-known fact: yup, unfortunately CP exists here on the WWW. It probably always has and likely always will, with or without &quot;pizzagate&quot;. Sad, but true. </p>

<p>I suppose that you could say, in a way, that all pedos must be a part of the same &quot;community&quot; of sorts, in that they are a group of people with the same &quot;interests&quot; and I assume CP is shared amongst them however I feel like the comparison ends there. Are you really trying to tell me that every single piece of CP in existence came to be somehow through this one &quot;pizza&quot; restaurant in DC....? Or that all pedophiles go there for Sunday brunch...? Or what? Am I missing something here....?</p>

<p>As for your first question: I have to admit, I am unsure of what exactly you are referring to. If you are talking about the supposed &quot;code&quot; speak contained in some e-mails(for instance, &quot;pizza&quot; and &quot;maps&quot;), then all I have to say is please find me a credible pre-&quot;pizzagate&quot; source which conclusively shows &quot;maps&quot; as being a semen reference. I get the pizza/cheese pizza thing, sure(spent many years on 4chan), as well as 1 or 2 others from that alleged list of &quot;code&quot; words but the rest are just .... really, really out there. Without these &quot;codes&quot;, the Podesta emails have zero relation to this whole alleged thing. </p>

<p>I admit I have not looked heavily into this. I am open-minded. If I have stated something incorrectly then by all means, let me know and I will, truly, look into it. I will admit the whole eye thing is pretty fucking bizarre but other than that ...? I feel like people are really really REALLYYYYYYY jumping the gun here. It&#39;s frightening, actually. </p>

<p>At best, CPP would be a conditioning front, or recruiting arm. The assertion that it&#39;s the central node of a transnational enterprise is a fake news narrative pushed by the fake news outlets like CNN.</p>

<p>CPP is just the tip of the tentacle of a monster that&#39;s involved in human and organ trafficking, ritual abuse and children for sale. This sort of thing is the &quot;crust&quot; of the pizza debate, and not many people have ventured here, instead they choose the first bite of the slice, which is a pizza joint in DC. As long as Pizza Gate remains confined to CPP, it becomes an effective PSYOP to shut down any inquiries into the crust of the matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I consider myself a fairly skeptical person. But some of the theories I&#39;ve been reading really are a stretch. I&#39;m open to idea that, for whatever reason, people in high power positions seem to be in pedos (not all, but there is a bit of a pattern). The precedent for it exists. I also would agree with all the WikiLeaks emails that there is definitely some fuckery going on that needs investigated.</p>

<p>But, there&#39;s one big theory (among several other&#39;s) that I just don&#39;t get. And that&#39;s the whole Comet&#39;s pizza logo/international pedophile symbol thing. I&#39;ll concede that they look pretty much exactly the same. But, why the fuck would these people that are apparently highly intelligent, highly secretive, and capable of building a massive child sex ring just out right publicly display a known, unclassified, symbol for pedos. I mean, that just makes no fucking sense to me.</p>

<p>If they are involved in a child sex ring of the scale being suggested, they are obviously extremely well connected in the pedo community. They also probably don&#39;t want just any average joe to find out. So why would they just blatantly (not immediately obvious, but this information isn&#39;t exactly hard to obtain) advertise that? The answer is -- they wouldn&#39;t. There is no need for that kind of risk.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t accept the answer that they think their invincible/cocky/etc. If anyone could provide me with any solid reasoning as to why they would even think that is even remotely a good idea, I&#39;d be open to exploring the possibilities of some of the weirder theories surrounding the pizza place. But I&#39;m not convinced, a lot of these just seem to be reaching and scream confirmation bias.</p>

<p>Because people are literally this stupid. I remember a story about Canadian investigators who set up a website selling child sex tourism. Little Treasures or something like that. In their website logo, they used all 3 FBI pedo logos. Predators <strong>still</strong> tried to set up sex tourism vacations through the site. </p>

<p>Interesting theory, not particularly convincing though. When you consider that a map is an item used by abusers to collect bodily fluids of their victims as a trophy suddenly the email makes perfect sense. </p>

<p>Or maybe you are right, maybe they were making a joke about a literal map of pizza places. Maybe the Podesta&#39;s are just the least funny people in the world.</p>

<p>Yikes. It&#39;s actually scary how far off base you are on this. You should really read this detailed <a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">report</a>. What actually happened was a group of people masquerading as a church group attempted to illegally traffic Haitian children (THEY WEREN&quot;T EVEN FUCKIN ORPHANS YOU GUYS ARE LITERALLY DEFENDING CHILD TRAFFICKING). </p>

<p>Laura Silsby and co. went to parents, lied to them about bringing their children to a safe place where the parents would be able to see them again, then just took them and tried to get them out of the country never seeing their families again. </p>

<p>They were convicted of child-trafficking because they were child trafficking and not the SoS, but Billy boy Clinton in the flesh showed up to broker a deal for their release. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. Anyone interested in the reality of the Silsby child-trafficking case should read the linked Harvard Human Rights Journal on the matter. </p>

<p>Nothing. Well you could call Alefantis having a close relationship with Bill Clinton, who when he is not flying around on private jets with convicted pedophiles, is flying to Haiti to get convicted child-traffickers off the hook. Alefantis posting content that can only be described as disturbing on his social media. The Podesta emails which make 0 sense without the added context of the FBI leaked pedophile code. The Franklin Cover Up scandal. Haffert&#39;s admission of child molestation. Anthony Weiner&#39;s pedophile activities. Rao being connected to the Alefantis posts while at the same time being in a position to prosecute pedophiles.  </p>

<p>You have an interesting definition of the word nothing. </p>

<p>The Podesta emails make as much sense as any other random collection of private emails. They can refer to anything. There&#39;s no &quot;FBI leaked pedophile code&quot; that can be applied to them to reveal some secret intent. You&#39;re mixing things up with an FBI memo listing known pedophile symbols (which was in no way leaked, the NY Times reported on the spiral logos back in 2004). The only connection to the pizza shop and its owner is the fact that they once hosted a Clinton fundraiser, hardly a &quot;close relationship&quot;. And I have yet to see anything gleaned from the social media accounts of said restaurateur that even approaches &quot;disturbing&quot;. A girl with masking tape on her hands?

<p>Weiner was <em>accused</em> of talking with a 15 year old by the Daily Mail. It&#39;s still up in the air if any of that actually happened. His biggest scandals were with ordinary adult women.

<p>Wikileaks actually doesn&#39;t support <em>your</em> argument.

<p>FYI: Pedophilia was rampant in Ancient Rome (<em>not</em> Greece) long before Antinous. He was deified due to his looks, but he was technically an <em>adult</em> lover of the Emperor, 15 was old back then. The pedophilia connection was, again, invented by you pizzagaters. This is Ancient History 101 and can all be verified with a few <a href="http://unusualhistoricals.blogspot.com/2013/02/scandalous-affairs-hadrian-and-antinous.html">searches</a>.

<p>It&#39;s a freaking catering bill. The venue happened to include hot dogs and pizza. Sounds pretty reasonable for a moderate White House party.</p>

<p>Seriously, is this all you guys have? I haven&#39;t seen a lick of admissible evidence. I haven&#39;t even seen anything that looks reasonably suspicious. So yeah. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t believe in pizzagate.</p>

<p>Yikes. It&#39;s actually scary how far off base you are on this. You should really read this detailed <a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">report</a>. What actually happened was a group of people masquerading as a church group attempted to illegally traffic Haitian children (THEY WEREN&quot;T EVEN FUCKIN ORPHANS YOU GUYS ARE LITERALLY DEFENDING CHILD TRAFFICKING). </p>

<p>Laura Silsby and co. went to parents, lied to them about bringing their children to a safe place where the parents would be able to see them again, then just took them and tried to get them out of the country never seeing their families again. </p>

<p>They were convicted of child-trafficking because they were child trafficking and not the SoS, but Billy boy Clinton in the flesh showed up to broker a deal for their release. </p>

<p>That couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. Anyone interested in the reality of the Silsby child-trafficking case should read the linked Harvard Human Rights Journal on the matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you&#39;ve either fallen into a common trap or using a cliched trick yourself. You&#39;re mixing up verified abuse scandals with witchhunts based on fiction. Parts of your comment that refer to abuse scandals, like Epstein, part is exaggerating known scandals (Weiner did some disgusting things, but pedophilia never came into the picture) and part is fantasy (i.e. anything regarding a certain pizza shop and its owner).</p>

<p>The Podesta emails make as much sense as any other random collection of private emails. They can refer to anything. There&#39;s no &quot;FBI leaked pedophile code&quot; that can be applied to them to reveal some secret intent. You&#39;re mixing things up with an FBI memo listing known pedophile symbols (which was in no way leaked, the NY Times reported on the spiral logos back in 2004). The only connection to the pizza shop and its owner is the fact that they once hosted a Clinton fundraiser, hardly a &quot;close relationship&quot;. And I have yet to see anything gleaned from the social media accounts of said restaurateur that even approaches &quot;disturbing&quot;. A girl with masking tape on her hands? A picture of an empty walk-in freezer? Then you folks went after some random attorney who had the audacity to (gasp!) click &quot;Like&quot; on a few of the posts. </p>
