    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been audio engineering for 16 years. I use Pro Tools and Reaper. Most DAWS do the same thing but the difference mainly is where the tools are located. You don&#39;t <em>need</em> to add any beeps. You simply need to cut the places where you need to cut. Think of it like highlighting and cutting a sentence from MS Word. Also do not add any type of processing such as dynamic processing (compression, eq, TC) or time based FX (reverb, delays, etc). </p>

<p>Just cut the sections and RENDER/BOUNCE/EXPORT as an MP3 and post it. If the audio does need to be cleaned up then let me know and I&#39;ll either do it free of charge or walk you through what you need to do to fix it.</p>

<p>If you have any evidence of any moderators breaking our <a href="/rules">site wide rules</a> or <a href="/help/useragreement">TOS</a> you should send that information to us via <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a> modmail or <a href="mailto:contact@reddit.com">contact@reddit.com</a>. We often see claims like this but never see any actual evidence, most often it turns out to be someone with a grudge. With evidence we can and will take action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psst... askreddit mods are volunteers who askreddit for fun (or sheer bloody mindedness). Admins are the people paid by the owners to actually run the site. Your thread accuses volunteers of accepting money for controlling content, you hadn&#39;t mentioned anything about admins.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to make stuff up you should make sure you&#39;re consistent otherwise it all looks a bit fake.</p>

<p>I love what you&#39;re saying though, it&#39;s so funny. &quot;THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THIS SITE CENSOR EVERYTHING THEY DON&#39;T LIKE!!!&quot; Except direct accusations of censorship. Because dictators just <em>love</em> to be criticised!</p>

<p>Just because the user was banned from a sub doesn&#39;t mean he/she doesn&#39;t actually have the info that volunteer mods were taking money. I find most of my best sources of hidden info have an axe to grind actually. In fact it&#39;s important to establish a motivation behind someone leaks secrets to help establish some credibility. Of course just saying I have this info doesn&#39;t mean you do and doesn&#39;t mean it proves anything either.</p>

<p>I have evidence</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t post evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol, OP is well beyond &quot;full of shit&quot; territory here.  He doesn&#39;t have shit.  If he did, why would he post this instead of waiting until he had something legit to post?  Anything he does post is going to be a laughably bad fake made by him and his friends, I 100% guarantee it.</p>

<p>And I have more evidence that he&#39;s full of shit than he does of what he claims.  Look at his post history.  He suddenly stops posting in AskReddit three weeks ago after making a comment about &quot;Indians raping everything that walks.&quot;  I bet you anything they banned him and he&#39;s salty about that.  So he sees the default mod slack leak over thanksgiving and says &quot;Hmm, people get pissed when they see leaks, I bet if I made some shit up, people would be outraged without checking if it&#39;s true.&quot;</p>

<p>Unless he actually expects us to believe that he just <em>happens</em> to have a friend of a friend who was a former mod (that way he can conveniently avoid having to pick one of the current ones on the list to blame) of the sub that he has a bone to pick with.</p>

<p>Yeah, I call bullshit.</p>

<p>Nobody&#39;s going to get called out because <em>there&#39;s no financial benefit to any company to be gained from paying off askreddit mods</em>. How do I know this? Because in five years of modding nobody has ever approached me in any kind of way to buy favours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Companies pay media specialists to make organic/grassroots advertisements that seem like actual customer experiences so you are more invested or likely to try their brand. Is the cool woodworking project in DIY something someone made for home use and happened to use these products or is it a carefully crafted advert by Minwax? You can&#39;t know or tell. Pay off a few mods to make sure any competition is either down voted or removed via nebulous rulings and you have sure fire advertising for a fraction of the cost.   </p>

<p>to edit: This is what last seasons Southpark talked about when it said we are the ads. Advertising has become to ubiquitous and insidious we all perpetuate it without consciously realizing that it&#39;s a part of the collective unconscious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Due to Skypes terms of service no one has any expectation of privacy while using their product. There is no legal reason you would need to edit anything at all out. Secondly based on most states laws as long as one party is aware of the recording I/e the person recording is in the conversation it means they do not have an expectation if privacy and as such no information needs to be edited out nor can they claim &quot;spying&quot; or libel due to it being a recording of them. Other than that since reddit is a bunch of douchebags you aren&#39;t allowed to show any proof for anything even while people scream at you demanding proof or you&#39;ll be subject to being banned.</p>
