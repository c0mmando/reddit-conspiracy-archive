       Just use Audacity to edit out the parts that might be sensitive. Just don't accidentally edit over the source file. Make a copy. Maybe add a bleep to sound super professional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where to host it? No clue. You can just make videos with just audio and host them on Youtube/vimeo/vid.me and see where it stays up.

       I've been audio engineering for 16 years. I use Pro Tools and Reaper. Most DAWS do the same thing but the difference mainly is where the tools are located. You don't
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to add any beeps. You simply need to cut the places where you need to cut. Think of it like highlighting and cutting a sentence from MS Word. Also do not add any type of processing such as dynamic processing (compression, eq, TC) or time based FX (reverb, delays, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Just cut the sections and RENDER/BOUNCE/EXPORT as an MP3 and post it. If the audio does need to be cleaned up then let me know and I'll either do it free of charge or walk you through what you need to do to fix it.

       If you have any evidence of any moderators breaking our
       <a href="/rules">
        site wide rules
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/help/useragreement">
        TOS
       </a>
       you should send that information to us via
       <a href="/r/reddit.com">
        /r/reddit.com
       </a>
       modmail or
       <a href="mailto:contact@reddit.com">
        contact@reddit.com
       </a>
       . We often see claims like this but never see any actual evidence, most often it turns out to be someone with a grudge. With evidence we can and will take action.

       Psst... askreddit mods are volunteers who askreddit for fun (or sheer bloody mindedness). Admins are the people paid by the owners to actually run the site. Your thread accuses volunteers of accepting money for controlling content, you hadn't mentioned anything about admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to make stuff up you should make sure you're consistent otherwise it all looks a bit fake.

      <p>
       I love what you're saying though, it's so funny. "THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THIS SITE CENSOR EVERYTHING THEY DON'T LIKE!!!" Except direct accusations of censorship. Because dictators just

       The OP has a legit concern that Reddit staff would not appropriately handle information that their site has volunteers being paid to push an agenda. They would have a reason to keep it quiet and either support or remove said 'volunteers'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing the OP has said is inconsistent and your attack is baseless. Reddit's handling of many topics during the election cycle was biased and many subs were highly controlled.

       Just because the user was banned from a sub doesn't mean he/she doesn't actually have the info that volunteer mods were taking money. I find most of my best sources of hidden info have an axe to grind actually. In fact it's important to establish a motivation behind someone leaks secrets to help establish some credibility. Of course just saying I have this info doesn't mean you do and doesn't mean it proves anything either.

       Every time a moderator has broken the TOS they've been caught, called out and dumped by OTHER moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there are going to be some cases of mods using the position for monetary gain. But there are also other mods that take this shit so seriously they'll go to extraordinary lengths to uncover it. Just look at the Quickmeme debacle.

       You can't really refute what he said, it has happened. Just because it doesn't happen ALL the time doesn't mean it isn't happening and once it happens people lose faith. You can't blame him for having lost faith.

       This is so conceited I feel for OP, why would you say this? The admin could've left the comment alone because they've never responded to accusations of censorship, possibly as a way to dissuade others from thinking they do indeed censor comments.

       Publish on voat and the chans. Make sure you're on at least a vpn. Personally I'd be behind more but a vpn over a public hotspot should suffice. Use at least 3 different hosting sites. Publish during peak hours.

       Also OP, send it to Breitbart and other news outlets, as there's a pretty good chance they'll take it to the next level in terms of exposure.  Consider making it a torrent too (uploading from a secure/anon connection)

       Lol, OP is well beyond "full of shit" territory here.  He doesn't have shit.  If he did, why would he post this instead of waiting until he had something legit to post?  Anything he does post is going to be a laughably bad fake made by him and his friends, I 100% guarantee it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I have more evidence that he's full of shit than he does of what he claims.  Look at his post history.  He suddenly stops posting in AskReddit three weeks ago after making a comment about "Indians raping everything that walks."  I bet you anything they banned him and he's salty about that.  So he sees the default mod slack leak over thanksgiving and says "Hmm, people get pissed when they see leaks, I bet if I made some shit up, people would be outraged without checking if it's true."
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless he actually expects us to believe that he just
       <em>
        happens
       </em>
       to have a friend of a friend who was a former mod (that way he can conveniently avoid having to pick one of the current ones on the list to blame) of the sub that he has a bone to pick with.

       Just want to point out that OP has made a big claim with zero content. If OP doesn't come through this is will stay rattling around in most your brains as true. It would be really easy to keep quiet until he had a finished publishable material. This is part of a conspiracy to make this sub dumber.

       While I agree with some of your sentiments, you shouldn't discourage OP from helping in the way that they can. While Reddit's corruption is obvious to some, that's not the case for everyone and OP has the power to push the truth.

       He is a default mod himself, of course he won't do any actual research into anything bad regarding default mods. Don't waste your time arguing with him. The only reason he's on this subreddit right now is because his fellow mods are gonna get called out.

       Nobody's going to get called out because

       I dont know if op is full of shit or not.  But what i am curious about.  Is why any other mods besides conspiracy ones would even care about what gets talked about here.  Like genuinely curious.   I mean sure there are over 400k subscribers.   But its conspiracy right?  Just a wave of the hand and a tin foil hat comment and the theories get dismissed.  Or do they?
And i am not even trying to be dickick in any way.  Just pointing out how easy it is to dismiss the kinds of conversations that are here because conspiracy theory.

       This thread piqued my interest because either OP is right in which case I want to know which of my fellow mods are bad guys, or OP is full of shit and so he deserves ridiculing.

       I asked for an explanation not an argument. All you've done is shown me some deleted threads. I can already see deleted threads, thanks. What I wanted to know was why they make you think askreddit mods are sellouts.

       It's ok if you don't want to explain, it simply devalues your opinion. I don't understand why you'd share an opinion if you're not prepared to enter into any kind of conversation about it.

       Companies pay media specialists to make organic/grassroots advertisements that seem like actual customer experiences so you are more invested or likely to try their brand. Is the cool woodworking project in DIY something someone made for home use and happened to use these products or is it a carefully crafted advert by Minwax? You can't know or tell. Pay off a few mods to make sure any competition is either down voted or removed via nebulous rulings and you have sure fire advertising for a fraction of the cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       to edit: This is what last seasons Southpark talked about when it said we are the ads. Advertising has become to ubiquitous and insidious we all perpetuate it without consciously realizing that it's a part of the collective unconscious.

       They don't bother paying off mods. They use lots of accounts to comment on and upvote their advert, they don't need to involve mods in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your suggesting involves getting mods to allow known bad content, and removing competitors stuff. Why bother when reporting is anonymous so you can just report the competition and have it removed without revealing your own ad stuff?

       Why play one angle when playing them all isn't any more expensive? Corruption and collusion can be done in ways that isn't completely obvious. I'm not entirely sure why you are so certain that being a mod is some sort of important or noble cause, when you are basically an Internet janitor.

       I'm sure that I am not corrupt. I'm sure that the people who I mod with, who have become my friends, are not corrupt. I'm not at all sure that there's any benefit to paying askreddit mods off.

       More information on any subject this sub explores is good. It's counter-productive to be so dismissive. If you don't have the information OP is looking for why get involved?
Are you not curious as to who this "interesting investor" is?
*OP -  If you believe you have information that will impact the narrative, release it anywhere you can with whatever methods you have available. Though Bestnewsevah has a point - why go through the pain of exposing yourself if it just reinforces the info we already have. Risk vs. Reward

       I mod two defaults, I've been an askreddit mod for something like five years and I've
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       been approached to be any kind of shill.  The most I've got out of reddit is a certificate to say thanks for being a mod and a few months of gold from the admins (which they don't seem to do any more).

       Due to Skypes terms of service no one has any expectation of privacy while using their product. There is no legal reason you would need to edit anything at all out. Secondly based on most states laws as long as one party is aware of the recording I/e the person recording is in the conversation it means they do not have an expectation if privacy and as such no information needs to be edited out nor can they claim "spying" or libel due to it being a recording of them. Other than that since reddit is a bunch of douchebags you aren't allowed to show any proof for anything even while people scream at you demanding proof or you'll be subject to being banned.
