       People want to try and compare this with creationism. No. No. No. This is not the invisible world. This is something that can be easily proven or disproven, at least with this one location Comet Pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't get is why these people are not wanting so badily to show the world in every possible way that they are innocent. This is like the worst thing I could ever think of being accused of. I would personally go through every possible measure to prove right away that these claims are not possible. I woukd even put a live camera feeds everywhere in my business dhowing where every child is at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the problem I have. Non of the way these people are defending themselves makes any sense and only screams guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       All they have to do is be completely open. Nope. Instead they take DOWN cameras and simply call everyone crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not something to simply deny. I would want the entire world to know and realize that I am not satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are pictures of them freaking digging in the building. Is that not enough to warrant an investigation? All this should be public knowledge. Show me the blue prints! Are they going to try and fill on the tunnels and hide evedence before they let an investigation happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, who else would go through pleading the 5th and only expecting people to take you at your word if you were accused of the worst and most inhumane crime I can think of?

       I've not seen Westworld but I am convinced that "soft disclosure" is a fundamental element of brainwashing/programming. Give a version of the truth via entertainment and no one will take it seriously in future discussion. "Oh you mean like the episode in

       Great post! To anyone reading this, thinking this could happen to you, if you still watch TV, it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The insidious nature of it is that it works even if you know what's being said is a misdirection or lie. It slowly becomes familiar to you and becomes reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watching the election with fam... Kelly says a bunch of lies and finished her statement with something arguably true. Someone says "she's right." I had to object and explain what just happened. That someone then says "you take all the fun out of TV." I said it's not my fault she's lying to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously. TV, shut it off, completely. There is nothing you'll miss. Life is so much better without out it, it's amazing.

       Really surprised that people still watch TV.  I haven't owned a TV in over 7 years and haven't missed a thing.  Dig up your own info online, don't trust ANY outlets.

       I have the same problem with my dad and Jeremy Corbin. I watch his speeches on youtube, he watches him soley on BBC and Sky News. He says he can't stand the man and that he dresses like a hobo and has no idea what he's talking about. I really like him, I think he's a cool guy that seems relatable unlike the Tories.. and he talks about the right things and how people are struggling so bad under the Tory Regime. It really worries me how MUCH he despises him for apparently no reason.

       No, sometimes they say good stuff. But all politicians are full of shit anyways. All the crap the tories have done with the benefits system is a fuckin crime against humanity. So not a fan of them.

       If I was a pedophile I surely wouldn't put something like
       <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwhxaTyVEAAI_8v.jpg">
        this
       </a>
       on my wall.  And especially wouldn't boast about it openly. Like I'd say no sane person would put that on his wall in the first place. Now, if I was a pedo with a lot of money, powerful friends I'd feel invincible. Some of these pedos have got away with it for DECADES after all with hundreds of people knowing and not doing anything about it. I'd basically tell the world in subtle ways:
       <strong>
        yes I torture and kill children, what are you gonna do about it
       </strong>
       . I will not try to prove I'm innocent, I basically say: "fuck you" in multiple ways, like putting disgusting, horrible sick shit on my wall, openly use pedo code words on social media and so on. It's basically a big "what are you gonna do about it?" thing. They certainly didn't expect that people actually start doing anything...

       These guys ride on a high of invincibility because they'll never be properly investigated and they'll never be thrown under the bus by the elites that they supply to- because if they did I'm sure they have a LOT more dirt and data on their elite clients and friends that they keep for leverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's why this is being shushed and mocked. Orchestrated Pedophilia involves so many players in politics, law and media - hell it's probably part of the initiation process- so that it can always be kept as blackmail leverage and keep you protected but also subservient.

       I predict that Comet is going to undergo a move and restructuring, renaming etc.-  they have enough money and connections it won't be a problem and they think we'll just forget about it. But right now they're probably removing any and all structural evidence and moving their data evidence to a new spot so they CAN bring in the media and say 'look, nothing to see here' - but right now they are absolutely being given time and leniency to do so.

       For me, all you have to do is look at this guy's name. It's fake, legally changed to a thinly veiled translation of the French for "I love children". Talk about brashness and hiding in plain sight.

       This is the same sort of thing people say about the NSA when they say "if you aren't hiding anything why do you care if they are spying on you?!"  It's retarded to say just because people on the internet accuse you of something you should invite the FBI to look at everything you've ever done/are doing.  What sort of precedent would that set?  If enough people get a stick up their ass about something they can just start making allegations about you until you call the FBI on yourself?  The only answer to this sort of witch-hunt (if you aren't guilty and give a shit about the constitution and your own civil rights) is "provide some real evidence that I did something or leave me the fuck alone."

       Because "hiding things" comes in various shapes and sizes. If u think that someone in the government is corrupted and maybe selling intel for example (with a sizeable amount of connection) and are trying to investigate about it on your own since the police wont do it, then yes, u are "hiding things" since that one could just use they spying to know that u are digging in the matter and u would get killed/framed because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is different. He just need to denied it, or letting the police checking in to see there is no basement (or dont talking inconsistent in the first place) to fend himself. People are free to dig in. But once that happened, they would just "meh, it's not worth it" or waiting for the next one to drop. Simple?

       It's enough to raise some suspicion so it does count. If u want real smoking gun, it's gonna be hard in 2 months with all the cover-ups and "fake news" bullshit to even get something direct. U know how long till an investigation actually get something substantial (and not just circumstantial bullshit) if the perpetraitor wasnt caught red-handed? At least half a year for it. So u are sweating about a guy being an important clue in an investigation. K

       The people showing up at his restaurant with guns harassed him (Oh, that's fake... I suppose you have no evidence for that either but just will say it's fake so that makes it so)...  The people, daily, showing up at his restaurant with cameras to "investigate" him are harassing him (they are posting videos and periscopes every day of themselves going to his place so that IS happening.. you can't pretend everything is fake)... The people posting stuff on his restaurant's facebook page calling him a baby fucker and a baby killer are harassing him.. and based on what?  Flimsy circumstantial evidence.  Nothing concrete.  If there is ever any actual evidence I'd be more than happy to call for an investigation.  I'm just not a fan of ruining peoples' lives without having proof first... I guess I'm weird like that.

       No, the neighboring restaurant having paddles in their logo that kinda sorta looks like a butterfly I guess, which is a pedophile symbol in some contexts, is not evidence that he murders and rapes children in his basement.

       No, even if the fucking restaurant has a basement and he said it didn't, this is not evidence that he murders and rapes children in his basement.

       No, even if his brother used to be friends with someone who is a child molester, that is not evidence that he rapes and murders children in his basement.

       No, the fact that he and/or his brother like weird art that may have sexual undertones does not count as evidence that he rapes and murders children in his basement.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the fact that he listens to a band that had a song about pedophilia is not evidence that he rapes and murders children in his basement.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, him having some weird Greek shit that might be associated with pedophilia as his instagram profile picture is not evidence that he rapes and murders children in his basement.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I missed something, let me know.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Literally none of this
       </em>
       even
       <em>
        suggests
       </em>
       that he rapes and murders children in his basement, let alone is evidence for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when you put all of this "not evidence for anything" in a long list, it
       <em>
        looks
       </em>
       like it's actually evidence for something because there is so much of it. This is a logical fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because there is a lot of "evidence" for something does not mean it's true, especially when
       <em>
        none of this shit is evidence for the claims being made
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumstantial evidence is a thing. It can even lead to convictions in court. But none of this is even circumstantial evidence for the claims being made.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is literally zero physical evidence. And this, also is not evidence. These claims are baseless. Or, rather, the base it uses is a gigantic pile of horse shit, but since there's so much of it it looks like it's not as horse shit as it is.

       You have posted nearly every hour for the past 24 discrediting this shit. For someone who doesn't believe this stuff you sure spend a lot of time on it. Why?

       I really, really hate it when people behave irrationally or illogically. And this is the most irrational and illogical thing I've seen in a good while. It is literally like watching the fucking Salem witch trials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus I'm pretty bored. I got hit by a car and although I'm not hurt too bad I didn't go to work, but the whole situation has me pissed off so I couldn't sleep. Dude fucking hit me and kept on going as I lay in the street. And I had the right of way.

       Who does that? Seriously. Just not a cool thing to do.

       People who think that everyone who disagrees with them are shills are hopelessly lost, and very prevalent in this community. They would think I'm a shill no matter what my posting habits were, because I don't agree with them. It's actually kinda sad.

       Because he's brigading from EnoughTrumpSpam. Look at his post history. He brigades the mensrights sub too. He spent literally every hour of every day for the past few days shitting on pizzagate. He's a troll, which is why no one takes him seriously.

       If he called for an investigation, the first thing this sub would say is "of course they're not going to find anything, the feds are in on it"
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting public feeds up to watch other peoples' children is definitely not something a lot of parents would feel comfortable with.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's really not much he can do to discredit the pizzagate theories without people finding ways around it. Also, you have to understand that this is still a fringe thing even though a lot of people buy into it. The vast majority of his clientele most likely don't believe he has a child sex dungeon, and he probably just doesn't want to bother with this anymore.

       Maybe so but it would still shut a lot of people up if they woukd simply let the FBI investigate. I seriously believe that if it was any other joe shmow pizza place the FBI would have investigated by now if millions of people were speculating. Any normal person would be like "come on in". I would go to great lengths to show people they shoukd be confortable bringing there children around and not post pictures of myself covered in blood, naked with high heels on.

       There really isn't enough evidence to investigate. There's no supposed victims and no actual allegations of a crime. His clientele probably hasn't changed much other than a few pro-pizzagate people coming in to get kicked out.

       Yes. If they did a transparent investigation and there were no tunnels or secret rooms I would let go. I would still think they are pedophiles simply because of things like this...

       Would that satisfy you? Is there a single (or even series) piece of evidence that would make pizzagaters say "Yeah, maybe we were wrong about this whole thing."
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen this time and again with some of the more outlandish theories, like Flat Earth, fake moon landings, and Obama's birth country. Evidence starts to stack up, but the theorists keep demanding more and more ridiculous, specific, and unreasonable proof.

       The problem I see is that how can you disprove this at this point? The FBI could raid all the pizza places in DC and check everyone involved and people would say they are all bought pawns. The media could do a massive push to investigate everything and people would say the media is corrupt. Even if the majority of Reddit came forward and looked at the evidence and debunked it all people will say Reddit is corrupt and full of shills.

       Omg I literally thought the same.... In this case Comet Pizza is accused. If I was them and had a business and I knew that I don't do any of this shit I would literally let law enforcement fully investigate on me as I had nothing to hide. So why doesn't that Jimmy Comet guy and other people related to him simply hand over all data to police if they are innocent?

       You don't choose to let law enforcement investigate you. You don't call up the police and say "hey people think I'm shady, please use your resources to investigate me until people on reddit are satisfied".
      </p>
      <p>
       Law enforcement investigates you when there is solid evidence that you've committed a crime. If you think the evidence you've seen is so strong, start emailing or calling LE and present them with what you've gathered.

       OK. Post proof right now that you have never raped a child. As you said it should be easy. Post proof right now showing that you have never done it. If you can't prove that an event hasn't taken place I'll just have to assume it did. Until you prove otherwise I am free to refer to you publicly as a child rapist.

       My comment went over your head. Proving thete is no tunnels or a basement would be pretty sufficient. Calling the FBI to investogate would be sufficient enough to at least stop a lot of people from witch hunting.

       No. To you that would just be proof they've hidden their tunnels and have a secret basement and that the FBI are all in on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, just prove to me right now you've never raped a child and this will all be over. There's no need for us to prolong this. To have me and others continue to call you a child rapist. Just prove to me you have never in your life raped a child. Then you can get on with your life.

       Did you know that up in Canada 'maple syrup' is a term used for semen? Did you also know that Brazilian currency is called the 'real'? I also notice that you spelled 'investigate' with an O instead of an I. Is this some sort of code you are using? Surely it can't be a typo, a well read and educated researcher wouldn't sully their academic reputation with a simple spelling error.
       <br/>
       So, ilikerealmaplesyrup, perhaps you are some one who is interested in getting some Brazilian semen? Where's the easiest place to get Brazilian semen? From the penis if a Brazilian sex slave, that's where! Perhaps you used the O instead if the I in 'investigate' because you prefer to invest in a rounder Brazilian slave penis rather than a skinny Brazilian slave penis.
       <br/>
       OMG YOU FUCK BRAZILIAN SEX SLAVES!

       The people showing up at his restaurant with guns harassed him (Oh, that's fake... I suppose you have no evidence for that either but just will say it's fake so that makes it so)...  The people, daily, showing up at his restaurant with cameras to "investigate" him are harassing him (they are posting videos and periscopes every day of themselves going to his place so that IS happening.. you can't pretend everything is fake)... The people posting stuff on his restaurant's facebook page calling him a baby fucker and a baby killer are harassing him.. and based on what?  Flimsy circumstantial evidence.  Nothing concrete.  If there is ever any actual evidence I'd be more than happy to call for an investigation.  I'm just not a fan of ruining peoples' lives without having proof first... I guess I'm weird like that.
