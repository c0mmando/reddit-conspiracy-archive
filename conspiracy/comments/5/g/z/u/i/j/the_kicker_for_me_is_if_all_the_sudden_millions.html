<p>What I don&#39;t get is why these people are not wanting so badily to show the world in every possible way that they are innocent. This is like the worst thing I could ever think of being accused of. I would personally go through every possible measure to prove right away that these claims are not possible. I woukd even put a live camera feeds everywhere in my business dhowing where every child is at all times. </p>

<p>This is the problem I have. Non of the way these people are defending themselves makes any sense and only screams guilty. </p>

<p>All they have to do is be completely open. Nope. Instead they take DOWN cameras and simply call everyone crazy.</p>

<p>This is not something to simply deny. I would want the entire world to know and realize that I am not satan. </p>

<p>There are pictures of them freaking digging in the building. Is that not enough to warrant an investigation? All this should be public knowledge. Show me the blue prints! Are they going to try and fill on the tunnels and hide evedence before they let an investigation happen? </p>

<p>I mean, who else would go through pleading the 5th and only expecting people to take you at your word if you were accused of the worst and most inhumane crime I can think of?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! To anyone reading this, thinking this could happen to you, if you still watch TV, it is.</p>

<p>The insidious nature of it is that it works even if you know what&#39;s being said is a misdirection or lie. It slowly becomes familiar to you and becomes reality.</p>

<p>Watching the election with fam... Kelly says a bunch of lies and finished her statement with something arguably true. Someone says &quot;she&#39;s right.&quot; I had to object and explain what just happened. That someone then says &quot;you take all the fun out of TV.&quot; I said it&#39;s not my fault she&#39;s lying to you.</p>

<p>Seriously. TV, shut it off, completely. There is nothing you&#39;ll miss. Life is so much better without out it, it&#39;s amazing.</p>

He says he can&#39;t stand the man and that he dresses like a hobo and has no idea what he&#39;s talking about. I really like him, I think he&#39;s a cool guy that seems relatable unlike the Tories.. and he talks about the right things and how people are struggling so bad under the Tory Regime. It really worries me how MUCH he despises him for apparently no reason.</p>

I&#39;d basically tell the world in subtle ways: <strong>yes I torture and kill children, what are you gonna do about it</strong>. I will not try to prove I&#39;m innocent, I basically say: &quot;fuck you&quot; in multiple ways, like putting disgusting, horrible sick shit on my wall, openly use pedo code words on social media and so on.

    <div class="md"><p>This.</p>

<p>These guys ride on a high of invincibility because they&#39;ll never be properly investigated and they&#39;ll never be thrown under the bus by the elites that they supply to- because if they did I&#39;m sure they have a LOT more dirt and data on their elite clients and friends that they keep for leverage.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s why this is being shushed and mocked. Orchestrated Pedophilia involves so many players in politics, law and media - hell it&#39;s probably part of the initiation process- so that it can always be kept as blackmail leverage and keep you protected but also subservient. </p>

<p>I predict that Comet is going to undergo a move and restructuring, renaming etc.-  they have enough money and connections it won&#39;t be a problem and they think we&#39;ll just forget about it. But right now they&#39;re probably removing any and all structural evidence and moving their data evidence to a new spot so they CAN bring in the media and say &#39;look, nothing to see here&#39; - but right now they are absolutely being given time and leniency to do so. </p>

<p>Because &quot;hiding things&quot; comes in various shapes and sizes. If u think that someone in the government is corrupted and maybe selling intel for example (with a sizeable amount of connection) and are trying to investigate about it on your own since the police wont do it, then yes, u are &quot;hiding things&quot; since that one could just use they spying to know that u are digging in the matter and u would get killed/framed because of it.</p>

<p>This is different. He just need to denied it, or letting the police checking in to see there is no basement (or dont talking inconsistent in the first place) to fend himself. People are free to dig in. But once that happened, they would just &quot;meh, it&#39;s not worth it&quot; or waiting for the next one to drop. Simple?</p>

<p>And <strong>WHO</strong> exactly harassed him? The police? He just pretty much talk to them and denying that he has done it, then they would just go away. The gunman? That was a fake anyway. The Internet? He could just, you know, FUCKING IGNORE IT IF HE WASNT DOING IT. Jesus Christ kid. </p>

<p>It&#39;s enough to raise some suspicion so it does count. If u want real smoking gun, it&#39;s gonna be hard in 2 months with all the cover-ups and &quot;fake news&quot; bullshit to even get something direct. U know how long till an investigation actually get something substantial (and not just circumstantial bullshit) if the perpetraitor wasnt caught red-handed? At least half a year for it.

<p>Ok, PROVE you&#39;ve never molested a child. I think it&#39;s completely possible you have. I haven&#39;t seen any evidence you haven&#39;t, yet you&#39;re obsessed with the idea, and say you can prove - and why would you already <em>know</em> the lengths you&#39;d go to to prove your haven&#39;t?

<p>How can we know this isn&#39;t just your way of showing off <em>your</em> invincibility, flaunting your sick addiction in public, right under the noses of the people who hate you most?</p>

<p>And so on. What you are proposing sounds like a good, moral thing at first. The authorities will always find something. If they want to. Your idea to self-investigate by calling the FBI on yourself is ridiculous.</p>

<p>I knew a guy, dead from cancer now, who was accused of molesting his kid. This was during a divorce proceeding, which makes it immediately suspect to me, and his life was made complete HELL. And he was innocent. It all came out, the wife admitted it was nothing but lies in court.</p>

<p>But, he had been branded. And he lived with that black cloud over his head until he died seven years later.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t be serious about this. You&#39;re just pulling some moral high horse shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>There are pictures of them freaking digging in the building. Is that not enough to warrant an investigation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. It isn&#39;t. Unfortunately, digging in a building is not actually a crime, nor is it evidence for a crime. And you kinda need that to warrant an investigation.</p>

<p>Shit like this is why pizzagate is even a thing. There appears to be a fundamental misunderstanding of what evidence and proof is.</p>

<p>No, his friend posting phallic images on Instagram is not evidence that he rapes and murders children in his basement.</p>

<p>No, him posting things that look weird, if you assume he&#39;s a child rapist, on Instagram is not evidence that he is, in fact, a child rapist. </p>

<p>No, the neighboring restaurant having paddles in their logo that kinda sorta looks like a butterfly I guess, which is a pedophile symbol in some contexts, is not evidence that he murders and rapes children in his basement. </p>

<p>No, something that kinda looks like one of the logos for pedophilia in the FBI database being on his restaurant is not evidence that he rapes and murders children in his basement.</p>

<p>No, even if the fucking restaurant has a basement and he said it didn&#39;t, this is not evidence that he murders and rapes children in his basement.</p>

<p>No, even if his brother used to be friends with someone who is a child molester, that is not evidence that he rapes and murders children in his basement.</p>

<p>No, the fact that he was digging in the building is not evidence that he murders and rapes children. </p>

<p>No, the fact that he and/or his brother like weird art that may have sexual undertones does not count as evidence that he rapes and murders children in his basement.</p>

<p>No, the fact that he listens to a band that had a song about pedophilia is not evidence that he rapes and murders children in his basement.</p>

<p>No, him having some weird Greek shit that might be associated with pedophilia as his instagram profile picture is not evidence that he rapes and murders children in his basement.</p>

<p>If I missed something, let me know.</p>

<p><em>Literally none of this</em> even <em>suggests</em> that he rapes and murders children in his basement, let alone is evidence for it.</p>

<p>But when you put all of this &quot;not evidence for anything&quot; in a long list, it <em>looks</em> like it&#39;s actually evidence for something because there is so much of it. This is a logical fallacy. </p>

<p>Just because there is a lot of &quot;evidence&quot; for something does not mean it&#39;s true, especially when <em>none of this shit is evidence for the claims being made</em>.</p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence is a thing. It can even lead to convictions in court. But none of this is even circumstantial evidence for the claims being made.</p>

<p>There is literally zero physical evidence. And this, also is not evidence. These claims are baseless. Or, rather, the base it uses is a gigantic pile of horse shit, but since there&#39;s so much of it it looks like it&#39;s not as horse shit as it is.</p>

<p>I really, really hate it when people behave irrationally or illogically. And this is the most irrational and illogical thing I&#39;ve seen in a good while. It is literally like watching the fucking Salem witch trials.</p>

<p>Plus I&#39;m pretty bored. I got hit by a car and although I&#39;m not hurt too bad I didn&#39;t go to work, but the whole situation has me pissed off so I couldn&#39;t sleep. Dude fucking hit me and kept on going as I lay in the street. And I had the right of way.</p>

<p>Who does that? Seriously. Just not a cool thing to do.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>People who think that everyone who disagrees with them are shills are hopelessly lost, and very prevalent in this community. They would think I&#39;m a shill no matter what my posting habits were, because I don&#39;t agree with them. It&#39;s actually kinda sad.</p>

<p>Putting public feeds up to watch other peoples&#39; children is definitely not something a lot of parents would feel comfortable with. </p>

<p>There&#39;s really not much he can do to discredit the pizzagate theories without people finding ways around it.

    <div class="md"><p>Omg I literally thought the same.... In this case Comet Pizza is accused. If I was them and had a business and I knew that I don&#39;t do any of this shit I would literally let law enforcement fully investigate on me as I had nothing to hide. So why doesn&#39;t that Jimmy Comet guy and other people related to him simply hand over all data to police if they are innocent?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t choose to let law enforcement investigate you. You don&#39;t call up the police and say &quot;hey people think I&#39;m shady, please use your resources to investigate me until people on reddit are satisfied&quot;.</p>

<p>Law enforcement investigates you when there is solid evidence that you&#39;ve committed a crime. If you think the evidence you&#39;ve seen is so strong, start emailing or calling LE and present them with what you&#39;ve gathered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. Post proof right now that you have never raped a child. As you said it should be easy. Post proof right now showing that you have never done it. If you can&#39;t prove that an event hasn&#39;t taken place I&#39;ll just have to assume it did. Until you prove otherwise I am free to refer to you publicly as a child rapist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. To you that would just be proof they&#39;ve hidden their tunnels and have a secret basement and that the FBI are all in on it.</p>

<p>Again, just prove to me right now you&#39;ve never raped a child and this will all be over. There&#39;s no need for us to prolong this. To have me and others continue to call you a child rapist. Just prove to me you have never in your life raped a child. Then you can get on with your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know that up in Canada &#39;maple syrup&#39; is a term used for semen? Did you also know that Brazilian currency is called the &#39;real&#39;? I also notice that you spelled &#39;investigate&#39; with an O instead of an I. Is this some sort of code you are using? Surely it can&#39;t be a typo, a well read and educated researcher wouldn&#39;t sully their academic reputation with a simple spelling error.<br/>
So, ilikerealmaplesyrup, perhaps you are some one who is interested in getting some Brazilian semen? Where&#39;s the easiest place to get Brazilian semen? From the penis if a Brazilian sex slave, that&#39;s where! Perhaps you used the O instead if the I in &#39;investigate&#39; because you prefer to invest in a rounder Brazilian slave penis rather than a skinny Brazilian slave penis.<br/>
OMG YOU FUCK BRAZILIAN SEX SLAVES!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people showing up at his restaurant with guns harassed him (Oh, that&#39;s fake... I suppose you have no evidence for that either but just will say it&#39;s fake so that makes it so)...  The people, daily, showing up at his restaurant with cameras to &quot;investigate&quot; him are harassing him (they are posting videos and periscopes every day of themselves going to his place so that IS happening.. you can&#39;t pretend everything is fake)... The people posting stuff on his restaurant&#39;s facebook page calling him a baby fucker and a baby killer are harassing him.. and based on what?  Flimsy circumstantial evidence.  Nothing concrete.  If there is ever any actual evidence I&#39;d be more than happy to call for an investigation.  I&#39;m just not a fan of ruining peoples&#39; lives without having proof first... I guess I&#39;m weird like that.  </p>
