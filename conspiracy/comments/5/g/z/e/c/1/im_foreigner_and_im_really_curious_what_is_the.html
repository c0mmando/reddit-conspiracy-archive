I&#39;m afraid that like 2 weeks and people will forget. Idk how&#39;s in your country, but here in Poland it&#39;s like nothing happened, no single word about it in any TV News, papers and hell it&#39;s hard to even find something on our internet.</p>

<p>Few years ago there was a pedo scandal in the UK, where former and actual politics were involved into. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>It really grind my gears that some people can do whatever the fuck they want and they will never be put to justice. </p>

<p>Is there anything we can do? How to show to this sick fucks that money can&#39;t make them immune? </p>

<p>If there is a way, i will follow it - i have enough of it.</p>

<p>I can stand that one ore another dude is caught sniffing cocaine and case is swept under the carpet but &quot;private sex island&quot;, abusing infants?!?! It&#39;s too much...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Educate yourself in the classic warning signs of children who are being abused. Encourage other people to also educate themselves. If you notice the warning signs in a child, don&#39;t be afraid to ask them if anything is going on that is making them sad or scared, and let them know that it is okay to tell you and they won&#39;t be in trouble for telling. Don&#39;t be a coward and turn a blind eye if you notice that someone is acting inappropriate towards a child, or if a child is showing the warning signs. This knowledge and courage should become common in society. It is the first major, crucial step in breaking through the cognitive dissonance of the masses when it comes to child predators in government. Right now most people don&#39;t even know how to recognize or respond to child predators in everyday life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, I&#39;m not sure we are dealing with &quot;traditional&quot; child abuse.</p>

<p>If we follow the rabbit hole all the way it leads to even crazier shit.</p>

<p>Mental reprogramming (Tavistock) and ritualistic abuse, even sacrifice to pagan gods (bohemian grove) and possibly even cannibalism (this is admittedly mostly conjecture based on spirit cooking).</p>

<p>I suspect these kids aren&#39;t exposed to the outside world much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, some child abuse is so organized and covert that the children never see the light of day, so to speak, and therefore there won&#39;t be anyone from the outside to notice something is wrong.</p>

<p>However, the point of my post is aimed more at the widespread cognitive dissonance in the general public when it comes to child abuse in general. If people cannot even recognize child abuse signs they witness in their own lives, as most cannot, then trying to convince them that there is a problem in powerful governments is probably not going to be successful.</p>

<p>It is a case where doing the right thing from the ground up is important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get your point, but you need to admit that it should be investigated.
If they are innocent, it&#39;s ok by me. (although i&#39;m 95% sure they are not)</p>

<p>Remember that we are talking about high officials here. If someone is responsible for whole country, he should be clean as a whistle but it&#39;s only my opinion in the end.</p>

<p>edit: Those instagram pics are at the very least disturbing.
I don&#39;t give a shit about instagram photos, but this guy is closely connected with high officials.

    <div class="md"><p>Which Instagram photos? The one of <em>his goddaughter</em> taped to the table in a joke picture, joking about how kids are always running around the restaurant?</p>

<p>Yeah, he should be investigated for that because a bunch of people on Reddit took the image out of context and said that this joke picture was him really sending a coded message that he rapes his goddaughter in the basement of his pizza restaurant. And he posted this admission of raping her on Instagram for some reason.</p>

<p>Or are you talking about the adult pictures, not even posted by him, taken over a year ago, <em>that in no way whatsoever at all indicate that a crime has taken place</em>?</p>

<p>He should be investigated for raping and murdering children based on literally nothing that would  be considered evidence for that, because fucking Reddit and 4chan are positive that he did it?</p>

<p>Is that really the basis for which we should launch police investigations now? Instagram pictures that prove <em>literally nothing</em>, but seem weird to you, are enough to have the police investigate someone for raping and murdering children in their basement?</p>

<p>You would think that the people of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would be against the police state and against baseless police investigations.</p>

<p>What do i really care is abusing children. If you could take some time and dig through network, you would already know that it&#39;s not about Alefantis/Trump/USA. There were simmilar cases in Norway, UK, Australia - lawyers, politicians, high officials etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look I give a shit about human rights. You know stuff like</p>

<p>(1) Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.</p>

<p>or No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.</p>

<p>In fact pretty much the majority of Articles 2-12 of the human rights declaration deal with this issue. People are being assumed guilty of the sickest crimes imaginable and subjected to humiliation in public and outright harassment because of this shit which has still to amount to anything more than the people involved have a weird sense of humour and weird taste in art (which judging by how quickly I could paint a disturbed image of you, you should be a bit more sensitive to how easy it is to push that narrative when you&#39;re picking and choosing what to show). Which was my point. That it&#39;s very easy to fall into the idea of proving someone&#39;s guilt and forgetting whether or not they&#39;re guilty in the first place</p>

<p><a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/</a></p>

<p>PS Notice how I spelled humour? I&#39;m not American either. It isn&#39;t a partisan issue for me either. But you should be critical thinking enough to notice that it is a partisan issue for those pushing the pizzagate rhetoric hardest. And yes I know about Saville and the vatican, which both had loads of people come forward that were silenced or bribed - we haven&#39;t seen that with pizzagate</p>

<p>I welcome the investigation, I have absolutely nothing to hide, something I have yet to hear from the people involved. When it comes to stopping the harm caused to children, I&#39;m willing to temporarily forgo certain privileges...you know, it&#39;s almost as if the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-29/fbi-and-nsa-poised-to-gain-new-surveillance-powers-under-trump">new investigation legislation</a> timing coincides with this whole pizzagate thing...no wonder pedos be freaking out!! <em>lol, run.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can respect your point of view and willingness to be open. But I think it&#39;s a dangerous one. I haven&#39;t been against pizzagate from the start - I&#39;m against it now, because I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve uncovered anything and are literally just harassing people now on some small off chance of them being guilty. I think if people here actually had the empathy they claim to have, they would realise that if the positions were switched - they&#39;d hate to be in Alefantis&#39; position and feel completely betrayed by the world.</p>

<p>I mean do we have to assume that just because someone is against being completely open, they&#39;re pedophiles. Personally I am against mass surveillance for this same reason (and I honestly always thought conspiracy theorists were on the same page on that with me).</p>

<p>I am for transparent government but let&#39;s not pretend this is where pizzagate is heading when the most closely linked person is a private citizen (yes with political links but everyone is linked to politics by some distance). My uncle (who I&#39;m not even close to) is actually a politician, does that mean I&#39;ve foregone the right to privacy?</p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s a massive shift in world views I have against this sub. I believe personal rights are above all and that some small chance of pedophile rings is not an adequate enough amount of suspicion for my rights to be thrown aside.</p>
