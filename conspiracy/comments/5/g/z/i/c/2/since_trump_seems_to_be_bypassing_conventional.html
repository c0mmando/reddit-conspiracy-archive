       They're going to stew in their own juice. There's nothing they can do, they've been excised due to their own bad behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does Trump need these people for anything? I saw his rallies on the internet, I watched his two addresses to the American people so far on youtube. Why do I need NBC/ABC/Fox or the rest of them to hear what he has to say?
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't have a "fold". They're unnecessary. They're the last people to realize that they've been made redundant.

       The millionaire talking fools on TV are toast. No doubt they're shaking in their boots tying to figure how to make the mortgage payments on the mansions they bought.

       I am interested that you think that they will just sit back and buckle up for the their freefall into oblivion.  Not that I have any sympathy for them in any way... but the same people who brought us 911, Sandy Hook, Boston etc....are behind these networks.  Don't you think they are capable of pulling off something that polarizes the public and causes an outcry for their "reliable news" ?  I even think that Assange's account being compromised might even be a preclude for distrust in a direct news outlet and who might have control over that person or their communication devices.... Just my 2 cents though :)

       Of course they won't sit back. They've already launched an an assault on their adversaries with 'fake news' accusations. The alt media is laughing uproariously at their vain attempts....it really is quite amusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kind of money made by the talking fools on mainstream TV will not be forfeited easily, that doesn't mean their cause is not already lost. They just don't understand that in the US they have already lost, and no amount of ragged ridiculous propaganda will bring them back from the dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're done.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to know how really well buried they are, ask me. I'm 63 years old and I don't believe a word they say. When they've utterly alienated the geezers, exactly what have they got left?

       The young ME-linials.... The focus will be getting rid of the older wiser and ill money sucking seniors... I see it all the time on the TV .... ads that are "a home for Mom" or Grandparents dressed as the big bad wolf looking down on their grandchild.  You and I are in for a bumpy ride all the way to our eventual assisted euthanasia when and if we stand in the way of our children or grandchildren or hold any monetary means.  Age is no longer wisdom or respected it is simply a giant sucking money machine and a drag on society and we better get used to the idea that we are "hindering" our children by our long lives and best to just end it so they can be free to do as they please.  This is who they will target those without moral compass and with little to no empathy and news ... well who knows what form it will take but it wont be anything about real news...

       The MSM, while floundering in low ratings, still have considerable reach on social media and other outlets. They just aren't smart enough to monetize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their response is what we are seeing now: a desperate attempt to label any other media as fake news in an attempt to reestablish credibility after a disastrous election. Will it work? I doubt it, people have already awoken. This will likely lead to a fast track of Internet censorship, which we are already seeing en masse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that the "powers that be" will never concede, and the media is still their biggest weapon. I don't see any scenario where the media colleses around Trump.
