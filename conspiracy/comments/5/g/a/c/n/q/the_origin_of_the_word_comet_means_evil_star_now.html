The ancient Greeks called them &quot;evil stars,&quot; which in Greek is dys evil and astron a star. This is the origin of the modern word disaster. The association of comets with untoward events or prophecies continued as recently as the twentieth century, when Comet Halley made an unusually close rendezvous with earth.[9]</p>

<p>-Lucifer is also known as a Fallen Star.</p>

<p>look at this</p>

<p>The origin of the word Comet, means &quot;Evil Star&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. It comes from the Greek word &#39;come&#39; meaning &#39;hair&#39;, and denotes a star with a tail.</p>

<p>(&#39;Coma&#39;, the medical term, is Greek too: &quot;koma&quot; meaning sleep)</p>

<p>They&#39;ve been thought of as omens for centuries, and get a mention in Shakespeare: &quot;When beggars die, there are no comets seen; The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.&quot;</p>

<p>You can see the same idea in the Heaven&#39;s Gate cult, who thought the Hale-Bopp comet of 1997 was a spaceship and committed suicide in order to be &#39;taken aboard&#39;.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s by the by. Things are named &#39;Comet&#39; because comets comeback regularly and spectacularly, so they are a good thing to be remembered for. Just off the top of my head I can think of two newspapers in the UK called &#39;The Comet&#39; and one wholesale distributor (gone bust now, I think).</p>

<p>And Lucifer isn&#39;t (or wasn&#39;t) a &#39;fallen star&#39;. The name means &#39;Light bearer&#39; and is usually applied to Venus as a morning star, heralding the sunrise. Lucifer (as in Satan) was a fallen angel, if you like, but not a fallen star. Big difference.</p>

<p>dys = evil</p>

<p>astron = star</p>

<p>disaster = evil star</p>

<p>Since they were described before being named, disaster is a possible alternative etymological derivation for the word &quot;comet&quot;. You probably don&#39;t see it on Wikitionary or other lefty etymology sites because of the devilish connection (gotta stamp out all traces of that evil!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a lost cause. I keep telling people to abandon the Satanic angle because it&#39;s too &quot;out there&quot; for most. It overwhelms the dismissal threshold. </p>

<p>Too bad, because that&#39;s exactly what the symbologist/sigilizer wants. For it to creep under the radar, right into the subconscious. For it to be accepted by all yet known by none, and worn as a badge of pride by some dissaffected goth type, etc. </p>

<p>The whole concept is pretty sickening when you do finally accept the true meaning of symbolism under the proper context.</p>

<p>What happened in the 80&#39;s is still relatively current,  it should not be discounted in light of the fact there are no children speaking up in regards to pizzagate,  but only some creepy leads that started on wikileaks.    Don&#39;t forget Assange himself is the target of false pedophile charges and dubious rape charges,  based also on sketchy material.</p>

<p>Kids don&#39;t lie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, but here&#39;s a link to a <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/149214NCJRS.pdf">relevant PDF</a> (which you&#39;ll probably not click &#39;cause you don&#39;t know me so I&#39;ll summarize it here) which was published in part due to the Jordan kids fabricating stories to please investigators, and in part due to the officers mishandling the investigation (shared interview results with other interviewees, interviewed the same child multiple times, etc.):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Children 
rarely 
lie 
about 
sexual 
abuse 
or 
ex-
ploitation, 
but 
they 
do 
fantasize, 
furnish 
false 
information, 
furnish 
misleading 
information, 
misperceive 
events, 
try 
to please 
adults, 
respond 
to 
leading 
questions, 
and 
respond 
to 
rewards. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you look into the original Jordan report there&#39;s about 6 or 7 interviews in a row that end up being thrown out because the kids can&#39;t keep their stories together.</p>

<p>That&#39;s quite a leap.  Out of the many thousands of revelations wikileaks uncovered, over a period of ten years and just prior to the election, you&#39;re going to assume it was pizzagate that led to his detention.</p>

<p>I was going to answer you, but with this childish response have decided you don&#39;t deserve any more of my attention.  It&#39;s not surprising to me you missed the entire point, and assume something else. </p>

<p>Of course there are real revelations.  Are you familiar with the Epstein&#39;s Lolita Express?  That has LOADS of REAL evidence involved, including witnesses, a convicted felon, an island that had the Clinton&#39;s, but wouldn&#39;t you know it, no one cares, and those that should are instead spending all of their time pouring over weird art and photos in this bullshit pizzagate thing.</p>

It&#39;s just old news you gotta keep up, I agree people get lost looking at silly pictures which will never amount to &#39;evdicence&#39;.</p>

<p>But how can you dismiss pizzagate when this is exactly what pizzagate is exposing? esp the same circle of government rich elite. Which is what I sent the link To the 60mins thing about. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not the one who said people making these claims would have been burned by witches by people like you. That seems more childish (or just dumb mob mentality), then me saying your a witchburner which you yourself said </p>

<p>I have no doubt whatsoever that the Clinton Foundation is corrupt, and a money laundering scheme.  Read about Haiti alone, and the many millions stolen from the natural disaster victims there.  But I have to disagree with your statement.  The american public has a short attention span.  This pizzagate shit is designed to divert attention, before allowing the Clinton Foundation and wikileaks <em>other thousands of revelations</em> to fade into the background.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, that&#39;s not true at all.  Arrests haven&#39;t been made because there is no evidence.  If dozens or hundreds of children are being raped by hundreds or thousands of powerful people, involving thousands of others, it will come out.  In fact, it probably would have by now. </p>

<p>That is what most people don&#39;t realize. We have been conditioned to think that pedophiles are some isolated sickos who act alone, but what we&#39;re slowly coming to realize is that pedophilia is actually a sexual orientation that is prevalent in society and especially among the elite.</p>

<p>US laws (18 and over) and all of that is not meant to protect children, but put there to stop commoners from practicing the same sexual preference as the elites. </p>

<p>Look into the Lolita Express.  There is a boatload of real evidence, including manifests, witnesses, a conviction, the Clinton&#39;s and royalty, etc  etc, but instead of investigating <strong>that</strong> child abduction and rape of girls as young as 14, (Epstein is a convicted felon, and Bill visited his island numerous times...) people are instead interested in this BS.</p>

<p>I have no doubt whatsoever the elite take part in eyes wide shut style shit.  Pizzagate has yet to come close to proving anything remotely as interesting as the Lolita express case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, because the government couldn&#39;t possibly be implicated because they are all pure and holy and above corruption, and if this were real it would have been over by now. The good people would have done the right things.</p>

<p>Do you even hear yourself? Or know where you are? People are jailed for days for being mere suspects in cases far, far below this caliber. It&#39;s guilty until proven innocent, UNLESS you have a position of power, in which case it&#39;s always innocent.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how you can admit the Clinton Foundation needs looking into, but you can&#39;t see how the NCMEC (organized originally by Bill Clinton) and CPS have been colluding with the FBI (who don&#39;t track missing children statistics, hmm wonder why), and that that&#39;s the big connection behind pizzagate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tens of thousands of people, not only in this country, but around the entire world <strong>are pouring over every single minuscule aspect of every single email.</strong>  </p>

<p>Yes, I absolutely do say that if anything damning enough were to come to light, (and it would happen fairly soon, wouldn&#39;t it? There are only so many emails.) arrests would be made.  </p>

<p>Supposing there is real evidence, the news would hit social media in a hot second, people would freak the fuck out and demand an arrest.  Just look at how unhinged people are right now!  I saw one poster who doxxed someone, came here and said, &quot;Look (so and so) has a second cousin that&#39;s an anesthesiologist!  So naturally, the implication is that must mean the relative knocks out small children so elite can have a fuck fest.  Others have shown someone wearing a pendant of two intertwined hearts, so obviously that woman likes &quot;hotdog&quot; every full moon!  </p>

<p>Do you even hear yourself?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Do you hear <em>yourself</em>?  I&#39;m rational, and most of you are out of your goddamn minds.  </p>

<p>If there is some undeniable evidence, then why haven&#39;t <strong>you</strong> called the cops, or the FBI?  It&#39;s an easy thing to do.  Faxing your evidence would work also.  Email.  You&#39;ll be a big hero for causing the first arrest.  Stop what you are doing, and do it right now.  It&#39;ll be world wide news.  I&#39;m quite serious, why haven&#39;t YOU called, if kids are being fucked all over, and you&#39;ve got the PROOF????????????  After all, &quot; People are jailed for days for being mere suspects...&quot;  Alephantis is not an elite untouchable, is he?  Many of the people implicated are not.</p>

<p>Do you even hear yourself?</p>

<p><strong>Pizzagate is a psy-op to take attention away from the corruption of the Clinton Foundation, and the whereabouts and condition of Julian Assange.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the point was they could have the pictures hanging on their walls and deniers would still say it&#39;s not enough evidence.</p>

<p>So no gay clubs don&#39;t need to have pictures of that because they wouldn&#39;t even believe it for child abusers.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://archive.fo/vddrO">no matter how creepy their art is like that statue crawling upside in the position of that guy dalmer murdered</a> or the fact the Washington post said  in 2004</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents&#39; suburban homes.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find it hard to believe that people can&#39;t connect these dots. Sure /conspiracy goes over board and claims little stars in the corner are proof they worship Satan. </p>

<p>But at what point does the defense of these places have to have to much defense?  My point, there is mounting evidence of this. Not of them abusing children, yet.
But when or if they do, all of the art work and those emails will be then looked at as an obvious sign.  </p>

<p>I just hope the media doesn&#39;t completely cover this shit up. Like they did in England <a href="https://youtu.be/KRObgttIyeg">with the 60 mins program that was never aired there</a> 
In fact I think all these fucks are still free.</p>

This is the worst of the worst. Apparently , imo , there are things , peculiar things, that the wealthy and privileged feel they can do and get away with .It is seemingly  so common,  they  even find groups of like minded folk to engage in their heinous behavior with . Generally these people don&#39;t get caught and if they have allegations against them , they usually can survive it because so many are complicit in their crimes by covering them up.  Low level guys or participants will take the fall if any thing .   Arrests aren&#39;t made because it is not the norm for these types of weird convoluted cases with people that are in high places and well connected.Their money and influence gets them covered up...

<p>I choose the truth for a side.  With how many thousands of people around the world on this goose-chase, why hasn&#39;t anything worthy of an arrest happened yet?  It&#39;s been weeks.  Why is <em>this</em> scandal more important than the <strong>Lolita Express case, where there is FAR more evidence and also children, girls as young as 14 being raped, trafficked  and exploited, and also involving the Clinton&#39;s?</strong>  Like I said, I use critical thinking skills, you apparently do not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s connected. <em>They</em> are looking. The ambitious researchers look at the whole picture - with an <em>open mind.</em> This means they&#39;re willing to consider the Satanic and other occult aspects, even etymology. Nothing should be dismissed until it can be verified as disinfo, via fact checking.</p>

<p>They&#39;re looking at Lolita Express, they&#39;re investigating who took rides on it, they&#39;re looking for links that will tie <strong>everything</strong> together. Pizzagate was just the starting gun, the push that got us all rolling. If you&#39;ve been in this game for longer, sure, you can flaunt your experience and demand elder respect, but it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll get it. Especially if you prioritize some leads over others.</p>

<p>So while some are doing the work, you sit here splitting hairs over what is more important to investigate, without doing any yourself. It&#39;s productive... if you&#39;re getting paid for it. Catch my drift?</p>

<p>WTF are you talking about?  You sound like you think you&#39;re 007.</p>

<p>Right, anyone who thinks there isn&#39;t enough evidence, real evidence... is naturally a shill.  Weak, man.  Very simpleton style thinking.</p>

<p>You are sure there is evidence right now, correct?  I mean, that&#39;s why you&#39;re here so high-and-mighty.  You&#39;ve seen it yourself.  Then why the fuck aren&#39;t you on the phone with the FBI at this very moment?  Why are you wasting time arguing with me, are you a shill perhaps?  Catch my drift?</p>

<p>You&#39;re sure, aren&#39;t you?  You can clearly write.  If it holds water, someone will listen, so why haven&#39;t you made the call?  Send a fax, or email.  What are you waiting for?</p>

<p>PS, I just want to ask.  Say two people know each other enough in their dark underworld to email each other using code words for important topics.  Is there ever really going to be a time someone emails their buddy to say, &quot;yeah, hey George, you left a cum-filled hanky from the ritual satanic child rape we just performed over here, do you want me to just MAIL it back to you?&quot;  Yeah, I&#39;m sure that happens a lot, those terrible people.  </p>

<p>The Lolita Express has a lot of <em>real evidence</em>.  FAA manifests, the conviction of Epstein, 24 phone numbers for Bill Clinton, proof he was on the island on at least several occasions by eyewitnesses, dozens of girls as young as 14 being trafficked and raped <em>by a convicted felon</em>, kept on a private island owned by a billionaire in a foreign country...  &quot;Massages&quot; given by aspiring models on the many plane rides, the young meat provided by a modeling agency and Epstein&#39;s friend, I could go on and on because I studied that one as well.  I did &quot;investigate&quot; this topic.  So far, you have weird art and odd circumstances, and that is it.</p>
