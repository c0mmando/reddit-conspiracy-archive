       "In fact, comets have been observed for far longer in history. The ancient Greeks called them "evil stars," which in Greek is dys evil and astron a star. This is the origin of the modern word disaster. The association of comets with untoward events or prophecies continued as recently as the twentieth century, when Comet Halley made an unusually close rendezvous with earth.[9]

       -Lucifer is also known as a Fallen Star.

       No it doesn't. It comes from the Greek word 'come' meaning 'hair', and denotes a star with a tail.
      </p>
      <p>
       ('Coma', the medical term, is Greek too: "koma" meaning sleep)
      </p>
      <p>
       They've been thought of as omens for centuries, and get a mention in Shakespeare: "When beggars die, there are no comets seen; The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes."
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see the same idea in the Heaven's Gate cult, who thought the Hale-Bopp comet of 1997 was a spaceship and committed suicide in order to be 'taken aboard'.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's by the by. Things are named 'Comet' because comets comeback regularly and spectacularly, so they are a good thing to be remembered for. Just off the top of my head I can think of two newspapers in the UK called 'The Comet' and one wholesale distributor (gone bust now, I think).
      </p>
      <p>
       And Lucifer isn't (or wasn't) a 'fallen star'. The name means 'Light bearer' and is usually applied to Venus as a morning star, heralding the sunrise. Lucifer (as in Satan) was a fallen angel, if you like, but not a fallen star. Big difference.

       Since they were described before being named, disaster is a possible alternative etymological derivation for the word "comet". You probably don't see it on Wikitionary or other lefty etymology sites because of the devilish connection (gotta stamp out all traces of that evil!)

       Also just a simple Google search will tell you that Lucifer is referred to as "Fallen Star" by Christians and non-Christians alike.

       It's a lost cause. I keep telling people to abandon the Satanic angle because it's too "out there" for most. It overwhelms the dismissal threshold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too bad, because that's exactly what the symbologist/sigilizer wants. For it to creep under the radar, right into the subconscious. For it to be accepted by all yet known by none, and worn as a badge of pride by some dissaffected goth type, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole concept is pretty sickening when you do finally accept the true meaning of symbolism under the proper context.

       You mean your tin foil hats?   Conjecture,  speculation,  guess work.   Which is fine except when taken to fanatical witch hunt proportions,  which it is now,  and discrediting all real investigations,  and this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice that for 9/11 credible,  educated,  professional investigators came on board.   Not for pizzagate,  because the standard of evidence needs more substance before serious people will pile in.   Serious pedophile investigators will build on real cases and expand their efforts proportionate to the real world information being actionable within any sane legal system.    They know how to smell a psy op.   And there are also cases of false child abuse accusations to learn from:

       Its typical narrative to discount this and go on a diatribe saying this hurts this sub. When it does not. It's solid evidence. It can't be debunked. No one has been able to.

       Weird symbolic memes ("satanic",  "occult",  "Illuminati" ) have totally invaded mainstream culture/Hollywood/celebrities and do not have clear meanings or tight connections any more.   Every kid in America is reading Harry Potter!!!!

       Marketing people know it and use it accordingly because,  surprise,  it sells,  to one of the single biggest markets out there,  kids (and their doting parents),  who buy stuff based on the symbology that is popular with kids.

       Why don't you take the time to study up on professional investigative procedure?    Why don't you look around and realize that its only a particular kind of demographic that is joining in on this,  and notice that they are infatuated beyond all reasonable criteria,  and that it has consumed a disproportionate portion of their bandwidth,  in a forum that should be concerned about WWIII breaking out,  in a forum that followed tens of thousands of victims of Catholic Church sex abuse with real standards of investigation from a similar victim demographic.   All you have is "air tight" guess work.   Welcome to Jim Jones level of kool aide here.

       Let's get specific.    Show me a kid who is saying anything about pizzagate,  maybe?    Not one?    Then kids lying has nothing to do with this specific situation.   So,  a witchhunt based on handkerchiefs and other symbols,  and that's it.   Oh,  and a lot of guesswork.

       Me:  "You mean your tin foil hats? Conjecture, speculation, guess work. Which is fine except when taken to fanatical witch hunt proportions, which it is now, and discrediting all real investigations, and this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice that for 9/11 credible, educated, professional investigators came on board. Not for pizzagate, because the standard of evidence needs more substance before serious people will pile in. Serious pedophile investigators will build on real cases and expand their efforts proportionate to the real world information being actionable within any sane legal system. They know how to smell a psy op. And there are also cases of false child abuse accusations to learn from:

       Its typical narrative to discount this and go on a diatribe saying this hurts this sub. When it does not. It's solid evidence. It can't be debunked. No one has been able to.

       Weird symbolic memes ("satanic", "occult", "Illuminati" ) have totally invaded mainstream culture/Hollywood/celebrities and do not have clear meanings or tight connections any more. Every kid in America is reading Harry Potter!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Marketing people know it and use it accordingly because, surprise, it sells, to one of the single biggest markets out there, kids (and their doting parents), who buy stuff based on the symbology that is popular with kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you take the time to study up on professional investigative procedure? Why don't you look around and realize that its only a particular kind of demographic that is joining in on this, and notice that they are infatuated beyond all reasonable criteria, and that it has consumed a disproportionate portion of their bandwidth, in a forum that should be concerned about WWIII breaking out, in a forum that followed tens of thousands of victims of Catholic Church sex abuse with real standards of investigation from a similar victim demographic. All you have is "air tight" guess work. Welcome to Jim Jones level of kool aide here."

       This is a conspiracy forum,  where we look for truth dude,  its not a place for people for personal problems and a chip on their shoulder.   You claim to be an expert on CPS etc.   but won't even acknowledge a case where 30 adults were wrongly convicted by their own kids who had been coached to believe in lies,  and gave false testimony.     Enjoy your witchhunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will continue to search for real investigations vs witch hunts.    If they can find a single kid or other single case linked to pizzagate,  I will eat my hat.   You are being played,  sir.    Mark my words,  this pizzagate will backfire against all real truth seekers.

       What happened in the 80's is still relatively current,  it should not be discounted in light of the fact there are no children speaking up in regards to pizzagate,  but only some creepy leads that started on wikileaks.    Don't forget Assange himself is the target of false pedophile charges and dubious rape charges,  based also on sketchy material.

      </p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you look into the original Jordan report there's about 6 or 7 interviews in a row that end up being thrown out because the kids can't keep their stories together.

       I gave as much evidence of a conspiracy as the OP did here. Pizzagate hasn't proven anything, except that it now has diverted all attention away from

        Wikileaks, what has become of Assange, and the Clinton Foundation corruption.

       That's quite a leap.  Out of the many thousands of revelations wikileaks uncovered, over a period of ten years and just prior to the election, you're going to assume it was pizzagate that led to his detention.

       Yeah because of what this has uncovered. They kill people and blackmail them to keep this pedophile ring hidden. Didn't you watch the 60 mins episode about elite govt officials in Britain abusing kids, and killing them if needed to protect themselves?  What's so hard to believe about govt elites molesting kids? I mean

        surely if it happens there in England

       Of course there are real revelations.  Are you familiar with the Epstein's Lolita Express?  That has LOADS of REAL evidence involved, including witnesses, a convicted felon, an island that had the Clinton's, but wouldn't you know it, no one cares, and those that should are instead spending all of their time pouring over weird art and photos in this bullshit pizzagate thing.

       I've been linking trump and Clinton together over Jeffry Epstein for the past year. And actually everybody on this sub does care about that. It's just old news you gotta keep up, I agree people get lost looking at silly pictures which will never amount to 'evdicence'.
      </p>
      <p>
       But how can you dismiss pizzagate when this is exactly what pizzagate is exposing? esp the same circle of government rich elite. Which is what I sent the link To the 60mins thing about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not the one who said people making these claims would have been burned by witches by people like you. That seems more childish (or just dumb mob mentality), then me saying your a witchburner which you yourself said

       I don't have to admit anything.  I'm not obsessed with it as you are.  What you have are suspicions, suppositions.  I've not seen one piece of pizzagate "evidence" that convinces me of anything except these people are weird, and like weird art.  It's all wild speculation like you've displayed here.

       The "weird art" is borderline child porn. They have bands perform at their venue that allude to sex with kids in their lyrics and imagery. You're tripping if you think they're "just weird".

       I have no doubt whatsoever that the Clinton Foundation is corrupt, and a money laundering scheme.  Read about Haiti alone, and the many millions stolen from the natural disaster victims there.  But I have to disagree with your statement.  The american public has a short attention span.  This pizzagate shit is designed to divert attention, before allowing the Clinton Foundation and wikileaks
       <em>
        other thousands of revelations

       to fade into the background.

       No, that's not true at all.  Arrests haven't been made because there is no evidence.  If dozens or hundreds of children are being raped by hundreds or thousands of powerful people, involving thousands of others, it will come out.  In fact, it probably would have by now.

      <p>
       That is what most people don't realize. We have been conditioned to think that pedophiles are some isolated sickos who act alone, but what we're slowly coming to realize is that pedophilia is actually a sexual orientation that is prevalent in society and especially among the elite.

       Look at history, all of the aristocrats would marry women age 14 and younger. It's part of their culture to have the youngest, most innocent sex partners.

       US laws (18 and over) and all of that is not meant to protect children, but put there to stop commoners from practicing the same sexual preference as the elites.

       Look into the Lolita Express.  There is a boatload of real evidence, including manifests, witnesses, a conviction, the Clinton's and royalty, etc  etc, but instead of investigating
       <strong>
        that
       </strong>
       child abduction and rape of girls as young as 14, (Epstein is a convicted felon, and Bill visited his island numerous times...) people are instead interested in this BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt whatsoever the elite take part in eyes wide shut style shit.  Pizzagate has yet to come close to proving anything remotely as interesting as the Lolita express case.

       there is still nothing but weird art and wild accusations... I don't think so , there is more . There is evidence that we have not seen and probably won't be released . They cannot release child pornography . It's illegal. So any of it in the Wikileak dumps won't be seen by the public. It is a crime and it would be called evidence.

       Of course, because the government couldn't possibly be implicated because they are all pure and holy and above corruption, and if this were real it would have been over by now. The good people would have done the right things.

       Do you even hear yourself? Or know where you are? People are jailed for days for being mere suspects in cases far, far below this caliber. It's guilty until proven innocent, UNLESS you have a position of power, in which case it's always innocent.

       I don't see how you can admit the Clinton Foundation needs looking into, but you can't see how the NCMEC (organized originally by Bill Clinton) and CPS have been colluding with the FBI (who don't track missing children statistics, hmm wonder why), and that that's the big connection behind pizzagate.

       Tens of thousands of people, not only in this country, but around the entire world
       <strong>
        are pouring over every single minuscule aspect of every single email.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I absolutely do say that if anything damning enough were to come to light, (and it would happen fairly soon, wouldn't it? There are only so many emails.) arrests would be made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supposing there is real evidence, the news would hit social media in a hot second, people would freak the fuck out and demand an arrest.  Just look at how unhinged people are right now!  I saw one poster who doxxed someone, came here and said, "Look (so and so) has a second cousin that's an anesthesiologist!  So naturally, the implication is that must mean the relative knocks out small children so elite can have a fuck fest.  Others have shown someone wearing a pendant of two intertwined hearts, so obviously that woman likes "hotdog" every full moon!

       If there is some undeniable evidence, then why haven't
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       called the cops, or the FBI?  It's an easy thing to do.  Faxing your evidence would work also.  Email.  You'll be a big hero for causing the first arrest.  Stop what you are doing, and do it right now.  It'll be world wide news.  I'm quite serious, why haven't YOU called, if kids are being fucked all over, and you've got the PROOF????????????  After all, " People are jailed for days for being mere suspects..."  Alephantis is not an elite untouchable, is he?  Many of the people implicated are not.

       I think the point was they could have the pictures hanging on their walls and deniers would still say it's not enough evidence.

      <p>
       So no gay clubs don't need to have pictures of that because they wouldn't even believe it for child abusers.

        no matter how creepy their art is like that statue crawling upside in the position of that guy dalmer murdered

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents' suburban homes."

      <p>
       I find it hard to believe that people can't connect these dots. Sure /conspiracy goes over board and claims little stars in the corner are proof they worship Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at what point does the defense of these places have to have to much defense?  My point, there is mounting evidence of this. Not of them abusing children, yet.
But when or if they do, all of the art work and those emails will be then looked at as an obvious sign.
      </p>

       I just hope the media doesn't completely cover this shit up. Like they did in England

       Some people don't know the history, behaviors  and  narrative of sex/ slave/Santanist    freaks and their cohorts throughout society .. We see and hear allegations , from victims and witnesses of Child pornography , child trafficking , kidnapping , Pedophilia , Satan worship ... and these groups of perverts are usually connected to great wealth  and political  power , etc,.. these NWO perverts write about their exploits , fantasies and 'doublespeak' ideas  about 'sexuality' and how pedophilia has to be accepted , it's a 'choice ' and all the usual lies they tell to make it seem not so bad (but it is bad and always will be to normal people) . ...and their  dreams of world domination in books , lectures , etc. There is  a lot of evidence to suggest there are groups of wicked people who like to do evil things to little children and babies.. the most vulnerable of society ... and they band together thinking they are not wicked , and brag about stuff they do ( buy and showcase weird suggestive sadistic 'art ' , involvement with spiritual practices that are Satanic , ritualistic , secretive. . Only  , in the real world, what they like to do , is illegal. Morally, ethically , spiritually. The entire disgusting thing. IT's almost like an Us and them.. ugh.People who are repulsed and angered at those  who exploit children sexually are appalled at any suggestion or hint of it , be it  flagrant 'art' , music , or code , symbols , anything that is catered to the child abusers glorifying their perversions . This is the worst of the worst. Apparently , imo , there are things , peculiar things, that the wealthy and privileged feel they can do and get away with .It is seemingly  so common,  they  even find groups of like minded folk to engage in their heinous behavior with . Generally these people don't get caught and if they have allegations against them , they usually can survive it because so many are complicit in their crimes by covering them up.  Low level guys or participants will take the fall if any thing .   Arrests aren't made because it is not the norm for these types of weird convoluted cases with people that are in high places and well connected.Their money and influence gets them covered up... They usually have several allies , in various positions , law enforcement, local and federal government ,  or justice dept  See the Franklin cover up.
