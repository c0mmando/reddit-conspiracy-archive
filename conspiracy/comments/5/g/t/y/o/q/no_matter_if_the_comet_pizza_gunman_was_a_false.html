Either way, it generated some good clean exposure.  Pizzagate may be true or false, but the more eyes on it the better so we can figure it out and put it to bed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PizzaGate is about people looking for conspiracies every place they can get them, and then being supported by people to push political agendas.</p>

<p>The MSM didn&#39;t lie about how the election was going, the pollsters did a bad job and did not correctly predict the mood of the country.</p>

<p>Also, how is it that conspiracy fans will eat up any news trying to conform PizzaGate with any URL, but every reputable media outlet is incorrect. Isn&#39;t it much easier for it to be fake and people pushing an agenda against liberals to keep conservatives in power than it is for every media outlet to collude to cover up some insanely huge conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok here is a point you have to realize. Real or fake, this is not a left vs right thing, it is a wtf people abusing and killing children or not thing! There is enough gross creepy artwork, questionable money, emails  and odd behavior to warrent an investigation. Don&#39;t confuse this with the conservatives trying to push their agenda by trying to blame certain liberal figureheads for a problem that is spread through all aspects of elite society. From religious figures to sports stars the number of cases currently under way over the same thing is in the thousands across the world. What we see here is likely only the tip of the iceburg... Or possibly a dead end though regardless these horrible things are happening every day. Human trafficking and child abuse are real problems not just a conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>The PizzaGate conspiracy is highly politicized in order to throw suspect against Hillary&#39;s campaign. It is still going on because once enough people become interested in any specific conspiracy it will continue to live on indefinitely. Between confirmation bias and distrust of media, it becomes something that is impossible to stop. The most popular conspiracies will continue on forever, it&#39;s just a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there isn&#39;t a correlation between Trump supporters and PizzaGate supporters? Or is it just that the same group has a propensity for believing any bullshit they read on the internet? </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not saying pedophilia isn&#39;t a problem, but come the fuck on. This was just a huge thing to attack hillary, and I&#39;m not standing by her anymore but why are all conspiracies on here against liberals? You have a billionaire in the white House who had to do a lot of questionable deals to get where he is and there is complete silence on this sub for anything that might be against trump. </p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t y&#39;all looking into Trump&#39;s business dealings with foreign leaders while president elect? There is a conspiracy already out in the open but since y&#39;all support trump it&#39;s not a conspiracy.</p>

<p>However, I personally researched the Pizzagate links from the first 4chan and Reddit threads showing the connections between the DC emails from Podesta et al and Comet Ping Pong &amp; Besta Pizza (before Besta changed their logo, before the Instagrams &amp; websites went offline, which is suspicious in itself. If there is nothing incriminating why hide/change it?). No matter how you look at it, it&#39;s wierd. I believe there should be an actual/official investigation by law enforcement, and I support journalists who do earnest research, and I don&#39;t think stating that is a crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d rather have journalists who are wrong but have journalistic integrity than media that has no sources and posts whatever they want without any oversight. </p>

<p>There is a conapiracy to create a distrustful, ill-informed electorate in this country. Conservative politicians are happy with people believing anything bad about liberals, no matter the truth. Our enemies are trying to break this country apart in a new information-age cold war. But because the polls were wrong in a few swing states (popular vote polls were pretty accurate) now the entire media is wrong and we are free to believe anything we want no matter the truth? </p>

<p>Eastern European fake news is not real because the polls were wrong? Russians aren&#39;t trying to influence the election for the politician they believe is more lenient to them because the polls were wrong? Global warming isn&#39;t real because the polls were wrong? Millions of illegal residents voted for hillary because the polls were wrong? You can&#39;t just say whatever you want with no basis in fact and have it be true, and you hate the media for trying to come up with an objective truth.</p>
