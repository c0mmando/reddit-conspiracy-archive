    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>how do you know what the false color on the infra red was calibrated to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not know, I am simply making a logical deduction based of the images of the infrared and thermal cameras. There is nothing to suggest the impact was in fact a nuclear explosion, especially when also taking into account the thermal image. Had it been a nuclear detonation, the thermal camera would have picked up much higher temperatures (tens of millions of degrees) than what was seen in the video.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well considering the mass and velocity of the upper stage, yes it is possible for the resulting impact to throw up a cloud of dust and debris that would affect the infrared. The equipment that captured the collision was meant to search for a presence of water on the lunar surface, it is no surprise it was not able to properly film the impact of a spacecraft.</p>

Thus the usa discovered nukes give off a massive emp blast and testing was moved underground (litterally). Or so ive heard. Also that it basically looked like the death star explosion from the original star wars before the adding in of the fire ring effects for the special edition. I too also heard that we nuked the moon, and that it &#39;continued to vibrate in such a way&#39; that the siesmic data was used to make projected models of the moons interior...

<p>Assuming your approximations are correct, 345 degrees Celsius is orders of magnitude lower than what is expected from a nuclear detonation. So where is all the missing heat?</p>

<p>how can 1 ton of mass at 5000mph do that without exploding?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh please, scattered heat is the cause for a descrepancy of several millions of degrees? For the last time, a nuclear explosion would have shown up differently on the thermal camera. The violent impact of the Centaur upper stage (9000 km/h weighing almost 5000 lbs) sent debris and dust on the lunar surface flying in all directions due to conservation of energy. The impact event also makes more sense because a nuclear explosion would have heated the surface enough for it to not disappear almost instantly.</p>

Solid impacts send debris to the side (left), whereas hollow impacts result in a high-angle ejecta plume (right). The LCROSS impact was an emptied rocket and acted like a hollow projectile. Figure shows parts of a high-speed image sequence from experiments made at the Ames Vertical Gun Range at NASA&#39;s Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif.

    <div class="md"><p>also i never &quot;see&quot; the impact in this clip ... we are watching slomo video  in both the IR and VIS range ... i can&#39;t even imagine how in 1 frame both go from normal to full field of view ... where is the center? it should expand out from the point of impact right? this tells me that we are not even looking at the point of impact. we are looking at a point near the impact. and suddenly we see our entire field of view blasted with both IR and visible light(maybe, could be all kinds of radiation i have no idea on the specs of the sensors)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it is hard to tell, it is possible the cameras were not pointed at the exact point of impact. But again, the thermal camera footage at 4:04 shows that the temperature does not got above even the highest temperature on the side of the crater.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t remember when it was reported to have happened, but I do remember them being surprised when they found that upon impact, the moon &quot;rang like a bell.&quot; Just looked it up, I found no mention of nukes, but a kinetic missile was used in 2009.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering how many times <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_nuclear_explosion">they detonated a nuke in space</a> I would be naive to think they didn&#39;t secretly hit the moon with one. Although I remember reading Carl Sagans letter to the govt highly encouraging them not to do it</p>
