       The fallen angel bloodlines are called Reptilian Shape shifters. They are reptilian and can change into human form when they needed. They eat children, organs, and drink blood, which they think helps them gain more power. They sacrifice children in the name of their God, which is Lucifer.  They are high in power such as politicians, Royals, and Hollywood so they can destroy the world while in power. These fallen angels want to spread so much evil in hopes the Messiah will return, which means Lucifer will too.

       Phil Schneider worked for the government and helped built the underground bunkers and while doing so he witnessed aliens and human experiments. He saw humans in cages drugged breeding with animals to produce a new species called hybrid. In these last days, the Bible says it will be a time of mass hybridization and the mixture and corruption of human DNA by fallen angels, also known as "Aliens."

      <p>
       These Reptilians/fallen angels steal our children, rape them, eat them, conduct experiments on them, enslave them, and use them as sacrifices in satanic rituals. They like to hurt our children most because children are the closet to God. Children are born pure and yet have experience the world of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Jesus said, "Let the children alone, and do not hinder them from coming to Me; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." Matthew 19:14
      </p>
      <p>
       "Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all." Mark 10:15
      </p>
      <p>
       "See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of My Father who is in heaven." Matthew 18:10

       Alright, only posting this cuz it's relevant for anyone interested in this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, lizard dudes were a big part of this mess. I guess they're called Draco. Some other aliens called Mantid's were also heavily involved too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those two races were the primary builders and controllers of this slave system we got on Earth. Its a long story, but basically they setup everything we think of as the bloodline families, Illuminati, whatevs to run shit for them down here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used past tense because very recently things have changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Draco were forced to leave this system, with their tails between their legs I might add. And the 4-5 other races involved here have been forced to make a choice to fix the problems they've made here or go the way of the Draco.
      </p>
      <p>
       This caused major disruptions in all levels of the system and a huge power vacuum at the top the NWO/Illuminati/Cabal/Deep State whatever you want to call it.  It's broken into like 5 factions who are fighting for control and some for survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humanity has an opportunity to break the cycle and for real change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that's my two cents, thanks.

       Greenlight is a bit odd and some of the stuff seems to be more "Fantasy/RP related than anything. I have read and would like to add that there are supposedly two factions of Reptilians and the Draco are the bad ones and live off planet. Again, this is just stuff I've picked up over the years.

       Well, not really. From what I've been able to piece together it was an "AntiGrav" accident which is usually how they come down. We've known about the Reptilians for a while now, we don't interest them in any way and they pretty much stay away from us. Supposedly there's a treaty with them. Some very interesting stuff is from the "Lacerta Interview" based on what I've been able to summize is the "Cigar Shaped" craft are Reptilian and the rounder ships (some are ours) are Grays, anything triangular is ours with the odd shaped ones being "Insectoid" which reside in the seas. Some say that eons ago our species was engineered by the grays for what I don't know and the Reptillians actuall evolved from dinosaurs and have been around for ages. It's all very fascinating but unfortunately you and I will never know the truth :/

       So the triangle UFOs are ours? I read where 6 insectoids were trying to escape out from the ocean and over Antarctica and were escorted back in by the triangle shape ones. I guess Shit is getting so bad they want to leave this planet but the triangle ones are keeping them here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so crazy how as of right now there is a war going on between aliens right here on our planet lol ive read many bunkers are being blown up and destroyed which usually causes an earth quake. Maybe all these earth quakes lately are underground bunkers being cleared out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if the truth behind this war will ever surface to public and be part of history?

       The end touches base on the new technology that is out there which is mind blowing. Teleporting, pushing a button and you're able to create anything you want with no cost. (Kinda like winning the lottery) the elites are holding this technology back from us because they want to keep us enslaved and below them as peasants.

       I watched the video, this guy seems more of the type that hangs out with the "Greenlight" crowd, fantasy stuff. We don't go on conquest missions with the Draco lol or have a "Dark Fleet" this is just someone's imagination running away with them in my opinion.

       Wow! Thanks man. I appreciate the info. Ill research the other alien races you listed. Do you think by Trump winning we broke the cycle and humans can take their planet back? I never knew the extent to all the alien involvement until now. During election time I campaigned hard for Trump bc I knew they were evil and Satanic. After researching the subject it's wayyyy beyond just a satanic person, they are from another planet.

       Oh boy, okay, I'll see if I can sum up some of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, yes, the Trump phenomenon is a HUGE part of us breaking their system.  He was a tool playing his part to help Clinton get in and it backfired spectacularly.  He was NOT suppose to win.  This freaked them out big time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also huge right now is pizzagate and Standing Rock. Both of those are also breaking their system.
      </p>
      <p>
       History and such:
      </p>
      <p>
       In our not too distant past there was some cataclysmic event, a reset of humanity if you will. Caused by what seems to be a cosmic war that some got our planet involved in and an impact of some sort at the end of the Pleistocene epoch triggering the Younger Dryas period and the massive and nearly instantanious global flooding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somewhere during this calamity the Draco showed up.  They offered to help us kick start our civilization again and against better judgment we accepted. They did help, but also enslaved us.  It took until now for other entities around the universe to figure out what's been happening here and to come help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is what's happening now :)
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not going yo fix all our problems, but they are helping clear things up there, so we can have an honest chance to fix things down here without the interference from off worlders. Of course its all much more complicated and nuanced than what I've said here, but this is a general overview.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, many of the underground bases have been cleared out, but not all.

       Oh ok.. I see, They wanted to repeat history? I feel like their plan was to bring chaos to trick us into giving into the NWO. Kinda like they did in the past with the flood?
      </p>
      <p>
       We kinda rewrote history, which I think is confusing to a lot of people. If Hillary won we would of been on the right track to the end times, revelations. Just shows you how powerful our God is compared to their God.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm looking to forward to seeing how Trump deals with all this, as far as the bunkers and draining the swamp.
      </p>
      <p>
       What an amazing time to be alive and be part of history.

       Did you all ever see the movie Midnight Meat Train?  Sometimes things I read here so remind me of that movie...  There are some very spooky similarities from what I remember ...I think I will watch it again to see why it still resonates with me to this day...

       No don't think I have seen that movie is it good?  The movie I am referring too has a reporter who continues to take pictures of  murder/butchering in a subway train and well  the end is very interesting but now I am going to re-watch it with a more keen eye. ;)

       they're already here dude, the last gate has closed and they're coming... this is what they're trying to say: the pizza represent the earth and the Ouroboros - the cycle of life. the gate is also earth/the heart/the holy grail. they aim to decapitate the snake and bring the end to all creation... they think they do it in the name of good, but they have been blinded by the religion that has decieved them.
      </p>
      <p>
       they do it because they think the universal system is broken, and they think they will reach 'heaven' only through breaking the cycle through strength, power, and persistence - not realising that the city of 'god' actually lies between 'light' and 'dark' and that the system they so desperately aim to break will be everything's undoing, for without good there is no evil, and without evil there is no good! 'heaven' lies in self realisation - found only within the harmony of the two. but they are weak, and foolish.
      </p>
      <p>
       people need to wake up! love is our only salvation. for both the mother (earth), and the father(you).
      </p>
      <p>
       i might consider it a good thing... but then why would they blind the masses from the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       ever heard the saying 'rid yourself of all desires' our desires are what keep us strong -rid myself of mine, and it made me weak - and henceforth bought the apocalypse.

       I think if it wasn't for these fallen angels, we wouldn't have so much pizzagate.. these reptilians have no emotion and they feel as they gain power by killing children. 
 We definitely need to love more.. love is the key to God

       Yeah I agree. He spreads a lot of truth to get our trust so when needed he can speak to change our gears.

       What pissed me off was the other day he told his viewers Julian is safe in the Embassy and just busy working on Germany leaks. Which is totally bs! No way that man is still locked up in the Embassy without telling us he was ok.

       You're born, live, and die in a world that you do not completely understand with an identity you do not totally comprehend that searches for creators and higher powers it can only imagine and never absolutely prove.

       I'm not rude.  I've been studying the elites and how evil and destructive they are and I connect them with luciferian. If you type luciferian and elites in google. Google says that's their religion. 
Im just protective when it comes to my country, not rude.

       As an aside point that I think wouldn't hurt to account for, the Bible actually states that we are all
       <em>
        born
       </em>
       with/into sin. It may say babies are innocent and the like, but they bear the sins of their fathers (quite literally meant in the Bible see:Adam) which is precisely why it says Jesus is the only way to heaven. So the "they are closest to God" argument could be felled fairly quickly.

       Hello I am probably setting myself up for a verbal attack but I think this needs to be said.....you obviously have an opinion and don't seem to be shy stating it (even if it means your comment karma is way in the - ) Why not quit with the derp comments and your comments of filth and mental superiority and actually use your intellect to help others constructively?   You must be here for a reason (most likely the same reason we are all here)...be part of a solution not the continuation of the problem that has so successfully divided us.

       I looked at your comments and realized that you are an intellectual thinker and hoped to appeal to that side of you...  There are so many negatives commenters and so many newly awoken thinkers and they must learn just like we did what they believe and what they find of interest to them (we all have our niches).  But whatever that is... I look at it as opening our minds and considering the possibilities even those that would be otherwise discounted as crazy or nonsensical.  If we had said that the world was round some time ago we would have been laughed at or persecuted (no offence to Flat Earther's).  If we used herbs or knowledge to heal we would have been labeled witches.  Open minds and calm debate we all can learn and be productive without finger pointing and ridicule.  Thank you by the way for your reply!
