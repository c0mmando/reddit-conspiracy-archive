       This song is a glimpse into the mindset of the self proclaimed "elites" and how they view us. This song is as bone chilling and terrifying as it is beautifully ironic...especially today. Enjoy and discuss.

       I am a huge fan of Tool and APC. Tool has gotten a semi bad reputation for being mainstream. I'd say it's because they make amazing music. Most people dont look too much into their lyrics, but when you do it takes you straight down a rabbit hole all of it's own.

       Thanks for sharing. I have heard that one before, it's also really good. I tend to listen to the original more. It seems to have a better over all flow in my opinion. Either way, Maynard never disappoints.

       Societal angst about people in power has been around a little longer than Maynard however and he'd be the first to tell you that.  Why does no one ever really look into the lyrics of RATM or SOAD?  Much more politically poignant.  Maynard is Maynard and hopefully he's crawled out the other side into his shadow to move on to 46&amp;2 by now. :-)

       I see what you did there haha and I couldn't tell you why more people don't look into those bands lyrics, just that I was raised by someone whose favorite bands was Tool so I grew to like them a lot. Certainly no one is saying Maynard is the only one with answers but he is responsible (along with the other members) for producing quality music with quality lyrics that opened countless peoples eyes.

       That's how I understand it too but maybe I'm missing something. As far as I know the theory is that currently we all have 46 chromosomes and 2 sex chromosomes with only one expressed aka our gender. Some say that the next step of evolution is when humans begin to "express" genetically both sex chromosomes. Ending the dualistic nature of male, female gender and moving on from 46 and 2 to 47 chromosomes. Not saying I agree by any means but that's the theory as I understand it. Correct me if I'm wrong

       We have 44 + 2 sex chromosomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people do have odd numbers of chromosomes as well but that does not always work out for that person, say 47 or 45.  The universe creates everything in pairs and rarely ever odd numbers.

       Ah gotcha. Makes sense. So what would be different about a human with 46+2 chromosomes compared to what humans have currently? I mis understood the lyrics as "46 and 2 are enemies" as him saying the "2" sex chromosomes are a lesser as far as evolution. But since we currently have 44 not 46 I'm a bit confused by the lyrics. This is why I love tool though plenty of conversation to be had about the songs meanings

       Haha right! Or how they use the golden ratio in the song Lateralus.

       "Counting between pauses, the syllables in Maynard James Keenan's vocals during the verses form the first few Fibonacci numbers, ascending and descending. For instance, in the first verse: "Black, then, white are, all I see, in my infancy. Red and yellow then came to be." correspond with the beginning of the sequence: (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)."

       So I did a little research to clear it up. Sounds like the theory is that we currently have 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes and the next step of evolution is when humans have 46 autosomes. Hence the lyrics "46 and 2 are enemies"because the 2 sex chromosomes are "holding us back" from the next step of 46 autosomes. Not sure I agree but interesting none the less.

       The lyrics for Vicarious are pretty interesting and fits theories about parasitic entities controlling reality:
The universe is hostile
So impersonal
Devour to survive
So it is 
So it's always been
We all feed 
On tragedy
It's like blood to a vampire

       IDK where I read it. Seems somewhat plausible. He supposedly found out some time before 'In utero' , leaving hints about it on the cover and in lyrics. He locked himself days before he died , with a mania like ' they are out to get me' ... You know about investigation into Courtneys part in his death?
