<p>Don&#39;t fret precious I&#39;m here, step away from the window 
Go back to sleep </p>

<p>Lay your head down child 
I won&#39;t let the boogeyman come </p>

To the rhythm of the war drums </p>

<p>Pay no mind to the rabble 
Pay no mind to the rabble </p>

<p>Head down, go to sleep 
To the rhythm of the war drums </p>

<p>Pay no mind what other voices say 
They don&#39;t care about you, like I do, like I do 
Safe from pain and truth and choice and other poison devils, 
See, they don&#39;t give a fuck about you, like I do. </p>

<p>Just stay with me, safe and ignorant, 
Go back to sleep 
Go back to sleep </p>

<p>Lay your head down child

<p>I&#39;ll be the one to protect you from 
Your enemies and all your demons </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be the one to protect you from 
A will to survive and a voice of reason </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be the one to protect you from 
Your enemies and your choices son 
They&#39;re one in the same 
I must isolate you 
Isolate and save you from yourself </p>

<p>Swayin to the rhythm of the new world order and 
Count the bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums</p>

<p>The boogeymen are coming 
The boogeymen are coming </p>

<p>Keep your head down, go to sleep, to the rhythm of a war drums</p>

<p>Stay with me 
Safe and ignorant

    <div class="md"><p>I am a huge fan of Tool and APC. Tool has gotten a semi bad reputation for being mainstream. I&#39;d say it&#39;s because they make amazing music. Most people dont look too much into their lyrics, but when you do it takes you straight down a rabbit hole all of it&#39;s own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing. I have heard that one before, it&#39;s also really good. I tend to listen to the original more. It seems to have a better over all flow in my opinion. Either way, Maynard never disappoints.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Societal angst about people in power has been around a little longer than Maynard however and he&#39;d be the first to tell you that.  Why does no one ever really look into the lyrics of RATM or SOAD?  Much more politically poignant.  Maynard is Maynard and hopefully he&#39;s crawled out the other side into his shadow to move on to 46&amp;2 by now. :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you did there haha and I couldn&#39;t tell you why more people don&#39;t look into those bands lyrics, just that I was raised by someone whose favorite bands was Tool so I grew to like them a lot. Certainly no one is saying Maynard is the only one with answers but he is responsible (along with the other members) for producing quality music with quality lyrics that opened countless peoples eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s how I understand it too but maybe I&#39;m missing something. As far as I know the theory is that currently we all have 46 chromosomes and 2 sex chromosomes with only one expressed aka our gender. Some say that the next step of evolution is when humans begin to &quot;express&quot; genetically both sex chromosomes. Ending the dualistic nature of male, female gender and moving on from 46 and 2 to 47 chromosomes. Not saying I agree by any means but that&#39;s the theory as I understand it. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have 44 + 2 sex chromosomes.</p>

<p>Some people do have odd numbers of chromosomes as well but that does not always work out for that person, say 47 or 45.  The universe creates everything in pairs and rarely ever odd numbers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah gotcha. Makes sense. So what would be different about a human with 46+2 chromosomes compared to what humans have currently? I mis understood the lyrics as &quot;46 and 2 are enemies&quot; as him saying the &quot;2&quot; sex chromosomes are a lesser as far as evolution. But since we currently have 44 not 46 I&#39;m a bit confused by the lyrics. This is why I love tool though plenty of conversation to be had about the songs meanings</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha right! Or how they use the golden ratio in the song Lateralus. </p>

<p>&quot;Counting between pauses, the syllables in Maynard James Keenan&#39;s vocals during the verses form the first few Fibonacci numbers, ascending and descending. For instance, in the first verse: &quot;Black, then, white are, all I see, in my infancy. Red and yellow then came to be.&quot; correspond with the beginning of the sequence: (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8).&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I did a little research to clear it up. Sounds like the theory is that we currently have 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes and the next step of evolution is when humans have 46 autosomes. Hence the lyrics &quot;46 and 2 are enemies&quot;because the 2 sex chromosomes are &quot;holding us back&quot; from the next step of 46 autosomes. Not sure I agree but interesting none the less.</p>
