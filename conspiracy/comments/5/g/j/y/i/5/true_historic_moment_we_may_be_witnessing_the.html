There&#39;s no life without clean water.<br/>
 <br/>
From the <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/u-s-veterans-form-human-shield/">article</a>:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A steady stream of U.S. military veterans continued to pour into the Standing Rock protest camps over the weekend, with our sources on the ground estimating nearly 5,000 vets already there, and more arriving throughout the night to take part in the “Veterans Stand for Standing Rock” movement.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;What you do to the water protectors you do to the United States Constitution. We are sworn to uphold and protect the United States Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And they’re saying listen, if you wanna burn the United States Constitution, you have to go through us. It’s quite a brave and amazing act that’s never happened in the history of the United States, that two thousand veterans just said you know what? Shoot at us first.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
In addition, as we previously reported, the Morton County sheriff’s department has threatened anyone bringing supplies to Standing Rock with a $1,000 fine. As if brutalizing and beating non-violent protestors wasn’t enough, Kirchmeier’s goons now look to create a human rights crisis in the below freezing condition.<br/>
 <br/>
For many of the veterans, including Sanderson, an Iraqi war vet, the battle over DAPL isn’t a simple environmental issue, as he believes that he is standing on the right side of history.<br/>
 <br/>
“In my prior deployment, I really feel like I was being utilized in the same way the troops are being utilized here,” Sanderson told Vice. “To protect American interests, whether fossil fuel, natural gas, pipeline. It’s all the same, and it’s the wrong way forward.”  </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <br/>
<strong>It&#39;s an awakening. Thousands of ex-military forces gathering to defend the environment against the Globalist Conspiracy. That&#39;s unprecedented!</strong><br/>
 <br/>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a private location when it&#39;s closed. Or how about when it has private parties? </p>

<p>I do agree it could be in a &quot;hidden&quot; location. But if someone finds a hidden secret there is no explaining it with nothing but the truth. 
If you disguise it as a legitimate business then it would be easier sway people that it&#39;s a legitimate business. 
It&#39;s like laundering money... you wouldn&#39;t have a illegal business and the name it &quot;Dirty Money&quot; or &quot;I sell drugs&quot;</p>

<p>Except in this case no arms were necessary. I&#39;m all for the right to bear arms, but what we have here is a prime example of how peaceful protest can more aptly achieve victory when you get any wing of the military-industrial-msm-banking complex to split off in support of the People. That is what&#39;s momentous here. American military vets have organized and rebelled before, sometimes armed, sometimes not, but almost always in support of their own military service related issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa now calm down and focus, we are talking about Standing Rock, no?  You say &quot;...in this case, no arms were necessary.&quot;  I&#39;m responding, that is a pretty premature, ignorant, apathetic way to view an incident where police murdered people for protesting.  Sure, the situation appears to be changing for now- but what&#39;s lost when you make offhanded comments like you just did, you tend to minimize the people that suffered and lost their lives due to heavy-handed police brutality.  Perhaps, &quot;in this case,&quot; arms <em>were</em> necessary in preventing unarmed, innocent people from being brutalized- since plans didn&#39;t seem to change until thousands of former military moved in, no doubt packing heat.  How many people were hurt or killed before the police &quot;decided&quot; to back off?  We will never get that true number, but you are totally naive to think that it wasn&#39;t significant.</p>

<p>Now if you want to talk about those other things you mentioned, those are different concepts altogether, totally unrelated to this, and way over your level of comprehension.</p>

<p>The state kowtowing to the will of the people with the money is the issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple resolution. </p>

<p>Lawyer up. </p>

<p>If anyone so much as gets a hangnail in private property, go to court. </p>

<p>Punitive damages, emotional torment, loss of pride, ect..... </p>

<p>The second the bugger does not defend himself, or pulls a no show, it goes to you. </p>

<p>OOOh, and the only way this person is not officially sued for not securing his personal property well enough is if he can provide the police warrent, and this should tell you more, for example, about infrastructure, chain of command, ect. You know, including the policxe officer that was directing the ray of the water cannon at the very moment. </p>

<p>Its the same with a bouncer in a club. The club is private property, the bouncer is clearly employed, so he is allowed to get you out of the club. </p>

<p>But if he takes you to the back and beats you with a tire iron, you have  a lawsuit against him. </p>

<p>Same here. </p>

<p>Sue the dog handlers for a million each. Force them to show their licenses. If they don&#39;t, you have been attacked , on command of a person in this property owners employ, by a private dog. If there is not a license to hold said dog, it could be argued that this dog was emotionally abused, and should be removed from the owners reach, as well as the owner sued for emotional and animal abuse. </p>

<p>LAWYER UP. </p>

<p>Bcause I see a possibility for this property owner to bleed millions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell, It can be challenged, mostly if you go for missuse. </p>

<p>just as an example:</p>

<p>Lets say we are talking about Taser shots. </p>

<p>Normal protocoll would be, one taser shot, in the center mass, shock once, and move in for controll. Shock again only if immediate danger for life and limb. This is when a taser is less lethal. </p>

<p>If I go in, pull the taser, shoot in your eyeball, and then taser you, I have just missused the protocoll, which led to a less then lethal wepon turning lethal. </p>

<p>Same with beanbag rounds. beanbag round from 50 feet? One hell of a bruise, but gets the point across. Beanbag round from less then 50 feet, and lets say, aimed at the head? Lethal. </p>

<p>There are two different sets of guidelines out there. One for the use of non lethal force, one for the use of lethal force. </p>

<p>As an example: </p>

<p>5 year old starts kicking you? </p>

<p>Usage of nonlethal force is ok, but even this is discouraged, if you can&#39;t stop a 5 year old from kicking you you shouzld not be wearing a police uniform. curb stompiung untill the 5 year old stops moving, and then claiming it was resisting arrest: not ok. </p>

<p>The way I would go about prosecuting this would be,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>freedom of information , and similar requests, regarding the issued licenses, certifications, training hours, ect. As an example, if I wanna guard my grillout with tasers, I can&#39;t just simply hand every joe schmoe a taser. I have to make sure these people are licensed, certiufied, and have freshed up their skills. As an example from law, if I defend myself using a firearm, and have a license, it is an entirely different thing then defending myself with an unlicensed firearm. Simply put, grab the number of licensed people, and what they were doing. If I find any people doing things they were not licensed for, ESPECCIALLY if they were private business mercs, or did not have their licenses and mandatory training hours in order, pull them out , make a pile, and prosecute them for operating without a license / certification / ect. If there was someone that did some stupid shit, like not having a license for a beanbag gun, AND firing at heads, charge them for attempted manslaughter. Oh, and unlicensed people operating restricted equipment? we can argue that any injuries resulting from that can be treated like being inflicted by a civillian, with no police protection or company protection what so ever. They may have been near a cop, but that does not make them one. </p></li>
<li><p>Pull the number of ammo used. Simple check. Any gun owner can tell you how many shots his gun has, and how many magazines / clips he has on the range. Then, compare the type of wounds. I would use a simple situation, if the number of projectiles missused ( for example, beanbag rounds fired at the head) is less then 10 %, shit, accidents happen.  If it is above 10 %, we can assume systematic missuse. That means, it has to be checked if the people doing this violated protocoll, training ect. If there are multiple incidents, you can even argue for a forced recertification of the officers involved, and issue punishments on probation. Here, it depends. For example, if more then 10 % of beanbag rounds were fired at spots the training manual did say they should not be fired at, you can say the police used lethal force, and the commanding officer should defend himself for the decision. For the individual tropper / grunt , it would most likely mean a forced recertification, but nothing more. Of course, that would mean we have to document the injuries the protesters sustained, but if you can&#39;t manage that, you are not a protestor, you are an idiot. </p></li>
<li><p>In repeat incidents, like for example, someone advancing and firing at heads, you could argue that an involuntary drug test is needed , to see if the individual was acting under the influence of roid rage, or alcoholism, both of which are rampant in law enforcement circles. Refusal to take the test should mean an immediate dishonorable termination, for acting under the influence, while simply not passing the drug test should be treated as a combined posession / operating weaponry under the influence charge, with a mandatory minimum sentence ( I know, police even if they smoke crack on the job before a use of force incident will not get any sentence, but a guy can dream). </p></li>
<li><p>Superior Officers who were aware of the facts above, like missing licenses, insufficient training, missuse, or so forth, but remained willfully ignorant, can be argued that they need an intimate date with internal investigations. Going through all their shit. If they come out clean, good for them. If not, hell, can&#39;t have bad apples on the force giving honest cops a bad name? And only someone with shit to hide would fear internal investigations. </p></li>
<li><p>I would argue that a company that willfully disregarded license problems, had missing certifications, ect, needs to be brought to heel .I would even argue you can file for removal of their license to operate, even if that means they no lonbger can fullfill their contractual obligations. </p></li>
<li><p>I would leave all the shit like &quot;OOOh, they sprayed water on them in sub zero temperatures&quot; or &quot;An arm was allmost broke&quot; out. I mean, yea, if you go and can actually prove that this was due to missuse of equipment, you have a case, but if you demonstrate, and don&#39;t move if they bring in water cannons, you have to expect some shit like this. </p></li>
<li><p>I would pay special care to see the &quot;uncommon equipment&quot;, and if all the paperwork was fuiled for them correctly. I mean, for example, lets take the rumors a sound cannon was used. I would go for hearing tests, and ear exams, for everyone exposed, and just publish the results. The government offices that do shit like certifiy if something is able to be certified as less then lethal would love to have this data, the bloggers even more so. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope I am not making unreasonable demands, because most of what I am asking for is paperwork. But just talking from experience from the job, if I so much as touch equipment I am not certified for, and something goes wrong, or missuse equipment, I am out of a job, and worse, most likely liable for any damages I caused. The same should go for police, and private security companies. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t even file the paperwork correctly, you deserve wht is coming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you re missing the point that police and private property owners are not allowed to do whatever they like. </p>

<p>Like the night club owner that is allowed to say he does not like this person, get him out of there, this is private property. That is totally protected. </p>

<p>However, my point is, rules are rules. You are only allowed to do this when you have the neccesary paperwork, and follow the law. If you have filled out all of the paperwork, and made sure the measures taken are in compliance with the law, sure, go ahead. 
If you have not filled out the paperwork to be a certified K9 officer/ leader, but instead simply let go of the leash, you should not be treated an iota differently then a thug that let go of his attack rottweiler leash in a public area. If you did so in the vicinity of children, even harsher. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have the weapons license, and have been trained with the weapon, you firing the beanbag round should never have happened in official capacity, so a police oficer who fires a beanbag round without recieving the neccesry training for it should be treated like a common man who does the same, or an officer who violates an order. </p>

<p>The standart is, yes, I respect the fact that this is a private property situation. But private property does not give you the right to do everything you like. </p>

<p>I take it from the approach that if you are on private property, and in the employ of the private property owner, anything you do can be used as the property owner doing it. </p>

<p>So, easily, IF the street was private property, if the bridge was private property, (should be checked immediatelly), the property owner carries full responsibility for what is happening there. </p>

<p>Thus, If the protestors break legs, slip and fall, or do other stuff, you would have to check, when was the last time the property owner de-iced the bridge? Was there salt on the way, or no? </p>

<p>Because if shit like water cannons happened, it can be assumed that yes, it was lawfull, but if the road was over private property, it also can be assumed that the next day, the private property owner send someone out there withn a bucket of salt to at least improcve the conditions. If he didn&#39;t, he is fully responsible for someone slipping there and breaking something. Which can easily cost him more then trhe DAPL nets him. </p>

<p>And this is what I mean. </p>

<p>If you want to argue that being on private property means you can be mowed down with a machine gun, that&#39;s fine. Then, I argue that each of the protestors has the right to sue the property owner for any damages incurred while on the property, that were due to negligence of the property owner. And those hospital bills due to slipping and falling are a terrible fright. </p>

<p>I mean, yes, you can shoo away trespasserts. That is appropriate force. </p>

<p>But we are in america. If you shoo away trespassers, and you use disproportionate force, like, for example, fire on a five year old with a shotgun, or such, then you should be held fully accountable. Private property does not only come with rights, but also with duties, and if you have ways and roads that are public access on your property, or even bridges, one of these duties is to keep them safe for the users. </p>

<p>If you insist on firing beanbag rounds at point blank range as being appropriate force , and operating weapons without being licensed / trained at such, and attack dogs just being brought there without no official oversight, i have to say your defenders of the law should be treated with as much scrutiny as they treat the supposed lawbreakers with.</p>

<p>But when I hear, spraying water in sub zero temperatures, I could think less of &quot;OOOh my god, my right to protest has been culled, help help. &quot; </p>

<p>That kind of thinking is unamerican. </p>

<p>I am thinking of &quot;I wonder if the road was registered for private use only, if it was built with taxpayer money (Otherwise, I would think it as interesting who has been maintaining the road / bridge, and who paid for that...), and that shit freezes, what does that little trick cost in road maintennance costs, and hopefully they sent a dude out there with a bucket of roadsalt to salt that bridge and the road, because otherwise, the police just intentionally damaged private property by covering it in ice, creating hazardous conditions for pedestrians, and the property owner of said insufficiently marked private property neglected his duties as a property owner, and should be held accountable for every injury that was due to slipping. </p>

<p>As I said, if you go anally retentive, be sure you have the law on your side. </p>
