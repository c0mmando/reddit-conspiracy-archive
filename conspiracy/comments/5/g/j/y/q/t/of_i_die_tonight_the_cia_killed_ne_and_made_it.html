    <div class="md"><p>By his post history OP is a young kid looking for attention. Lets look at the facts, He has somehow managed to attain sensitive information on Pizzagate enough that the establishment has tried to kill him and is still attempting to, Also he has somehow evaded multiple attempts and has come to a point where he is able to now post an SOS on reddit. he has stated that you would need certain hacking tools to decrypt the hard drive he has left at his friend Byron.</p>

<p>So some really intelligent hacker type dude who is wanted by establishment hitmen and has evaded attacks has just publicly disclosed where he has left his only copy of the sensitive data (meant to keep him alive).</p>

<p>These trolls irritate the crap out of me. Someone needs to call OP&#39;s parents and tell them to cut off his internet while this pizzagate thing is being uncovered. Pull an assange on this guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the deal, you&#39;re either trolling, going crazy, or in legitimate danger. </p>

<p>If you are trolling, thanks for the laugh.</p>

<p>If you are going crazy,  lay off the conspiracy stuff. It&#39;s fine to open your mind a bit, but spending all day thinking about the man behind the curtain or trying to unravel the web of lies will make anyone crazy. The battle the people on here are trying to fight it a war of inches not yards.</p>

<p>If you are in legitimate danger, post whatever evidence you have. Kill the lights to your house via your breaker box. You have the right to self defense, but that&#39;s on your property. You don&#39;t have the right to attack anyone outside of your house if you are not under attack. Next go into the most secure room in your house that is not your room, office, or family room. After that, ready whatever weapon you may have and lay in wait for any chance you have to protect yourself. Don&#39;t be a victim.</p>

<p>That said. No offense but I feel there&#39;s a very small chance this is legitimate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>first i&#39;d suggest relaxing.  making decisions under duress is problematic.  maybe don&#39;t drink or smoke the herb.  i know, it&#39;s heresy.  lock your doors..make sure you&#39;re safe...relax..maybe get some sleep.  </p>

<p>in the morning when you&#39;re less freaked out, go read up on personal security best practices.  just try to familiarize yourself with the domain.  the ability to keep digital records and move them around in unexpected ways (like on networks you never use, or with machines that you never turn online) is useful.  security cameras are useful, just keep them turned off until you need them if they&#39;re inside.  consider edge devices like cams to be compromised.   relax some more.  get a trusted circle.  restrict your exploitable surfaces.  relax some more.  continue in this fashion, slowly increasing your personal capacity.  also..trust your gut.  and it&#39;s much harder to track people in motion/faces away from cameras/on unusual paths/not always visible from above if that need arises.  cheers.</p>

<p>ps.  dressing like a mormon on missionary is a great way to get people to avoid you, in the event you need privacy.  </p>

<p>The rn, who i dont think even works there, gestured that it was time for me to dye. If i diddnt start yelling at the top of my lungs, they would have killed me quietly and said i grabbed their gun. </p>

<p>You all need to see the security footage. The whole two hours before. Crazy shit was going on. Like the whole time im in the detox room. The entire footage, no edits. I was in the detox room for like 4 hours. It was all a set up and the entire footage shows that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;If I post it, I die. If I don&#39;t post it, I die.&quot; You seem to think you&#39;re going to die either way so why wouldn&#39;t you want to take them down with you?</p>

<p>Not to mention I don&#39;t think these &quot;shadow agents&quot; kill people for what they &quot;know&quot; but for what they can prove. You say you can prove it, but you don&#39;t. And I&#39;m sorry but your lack of spelling and your story of what happened in the hospital lead me to believe that you are crazy. So concerned and scared that &quot;they&#39;re&quot; watching your internet, routing your server, whatever, so you post on reddit... Obviously they would see this if it were true. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry dude, but there is no way this is real. I find it severely hard to believe that the nurses joked about you being killed, because I&#39;m sure the first thing these &quot;shadow agents&quot; do is tell everyone around their victim that they&#39;re going to kill this person. And the screaming and running from security do nothing but provide evidence for the fact that you&#39;re probably crazy. I used to volunteer at an old folk&#39;s home and you know how many of them would scream about people after them, how the nurses are trying to kill them, and do you know why no one ever believed them? Because it wasn&#39;t true, it was all in there head. Now if this threat is real and you&#39;ll die either way, then you&#39;ve got nothing to lose by posting your information...</p>

<p>The problem is that it shows exactly what im talkiing about and i need help out of this situation before i get killed. </p>

<p>These people have guys on &quot;suspended&quot; sentences. They can show up any day or time and send them into jail with you. Then they take care of the problem, which is me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to be clear. My internet is routed through their shit. I can print out the log showing everything i do is routed through the cia dns server. Also, my phone us tapped. I can prove that by downliading an app that shows how many accounts are listed on my device. </p>

<p>Odds are that this post is being deleted my mods or some shit. Also, look at tbe people trying to say im crazy, go to their orofiles. I bet their astroturfers. </p>

<p>I know it sou ds crazy, but this shit is huge. I was not suppose to know. Their going to kill me.</p>
