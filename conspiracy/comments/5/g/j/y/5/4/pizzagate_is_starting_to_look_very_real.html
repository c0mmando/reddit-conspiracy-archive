    <div class="md"><p>Shit&#39;s weirder than fiction. I think those of us who believe know that the evidence is tenuous. But covering your tracks is something these people do for a living. If you follow the leads then too many coincidences add up. And I would rather be wrong about this than just let it get swept under the rug. It&#39;s too evil to be left alone, if true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll wait until we get some more convincing evidence first. Seriously, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but so far we only have some weird coded language in some emails, an unverified list of codewords from 4chan of all places, Alefantis having Instagram pictures of children, and the fact that the logo of a completely different pizza place looks vaguely like a pedo symbol. That&#39;s not a great start guys. It&#39;s honestly kind of embarrassing. Focus on finding better evidence and then maybe more people will get behind your movement.</p>

And then a news outlet like infowars or one of the other myriad sites involved in this fuckfest intentionally changed that to them being actual pictures that he displays in his house to capitalize on pizzagate and bring in ad revenue.

<p>It was referencing the photo of their stuff containing a baby appearing in a magazine with &#39;edibles&#39; in the title. If you actually look at the evidence objectively, instead of assuming pedophilia from the outset, you do not arrive at pedophilia. The only way to read pedophilia into that is by starting at the assumption, and that the assumption is baseless (from made-up 4chan code words), it is unreasonable to start with that assumption.</p>

<p>There is also the thing where the old Besta logo is not proof of anything, it contains a common graphic element, it is not simply the same as the leaked FBI symbolism document. It is also ridiculous to think that a major pedo ring involving the most powerful people in the world would advertise to the common gutter pedo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is totally not trying to help the cover up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Burying your head in the sand by claiming that critical analysis of the evidence is part of a cover-up is an unreasonable position to take. You have to engage critical analysis, you have to throw out the evidence that has been debunked, you cannot cling onto it despite evidence to the contrary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, I agree with the 1st sentence, the Almighty has already won the war - His boundless mercy is what lets thing continue, that people repent of their wickedness - He does not wish that ANY should perish</p>

<p>as far as the rapture goes, look to the parable of the wheat and the tares - clearly says the tares (some translations say darnel - this is a mutant segment that is not edible) will be gathered FIRST to be thrown into the fire, only then is the wheat gathered into His storehouse</p>

<p>that verse about &quot;one will be taken, and one will be left&quot; is misunderstood to mean the &quot;one to be taken&quot; is the one to be saved, it&#39;s the other way around...</p>

<p>It can be hard in some senses to reconcile a loving God (which I believe he is) to the fact that innocent children are hurt and worse. But I pray, I pray every night for these children.

<p>The suffrage of the body is of the moment, with eternal souls, there in lies what these monsters may truly be after.

    <div class="md"><p>It is a trial, to see if mankind as a whole is worthy of His blessings. We have two paths before us. </p>

<p>Allow this to continue until all that is good is extinguished from this world. Allow Satan to rule us through his agents. Allow the perversion of his word and will that is Islam to exist. </p>

<p>Or reject evil and lies and fight for goodness and holiness and brotherly love.</p>

<p>A war is coming. It is chronicled in Revelations. All the actors are there. The Synagogue of Satan, the dragon, Illuminati. The Nicolatians, the Beast, Islam. The Mark of the Beast is the brand of Islam,  the bismillah. </p>

<p><a href="http://bigfaithministries.com/mark-of-the-beast/">http://bigfaithministries.com/mark-of-the-beast/</a></p>

<p>Satan is the great counterfeiter. Islam takes God&#39;s word and twists it into a horrible anti-religion to Christianity. And did you know the Illuminati was founded in 1776? The same year our nation was founded. It is an opposing force to counter freedom and liberty with oppression and servitude. </p>

<p>In the war that is coming, oil plays a part, the world drunk on the wine of Babylon. China is a major player, opposing the USA. The woman with her feet on the moon, a crown of stars, and the wings of an eagle. There will be nukes, and a war in space between satellites. A ground war, and 3 billion dead. It&#39;s all laid out plain as day.</p>

<p>But there is hope. God has a plan and is on our side. I really suggest reading it. Someday soon we will all know it by heart. God has faith in us to make the right choice, we must have faith in him to guide us to victory.</p>

The &quot;Fake Heaven&quot; actually sucks big time. Humans created this Simulation as a playground. They forgot their true nature and eventually believed the Simulation and actual &quot;matter&quot; was real. The Simulation was then hijacked by the &quot;Archons&quot; who are Astral Parasites. The God you pray to does not exist. Time to grow up and understand; This universe is Fake. You live inside a Computer Simulation. Everything is possible in the expanding real universe. But currently you are not in the &quot;Real Universe&quot;. Praying to a fictional god sends energy to the controllers of this Simulation; The Archons. Once again; This is a Closed Simulation. It does not expand. There are set rules and massive limitations programmed into the Matrix. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think agents of evil weren&#39;t present at all those events?  The Crusades were misguided in many ways, but that&#39;s not because the teaching of Bible encouraged such atrocities. As for Salem, hell, the witch burnings might even have been justified if they were doing the garbage to children these modern day monsters are doing. I don&#39;t know if I believe the &quot;offical&quot; narrative anymore. Sodom was probably the same. Evil is real, and sadly you can&#39;t always save everyone once they are touched by it. We must take solace in the fact that if innocents were present in Sodom, which according to the tale not one could be found, that they were delivered to God&#39;s presence and care.</p>

<p>And no, Islam was created and perverted by Satan. They worship him, not the God of Abraham.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this statement gets thrown around enough to make it seem like some kind of catch-phrase.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s Nietzche or what, but I swear, unless you want to elaborate on what you mean by it, stop fucking saying it.  </p>

<p>Because that&#39;s a statement badly in need of explaining--was god like a person, an old dude in the sky with a beard, and something came along and killed him, or he got sick and died?  Or, maybe you&#39;re saying the concept of god, as created by people, has been destroyed, or abandoned, or perverted, or misunderstood or distorted or attacked, or just ran its course and isn&#39;t relevant anymore, or whatever, to the extent that you consider IT dead?  </p>

<p>Or like god is literally a dead guy, like a ghost, but he&#39;s still god, doing god-stuff, only he&#39;s just dead?  </p>

<p>What THE FUCK does &quot;god is dead&quot; mean?   Seriously I insist that you explain, because if you don&#39;t offer some kind of interpretation of that phrase, I have to assume you&#39;re just trolling and I majorly took the bait, hook line and sinker.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t agree that God is the dark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay.  So then if God is not the dark, and darkness most definitely exists (both literally and metaphorically), then God necessarily is not “everything” (can&#39;t be since God is not darkness and darkness definitely exists).  If God is not everything, then God cannot be all powerful, therefore (can&#39;t be since there is something - i.e. darkness - that, not being God, exists <em>outside</em> of the purview of God&#39;s existence and, therefore, ability).  If God is not all-powerful, then that means God simply cannot control certain events.  This God is ultimately an impotent God.</p>

<p>If God is not all powerful, then it stands to reason that there is something that is stronger and more powerful than God.</p>

<p>And what kind of God is that then?  It’s a God “that really <em>means</em> well” but, in the end, is ultimately powerless to help and do anything about the calamities of existence.</p>

<p>That, by definition, cannot be the definition of an “all-powerful” God.  You would agree, I’m sure.  It is a self-contradiction.  God is the very word that we human beings have for <em>“the</em> most powerful” -  “the All”, right?</p>

<p>How can a god that is not all-powerful…win in the end?  It will presumably get bested by that which <em>is</em> all-powerful…right? (or even that which is merely <em>more</em> powerful than it - without needing to be &quot;all&quot; powerful).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you’re saying that not only is God <em>not</em> all-powerful, but that God is also limited to only being one gender to boot?  God is a <em>he?</em>  I’m assuming you mean a <em>human</em> “he”, right?  So you’re saying God is a man in other words.  Right?</p>

<p>How can a <em>human male</em> be in charge of even <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fFdI83m.jpg">the observable entire universe</a>, to say nothing of the infinitely more vast multiverse?</p>

<p>Seems chauvinistic to me, to be honest.</p>

<p>The history you&#39;re aware of is but the tiniest blip in the radar of humanity&#39;s true existence on this planet.  That other history - the true history of the species here - goes back ages long before any we&#39;re allowed to see.</p>

<p>Kind of feels like that to me.  I mean if a thing’s a <em>she</em>, then someone would say “she”, right?  If they think it’s a <em>he</em>, well then they say “he”.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean the male-ness of it is pretty hard to avoid, but for instance, in spanish or french, articles to refer to any noun are gendered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has a different connotation in Spanish, however, and one can still successfully de-gendering a word in that language.  Source:  Spanish is my first language.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He,&quot; in some sentences in those languages (el, il) could be referring to the table, or the door, or whatever was just being discussed. It&#39;s just a way to refer to something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand what you’re attempting to show, but - again - it simply doesn’t have the same connotation in Spanish.  For example, “the door” in Spanish is “la puerta”.  Using “la”, technically makes the door a female.  However, no one in Spanish <em>ever</em> thinks of a door as a “her” even while they’re saying <em>“la</em> puerta”.  Same with every other inanimate object that has a gender-based pronoun.</p>

<p>In English, even though certain words are naturally/necessarily gendered - like, for example, “God” as opposed to “Goddess” - the pronouns “him” or “her” are used to much more rigidly and specifically categorize the gender of the noun in a manner that wouldn’t necessarily be so rigidly categorized <em>without</em> that pronoun.</p>

<p>While I understand that many people simply say “he” when referring to God out of just general custom, I still felt it pertinent to make mention of what I did in terms of questioning the previous user’s assumption of what gender God is/is not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And especially considering something that&#39;s understood to have consciousness, sentience, a persona, or whatever... it&#39;s more or less appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I refer to God as “It” whenever I’m force syntactically to use a pro-noun.  Not difficult really - and much more accurate, I feel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would be even sillier to correct it to &quot;he or she&quot; because then it would follow that god were a specimen of a species which had the two sexes, or that god were literally like a person of some sort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God’s not “he or she”.  God’s “he <em>and</em> she” both.  Has to be, for both sexes are most definitely contained within God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just saying &quot;he&quot; still works, at least imo, when one is considering god as just the embodiment of existence, or some other such abstract concept.</p>

<p>Just my $.02, anyway, not really important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Na man I think you have valid points and it’s good for you to have brought these counterpoints up here.  I just feel that it’s imbalanced to refer to God using only one gender.  I personally feel it’s a bit chauvinistic - if even subconsciously so - and necessarily incorrect, since God is, again, <em>both</em> and all sexes/genders.</p>

<p>I don’t think you have bad points though, and I feel I understand what you mean.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t become confused by this, though. Yes, God is both the ying and yang, but the ying-yang only represents <strong>balance</strong></p>

<p>Balance and harmony is the correct path towards God. </p>

<p>Imbalance is what forces you away from God. And there are many, many imbalances in the world today. God didn&#39;t create them, human beings created those imbalances and we also have to re-balance the scales ourselves. </p>

<p>&quot;Satan&quot; or &quot;the devil&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;Sin&quot; is actually just imbalance. <strong>These are NEITHER the Ying nor the Yang</strong>. They represent imbalance, which inevitably leads to self-destruction. Imbalance is not sustainable. Anything separate from God is not sustainable.</p>

<p>This is true, but it is also Not true. God will ultimately win, but right now in the world, there are a lot of areas in which God is not winning. </p>

<p>In fact, there are places in the world that are so imbalanced and drowned in sin that God is nowhere to be found there. These people and/or places have literally separated themselves from God.</p>

<p>So try not to go to the opposite side of the spectrum and just say that Everything is God. Some people have truly ripped themselves away from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the ying-yang only represents balance</p>

<p>Balance and harmony is the correct path towards God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see what you’re saying, and it’s a sentiment expressed by many religions - one that I don’t think is completely without merit - but God, being technically <em>everything</em>, means that any and <em>every</em> path is the God-path.  It’s just that some God-paths might be pretty awesome by conventional/human senses, and some really truly suck.</p>

<p>They’re all God, however.  Have to be.  Otherwise God wouldn’t be God/everything there is/the alpha and the omega.  Much of Western civilization, and as a result, much of the people of the West, don’t understand or recognize this fact.  The East, however, tends to realize and understand this reality much more clearly.  The Buddhist and the Hindu religions particularly realize that God is the creator <em>and</em> the destroyer of existence both.</p>

<p>Once a human being attains transcendence, however, they can rise above both the good and the bad and be in a state of (in Buddhism) nirvana or (in Hinduism) nirvikalpa samadhi.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there are many, many imbalances in the world today. God didn&#39;t create them, human beings created those imbalances and we also have to re-balance the scales ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a contradiction in terms, however, because since God is in fact everything, then God cannot be anything but every being and every <em>thing</em> that exist - human and non-human both; from the lowest dreg in existence to the loftiest, most evolved figure.</p>

<p>It’s all part of the same whole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God will ultimately win, but right now in the world, there are a lot of areas in which God is not winning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an anthropomorphized version of God - which is fine in its own way and more closely related to that version of enlightenment that Hindus call “savikalpa samadhi” where one attains “enlightenment” through the visualization of God as a person or figure who is “balanced and good”, but it is not ultimately the loftiest version of the concept where God is all and everything <em>independent</em> of anthropomorphizing.  For that, one necessarily has to travel through the understanding of the yin as well as the yang.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, there are places in the world that are so imbalanced and drowned in sin that God is nowhere to be found there. These people and/or places have literally separated themselves from God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Na.  They haven’t separated themselves from God.  They’re just hanging out in the part of the “savikalpa” (anthropomorphized) version of God that’s near its/her/his ass crack is all.</p>

<p>Everything is logically, <em>necessarily</em> God.  We humans just don’t understand the full dynamic of existence yet.  We are babes upset that <a href="https://thehemppress.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/pouting-child-girl.jpg">“Mom won’t just let us eat as many candies as we want!  Mom must be mean and evil then!”</a> when, in reality, she’s just looking out for us and disciplining us in ways that we do not yet understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you&#39;ve stated is pretty basic Hindu/Buddhist philosophy, which I&#39;m well aware of, and I agree with most of the ideas you&#39;ve offered. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the full truth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but God, being technically everything, means that any and every path is the God-path.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God, in it&#39;s highest form, is everything, Yes. The purest and fundamental reality of God is simply <em>pure consciousness</em>. God in the Highest sense has no form or motive. It is simply consciousness, and everything springs out of that constant. </p>

<p>This does not mean that EVERY path is the God-path. </p>

<p>You state yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They’re just hanging out in the part of the “savikalpa” (anthropomorphized) version of God that’s near its/her/his ass crack is all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you understand that it is possible to move very far away from the full reality of God, essentially separating yourself from truth. Yet, you do not believe that it is possible to <em>completely fall off</em> or <em>split apart</em> from God. I do believe that is possible. </p>

<p>I do believe that every person is an individualization of God, with <strong>Free Will</strong>. This is key, because it essentially means you can make choices that are not harmonious with God, that are not balanced with the proper flow of Nature, and that are destructive in and of itself. You can continue to make these choices, and they will be reaped at some point. The consequences of those choices will be very bad for you, but still you can continue to make those choices even after experiencing the Karma. And yes, often times a lifestream will still continue to push themselves farther away even after reaping the Karma. But they always have a choice to turn around and go back. </p>

<p>You are a co-creator with God. You actually participate in the Creation process. And therefore, you have to also balance the scales, not God or gods. </p>

<p>By your philosophy, one can say that any action is appropriate and can continue to be done indefinitely, with no real chance of you ever losing yourself from the &quot;River of Life&quot; that is God. I don&#39;t agree with this because of the reality of Free Will. A person can choose to continue and continue to move farther away until they are no longer part of it, God. By this point, they will be in such a sorry state of a self-created &quot;Hell&quot; that they will have <em>every reason</em> to change their ways and turn around back to the Source. The Karma will be so harsh, that they will have every opportunity to start making their way back, even if they are way out in the &quot;savikalpa&quot;, as you call it. But eventually, they will destroy themselves if they do not make the change. </p>

<p>As I stated before, imbalance (or anti-God) is self-destructive... It is not sustainable. It will destroy itself, since God will not be present in that self-created &quot;Hell&quot;. And to think that there is some &quot;law&quot; in place that subverts and bypasses an individuals Free Will to continually separate itself from God is not something that I agree with. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Actually, I was just repeating your own terms when you stated &quot;God is always winning&quot;. That is an anthropomorphization. I was assuming that we were speaking in terms we both understand, so sorry you got confused when I repeated about God winning. But yes, I realize that in the highest levels, it is not possible to project human emotions and characteristics onto God. It has no form, no drive to create, nothing of that sort. It is simply consciousness.  </p>

<p><em>EDIT</em> Oh and I have no idea what you mean by &quot;I didn&#39;t dv you&quot;, not sure what &quot;dv&quot; is.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If you think that an individualization of God is separate from God, then that God cannot be “all there is”, since that would put God on one end, and the individualization that is <em>separate</em> from God on the other.</p>

<p>If one says the individualization <em>is</em> God, however, then that would mean the individualization has no free will since it is a manifestation of God Itself.</p>

<p>So either there is no free will - i.e. everything is a manifestation of God Itself - or there <em>is</em> free will - in which case, God is not “all powerful”…which would make God impotent.</p>

<p>The latter conclusion (an impotent God - which is essentially <em>no</em> God) seems far more logically abhorrent than the former (no free will since God is manifesting Its will as everything there is).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And my point is that all this that you just described?  It’s <em>still</em> within the purview of God’s existence.  It’s still <em>in</em> God.  It’s still <em>part</em> of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are a co-creator with God. You actually participate in the Creation process. And therefore, you have to also balance the scales, not God or gods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is limited amnesia that God has put into Its creations, and this amnesia causes many of those creations to forget that they <em>are</em> in fact the Godhead and all of Its creations.  They think themselves small because they have forgotten about that part within them that remembers they are in fact infinite.</p>

<p>And the “they” we’re talking about <em>is</em> ultimately God.  Even while they tumble around lost, seemingly “away” from God, they are only tumbling away from God in seeming.  It is only temporary.</p>

<p>Even if that tumbling in darkness lasts a billion millennia…it is still only a temporary amnesia.</p>

<p>The confusion eventually goes away and the individual identity ultimately realizes that it all along was actually a much greater identity (<em>the</em> identity, actually - God), and it just had a dream wherein it was a bunch of different individuals - all having separate, disparate thoughts and feelings, many of them quite destructive.  Everything and everyone will eventually wake up and realize that they were all One.  All the angels, all the demons.  All of them.  They were and are all God dreaming and drawing and doodling and telling stories.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Seems to me we are quark-sized identities playing in a sand lot the size of the universe thinking that because we can’t see the end of the sand lot, that it is “infinite” and we have “infinitely free will”.  Even those quarks in massive universe don’t have free will, however.  There’s a <em>lot</em> we cannot do.  </p>

<p>For example, try to think of an object that is both in and out at the same time; simultaneously convex <em>and</em> concave in the same space; both up and down at the same time; both black and white together…not <em>gray</em>, mind you.  Not mixed w/black and white.  <em>Literally</em> both black and white.</p>

<p>Seems we can’t quite do it.</p>

<p>Our will and our thoughts, it seems, are confined by the limitations of our sensory abilities and perceptions and our brain and mind’s capacity to grasp concepts.  There is a lot we cannot do.</p>

<p>It seems we are very not free.</p>

<p>It’s okay though.  Even though we don’t have free will, there’s still a lot we <em>can</em> in fact do.  I don’t think we have to think of ourselves as greatly limited by our not having free will.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A person can choose to continue and continue to move farther away until they are no longer part of it, God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn’t matter how far you move toward the edges of nothingness…you are still in the nothingness…and that nothingness…is still God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By this point, they will be in such a sorry state of a self-created &quot;Hell&quot; that they will have every reason to change their ways and turn around back to the Source.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure.  I wouldn’t disagree with that - only I would simply say that it’s <em>all</em> Source.  Just different areas and aspects of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Karma will be so harsh, that they will have every opportunity to start making their way back, even if they are way out in the &quot;savikalpa&quot;, as you call it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are likening savikalpa to being <em>away</em> from God consciousness?  That is the very <em>opposite</em> of what it is actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But eventually, they will destroy themselves if they do not make the change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what is the “they” that gets “destroyed”?  That “they” is but a rain drop in that ocean that is still God Itself.  Once that tiny raindrop gets “destroyed”, it will simply go right back into Source from where it came.  It will simply be a small identity ingested as one into the Great Identity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I stated before, imbalance (or anti-God) is self-destructive... It is not sustainable. It will destroy itself, since God will not be present in that self-created &quot;Hell&quot;.</p>

<p>Seems to me that God is as much that self-crated hell as It is the self-created heaven.</p>

<p>“dv” means “downvote”.  Your vote count was at 0 and then -1 when I saw it, and I was just saying that I didn’t vote you down.  I don’t think that anything you’re saying is worth a downvote.

<p>Ah, wasn&#39;t familiar with that one, but thanks for that. I am indifferent to the upvotes and downvotes, as my spiritual views often contradict all of the most established sides of an argument, which means my comments often have the most opposition on every side. </p>

<p>The issue with the down-voters is that they didn&#39;t bother to respond. I added to a conversation we are having, and you are engaging me as well, but you didn&#39;t dv. Anyway, we know reddit is really an opinion site. It doesn&#39;t matter if you are contributing or not, it&#39;s easier to down vote than to respond on why you think I&#39;m wrong. Not too concerned about digital points either way. So thanks for actually participating in open forum discussion. </p>

<p>Regarding the conversation we were having....</p>

<p>I believe most of the world religions have truth, some more than others, but none have the full story. I certainly don&#39;t claim to know it all, and I just take my views from some of the foundational teachings found in all of them and more modern teachings (1800s - present day).</p>

<p>Judging by your comments, it seems like we would agree on most things. But once anyone starts getting into these deeper, more mystical (some would even say esoteric) discussions, there is bound to be some disagreements and misunderstandings. </p>

<p>But I think I may have identified the crux of our disagreement in this particular topic. </p>

<p>It can kinda be summed up in your first sentences:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think that an individualization of God is separate from God, then that God cannot be “all there is”, since that would put God on one end, and the individualization that is separate from God on the other.</p>

<p>If one says the individualization is God, however, then that would mean the individualization has no free will since it is a manifestation of God Itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will simply explain what I believe on this issue:</p>

<p>I think it is possible to be an individualization of God with Free Will, and at the same time that necessarily means that you are part of the one God, which is everything. I think where we disagree is when you say that the individualization must have no free will if it is manifested from God itself. </p>

<p>As I said in my previous posts, the highest level of God has no form. God, at that level, is simply pure Being, or consciousness. Let&#39;s call it the &quot;Allness&quot; of God. Out of the Allness comes a self-conscious being which acts as a Creator (do not try to place this &quot;event&quot; on a timeline, in these states there is no beginning nor ending nor linearity). The Creator has form, but it is not a form that can be conceptualized by our human minds / limitations. Now, the Creator <em>does</em> have the potential and the drive to create something, and it must fashion that something out of its own being, or consciousness. Just like when we humans build our toys, machines, and huge cities, those material things <em>must first</em> start as a blueprint in the mind/consciousness of a human co-creator, and then it can become manifested reality. </p>

<p>Now, the Creator can continue indefinitely to create utterly unfathomable and beautiful -- yet completely inanimate and without any Free Will -- objects and manifestations. And I am sure that the Creator (I will add that I believe in <em>many</em> Creators, not one), did do just that. But... and here is the crux... it also created self-aware and self-conscious, self-driven beings to inhabit this world of form. Why would it do this?.... </p>

<p>The importance of a self-aware being is that this individualization has the potential to recognize that it is an extension of God. Although a rock has God&#39;s consciousness within it, it just does not have the self-awareness to realize it is a part of God and, as a result, make decisions that are against the correct &quot;Flow&quot; of God.... or what Eastern teachings call &quot;The Way,&quot; for example. Or what Western religions call the &quot;Will of God&quot;</p>

<p>When a lifestream remembers that they are an individualization, or a Son or Daughter of God, then God can experience this material world through them. That is how God, overall grows and transcends itself as well... through your own Godly experiences. </p>

<p>The other purpose for making self-aware beings was because God doesn&#39;t want to have a world of form that is static and dead. God did create natural laws to guide the world of form (example: Karma and Samsara). Essentially, these laws allow the world of form to grow and evolve without any direct input from God. But why would God create this mechanical universe, governed by these laws? That would mean that God could just sit back and watch the universe unfold in exactly the ways that it intended, without even a minor deviation....</p>

<p>Yet, it is my belief that God created a universe that can evolve in ways that are surprising even to God. For this reason, God created those co-creators &quot;In the image of God&quot;. We are Creators, just like the Creator that created the world of form we live in. If that Creator can create a world of form as intricate, complex, and unfathomable as the one we are in, then we as Co-creators have the same capability. Yet we are currently at a very low state (due to our own actions and those pesky laws of Karma and Samsara).</p>

<p>I 100% agree with this statement you make here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And my point is that all this that you just described? It’s still within the purview of God’s existence. It’s still in God. It’s still part of God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God created planet Earth as a rough outline, and we are here doing the Co-creating from the inside. We have true dominion here, not God. Seems weird to say, but I believe that&#39;s the truth. Our planet right now is simply not living up to the full potential that the Creator&#39;s mind had originally intended. And yes, that is possible because we are the Co-creators here, we have the power to do that. We can make change happen that is against the Flow of nature/God. Nevertheless, as you are stating, <em>this is still to some degree within the overall plan of God.</em> </p>

<p>This brings me to the final point. The final reason that I believe is the purpose we were created:</p>

<p>Humans beings are not simply here to experience the world and co-create the universe. Humans are created with the potential to grow in consciousness and self-awareness until they reach the pinnacle of self-awareness. Some call this &quot;enlightenment&quot; and other call it &quot;ascension&quot;, and there are other terms as well... This process has many stages, which must each be transcended, and the world of form we live in now here on Earth is a schoolroom for our lifestreams working towards this effort. As a result, even the current imperfect conditions serve as a way to help us grow and transcend -- BUT only if that lifestream is willing. </p>

<p>Let me just add this one statement you make here which I want to address:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything and everyone will eventually wake up and realize that they were all One. All the angels, all the demons. All of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You state this as if it is a <strong>guarantee</strong> that every single one will eventually come back to God. This subverts and dismisses Free Will once again. I am going to piggy back off of your analogy and use those same terms, so don&#39;t get too caught up with this metaphor:</p>

<p>Sure, the &quot;angels&quot;, who are closer to God and are following the &quot;God path&quot; will continue to wake up and realize they are all One and that all of it is God. But the &quot;demons&quot;...who are very far away from God and steeped in a dark illusion of un-reality, well...they may not make it back. They have that choice. And don&#39;t get me wrong here...the part of them that originated in God, which <em>we all have</em>, will not be lost. That will be re-absorbed into the Allness. But everything that they perpetuated and created throughout their existence that does not flow with God, that will all disappear. Literally vanish. It had no ultimate reality in God in the first place. It only existed in the mind/ karmic ties that the individual was perpetuating constantly. There is no such thing as an eternal Hell where people who have separated from God will spend in eternal torture. The only Hell is the one that you are creating, and that Hell is there to serve as a spring board for you to start making your way back to God. If the lifestream continues to manifest these illusions, which have no ultimate reality since they are self-destructive and unsustainable, then they will altogether &quot;vanish&quot; just like the rest of it. It&#39;s no longer part of God, because it simply cannot exist within God. And it is not sustainable in order to exist without the help of God/Creator. </p>

<p>Again, thanks for participating with me in the conversation. I&#39;m sure most of our beliefs align, but allowing the specific details to divide anyone is the mistake that religions have been making for centuries. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn’t disagree with this interpretation on your part.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Out of the Allness comes a self-conscious being which acts as a Creator</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This I think is a very important statement.  I feel I understand much of what you posted, and I feel I am also discerning a differentiation in our categorizations of God.  It seems to me that what you are calling God is the Creator that springs from the Allness.</p>

<p>What I am calling God, on the other hand, is the Allness Itself from which that Creator springs.</p>

<p>Within the context of the Allness from which that Creator springs, I would say <em>yes</em>, you are right in establishing that there can be a Creator on one end, and an individual identity with its own free will separate from the Creator on the other.  Both the Creator and the individual exist separately within the stratum of The Allness.</p>

<p>I understand this.  What I’m saying, however, is that this particular definition of the Creator is in fact <em>not</em> God Itself because it is not the end all and be all of everything in existence.  The Allness is that - and it is The Allness Itself which is in fact God…not the Creator that springs from The Allness.  The Creator is only a manifestation of The Allness - like you are and I am.  The Creator is just a manifestation that is, let’s say, <em>closer</em> to the core of The Allness than you or I are.  The Creator is still a creation, however - a creation of The Allness.</p>

<p>It is <em>The Allness</em> which is God - and everything that comes from The Allness is one <em>with</em> It.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God&#39;s plan is not to have children sexually abused. If you remember, he said in the old testament, that if you mistreated a fatherless child, he will hear their cries, and he would make make your children fatherless and make your wife a widow. You would also be punished for making fun of the blind and deaf.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s both agree for a second that God is real and seeing what&#39;s happening. Do you think this is his plan? Heck no. &quot;he will judge the sexually immoral (grown ups diddling little kids is absolutely disgusting)&quot;, even those who are part of &quot;Christianity&quot;, like the priests and such (I put quotes around Christianity, because anyone doing something as sick as that doesn&#39;t deserve to be called a Christian.).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re saying a God who allows children to be mistreated is cruel. I showed you how much he hates it, in bible times it would be punishable by death. Then you say punishing that person with death is unfair to the person&#39;s child, and that&#39;s sick.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it again. He did not plan for this to happen. He wanted us to live happy lives while serving him. He did give us free will. We humans decided &quot;no we can manage ourselves, we don&#39;t need you!&quot; Now that he&#39;s given like almost full reins, and when people use their free will to hurt children, and he doesn&#39;t intervene when something bad happens, we want to complain. That&#39;s kinda like people telling their parents &quot;fuck you mom and dad, I&#39;m out of here, I don&#39;t need you and your rules!&quot; and moving out, but expecting the parents to come bailing them out of every bad situation they encounter.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like there being a massive lava lake beneath an active volcano.  At the moment the volcano is starting to erupt, but there have been tremors going through the ground every now and then for years.  It wasn&#39;t necessarily enough to know the exact size of the lava lake, but from the nature of the tremors and the rumbling, you can tell that it is big, and that when it erupts it&#39;s going to like Mount Vesuvius.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to speak for <a href="/u/petrus4">/u/petrus4</a>, but I&#39;ve also known for about a decade, beginning with meeting my first acquantance victimized by it.  To the credit of my cynicism, I was skeptical until I met several others, none of which had ever had contact with the others I knew, and the circumstances of my contacts with them were completely unrelated.  Yet they all told the exact same stories with sufficient conflicting details to convince a trial jury.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never witnessed nor experienced this first-hand, but I continue to meet survivors of this who share certain details of what happened, but never go into the responsible parties (with a few exceptions) for my own safety.  The fear / terror in them is real, and the emotional and physical scars they bear are real.  Putting the pieces together from their stories, plus my own investigation, I&#39;ve come to the following conclusions:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is an organized, global conspiracy actively working to undermine all forms of sovereign national government so that a single hegemonic dictatorship can be established.</li>
<li>A majority of the players involved on the ground do not know about each other, nor do they understand what the ultimate goal is.  These are scattered throughout public and private life, in positions of power and influence in Hollywood, various nations&#39; governments, financial institutions, and media outlets.</li>
<li>The people you see (Podesta, Clinton, Soros, etc) are expendable, and as deceived as everyone else.  They think their actions buy them favor in the future, but they&#39;re being used until they&#39;re no longer useful.</li>
<li>The true power behind the conspiracy is never seen, never heard, never caught.  They will never leave evidence of their crimes, and they pull the strings of the most powerful people of the world.</li>
<li>No single group, agency, or organization bears responsibility as a whole.  Within those groups most people assume are the &quot;bad guys&quot; is a majority of people who are not privy to anything.  The CIA, FBI, Council for Foreign Relations, Builderbergs, DNC, RNC... no single public group is made up just the conspirators.</li>
<li>Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) is real, and serves to draw a certain spiritual power into the world that supposedly protects the conspiracy from exposure, and imparts temporal power to those involved.  It also acts as a method of indoctrinating future generations to carry on the plan.</li>
<li>This vile darkness in the halls of power started in the Vatican, and has been pushed out into the world like a cancer, being overseen and fed for over a thousand years. </li>
<li>The backbone of control is blackmail and manipulation, using children to force the puppet masters&#39; puppets into compromising positions, threatening exposure if there&#39;s lack of compliance, relying on the &quot;I&#39;m in too deep to stop now&quot; mentality.</li>
</ol>

<p>And my most unappealing conclusion, but one which should prevent no one from continuing to try, is that <strong>this is far too powerful to stop now.</strong>  At this point, the powers that be have too much influence and control to ever get caught, and possibly too much to care if they do.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very real, and you should be very concerned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should review the account of Jay Parker who was raised in a Satanic abuse family.  It is hard to listen to some of the details of his abuse but this particular interview also addresses some of the questions people tend to have in the vein of &quot;well, HOW do they cover up the abuse?&quot;  He talks about living in communities as a child where the majority of families (thus the children being abused) are in the &quot;old religion&quot; as Jay&#39;s &quot;mother&quot; referred to it.  He mentioned as many as 80% percent of the kids at the local elementary school were trapped in the cult.  His &quot;mother&quot;, Josette Parker, was a schoolteacher.  He also explains instances where criminal investigations were smothered at the local Police level.  He explains that his &quot;family&quot; attended Christian church services as a cover story every Sunday before heading directly to the satanic church where he was abused.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t know where those code translations came from, but at the same time, can anyone offer an example of how the sentence, sent to John Podesta by someone called Susan:</p>

<p>&quot;The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related.&quot;  </p>

<p>might make any amount of sense, at all, in any imaginable conversation?  Just try yourself, see if you can fit that into a fake dialogue where it isn&#39;t completely insane and bizarre.  I can&#39;t.  then it goes on to say:  </p>

<p>&quot;Is it yorus [sic]? They can send it if you want. I know you’re busy, so feel free not to respond if it’s not yours or you don’t want it.&quot;</p>

<p>So, if you take the words at face value, this means:  </p>

<p>Some realtor (whoever that is) found a literal handerchief, and lets Susan know.  She takes a look at it, and it seems to have an image of a map printed on it, at least she thinks so  (remember, she doesn&#39;t say she&#39;s sure, she says &quot;I think it has a map&quot;).  So, maybe it&#39;s a vague image, or maybe she sometimes has trouble remembering what exactly a map is... but she thinks the thing on the handkerchief probably is one.  </p>

<p>And also, the map is &quot;pizza-related.&quot;  It&#39;s a map with directions to pizza places.  Or its a map of the country where pizza was invented.... or, uh.... seriously I can&#39;t think of a fucking thing that this could legitimately mean.  And i&#39;m trying here, to give them the benefit of the doubt and think of a normal meaning for a pizza-related map.  It sounds like the kind of shit Charlie from Always Sunny would write in his dream book.  </p>

<p>Oh, and ALSO, this handkerchief appears to have enough value or significance that it would warrant an email offering to return it to its rightful owner.  A very expensive-looking, beautiful, silk pocket square, maybe?  ok.... with a pizza-map on it.  Right.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s precisely the type of item that, if I found it in my home, I would have a good idea of which one of my guests it belonged to, because who CAN&#39;T determine who the owner of a HANDKERCHIEF was?  She probably knew that silk pizza-maps were totally John&#39;s style, and he&#39;d be really upset if he lost it.  So she&#39;d better just shoot him an email offering to FedEx it right away, if he wants it back.  </p>

<p>OR,   </p>

<p>It&#39;s a secret fucking code and it&#39;s WEIRD.  </p>

<p>I will admit, that almost every other one of those wikileak emails&#39; text had some sort of conceivable context that would explain it in an innocent way.  But this one?  </p>

<p>Please, be my guest and take a crack at it.  I would love to be proved wrong.  </p>

<p>One weird email doesn&#39;t seem like enough....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a couple of things....  </p>

<p>first, &quot;handkerchief&quot; is one of those words that doesn&#39;t really sound like any other words.  hard to mistake. </p>

<p>Second, in other emails, podesta and his recipient were pretty quick to correct a simple typo (he wrote &quot;i&#39;m passed . . . &quot;  and they replied &quot;you mean pissed?&quot;  then he said &quot;yes sorry, i meant pissed&quot;).  Here, he replies &quot;It&#39;s mine, but it&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot;  Doesn&#39;t inquire about anything weird being told or asked.  Doesn&#39;t clarify any meanings.  </p>

<p>Third, the following sentence has a typo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it yorus?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I highly doubt any text-to-speech fuckup outputted that.  Furthermore, there are punctuation errors, and the use of parentheses (one such error being the omission of a closing parenthesis).  Doubtful that it was anything other than manually typed.  </p>

<p>All the words and phrasing are pretty straightforward.  The response from Podesta is matter-of-fact, and directly addresses the question. </p>

<p>Your suggestion almost had me at first, and for a second I felt optimistic.  Unfortunately, though, IMO it remains unexplained.</p>

<p>[edit]</p>

<p>also, one weird email isn&#39;t enough, but there are a couple.  The others just have the capacity to allow for explanatory contexts.  This weird email to me appears to be the one massive fuckup that went overlooked, where people got sloppy, or just absent-minded, and allowed a very questionable statement and, even worse perhaps, a response which treats it as an ordinary question, to exist in black and white.  </p>

<p>Your making assumptions with no proof.  Do you know the person that moved the camera personally?  Do you know any employees from DDOT?  Do you know anyone in HR or managers who do scheduling?</p>

<p>The view is not blocked.  It may no longer point at the restaurant (I don&#39;t know if it ever did), but the camera&#39;s view of traffic is not blocked.  No matter how many times you make that claim it won&#39;t become a fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except it&#39;s really not. All of the alleged evidence proving this is a false-flag is either fabricated (moved traffic camera that then overnight morphed into &quot;turned off&quot; traffic camera - based on a single Voat post with no mention of a timeframe or any proof that the camera was actually moved), misleading (Washingtonian posting the article early - common Google bug), or doesn&#39;t actually prove anything (guy was a production assistant on three no-budget films, ergo he can&#39;t do anything bad unless hes being paid to be a crisis actor). It&#39;s a laughable attempt by Pizzagators of false-flagging  a false-flag to protect the integrity of their movement and deny the very real fact that encouraging people to &quot;ask questions&quot; about a global pedophile ring of untouchable, unprosecutable people encourages lone nuts to try and bring justice into their own hands. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an undeniable fact that telling a bunch of people that they are battling untouchable monsters is going to make at least one of them act out. We saw it with Sandy Hook when people with guns started showing up at the school, school committee meetings and outside victims&#39; homes. We saw it with the Boston bombings. We saw it with the Salt Lake City daycare when actual <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users started trespassing on the property of a daycare in a low-income neighborhood and taking pictures into the windows of the place because a single person said the building looks suspicious and suddenly out of nowhere a whole elaborate drug smuggling conspiracy was invented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on your definition of both Satan and &quot;proper&quot; Satanists.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about the Antone LeVay created &quot;Satanism&quot;, that is just secular humanism that uses the archetype of Satan as an inspiration. Nothing truly Satanic about it. These type of Satanists would not participate in occult rituals, as they do not believe in Satan as an entity. </p>

<p>Satanic deification (worshiping Satan as a god...&quot;devil worship&quot; if you will) however, is a different matter altogether. These type of people believe in the actual entity/power of Satan and worship him as Christians do God/Jesus. Occult rituals are common, if not outright required, for this type of religion. </p>

<p>I would say it&#39;s easiest to assume that what most people label &quot;Satanic&quot; is actually worship of another, older evil deity, such as Moloch (the bull god...not the owl Minerva). Aleister Crowley, for example, was labeled as Satanic, but was not, in fact a Satanist. To deny that he meddled with some dark forces in his day, however, is lunacy. But to the average person, hearing that something is &quot;Satanic&quot; is a much easier filter to go through than having to explain who and what &quot;Set&quot; is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you we are in total agreement. I said the same thing you have just described about Alister Crowley. All I said is that these idiot people probably meddle with &#39;something&#39; and that calling it Satanic is easier to feed to the masses.</p>

<p>However I fear that the &#39;masses&#39; are usually pretty uninformed and some religious folk will see it as literal. Which means that some Satanism, which is less violent and stupid will be put into the same drawer. Just like people hear the word &#39;drugs&#39; and put dope and Heroin into one. This brings with it a lot of hassle for those liking one and not the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theories have been floating around since...forever. I have never seen such a doubling down on anything like this. 9/11 Truthers have been around for years, Sandy Hook had a conspiracy, but only fake news touches the Clinton camp!! I can guarantee you if this was involving Donald Trump, msm would be all over it. You know, like those rape allegations...which should rightfully have been pursued if there was any reason to be suspect. </p>

<p>There have been so many elites involved with this sort of stuff. The Franklin coverup incident, Jimmy Savile, Epstein, Hastert (both of which had regular contact with the Podestas), Freud, Weiner in contact with underage girls, Norway elites just had a huge pedo bust, there was a call-boy investigation in the 80s. Is it really SO difficult to imagine this is possible? Pair that with: </p>

<p>*Using existent code words for child porn in otherwise nonsensical emails. Who wants to fly in $65,000 worth of pizza/dogs to the Whitehouse? Would I do better playing dominoes on cheese or pasta?</p>

<p>*At the VERY least, incredibly distasteful social media postings. Who in their right mind uses #hotard next to a baby?? With picture comments including &quot;Would like a Haitian special, extra cheese.&quot; It&#39;s not funny, and talk about shitty marketing for a supposedly family friendly business. This is the &quot;49th most powerful man in DC&quot; and a pizza shop owner who has been to the Whtehouse 5 times. Oh, and has a profile picture of Antinous. </p>

<p>*Paintings of scantily-clad teenagers in Tony Podesta&#39;s home and stuffed animals in his bedroom when he has no children. And a continued relationship with Dennis Hastert. </p>

<p>*Hillary Clinton taking personal interest in Laura Silsby for child trafficking in Haiti. Oh, and her legal advisor Jorge Puello is under investigation for sex trafficking. </p>

<p>*Monica Peterson being killed while investigating the Clintons and human trafficking in Haiti. </p>

<p>All of these bits of info, and more, on their own may be of no consequence, but together, I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s so crazy to investigate further. </p>

<p>There is no evidence of wrongdoing by anyone targeted. There are no perpetrators.</p>

<p>There is nothing harmless about conducting witchhunt with zero evidence of wrongdoing, zero evidence of harm.

<p>People who intentionally spread lies about pedophilia are monsters, they are assholes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are assuming these people are innocent, and you are assuming that people are ruining lives for no reason.</p>

<p>Innocent until proven guilty. None of them has been proven guilty, none of them has been shown to have done anything wrong, none of them has been shown to have ever harmed a child.</p>

<p>There is no proof of a crime, how can there be perpetrators?</p>

<p>Investigative phase? If you start with the assumption that secret code words are being used, you should investigate where those code words came from, and investigate the validity of them. Since the whole investigate is based on those 4chan code words, that is where the investigate should start. Where did those code words come from? Pulled out the air? Are those code words valid? Why? How?</p>

<p>Everything rests on those code words being taken at face value, despite that they seem to have no validity whatsoever.</p>

<p>I just said that not everyone is assuming these things about alefantis and podesta and whomever, sure a few are, but you are pretending everyone does. You, yourself, are also assuming that these people are innocent and people are deliberately spreading disinformation and lies about them. I&#39;m not saying we shouldn&#39;t assume their innocence, what I&#39;m saying is that you&#39;re being completely hypocritical and fallacious in your claims. It&#39;s a pretty terrible thing for people to be labeled pedophiles or rapists when they aren&#39;t, i completely agree. The point I&#39;m making is that being completely dismissive is oftentimes more harmful to people than probing into potential crimes. </p>

<p>Most of the people looking into it are not trying to ruin anyone&#39;s lives, they are trying to make sure that lives are not being ruined in the future by turning a blind eye to potential criminal activities, the likes of which take place all throughout history and all over the world. Painting all the investigators as scumbags and crazies is as ignorant as claiming that alefantis is a pedo. Not as damaging, but just as ignorant. How do you not see that point? I&#39;m agreeing with your point that these few morons are destructive and doing more harm than good. Repeating that point doesn&#39;t make the rest of your arguments any more sound.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is absolutely real. When there isn&#39;t proof enough to  exonerate or condemn (beyond circumstantial stuff), yet the media has already gone into debunk mode, saying pizza gate is definitively false, you know something is up. Real journalism would say that the allegations are just that, alleged, but they won&#39;t even go there. No, to MSM, the case is somehow already magically closed, because big brother says so. MSM response totally confirms it to me, the bias is so fucking palpable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ying Yang , its a fundamental principle of all life, trust. Consider, a system where everything is illegal, how if everyone wants to do a thing, can you prevent a thing happening. Answer ; you let a fraction do the thing and deny it. It&#39;s  the only way. Like the puzzle of a guy in a boat with the wolf and the sheep. Except, whoever, ends up in the boat, with the little lambs, turns into a wolf, its human nature, nothing else. The alternative could be much worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long time lurker here. Feeling brave today to add something that&#39;s been bugging me. During Clinton&#39;s campaign, the moment MSM learned they lost control of being the primary source of information is when they began to push Russian propaganda. Clinton even mentioned it during a debate. It felt like they were grabbing on to a long lost fear tactic that once worked to persuade the masses. Election night was bizarre. Especially watching these reporters back peddle on this narrative they pushed so hard by claiming there were closet trump supporters and &quot;uneducated white males&quot; who were to blame for them being completely wrong. Shortly after, this bullshit saga of &quot;fake news&quot; is being paraded around to discredit anything that doesn&#39;t fit some sort of an agenda. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still on the fence with pizza gate, and I firmly believe the &quot;fake news&quot; agenda isn&#39;t a result of the pizza conspiracy. Fake news narrative is a result of losing control of information. An informed society is a society that cannot be controlled. Why do the elites need to control over 300 million humans in America? Europe? Middle East? Why? Then we have pizza gate. I see both sides, some of the excitement does leave a bad taste for critical thinking. And the rebuttal is also distasteful, yet there are valid questions on both sides that should be examined. I won&#39;t discredit pizza gate entirely because there have been pedophilia with priests, Boy Scouts, and Hollywood inside America. So it&#39;s not completely far fetched that our tiny little bag of flesh politicians could behave so disgustingly. </p>

<p>Whether pizza gate is true or not, I have a very strong suspicion it is nothing compared to what is really being kept in the dark. I think the situation here upon earth is in much more danger than pen whipping psychopaths peddling around with children. Not saying I would turn a blind eye to it, but I think there&#39;s an ulterior agenda that will make pizza gate look like a bounced check. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is a possibility. Honestly I don&#39;t really believe that it is possible to &#39;outsmart&#39; a ruling elite that have been successfully ruling for hundreds and hundreds of years if you really dig into it. I mean they really have it down pat by this point. I also believe (however debbie downer it is) that if the ruling elite do have some diabolical plan for the country, then they are going to be able to pull it off. </p>

<p>Which is why I think it is important to just <em>do the right thing</em> since that may be all we have in the end. And in my personal opinion, the right thing is to look into something if it seems suspicious and there is the possibility of child victims. This doesn&#39;t mean violence, defamation, etc but just look into it and share one&#39;s findings. Be able to feel right with yourself when all is said and done.</p>

<p>I mean, if the ruling elite want to roll out more censorship laws, then they are probably going to get more censorship laws. If they set a &#39;trap&#39; and it doesn&#39;t work, that&#39;s not going to stop them. I mean if you really think about it and how powerful these people are, whether or not we research something has almost no bearing whatsoever on their own intended outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not seeing what would make you think that, mostly because you dont explain it.</p>

<p>i see all of this pizzagate shit as a great distraction, while all you guys chase a pizza place the important shit is happening somewhere else.</p>

<p>no evidence i have seen on pizzagate has been more than speculation, yet some people seem to have found their gospel...
based on an unsourced /pol/ post and using codewords to decode leaked emails(hint: if you take words as meaning something else, you can make a lot of shit work).</p>

<p>its all stretches, even if this shooter is an actor, its a huge stretch to say that its a false flag because of it. </p>

<p>i cant change your beliefs, but ill keep expressing my belief that you are all victims of a psyop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never said they give &quot;fake blessing&quot;. People die and then end up in the Astral Holding Area which is a &quot;Fake Heaven&quot;. The &quot;Fake Heaven&quot; actually sucks big time. Humans created this Simulation as a playground. They forgot their true nature and eventually believed the Simulation and actual &quot;matter&quot; was real. The Simulation was then hijacked by the &quot;Archons&quot; who are Astral Parasites. The God you pray to does not exist. Time to grow up and understand; This universe is Fake. You live inside a Computer Simulation. Everything is possible in the expanding real universe. But currently you are not in the &quot;Real Universe&quot;. Praying to a fictional god sends energy to the controllers of this Simulation; The Archons. Once again; This is a Closed Simulation. It does not expand. There are set rules and massive limitations programmed into the Matrix. </p>
