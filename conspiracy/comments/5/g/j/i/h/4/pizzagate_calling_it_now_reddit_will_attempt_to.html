        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">3213</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/BransonOnTheInternet.html">BransonOnTheInternet</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>READ THE WHOLE POST BEFORE COMMENTING PLEASE IF NOT YOU ARE DOING YOURSELF AND OTHERS HERE A DISSERVICE.  </p>

<p>After what many are considering a false flag op around Comet I am willing to be we are going to see a crackdown not only on this sub, but Reddit as a whole. Though I may not agree with some of the discussion, or more importantly how it is framed, its none the less an important discussion too have; now more than ever. </p>

<p>So keep in mind this is what they want, as we already saw with the closing of <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> last month, and today&#39;s events will only provide the ammunition to shut down this discussion and frame it not only as &quot;fake news&quot; but a witch hunt that has turned violent. We have to be ever vigilant at this time and realize that though they have the power in this regard and though they can attempt to control the narrative they can&#39;t silence everyone and though they can try to ignore it they can&#39;t make this go away. Also keep in mind that now more then ever we cannot come off as supporting (not that anyone has) any actions like the ones attempting to be framed today. We have to ensure we don&#39;t proivse the alternate side ammunition to use against anyone involved into looking into this, or allow them to easily discredit anyone. Be vigilant not only in what you say, but how you say it. Now more than ever is this important. </p>

<p>Keep digging, keep discussing, and keep giving a voice to the voiceless. </p>

<p>Edit:  and the trolls/shills have arrived my friends. Play nice. </p>

<p>Edit 2:  if you want to come in here and call people names, shill, troll, please understand what sub you&#39;re in. You may noy agree with what people have to say, or how they&#39;ve gone about this, but please respect their right to do so - regardless of your feelings regarding this matter. If you can&#39;t do that, then please take this friendly advice and reconsider being a part of a sub about conspiracies. Thank you. </p>

<p>Edit 3:  It&#39;s sad that this must be said, but let me make this clear:  NO ONE in this thread has encouraged, advocated for, or condoned what happened at Comet Pizza.  Let me repeat that, NO ONE in this thread has encouraged, advocated for, or condoned what happened at Comet Pizza.  Not a single person.  Nowhere in this thread, nor any other that I have seen has there been any discussion regarding this being okay, in any way shape or form.  </p>

<p>The only people that are attempting to push this particular narrative are those attempting to discredit anyone speaking about Pizzagate itself.  The truth is if anyone did condone, advocate, or encourage such they would be downvoted, reported, and informed of how misplaced/misguided they are.  </p>

<p>What happened at Comet Pizza is unfortunate and should not have happened.  That being said, it does not mean that the conversation surrounding such stops; no matter how much some may wish it to be so.  We are not responsible for what others may do with this information, we cannot be culpable for an individuals actions or how they may act upon such.  We are simply asking questions that many believe need to be asked.  If some poor misguided soul misinterprets that, then that is on them, and cannot be laid at the feet of Conspiracy as a whole.  If you believe it to be otherwise then I would respectfully ask you to read the above, and remember where you are and what this sub is about.  </p>

<p>With that being said, I am off to bed.  Thank you for keeping this discussion alive and for the most part remaining civil, even in the face of trolls/shill/those attempting to derail and defame the conversation.  Keep up the good work and keep doing what you know is right.  </p>

<p>Edit:  Let me make this as fucking clear as I can since some of you insane assholes don&#39;t seem to fucking get it (this is a post in this thread as well, but due to massive amounts of hate thrown towards this post and users here I think it&#39;s important to make this very clear).  </p>

<p>I was/am simply calling for people not to be scared of discussing it. I don&#39;t believe anyone should be going to comet, or leaking peoples names, etc. Hell I can admit the Instagram shit, not what&#39;s on it the posting of it to shame someone, makes me uncomfortable. </p>

<p>Hence why generally I&#39;m not involved in any discussion regarding such matters. I just think people should be able to discuss this issue in a way that is both looking for the truth and respectful of individuals rights, no matter what some may think they are involved in.</p>

<p>At the same time I recognize that I can&#39;t police the discussion. It&#39;s going to happen whether I like it or not. All I can do is make my points and not engage in any I may disagree with. I have to be respectful of people and allow them to make their own decisions even if I disagree with such. I think people need to realize that we all come from different backgrounds and approach this in different ways. Some people view privacy on the internet differently. We can&#39;t, as stated police that, its not our place. All we can is pick and choose how and when we will enter into the discussion, if at all. </p>

<p>People just need to be respectful of other opinions and rights, rather than attempting to attack and engage in the very behavior they are accusing others of, ie witch hunts.</p>

<p>We need to understand that people are upset about this because they have been lied to and they feel disenfranchised. They feel as if they are being misled, because sadly they have been, so many times before. People believe this because for years many they were being told, no there&#39;s no pedophile problem, only to find out that there was. Whether it be the BBC, Jimmy Saville, The Vatican, members of Congress, CEO&#39;s, etc, the truth has come out - and after years of people being told they were crazy and the media ignoring it and writing it off. So yea, it may not be true, you may not have proof you like, but that&#39;s no reason that others shouldn&#39;t be looking. They&#39;ve been down this road before and had the same attacks labeled against them and they&#39;ve seen where it ended up. With this in mind there&#39;s no reason why these people shouldn&#39;t be concerned, its history playing out like it has so many times before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because YOU base YOUR logic, morality and ethics on what they tell YOU?</p>

<p>There are thousands of documents worth of circumstantial evidence, and any reasonable person who has looked at it would draw the same conclusions as many people have here, which is quite contrary to what you believe in your government-issued thought bubble.</p>

<p>You have made not one credible argument dismissing a single piece of evidence raised by pizzagate and there is an unlimited amount of evidence.</p>

<p>Instead you make uneducated blanket statements handed down from a mainstream news source you probably didn&#39;t even read or comprehend any way other than explicitly how you were told to.</p>

<p>Try observing the evidence and then making your own rational decision. I know thinking for yourself takes work, if I had a camera pointed at a pretty face to regurgitate my message would you be more inclined to listen?</p>

<p>When the law doesn&#39;t work, people in history often turn to vigilante justice. It&#39;s a natural reaction to a system not serving the people. The accused should be charged, but they won&#39;t be, because the corrupt system you cite your irrelevant rules from will let them walk.</p>

<p>There is infinite context to these allegations, where would you like to start? We could spend the next week addressing the vast amounts of evidence, and you might just be able to comprehend the bigger picture when you add it all together. How about the fact John and Tony Podesta look exactly like two men wanted in connection with a missing person.</p>

<p>How about we start by addressing this? How about they defend themselves? How about they respond to the allegations? How about they explain what the emails actually mean if nothing nefarious is going on?</p>

<p>They are identical to two people wanted in connection with a missing girl. How much cognitive dissonance and plausible deniability can one use in their favor? Deny deny deny deny. The sky is still blue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plausible deniability is a helluva drug. In fact, drug dealers use it all the time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not breaking the law if the police don&#39;t stop you right? </p>

<p>Spirit cooking is just a coincidence?</p>

<p>Those creepy dinners, nothing to see there?</p>

<p>Pizza handkerchief? Pretty common I own several.</p>

<p>Obama ordering 65k worth of pizza and hot dogs? No problem I hope you got your fair share of your money&#39;s worth as a taxpayer.</p>

<p>Hillary wants a hot dog with no bun, she must be gluten free.</p>

<p>Oh did I mention Tony Podesta has a pizza oven in his back yard? Obama moved in next door! Who doesn&#39;t have a pizza oven in their back yard? Pretty common thing to have if you ask me. Do you have one?</p>

<p>I love collecting art that depicts the murdering style of serial killers, don&#39;t you, fine normal well adjusted person? Pretty normal shit.</p>

<p>Nothing to see here, nothing weird going on. Just a bunch of grown adults eating pizza with no specific pizza toppings while being accused of child trafficking while many of them have accrued vast quantities of wealth in undefined ways.</p>

<p>These people could be waving their dicks around on the street in public and you probably wouldn&#39;t be able to discern something was wrong, at this rate.</p>

<p>So you would have to have evidence of wrong doing. Not 4chan and reddit posts. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m going to address this at the end of the post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When are you coming over for the pizza and hot dog party?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly does that <em>mean</em>? Did a person who was actually involved with it break ranks and disclose what these words mean? For all we know pizza and hot dog party could be cocaine and playing scrabble. It could mean <strong>anything</strong>.</p>

<p>Now let me address a couple of points. To think that the stooges of the global elite, will arrest, indict and convict their masters, based on the ramblings on 4chan and reddit, are <strong>comical</strong>. Now when I say this, I am not saying or implying that these people are not involved in rituals, pedos, etc. I firmly believe they are and my research and what I create is my proof of this. However, if the CJ system were not corrupt, you would still need evidence that can be quantified, evidence such as video, images, audio, someone breaking ranks, ledgers, etc. Why do you need this and not circumstantial evidence? Because of the <em>nature</em> of the crime. When you or anyone else talking about pizzagate, can cite case precedent where someone was arrested, indicted and convicted with the same type of &quot;evidence&quot; that is presented now then you will have done something. However, you can&#39;t and you won&#39;t because those involved with child porn aren&#39;t convicted like that, shit they aren&#39;t even arrested like that let alone seeing a charging document. The second reason why this is bullshit is because these people don&#39;t have the problem of reliving the moment. Those who have a problem reliving it are those who lack access to the victims. So don&#39;t think for one second that the silly old lady, who can&#39;t use a computer, is going to be filmed in some sexual acts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not playing devils advocate and I&#39;m not arguing with you. I&#39;m having a discussion with you while utilizing critical thought and knowledge, while not relying on confirmation bias, to support what I am saying. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Making assertions based on all of the available information is far better than blind ignorance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When those assertions are based in critical reading/examination/thought and writing? Yes. When based on inductive and deductive reasoning? Yes. When based on information that is not clarified and can&#39;t be quantified? No. When based on 4chan and reddit ramblings? No. Be skeptic, question everything, but don&#39;t be so quick to hop on shit because you think it&#39;s one way when, in fact, it could be something totally different. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Circumstantial evidence won&#39;t get them in court, </p>

<p>So then what&#39;s the point? What is the point of all of this if they won&#39;t see a courtroom? So people will be &quot;awake?&quot; If you needed 4chan and reddit posts to wake you then then you&#39;re the problem and so is your school board and family. BTW, when I say &quot;you&quot; I am not talking about you specifically. I mean it in general terms.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It absolutely can. However, people need to think long and hard about it. </p>

I was simply asking you if you were capable of discerning implicit meaning before we even got past the fact you don&#39;t believe in one minor theory, there are fortunately dozens upon dozens more and I&#39;ll gladly move forward if you think there&#39;s nothing in that particular direction.

<p>How do you know they&#39;re respectable people? Do you know them? Why would you specifically try to defend their moral character while at the same time stating that &quot;us people&quot; don&#39;t have the right to investigate, speak our minds, share PUBLIC information, and of course for good measure drop in that we&#39;re just whackjobs... </p>

<p>Yep nothing suspicious or biased about this post.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is not based on any hard evidence. It&#39;s libel. It&#39;s damaging to individuals and to society.</p>

<p>If pizzagate was libel they would be suing the fuck out of everybody. Notice they haven&#39;t filed against anybody anywhere? WEIRD!</p>

<p>At this point it would definitely count as defamation if untrue, and it already damaged his character so (assuming it&#39;s a lie) the criteria to sue is met</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it hasn&#39;t! This is just utmost piffle.</p>

<p>A few people failed to act as they should have done <em>according to currently accepted doctrines</em> 40 to 50 years ago. That was bad; but what they knew about was allegations that Savile was grabbing girls on set, something that wasn&#39;t that uncommon.</p>

<p>By coincidence, I was talking to some women on Friday night in a pub. We were discussing changes in attitudes. One of them said that her mum, when her bottom was pinched in the 1970s, would have been likely to giggle and smack the man&#39;s hand, saying something like &#39;you are awful!&#39;, because in those days it was not forbidden behaviour. The lady I was talking to said that by the time she was an adult a pinch on the bottom would have provoked a slap in the face.</p>

<p>Grabbing a 15 year old girl&#39;s arse during preparations for Top of the Pops or groping the tits of a 14 year old would not have rung particular alarm bells in the 1970s. You would change your opinion of someone doing that but it would be because of the groping not because of their ages.</p>

<p>So if and when a producer was told &#39;Bloody Savile&#39;s been at it again&#39;, he would have said &#39;Try to keep him off set when he&#39;s not needed&#39;, rather than phone the police.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the extent of the BBC&#39;s wrongdoing. Calling it a &#39;cover up&#39; makes it sound like BBC management committee was taking action to prevent everyone else finding out what Savile was doing while allowing him to go on doing it.</p>

<p>Having said all that, because of sheer embarrassment and fear of political fall-out, they didn&#39;t make a clean breast of it as early as they should have done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over 100 people knew and it was dubbed an &quot;atmosphere of fear&quot;. It lasted for 46 years, well across this generational divide you&#39;re claiming. You say 1970s, but it happened up until far more recently than that, and a lot of people knew about it. If you truly think that it was this weird thing that happened back in the 70s, I&#39;d suggest you do a bit more research.</p>

<p>The post above was about a <strong>cover-up</strong>. The judge&#39;s report was quite clear there had been no such thing; just mistakes, misjudgments, over-cautiousness. </p>

<p>The &#39;atmosphere of fear&#39; referred to by the judge applied to <em>all celebrities</em> (&#39;the talent&#39;, in the industry parlance), and was not associated with Savile in particular, and certainly not with his criminal proclivities - although the report states that it contributed to his ability to get away with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Generally, </p>

<p>a) libel suits have a statute of limitations ranging from 1-3 years depending on state; it&#39;s not common to see a libel suit within weeks or a couple months of the offending action.</p>

<p>b) Most of those placing allegations against Comet Pizza don&#39;t likely have enough money to make it worth filing suit. While they could pursue injunction, there&#39;s probably too many people people spreading this rumor (most behind a layer of anonymity from the internet) to affordably identify and serve legal notice. A pizza shop likely doesn&#39;t have enough resources to pursue legal action of this nature, nor would the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well multiple news sources have reported on it, like infowars.</p>

<p>If infowars is spreading lies calling them pedophiles, why not stop them? Infowars has enough money to make it worthwhile, and if infowars actually got punished for libel then it would kill all these rumors.</p>

<p>So can you revisit your second point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So a quick google search of &quot;infowars pizzagate&quot; didn&#39;t turn up any articles like you mentioned, but what I&#39;d be looking for if I were considering filing a claim against Infowars for a client:</p>

<p>1) they would have to make demonstrably false statements. It can&#39;t be like those Rush Limbaugh &quot;I&#39;m not actually making any accusations, I&#39;m just asking questions&quot; type of statements, but a factual like &quot;So and so is a pedophile.&quot;</p>

<p>2) Infowars has enough pull and/or money to make injunction and/or monetary compensation worth it. Pull would be number of people who actually <em>believe</em> the publication, and not necessarily the number of people who read it. I don&#39;t know how much money they have on their books, or if they could afford to pay for damages + legal fees</p>

<p>3) Comet is incurring enough harm to make it worthwhile to seek an injunction or monetary damages. If all the pizza shop can show for damages is harassing phone calls and a bullet hole, it might not be worth it; however, if you get a good lawyer in there who can claim psychological distress (which requires medical examination and bills), demonstrable drops in sales, or other quantifiable harms, now you&#39;re getting somewhere. But like I said in the first point, figuring all that stuff out takes time.</p>

<p>From what I understand, Comet Pizza is a popular pizza joint in DC. 95% of the country has no idea what the Podesta emails are (although maybe more people have heard about it in DC), let alone the allegations against the restaurant, and then let alone people who used to go to the restaurant and might alter their habits based on a Alex Jones circulated reddit conspiracy. While the guy going into the place and firing a few rounds might be the first real tangible effect on the place, it&#39;s unlikely that all of the activity on reddit, InfoWars and otherwise has had much of an effect on the operations of a popular local pizza joint. Until someone goes out and starts walking around with a sign saying &quot;your kids will be raped if you eat here&quot; or somebody comes by and starts shooting into the crowd, it&#39;s unlikely there will be any demonstrable damages worth pursuing this case until other quantities of damages can be measured. Especially those that could be verifiably linked to InfoWars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again though, even assuming death threats from strangers would make it &quot;worth it&quot; enough to the owner to satisfy point 3, points 1 and 2 are still necessary to seek injuntionary relief via defamation. If there&#39;s no kill shot &quot;so and so is a pedophile&quot; from a publication source with a reasonable amount of &quot;pull&quot; and a way to prove that kill shot statement directly or likely caused the threats or physical harm, courts won&#39;t help.</p>

<p>Defamation cases are famously difficult to succeed on. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/24/media/donald-trump-sue-news-organizations/">Donald Trump has made statements on wanting to make it easier to win defamation</a> because of how regularly he suffers negative PR from misleading media reports and feels powerless against them. If you&#39;re concerned about death threats, turning evidence to investigators and hiring a body guard is what you do, a defamation suit is a non-starter (at least until hard monetary damages can be assessed, if ever).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first of all, cases have been solved before without any hard evidence.  Soft evidence is pretty powerful especially when there is no hard evidence.  </p>

<p>And why do you think it is so unbelievable that a group of pedophiles could reach key positions of power?  Former Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, pleaded to being a serial child molester.  That right there should show you that it&#39;s possible.  A former FBI director actually retired and gave a big speech about certain satanist, pedophiles in key positions of power abusing their influence.  He mentions a lot of the names you are hearing from pizza gate today and this happened in 2003.  I&#39;ll link the video at the bottom of the comment.  You should really watch it.</p>

<p>And why do you say this evidence is &quot;crackpot?&quot;  Do you not think its credible because it&#39;s just ordinary people researching this and not some government agency with a fancy name and uniform?  This whole investigation started with the DNC&#39;s emails were dumped and users happened to find John Podesta speaking with the official FBI pedophile code language.  YOU can look at the emails yourself.  Not have somebody tell you what the emails say.  Just YOU and your EYES.  As goes for the logo of Besta Pizza that is just happened to be owned by Andrew Kline of the Human Trafficking persecution unit of the DOJ.  An official FBI pedo symbol that has since been changed as a result of this investigation.  All of this is not debatable so far.  These things have happened and you can physically see it.</p>

<p>While we are discussing undebatable facts that have happened, let&#39;s look at comet ping pongs Facebook.  You can see the weird pictures of kids they have posted.  There&#39;s a kid taped to a desk.  There&#39;s is a dude wearing a shirt that says &quot;I &lt;3 kids&quot; in French while he standing next to what looks like strippers.  There is a picture of a baby saying its for sale.  A lot of the photos are also liked publicly by John Podesta.  You can go on Facebook and look at all this if it hasn&#39;t been deleted yet.  Even then, countless people have screenshots.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why the FBI would not investigate these companies unless they had certain people in key positions like Andrew Kline to prevent them from investigating.  If I had a pizza place with weird pictures of kids the Facebook, pedophile code words in my pms, a pedophile symbol for the logo of the business, and a history of pedophiles in my inner circle, you would bet your ass that the FBI would be at my business in no time.  And that is what you should question the most.  Overall, why would the media not want this discussed?  After all, it&#39;s only an idea.  Ideas don&#39;t hurt people, actions do.  Why would Reddit try to squash the community behind the investigation.  Why can&#39;t I hear an opposition to this that isn&#39;t &quot;oh they are just a bunch of crackpot conspiracy theorists who don&#39;t know any better?&quot;  Why don&#39;t you actually point out which parts of evidence aren&#39;t right?</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/BplUD6kQYuU">https://youtu.be/BplUD6kQYuU</a></p>

<p>And I&#39;m feeling generous.  Here&#39;s some footage of Joe Biden molesting kids in public.  You&#39;re welcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me? I haven&#39;t downvoted anything, and I&#39;ve been elsewhere not reading the thread for a bit, chill.</p>

<p>When I say &quot;lies&quot; it&#39;s because I think that pizzagate is nonsense. It&#39;s literally made up. By insinuating that the people are child traffickers and paedophiles you are lying. On the balance of evidence, I think the people championing this are misguided at best. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s also impossible to ignore the political spin to this. The alt right that were galvanized by the Trump campaign are moving on to this - a paedophilic conspiracy by the liberal elite. It&#39;s not credible, none of the sources are strong enough to justify this becoming a massive deal. Which is why I understand and agree with Reddit&#39;s decision to ban the sub.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that I don&#39;t think shady shit is going down in many places. UK history shows that powerful people do seem to indulge in this kind of stuff. The Epstein Island thing seems to be shady as hell, and in that case it&#39;s easy to make the connections. I don&#39;t get that feeling in this case, the evidence is too sparse, and further context easily debunks so many points (i.e. The kill room instagram, obvs a Dexter reference).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so what I&#39;m getting is that you don&#39;t fully understand  pizzagate and that you don&#39;t know what a lie is (not trying to be rude). </p>

<p>Insinuating something or presenting evidence for something isn&#39;t a lie. Saying you believe evidence for something suggests a given thing isn&#39;t a lie. A lie is an intentionally false statement. It requires that you know the information is not true and that you are presenting it as fact.</p>

<p>Someone saying, &quot;The podestas fit very closely to the police sketches of the Madeline McCann kidnappers so I believe they are likely involved,&quot; is not a lie. Someone saying, &quot;Marina Abramovic participates in strange satanic rituals that appear to be more than just art,&quot; is not a lie.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is based on facts that do not necessarily prove wrongdoing but do build a network of circumstantial evidence for alleged wrongdoing. For someone to believe this evidence proves something is not a lie. </p>

<p>If there is a certain piece of evidence you think is untrue, however, that is a fair and different story. I would gladly hear what you have to say about some of them. But from what you&#39;ve said already, no, those are not lies. The podestas do look a lot like the police sketches and could be involved in the abduction and Abramovic does conduct strange satanic pieces that could be more than just art behind closed doors. You are free to believe that the evidence is not sufficient or that it isn&#39;t the case, but that does not mean others are wrong to believe there is more going on.</p>

<p>It is noted in your article that Alefantis owns at least three buildings, and the &quot;basement&quot; referred to is not specifically mentioned as being in the building. But when you are looking for something, you will look past these sorts of details. </p>

<p>Oh so are you backtracking now on McVeigh&#39;s involvement with your community? All I said was that if you&#39;re going to implicate everyone in the government because of that horrible case, then you also have to implicate everyone in your own community when the history of death and destruction is brought to light. You then proceeded to try to deny that said bloodshed existed, so I had to go and prove it to you, and then you denied McVeigh&#39;s motives, so I had to go out and prove it, and now you are far enough along in the conversation so that you think you can derail to your emotionally based avoidance of the logical conclusion. You might have pulled that off with other people, but you&#39;re not going to with me. </p>

<p><strong>Ironically, you just conspired to cover up your own community&#39;s history of violence and murder. There are many more examples of it, and no, I won&#39;t cite them and make you backtrack on whether or not your community had anything to do with them right now. If you want to blame everyone in government for that pedo ring, that&#39;s your business. Just make sure you&#39;re consistent and aggressively slather blame indiscriminately across your own community as well for your own history of bloodshed and attempted bloodshed.</strong> </p>

<p>I am theoretically applying your own standard of behavior to your own community, for the sake of showing you why your standard is absurd. If you don&#39;t like the standard I am applying then stop applying it to the government. Unlike you, who finds the entire government responsible, I do not <em>actually</em> find the entire conspiracy community to be responsible for these murders. I am simply extending your own belief system onto a group that you identify with, for the sake of illustrating to you why what you believe is ridiculous. And now, you have illustrated that you are not actually willing to consistently apply this standard, only selectively when it fits your narrative. </p>

<p>jeez... if this is the kind of stuff that you&#39;re gleaning from these sorts of comments it&#39;s no wonder you&#39;re unable to entertain an idea like Pizzagate... </p>

<p>The mark of an intelligent mind is the ability to entertain an idea without accepting it... remember that</p>

<p>Do you really think if someone designed a &quot;kill room&quot; (that looked just like a walk in) they would post it online? And someone who did the killing would post a comment referring to it as such?</p>

<p>At some point you have to take a deep breath and think hard about these &quot;clues&quot;. If you were running a child rape and murder center, would you post about it on social media and leave a trail of &quot;clues&quot; anyone with an internet connection could follow? </p>

<p>The FBI thing is proven pretty much solely by the timeline and proceeding actions/lack of actions on similar cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/f_bc12MVvSg">Keith Olberman lays out the timeline pretty well here.</a> And the entire US intelligence community has concluded that the Russians hacked the DNC.

<p>This is common sense shit, that literally stole an election. Corruption at the highest levels of government. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the entire US intelligence community has concluded that the Russians hacked the DNC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see this misleading bullshit line all the time and it&#39;s nonsense. It was one guy, who heads an organization, which represents many intelligence communities, saying, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few things there. Wikileaks doesn&#39;t reveal their sources. How can this agency know that the methods of the &quot;alleged hack&quot; are? Especially if it&#39;s just an alleged hack and not an actual hack. Even if they magically know the source of the emails, and how those emails were obtained, all it says is that the methods are &quot;consistent&quot; with Russian methods. There is no proof whatsoever that the Russians had anything to do with the Wikileaks emails. </p>

<p>The reason i said the line is misleading is that it was the head of one organization that put out this bullshit memo, so to say that &quot;the entire intelligence community agrees&quot; is misleading because it implies that all 11 or whatever agencies looked into it and all concluded that this was the Russians, which is simply not what happened. One guy heading up one organization said that the methods that he couldn&#39;t possibly know are somehow consistent with Russia&#39;s methods. </p>

<p>Excuse me if I&#39;m not entirely convinced by this. This is not &quot;proof&quot; by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What a way to try to malign the DNI. Do you know what the DNI does? I used to work for an organization under the DNI. What the DNI says represents the prevailing view of all of the member groups. The DNI&#39;s job is to decompartmentalize data between intelligence organizations. FBI, CIA, NSA and DHS input certainly went into that report. </p>

<p>You picked one out of context line from <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement">the DNI&#39;s statement</a> which represents the work and conclusions of tons of people, and specifically the DHS who joint released it. How about this line?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t say things like that lightly, and they are, again, a bunch of right wing Republicans. Their motivation here is being factual. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a ton more evidence that you&#39;re ignoring. Great collection of it was done by <a href="http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a49791/russian-dnc-emails-hacked/">Thomas Rid,</a> of the Department of War Studies at King&#39;s College London.</p>

<p>You&#39;re totally misrepresenting the situation to give yourself a sense of doubt. And yes, this is not a puzzle we have every piece of. But the overall picture is quite clear. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pizzagate doesn&#39;t have 1/100th of the evidence, and no one here gives a shit. Because everyone here is biased towards a narrative that makes them feel how they want to feel. Not towards the actual truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t. This article with a constitutional law expert lays this out pretty well here: <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/10/constitutional-law-expert-comey-not-violate-law-announcing-email-investigation.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/10/constitutional-law-expert-comey-not-violate-law-announcing-email-investigation.html</a></p>

<p>A notable takeaway, even if Comey did violate the Hatch Act, which he did not, this is not a criminal offense. </p>

<p>That link of collected &quot;evidence&quot; is hardly evidence at all, especially regarding the Wikileaks situation. There&#39;s a lot of &quot;probably&quot;s in there and no actual evidence. Like the DNI statement, there&#39;s not actual evidence that the Russians had anything to do with the DNC leaks. Why would the DNI statement say that they know the methods involved, then still call it an alleged hack? If they know the methods, then certainly they know it&#39;s a hack, right? They published that statement <em>really</em> quickly after the emails were made public. How were they able to find the leaker/hacker, analyse the methods used, and correlate them to Russian methods so quickly? It doesn&#39;t make sense. There is still no actual evidence. </p>

<p><em>Even if</em> Russia was involved in the hacks, does it matter? It seems clear to me this whole hubbub about whether Russia was or was not involved in the Wikileaks revelations is just a smokescreen to distract from what was in the emails themselves. </p>

<p>To use an analogy, if a burglar breaks into a house and discovers 10 dead bodies in the basement, it would be strange for all the headlines to read, &quot;Horrible criminal breaks into innocent citizen&#39;s house!&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m shocked that that website that&#39;s writing pro-Trump pro-Russia pieces picked this one guy&#39;s opinion. Here&#39;s an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/30/did-james-comey-break-the-law-when-he-told-congress-about-clinton-related-emails-maybe/?utm_term=.f08d274c2c42">equally valid opinion by another expert.</a></p>

<p>The Hatch Act can be violated <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2012/09/osc-report-sebelius-violated-hatch-act-081122">pretty easily.</a> We were warned about it constantly during election years when I was in intelligence. I don&#39;t see how Reid was wrong. Comey&#39;s actions for &quot;months&quot; ARE egregious in hindsight, if we know the FBI was investigating Trump simultaneously and not given the same formal letter writing treatment that clearly harmed her candidacy. If you treat a certain candidate differently than another, and it seems the NYC agents were doing this even more directly, that clearly is &quot;federal programs administered in a nonpartisan fashion.&quot;</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not criminal, you&#39;re right. I thought the Office of Special Council had prosecuting power. It&#39;s just a fireable offense. </p>

<p>Comey should be investigated and fired, the agents that helped Trump should be investigated and fired. </p>

<p>And this is all secondary to the Russia thing. A foreign power just, in part, decided our election. No matter who you support that should disturb you. You have no idea how intelligence works if you think there is going to be &quot;proof&quot; in a DNI press release. It&#39;s the summary of a bunch of classified data from a bunch of agencies. You don&#39;t just tell the Russians how you caught them. That would be insanely stupid. Again, it&#39;s a bunch of right wing GOP people, who only make statements like this when the information is conclusive. It makes them look bad. Our country was penetrated electronically by a foreign power, Russia, the biggest rival the US intel community has. You think they want to admit that? You&#39;re not using logic. </p>

<p>The emails were nothing. The DNC wanted one candidate over another candidate. Big whoop. They&#39;re a party, they can do what they want. I&#39;m not happy about what they did. But the RNC did the exact same things to try to suppress and freeze out Trump, it just wasn&#39;t successful. If you hack any political organization some dirt will come out. The DNC&#39;s dirt was miniscule. But Russia weaponizing Wikileaks and the right wing media with that info, where it was conflated out to something much larger, to try to decide our election is terrifying. </p>

<p>There weren&#39;t bodies. And this isn&#39;t a burglary. This is the future of our country. US citizens are going to die when they lose their healthcare, if abortion rights go away, etc. There are actual bodies on the line here. Wake up and see the actual conspiracy. It&#39;s not juicy and fun to obsess over, but it happened and changed all our lives. </p>

<p>Since others have been (rightly or wrongly) convicted based on even less evidence than what&#39;s been provided, I would think that any investigation would be better than none and would help clear this guy&#39;s name in the end. </p>

<p>At this point (actually way before this point) he should be the one pushing for an investigation in order to clear his name. At the very least he should have asked a film crew over to tour the basement instead of lying about it.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you ask <em>anyone</em> who&#39;s been investigated and cleared for child rape if having their name dragged through the mud in the media with an official police investigation how &quot;clearing their name&quot; went. Ask their former employers if they rehired them after immediately firing them for such atrocious accusations. Ask family members if they suddenly started talking to the accused after exiling them from their lives after hearing of the accusations. </p>

<p>You really have no fucking idea how serious the claims you casually toss around are, do you? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t totally believe any of this, but I don&#39;t totally dismiss it either. With this much smoke there&#39;s probably a fire around, but who&#39;s fire it is and who lit it are debatable.</p>

<p>As far as occam&#39;s razor, that could be used against your stance as well couldn&#39;t it? Or do you really believe that all of this just happened through sheer chance? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there is any evidence that this guy who went into comet with the gun had anything to do with r/conspiracy. We are not held responsible for shit that other people do. Mods have made it very clear this is sub does not by any means advocate taking action. </p>

<p>Edit: let&#39;s say I am on an animal rights forum. There is talk of a lab that is suspected of abusing animals and everyone on the forum agrees it is wrong and something should be done about it. Then a lunatic PETA member goes and blows up the lab. That lunatic didn&#39;t have any connection to the online forum. The people on the forum are responsible for that?  </p>

<p>Or how about someone who disagrees with abortion for whatever reason. If they are involved in an online community that shares their view, those people are responsible for the murder of the doctor who helps women get abortions?  </p>

<p>And now that you&#39;ve lumped all conspiracy theorists together, you&#39;d all agree that the whole &quot;one bad apple&quot; excuse doesn&#39;t apply to us, but you will jump at that when it comes to deep seated racism on a national level with our police/justice system?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let them control you like this. What happened was wrong and I&#39;m sure a vast majority of r/conspiracy would agree with that. Don&#39;t hold us responsible for the actions of others. Wrong is wrong, and this guy should have known better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, pretty much. Whenever I&#39;ve spoken out against Pizzagate, I get the same excuse I got during the Sandy Hook and Boston Bombing witch hunts: &quot;We&#39;re just asking questions! There&#39;s nothing wrong with asking questions!&quot; </p>

<p>Yup, there&#39;s nothing wrong with accusing literally everyone under the sun - including the <em>reddit admins</em> when they step in and try to enforce their site rules - of being pedophiles or allowing kids to be raped through inaction or some obscure action, with &quot;evidence&quot; cobbled together with diagrams, hundreds of red lines and leaps of logic so great it&#39;s impossible to follow as a &quot;normal&quot; person. </p>

<p>And sure enough we&#39;re seeing the consequences of &quot;asking questions&quot; just like we saw when conspiracy theorists started showing up armed at Sandy Hook schools, School Committee meetings and outside of victims&#39; houses harassing them. </p>

<p>But wait! Look! One person says a random traffic camera was tilted slightly and one of the <em>many</em> sources reporting on an armed man shooting up the pizza place we&#39;re telling our followers is owned by evil untouchable pedophiles who will never see justice unless we do something about it said it was published early! We&#39;re in the clear, it&#39;s a false-flag! </p>

<p>Well... there is a bunch of strange things going on with the Clinton Foundation, but why do we need to choose your narrative for you? This is proof enough to me that you&#39;re not actually interested in any of this. You need your hand to be held, and aren&#39;t willing to dig through it yourself. Sorry for not wanting to hold your hand, but don&#39;t blame me for your discomfort at someone else&#39;s narrative when you&#39;re just gonna turn around and pick up the other guy&#39;s (MSM) narrative when it comes down to it... maybe you should try to think for yourself instead of worrying about whose narrative you&#39;re following. </p>

<p>As long as they&#39;re not fucking your kids right?</p>

<p>My evidence for a nationwide government involved pedo ring was a nationwide group of government employed pedos... but of course it&#39;s not satanic enough and doesn&#39;t fit between your narrow goalposts so it doesn&#39;t count and these guys get a pass. This was all happening before pizzagate by the way... to any rational person with a heart in their chest, 42 arrests would mean there&#39;s probably more than 42 people involved. Couple that with the fact that they were mostly using government computers and you need to figure that - with the ages, and careers and lengths of time some of these people were in office - someone else must&#39;ve known outside of those 42 people. </p>

<p>Then couple that with the fact that the Podesta&#39;s hang out with known pedos, that James Alefantis&#39; instagram picture is a homage to a patron saint of pederasty, and include the knowledge that Laura Silsby was arrested for human trafficking and then freed by Clinton + given a job alongside the Amber Alert program... probably just coincidences right?</p>

<p>But yeah... just blow it off.</p>

<p>It must be fun to live in your world where the investigations are already concluded before they occur, and any questions outside the official narrative are met with derision. </p>

Even if we did have that kind of evidence, the people who had it would be put in jail for 30 years for &quot;pedophilia&quot; because they had video evidence. </p>

<p>I guarantee the guy is not going to get a real investigation <em>because of how much power he has.</em> He&#39;s not just some random pizza shop owner. He was literally listed in the top 50 most powerful people in the world, I think in 49th place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I repeat, there is no &#39;right&#39; to do what you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re exploiting a privilege, and if that privilege is taken away from you, you only have yourself to blame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only way they can take that privilege away is by taking away basically all of our internet rights; free speech for one. If they do that everybody suffers, and the UK already did so. Microsoft has a keylogger on windows, they take a high def picture of your face, THEN we have telemetry data they send back. They admit this as well. </p>

<p>They&#39;re already moving to take away any chance we have of un-fucking the world without violence. Because that&#39;s what we&#39;re headed to, a very bloody civil war. The average length of an empire is 250 years, and we are getting closer to that date every day. That&#39;s how long it takes for a government to go from for the people, kind of for the people, to corruption for power, and complete corruption for power. We are currently in that last stage.</p>

<p>Which is basically saying because we don&#39;t have a video of the guy killing/raping kids you won&#39;t take anything as evidence to at least have a real investigation into it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me tell you about evidence.</p>

<p>I once had a client whose claim was what is called &#39;misrepresentation&#39;. He had bought something because the guy who sold it told him a lot of lies. In particular, he told him: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;Hey, this guy has already bought this thing, he&#39;ll tell you all about how great it is. Plus, he can put you in touch with 3 or 4 other people who also bought the thing.&#39; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So my client called all these four people, and they all raved about the thing. Said they&#39;d had it for months, and it was amazing.</p>

<p>So he bought the thing.</p>

<p>By the time he came to me, <em>he had lost his case</em>. He couldn&#39;t figure out how. I told him there was only a really slim chance, if any, that I could pull his nuts out of the fire. [left out para setting out technical details]. He wanted to instruct me even though I told him costs would be high and prospects of success low.</p>

<p>I read his 70 page witness statement (that&#39;s right; 70 pages). It was hopeless. In all those 70 pages, only one paragraph (admittedly, it was more than a page long) dealt with this misrepresentation element. </p>

<p>But he had a statement from one of the four people saying that they&#39;d been offered an inducement to lie like a carpet to him, and stating that he was, in fact, the <em>first person</em> to ever buy the thing.</p>

<p>This was his light sabre, his rail-gun, his unanswerable argument. Everything else in his witness statement was unnecessary. All he needed to say was: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the thing because the seller gave me four names of people who&#39;d already bought the thing and they told me how good the thing was and it turns out that they were lying and that he arranged for them to lie to me. Please see the letter from one of those people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>The seller could not have succeeded</em>. The people he&#39;d &#39;bribed&#39; were highly unlikely to turn up at court and add perjury to their list of accomplishments.</p>

<p>In the end, he fired me. </p>

<p>He thought - you&#39;ll laugh at this, it&#39;s great - he thought he&#39;d lost because of a conspiracy between the solicitor acting for the seller, and a clerk at the court. This is because his letter, which he posted on Tuesday, wasn&#39;t in the Court bundle that was given to the judge by his clerk on the Friday. Never mind the fact of frequent postal delays; never mind the fact of commonplace delays in the court office in processing incoming post and getting it to the relevant file, never mind the fact of errors in everything human beings ever do. So far as he was concerned, the only possible explanation 
was a conspiracy. No evidence of such; his thought process was: the letter wasn&#39;t there; that benefited my opponent; therefore my opponent must have been responsible for it; and the only way he could have done that is if he conspired with court staff.</p>

<p>The possibility was absurd, and furthermore I&#39;m not going to make allegations like that without better evidence. So he fired me. Shame. I might have got him an appeal, if he&#39;d not been so pig-headed.</p>

<p>These things are COMPLEX. Evaluation of evidence requires EFFORT. It also requires INTELLECTUAL CAPABILITY. In another answer I wrote &#39;some people are better at baseball; some people are better at thinking&#39;. It&#39;s a fact; not so comfortable to the people who <em>aren&#39;t</em> so good at thinking, because who wants to think other people can do <em>that</em> better?</p>

<p>So: evidence is hard. </p>

<p>What are we going to do to get evidence, because we can&#39;t get evidence over the internet like this. It needs to be physical evidence.</p>

<p>&#39;Needing&#39; evidence - in this context, of an &#39;investigation&#39; or &#39;enquiry&#39; - suggests that you already have a conclusion. That&#39;s not how it works. In an investigation you look for the evidence, and if it isn&#39;t there, you abandon the investigation.</p>

Hopefully that won&#39;t involve shutting down the whole of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, because that would be a shame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2014 the Ninth Circuit Court ruled[6] that liability for a defamatory blog post involving a matter of public concern cannot be imposed without proof of fault and actual damages.[7] Bloggers saying libelous things about private citizens concerning public matters can only be sued if they are negligent i.e., the plaintiff must prove the defendants negligence – the same standard that applies when news media are sued.[8] The Court held that in defamation cases not the identity of the speaker, but rather the public-figure status of a plaintiff and the public importance of the statement at issue provide the First Amendment foundation.[9]</p>

<p>Yeah its defamatory but I&#39;m legally entitled to my opinion again. It would never stand up in court and, as defense his sexualized images of infants and toddlers would be shown, something tells me he doesn&#39;t want that.</p>

<p>He defamed himself with his creepy instagram account</p>

Fact of the matter is many people are, and they are the ones im referring to. People with one month old accounts flocking on to these forums to cast doubt and look down on people for merely investigating matters, like look at all these upvoted posts lol, what the fuck is their substance? All the same thing, you dont have complete 100% concrete evidence so stop bothering looking? If its all about evidence would you pls link me some in regards to the epidemic of personal attacks and comments directed towards possible pedophiles on here? There must be hundreds considering how many SJW/bot accounts repeat the rhetoric in here on a daily basis. So much so in fact, that alot of you dont think its worth investigating possible child murders and rape, and before you chime in and say &#39;oh im just saying we n33d more evidencez&#39; (which we all fucking agree with), due note that my original comment wasnt intended for people like yourself.

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying and I agree that everyone should try to reflect themselves from an outside perspective, obviously. I also think that the pizzagate community as a whole does not really do that and, as in most conspiracy theories, this ends in a lot of ignorant and fear driven tendencies that are in no way addressed - as far as I see. Cognitive bias to that degree are unbearable for me and the fact that critique is labeled as acts of &quot;shills&quot; does strengthen the impression, that beyond the unknown factual reality, conspiracy circles follow underlying agendas. So stop calling people shills for your own sake AND for your argument. Critique ultimately strengthens any cause - not using that is naive, childish and a sign of weak structure and arguments. </p>

<p>There are two possibilities:</p>

<p>If it turns out that the guy with the gun <em>was</em> motivated to take the law into his own hands because of all the pizzagate hysteria on the internet, then the hysteria will have come close to being deadly.</p>

<p>If it turns out that this wasn&#39;t what motivated him, then the problem is that for a short time, no-one could be sure the hysteria <em>isn&#39;t</em> what motivated him - and that tells us that it was only chance that gets the conspiracy spreaders off the hook.</p>

<p>I am not part of a lynch mob, and thus require no &quot;excuses&quot; for the actions of an individual(s) you claim to represent the views of another set of individuals.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve noticed that you changed your stance a bit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>0 evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>became </p>

<blockquote>
<p>0 concrete evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which I applaud you for. Now, it would be more true to say that you have found no concrete evidence, not that none exists.</p>

<p>Look, I don&#39;t want to argue here on and on. I understand where people are coming from with wanting to curb the vigilantism. What I want people to know is that from the outset, there have been a large number of individuals investigating the phenomenon of pedophilia rings that have called for exactly that: the prevention of a witch hunt. This thing has gotten very big. There are many groups and individuals with a variety of opinions.</p>

<p>I want to point out that there actually is evidence. It may not hold up in court (in fact I highly doubt it would). There is a term called circumstantial evidence. Any honest person doing even a modest amount of research into &quot;pizzagate&quot; will likely come to the conclusion that there is some evidence, as well as a whole lot of nonsense and noise. What I&#39;m trying to communicate is that the noise and nonsense doesn&#39;t erase the real evidence which is highly suspicious. Before you reply, consider at least one piece of information (which I will not even call evidence for the sake of not wanting to carry on with this tired argument). Please examine the death of Monica Peterson. Even though there may not be &quot;concrete evidence&quot; linking her to &quot;pizzagate&quot; or whatever else, please consider that real human lives are being snuffed out before you demand censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incorrect. But nice try. While I agree that Reddit or any other platform can (and will) censor users, as they have the right to, that is not what free speech means. Free speech is not granted as a privilege government, but is inalienable. The first amendment does not grant free speech. It denies Congress the ability to make law that would impede it.</p>

<p>Reddit is at liberty to shut down videogame discussions in general if they wanted to if they for some reason hated videogames. This is not about Reddit, or any particular forum. This is about conformist thought. All the fake upvotes and downvotes in the world aren&#39;t going to quell the discussion. Streisand effect is taking shape here, and the hush hush movement ain&#39;t working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;if he&#39;s not doing anything wrong he&#39;s got nothing to worry about&quot;. Exactly weren&#39;t we against this logic before. I know for a fact you can paint a pretty bad picture of me, if you go through my post history and actively chop and choose what you choose to present as &quot;evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used this example before but the reason these NSA things are so bad is that you can frame the argument by chopping and choosing what is shown. America probably just chose the most corrupt president they&#39;ve ever had and they did it because the (admittedly not innocent) other party was framed as worse.</p>

<p>For example if I told you to choose between this nice german man, who only wants what&#39;s best for Germany, and loves dogs vs this black terrorist who was arrested for treason and attempted murder and was so dangerous he was sent to prison on an island - Robben Island - who do you choose?</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not that bad. I mean as long as Alefantis (and let&#39;s use his real name to remember he is an actual human being) isn&#39;t being punished it&#39;s not that bad to investigate the innocent, right? It&#39;s just to prove his innocence then, right? Except James Alefantis is being punished. How many customers has James Alefantis lost in this time? How much emotional damage has James Alefantis suffered? The answer if he&#39;s innocent, is too much</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol nice to see you respond to me again at a completely different comment. Nah I&#39;m not forgetting shit. This isn&#39;t The_Donald - I don&#39;t have to agree with you. I&#39;m allowed to have a different opinion.</p>

<p>And my opinion is pizzagate is harassment and should be illegal. The law is slow, the problem of how to enforce it over the internet is real but ask yourself if the things the pizzagaters have done behind their computer screens wouldn&#39;t at least be criminal in terms of stalking, harassment and libel if they weren&#39;t done of the internet?</p>

<p>It would definitely be considered illegal if making new laws wasn&#39;t so shitty and the problem of how to enforce those laws such a massive issue. But it&#39;s not illegal is such a low fucking bar. I mean come on man, surely you&#39;re better than that. It&#39;s not illegal for me to destroy the world by creating a machine to release greenhouse gases but that&#39;s only because the law is a shitty immobile thing. But I consider myself better than that. Plus PS the spirit of the law does consider those things illegal even over the internet <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/11/what-the-law-can-and-cant-do-about-online-harassment/382638/">http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/11/what-the-law-can-and-cant-do-about-online-harassment/382638/</a></p>

<p>Like I replied to you in the other comment. The problem with this casual global citizen investigation (lol) is that they don&#39;t operate ethically and cant be held liable for their actions. Pizzagate quite clearly crosses the line between conspiracy into vigilantism to anyone that&#39;s followed it and maintained some modicum of impartiality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah I mean Saville proved that there are sick fucks everywhere. Hell what we should be doing is looking at that sony leak.</p>

<p>I dismissed pizzagate because I&#39;m familiar with the concept of if you look for a pattern you&#39;ll find one. And when I read the emails that&#39;s what I saw.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t see pedos. I saw people making inside jokes and weird innuendos. The same things I do except they were being judged under the light of being presumed guilty (admittedly at first, not guilty of being pedos but of being guilty).</p>

<p>And that&#39;s what happened people threw out theories about what they were guilty about and the pedo thing stuck and then people ran away with that. Except people forgot to ask if they&#39;re even guilty. And very quickly I realised I was participating and actively supporting harassment and stopped going to those sites</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it isn&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>......You need a gold medal in mental gymnastics. Are you saying the picture of the little girl being restrained isn&#39;t highly suggested? Or Comic Pong Pong having and promoting &quot;those posters&quot; aren&#39;t suggesting anything? Are you blind? Do they need to have a little girl licking a popsicle with her tongue sticking before you say its highly suggested? And here you are stating there aren&#39;t any connections whatsoever.
 You seem to have this misconception that conjecture is fabrication. Let me tell you this, it isn&#39;t. You can not make conjectures without having SOME evidence go off of. If you don&#39;t then you&#39;re are making up stories and not conjectures. 
 So if a guy who was trial for murder and was found innocent then a few weeks later after the trial he is found on video of himself bragging of how he got away with murder, would you say that isn&#39;t suggesting anything and isn&#39;t in any shape or form of him wrongdoing? Or do you think he is being misinterpret and being taken out of context?
It isn&#39;t normally for a pizza restaurant to have a cooler room like that. The cooler room in the photo seems like one for a butcher. Pizza restaurant usually don&#39;t butcher meat. It is rather odd for Comic Pong Pong to have a cooler of that size, while a smaller one would have been more sensible......</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, you know their restaurant space was purpose built for them, they didn&#39;t maybe lease an already finished restaurant space? What does it matter if their cooler room is bigger than they might need? Are you suggesting they have food in one half and a kiddie torture room in the other half? Because that&#39;s what it sounds like you&#39;re suggesting.  And it&#39;s the most retarded thing I&#39;ve ever heard. Maybe you should go sneak back there and check it out so you can alert the police. Or the health department that regularly inspects it anyway.  You aren&#39;t conjecturing, you&#39;re making shit up from whole cloth.  If a large cooler room is evidence of a child torture sex ring, then literally everything could be construed as &quot;evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>You posting about it on the internet is even stronger evidence that you&#39;re interested in pedophilia than that cooler room is. And man, if you live alone, or own a van, then god help you.  That&#39;s enough for a conviction on this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t make make any claims that the restaurant was built for them? Why are you making conjectures? :) How do you know that they might have lease the place for the large cooler room? If they did why would they want such a large cooler room? Could they be butchering meat? If so, what kind of meat are they cutting up? More importantly, why would a pizza restaurant be butchering meat?
A kiddie torture room you say? Man you and your conjectures, but that would explain the need for a cooler room like that. You find the thought of a cooler room being used as a kiddie torture chamber the most retarded thing you ever heard? You must have a very shelter life......I doubt I could &quot;sneak up&quot; on an actual kiddie sex ring and even if I did (based on their know relationships to some big cats) I doubt contacting the police would help much. The health department is already corrupt (just look at the current health industry in the US) so their inspections are worth jack-shit. 
Not everything can be used as evidence. For example, you can&#39;t use a picture of someone&#39;s who eating cheeseburger to prove that he is a vegan. Also, a piece of evidence can be used draw very different conclusions. For example, you have a student that get 100&#39;s on his tests while in the classroom with his classmates but get 50&#39;s when he is by himself. You could take that to mean he is a good cheater or you could take that to mean he works best while in a group or you could draw different conclusions.
 Your example is off (to say the least) since you are completely ignoring context that is available in front of you and would pretty much damn anyone on this thread. If you&#39;re saying they are taking pictures out of context, then I would like you to show evidence that they are misrepresenting Comic Pong Pong.......</p>

<p>Because most normal people, including most logo designers, have absolutely no idea of any damn pedophilia signs.

As for the sculpture, it&#39;s by Louise Borgeois, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=louise+bourgeois+artwork&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;bih=946&amp;amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLUz9U3MCrLSzJTQjC1lLKTrfTLMotLE3PiE4tKkJiZxSVW5flF2cUAlwHEaTwAAAA&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwio1qKdwd3QAhXEKJQKHRDUAWgQ_AUIBigB#safe=off&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=louise+bourgeois+hanging+artwork">and hanging bodies and parts</a> is one of her schticks. As for the paintings, they&#39;re by Biljana Djurdjevic, and her whole portfolio isn&#39;t just half-naked kids so much as half-naked <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=biljana+djurdjevic&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;bih=946&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG46HLwd3QAhWBHpQKHapBCFMQsAQIIw">everybody</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I just read as much about it as possible and, yeah, some of it is definitely a bit creepy. I can see how one might be convinced, especially if you already didn&#39;t like Hillary Clinton. The high rate of missing children is very weird, and a lot of the emails do seem pretty strange (although I am dubious about the &quot;code&quot;- I&#39;d like a source for that before I even considered believing any part of it because it&#39;s stated as authoritative fact and it kind of just seems made up). Oh and the sketches are eerily like the Podestas- if they were really in Portugal that is pretty strange, although I&#39;d like to know who exactly &quot;alleges&quot; this.</p>

<p>But several pieces of it are just obviously a huge reach, or outright false.</p>

<p>One thing that struck me in particular is that there doesn&#39;t seem to be a lot of internal logic. Like a lot of the evidence relies on the idea they were sort of &quot;hiding in plain sight&quot;. But why would they do that? They have so much to lose, and so much of this is very easily found. It just doesn&#39;t seem plausible that they&#39;d abuse children in a location that has a known paedophile logo on the front of it in a major metropolitan area.</p>

<p>And given that the well-established narrative is that they&#39;re abducting refugees and at risk children etc., <em>why on earth would they abduct Madeleine McCann?</em> I&#39;m not sure how familiar you Americans have been with the case prior to this whole thing, but there was a <em>huge</em> media furore about it. It absolutely dominated the headlines for a long period and returned sporadically to the news for years, every time there was a new development. This would not have been a surprise to them. So it just seems internally inconsistent that they would take such an enormous risk when they already had this much easier method of obtaining victims.</p>

<p>no silly, the entire dc music scene is pedos, also the entire art scene - i mean some of the pictures they&#39;re using as &#39;evidence&#39; are literally hanging in significant galleries being seen by hundreds if not thousands of people every day... and it&#39;s international, every art gallery in the world - i was in a really cool little space showing Gee Vaucher&#39;s work, the artist behind the legendary CRASS album covers, some of her work covers the subjects of violence against children - i mean sure she&#39;d say she&#39;d devoted her life to raising awareness and understanding of these things so we can try and confront them and stop them happening but i happen to be able to guess she&#39;s eaten [vegan] pizza at some point in her life!!!! </p>

<p>Literally everyone that has any form of education is an evil pedo, the evidence is obvious - i mean did you see the one they demonstrated that the Greek statue someone used as their avatar is probably an pedo... yes, i know it&#39;s crazy just imagine how long he must have had to search through antiquity to find someone involved in that sort of thing!  oh, and he&#39;s the most commonly represented figure in Greek statuary btw so basically anyone with any Neoclassical architecture or artwork is in the evil gang too....  </p>

<p>Suddenly though it becomes clear, it&#39;s the same people who have always been upto something, it&#39;s the evil smart people that stop us doing all the fun things we want to do like holding fireworks and getting rich on pyramid schemes.... </p>

<p>If it was damning evidence they would be lynched when people saw it.(And I&#39;m not calling for this either.)</p>

<p>Has no one around here ever worked in a restaurant? That&#39;s a walk-in freezer or fridge. Those units along the ceiling are the blowers that pump the cold air in. <em>Every</em> restaurant you&#39;ve ever been in has one or two of them. During normal daily operation they have racks around the walls with food stored on them.</p>

<p>This is a nice example of the logic problem with a lot of conspiracy theories. You&#39;re looking for and assuming something nefarious is going on, so you&#39;re going to find it whether it exists or not. It&#39;s all confirmation bias. </p>

*&quot;kill room&quot; = walk in freezer... that they have in every restaurant. the comments are just dark humor.<br/>
*that kid has masking tape on her, she was playing and looks like she&#39;s having fun. another kid probably taped her, parent snapped a picture of kiddo hijinx.<br/>
*flecks of color in the eye? not uncommon... could be reflection anyways<br/>
*a spiral triangle is a simple shape, easy coincidence to makes a spiral pizza slice.... they changed it once they learned of the similarity. (why would a pedophile lair use publicly known pedo symbols as a logo? seem kinda too brazen? or maybe just a coincidence?)<br/>
* looks like cool bands i&#39;d go see.<br/>
--seriously, lots of bands use scary-movie-poster style posters<br/>
* police render sketch actually does look close. i mean, generic faces but kinda creepy.<br/>
* thats not a spiral heart, that&#39;s an outlined heart, or two hearts... and come on, how cliche is a hand on a heart? I could find 1,000,000 hand on heart logos in one google image search<br/>
* the kidnapper potesta thing... and the art work... you should focus on just that. it&#39;s not evidence but at least interesting.<br/>
damn it... most of your evidence seems cray cray...

<p>The context is quite clear. And there&#39;s nothing about pizza in it either. A grandfather was sent an assortment of cheeses. He is waiting for his children/grandchildren to return from vacation so they can &quot;demolish them&quot; (eat the cheeses) together. It&#39;s pretty fucking straightforward.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been reading through pretty much all the &quot;evidence&quot; these people have invented. The only really scary thing to me about all this is that seemingly anyone can be accused of these heinous acts, and people will believe it based on insane interpretations of completely harmless statements and images.</p>

<p>literally nobody has stepped back and said &quot;hey, maybe thats something tons of restaurants put on their menus/advertisements because people have kids and want to know if it would be rude to bring them&quot;, literally just a cue as to the type of restaurant it is. </p>

<p>What indeed? For starters:<br/>
1. Less of James Alefantis&#39; life than the police have investigated.<br/>
2. A waste of your time.<br/>
3. A Rorschach test to see if you spend <em>way</em> too much time thinking about pedophilia.<br/>

5. Why we need to increase access to care for the mentally ill.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean believe? I just want you to address the facts of these two cases.</p>

<p>With Silsby we have Bill Clinton going out of his way to get convicted child-traffickers off the hook in Haiti. I heard that he has a connection or two to Alefantis and Podesta and Weiner and Epstein.</p>

<p>With the Franklin case we have a prominent example of how the ruling elite use pedophilia to control their lesser minions.</p>

<p>&quot;
This was the biggest pedophile scandal in the history of the U.S.A. The story received some newspaper coverage but there was a TV News Media blackout on the subject. For this reason, most Americans have never heard of it.</p>

<p>Former republican Senator John Decamp was involved in the production a documentary called &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot; it was to air May 3, 1994 on the Discovery Channel. This documentary exposed a network of religious leaders and Washington politicians who flew children to Washington D.C. for sex orgies. At the last minute before airing, unknown congressmen threatened the TV Cable industry with with restrictive legislation if this documentary was aired.&quot;</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in learning about pedophilia/child-trafficking and the government <a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">Laura Silsby</a> and the <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/Franklin/FranklinCoverup/franklin.htm">Franklin Cover Up</a> are a good place to start.</p>

<p>Of course it is. What it&#39;s <em>not</em> is ironclad, incontrovertible proof beyond a shadow of a doubt. It is, after all, a police statement on an arrest submitted to a wire service. Assuming he doesn&#39;t plead, we&#39;ll probably have to wait for his trial for more information as to his motives. But I&#39;ve asked you for hours for <em>any</em> evidence that the shooting was a &quot;false flag&quot;, of which you seem convinced, and you haven&#39;t provided a single piece of evidence relating to Edgar Welch. Why should I listen to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well right off the bat you have a &quot;phrase key&quot; that was pretty much invented by Pizzagators. There&#39;s zero evidence that any of those words mean anything. In order to get past the very first part of that photo, I need to take the word of the people inventing this conspiracy that their list of &quot;code words&quot; is accurate without any way to verify it. </p>

<p>So at the second line of your &quot;master evidence of Pizzagate&quot; I&#39;m already arriving at false, unverifiable information invented by those searching for a conspiracy. I continued, and found more fabricated information. there&#39;s a pic of someone affiliated with the resturant holding a kid with the hashtag &quot;chicken lover,&quot; with the infographic claiming that&#39;s a word used by pedophiles. Googling the phrase I only find references to a restaurant. Gooling &quot;Chicken Lovers&quot; + pedophilia I only get articles about Pizzagate. Another fabricated pedophilia &quot;code word&quot; that the existence of this conspiracy relies on. </p>

<p>Funny that people say this after an actor supposedly goes into a pizza parlor with a gun. No video evidence of that. No testimony other than police. In fact there&#39;s testimony to the contrary saying &quot;there were no gunshots, and I was one of the last to leave the building&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very much in favor of investigating the emails, but too many assumptions have been made along the way and this public &quot;investigation&quot; is compromised. Possibly by CTR, but also possibly just by dumb kids.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know what to do with people anymore. Some people are so comfortable with their lives they don&#39;t want to break their delusion that something like this isn&#39;t possible. I&#39;m getting sick of it. Here, let me take out some of the bits that have no reliable source. No cheese pizza, chicken lover, or anything else. No &quot;code&quot; bullcrap included. The case does not solely rely on bullcrap code. I would hope people could actually filter properly but I guess not. I have to hold everyone&#39;s hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all very fascinating but extremely disjointed and still not evidence of anything. Everything that you just mentioned I could pull an explanation out of my ass for, each one something other than &quot;evidence of a massive pedophile conspiracy.&quot; But you know that, and you know that your assumption of the value of these items is exactly that: an assumption based on the conclusion that you want to see.</p>

<p>Like I said, the entire public &quot;investigation&quot; is compromised by people like you. Maybe you&#39;re working for someone and you&#39;re doing this to discredit the investigation from the inside, or maybe you&#39;re actually retarded enough to think that what you&#39;ve just provided me is evidence of anything but confirmation bias.</p>

<p>Regardless of which is true, it&#39;s just ridiculous. It was a very important investigation and people like you fucked it up. Whether you were paid to or whether you&#39;re just so fucking stupid is beyond my knowledge, but I hope you&#39;re proud of yourself.</p>

<p>I support the theory and the investigation. I DO NOT support confirmation bias. I follow facts and convincing data. All of this data is random and not convincing to form a single large narrative. The fact that you think otherwise is confirmation bias in action. Please, for the love of god, pretend to be intelligent enough for a moment and perform a legitimate investigation instead of spreading so much misinformation that no legitimate investigation can be had in the public square.</p>

How convenient.[A psyops]) is what convinced me that this investigation is legitimate. The very thing that actually convinced me there&#39;s something to this investigation is how much every single &quot;official&quot; news source is trying to debunk/discredit it. How the &quot;Fake News&quot; narrative was pushed immediately after google searches of pizza-gate went rocketing.</p>

<p>I know another guy that fits those descriptions. Oh shit, you think he&#39;s connected? My kid drew a picture of both him and the guy you&#39;re talking about and both of their heads were round. Looks similar. Smoking gun!</p>

<p>This is retarded. I support the investigation, I do not support people like you unwilling to question the incredible leaps made by extraordinary assumptions along the way. So much of this investigation is borderline kindergarten quality. I don&#39;t even know what I support anymore when I say &quot;I support the investigation.&quot; All I seem to find are people like you involved in it now. The intelligent people seem to have jumped ship already.</p>

<p>Fuck the CTR shills for polluting the investigation with false information, and fuck the people who propagate their false information to discredit what was, originally, a very important investigation. I hope someone, somewhere, is investigating it all on their own from the beginning. Whoever is driving/funding this needs people like me to be downvoted so the child-like investigative &quot;evidence summaries&quot; can be promoted to the top, to frame us all as unintelligent. It&#39;s working, too. That&#39;s the conspiracy in front of us right now, and it&#39;s being drowned out.</p>

<p>Surely you must see this? If someone turns round and says: &#39;Sean Hannity skins kittens alive and fries and eats their organs&#39;, nobody goes around to arrest Sean Hannity. They say &#39;What makes you say that?&#39;, and then you say: &#39;There&#39;s this email in which he says that&#39;s what he does&#39;, and if they police investigator reads the email and you&#39;ve misunderstood, then there is no further investigation.</p>

<p>Also, I didn&#39;t make any remark about &#39;everyone in this sub&#39;. I didn&#39;t even talk about everyone in this thread. My remarks are to those people who posture and aggrandize themselves as &#39;defenders of little children&#39; while burbling on about inconsequential particulars and grabbing this fact from that continent and that fact from this continent and then amazing themselves with the wonderfulness of their creation - in the meantime making the most utmost serious allegations against people merely because they don&#39;t like them.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t just a question of being entitled to a trial; the allegations against Hillary Clinton are partly involved in handing the Presidency to the Ghastly Gurner, one of the most godawful twats in politics. And yet these allegations are either untrue outright or hugely inflated. Saying things over and over without properly checking your sources is damaging, and those of us who understand these things better - sorry, but there it is, some people are better at baseball, some people are better at thinking - have every right to call <strong>BULLSHIT</strong> when we see it happening.</p>

<p>The law of evidence in the UK (technically, England &amp; Wales) is not the same as the law of evidence in the US. But most of the principles are the same. You cannot throw a couple of hundred grains of sand on the floor and exclaim that you have a beach.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s a bit of a leap. Nothing? Like nothing at all?</p>

<p>1.) Billy boy Clinton, he has his paws all over Comet Ping Pong, he&#39;s also flying to Haiti to broker deals for the release of convicted child traffickers. He&#39;s also flying around with convicted pedophile Epstein, and is obviously tied to Huma Abedin&#39;s pedophile husband Weiner. And he also has numerous accusers of rape and child abuse. </p>

<p>2.) We have James Alefantis&#39; disturbing instagram account, nothing needs to be said here. Any parent can see how horrifying it is. Anyone can make the conclusion that there are subliminal messages in his post.</p>

<p>3.) John Pedo-esta, long known to have a taste for the young ones evident in his art and emails about pizza that make 0 sense in context, but complete sense when applying the Wikileaks confirmed pedophile code uncovered by the FBI.</p>

<p>4.) The Rao character being connected to the disgusting Alefantis Instagram while at the same time prosecuting child sex abuse crimes.</p>

<p>5.) The Franklin cover-up, shows that pedophilia is a tool used by the ruling elite on both sides of the political spectrum for blackmail purposes against their lesser minion politicians. </p>

<p>6.) Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House, admitted child molester gets 15 fucking months. Hastert, Pedo-esta, Weiner, Epstein, Laura Silsby, Brownstone....Yeah alright we have nothing. Now you&#39;re gonna tell me Podesta forgot his handy map of the local pizza restaurants behind that&#39;s all!   </p>

<p>lol we are talking about facts here my delusional friend.</p>

<p>Fact #1. Laura Silsby and company were lying to parents in Haiti that they were taking their children someplace inside the country where they would be able to see them again, but instead trying to illegally smuggle them out of the country never to be seen by their real families again. They were convicted of child-trafficking by Haitian authorities and were represented by a lawyer with known ties to child-trafficking. These children weren&#39;t even Orphans...</p>

<p>Fact #2. Billy boy Clinton flew to Haiti in the flesh to broker a deal to get these subhumans off the hook for their crime. </p>

<p>Fact #3. Billy boy Clinton and his succubus &quot;wife&quot; are known associates of James Alefantis as evident in the Instagram posts and Wikileaks emails. Having had multiple events at the restaraunt.</p>

<p>Fact #4. That Instagram content is completely disgusting and has multiple subliminal messages referencing pedophilia. Art on the walls is horrifying as well.</p>

<p>Fact #5. Franklin Cover up proves  the use of pedophilia by the ruling elite to control  their lesser pawns is a tactic employed by these depraved individuals. </p>

<p>Fact #6. Billy boy Clinton, close pal of Alefantis, also flies around in jets with CONVICTED pedophiles. </p>

<p>Fact #7. Anthony Weiner, with a taste for young girls, is also a part of this circle of corruption. </p>

<p>My father is a relatively wealthy business owner, I actually know a thing or two about private jets and their charter prices. Round trip Washington-Chicago you are looking at around $20,000-30,000. So how many pizzas/hot dogs can you acquire with the rest of the funds?

<p>That&#39;s how homosexual relationships worked back then, jesus christ. If you cared at all to actually learn about him, he&#39;s been an icon of homosexuality for like 200 years.

<p>This is from Wikipedia:</p>

<p>For centuries, pederasty had long been socially acceptable among Greece&#39;s leisured and citizen classes, with an older erastes (aged between 20 and 40) undertaking a caring sexual relationship with an eromenos (aged between 12 and 18) and taking a key role in their education;[20] and Hadrian took Antinous as a favoured servant when they were aged about 48 and 13. Such a societal institution of pederasty was not indigenous to Roman culture, although bisexuality was the norm in the upper echelons of Roman society by the early 2nd century.[21]</p>

<p>&quot;we plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be uber service to transport Ruby, Emerson and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you&#39;ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.&quot; </p>

<p>They are being identified as entertainment for an adult. Horrifying, </p>

<p>And again, keep using the historical context that the homosexual icon lived in to misinterpret the facts. I bet Romeo and Juliet is pedo porn too?</p>

<p>Again what do we call 48 year olds who sleep with 13 year olds now? Sure it was acceptable in ancient Greece, Alefantis must long for such a time. Was Romeo 48 and Juliet 13? </p>

<p>For an <em>all-ages show</em>, it&#39;s not a deal breaker. You&#39;re trying to manipulate the language on a concert poster to mean something else. Let&#39;s just remember that this is a musician with a shocking homosexual schtick, not a member or in any way related to comet pizza. He&#39;s putting on a show that doesn&#39;t serve alcohol (thus all-ages) and promoting it on his own time with a penis image. Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhocking. </p>

<p>Ha. Either she thinks her kids are fun, or it&#39;s a tongue-in-cheek way of saying that these kids are a handful, so have fun corralling them. Only a sick mind would take such a thing to mean &quot;worldwide pedo ring confirmed.&quot; </p>

<p>Like, they talked about heating up the pool for the kids to swim in. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nowadays they would be a criminal. Unfortunately, history doesn&#39;t fit neatly into the way we model society now, so some of the only homosexual love stories are in the Roman-style context. It&#39;s happenstance- <em>if you actually bothered to look into what he has historically represented, it is homosexuality only.</em> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was Romeo 48 and Juliet 13?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they were both 13, which would be a scandalous, disgusting story today. But we ignore that, because in the historical context it wasn&#39;t icky, and we instead focus on what makes it an interesting, moving tale. Like Antinous. </p>

<p>Not all sexualizations of children are equal, as your refusal to acknowledge Romeo and Juliet proves. Antinous is a romantic homosexual story, loved by loads of homosexuals who aren&#39;t pedo / ephebophiles. That&#39;s just how homosexual relationships worked back then. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll just remind you that the age of consent in a lot of places is still 14, so not everyone shares our perception of sexual maturity. And it&#39;s STILL mutually exclusive with pedophilia, which is the sexualization of <em>pre-pubescent children.</em></p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s objectively a different sexual fetish, there is no room for interpretation there.

<p>You don&#39;t seem particularly disturbed by it, in fact you keep mentioning how normal it used to be as a justification for using Antinous as your profile picture. You are basically saying that since it used to be normal for grown men to sleep with boys that there&#39;s nothing strange about Alefantis choosing him as his profile picture. That&#39;s without even considering the date rape drugs, moloch, lolita, and all the young children on the page given that context the choice of Antinous becomes even more disturbing. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>What do we call 48 year olds that fuck little boys? Normal adults? Pedophilia is defined as a sexual attraction to children. A 13 year old is a child. Antinous and Hadrian&#39;s relationship was pedophilia no matter how hard you deny it.</p>

<p>Look up the definition for pedophilia there&#39;s no age limit. </p>

<p>Read about Corey haim and Corey Feldman or what Elijah wood said about how rampant pedophilia is in hollywood.</p>

<p>To act like this is unprecedented and &quot;nuts&quot; shows you are simply uniformed about a lot of this stuff or you think it&#39;s ok, idk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you seriously not understand what potential means?  It doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not pedophiles now, it just means it hasn&#39;t been proven, it&#39;s like saying alleged.</p>

<p>Denny Hastert,  Jeffrey Epstein, Anthony Weiner etc set a precedent.  It&#39;s not some insane conspiracy theory like the dems claiming Trump was a Russian Agent, with absolutely no proof.</p>

<p>There is nothing dangerous about talking about this and it is astonishing that people are so intent on defending it or making excuses for these people.  Like why have you spent so much time online tying to convince people of something you clearly don&#39;t have a clue about?  The reason there is no concrete proof is because the Washington elites and msm won&#39;t cover this story.  The same people that lied about hands up don&#39;t shoot,  Duke lacrosse, mattress girl etc. so when the msm is willing to run stories that are proven to be false and had no proof but not willing to even discuss this?  It doesn&#39;t make sense and god forbid they do prove that any children have been hurt because of people like you who try to shut down discussion than you are going to look really bad.</p>

<p>Look what happened at Penn State, do you remember how many people deemed that insane before all the facts came out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The potential to be a pedophile absolutely makes sense and the fact that you are sitting here incorrectly playing semantics to change the subject from child rape because of whatever weird agenda you have. </p>

<p>You must be one of the people who thinks pedophillia isn&#39;t a crime, it&#39;s only a disorder.  </p>

<p>Trump was accused of raping a 13 year old during the election with absolutely no proof and the media and dems ran with it because it fit their narrative. </p>

<p>So maybe instead of trying to misconstrue my words to make your point you can explain to us why you so adamantly defend or overlook children being raped?  Clearly you don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad thing and shouldn&#39;t be investigated unless caught in the act right?  </p>

<ul>
<li>800,000 total children (including teenagers)</li>
<li>About 200,000 kidnapped by their own parents</li>
<li>Majority of the rest are teenagers who fled home, got trapped with wrong gangs, fake modelling jobs, got lost, etc. (the majority of missing children are not kids but teenagers)</li>
<li>About 1000 kidnapped by total strangers</li>
<li>About 100 &quot;white van kidnapper&quot; kind of scenario (called stereotypical kidnapping). Apparently, half come home.</li>
<li>Over 96% of all abductees return home within 24 hours, majority are teenage runaways</li>

<p>Those statistics should &quot;cheer&quot; you up in the circumstances. Most kidnappers are also known to the child/teenager. Parents are the biggest kidnappers!</p>

<p>Also.... I&#39;d like to point out that these are the US stats, so maybe the huge &#39;child trafficking network&#39; isn&#39;t that big in USA but still there.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever wondered why Haiti international adoption was 50% lower on the year of the 2010 earthquake... in a country where lot of children are undocumented.... where huge mining and clothing industries got built..... <strong>and where the Epstein Foundation is building at least one mega school</strong>...... and that foundation also funds studies about human behaviors &amp; AI, and stuff that would be highly unethical to test on human subjects  .............</p>

<p>Why the adoption should be higher than the previous and next years? Because half of the population are kids........................ Doesn&#39;t take a math genius to figure out even without looking at the casualties there&#39;s most likely more kids orphans than parents whose kids died.

Don&#39;t go insecure thinking I&#39;m trying to disprove the fail pizzagate by using Haiti; both are possible at the same time but maybe you guys don&#39;t have much interest in black little kids, I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not a secret either there&#39;s a lot of child labor there, just read the reports, check which corporation did the pay-to-play. Lot of relationships. You guys are horribly insecure and terrible investigators. I also find it interesting the Epstein note is of no interest to any of you and was mentioned many times....!

    <div class="md"><p>Because pizzagate is focused (or pretends to be) on young children, not teenagers. So using the whole 800k statistic for it is a bit deceitful and also takes some focus away from the majority of victims. All victims are important but let&#39;s just say 100 vs 800k changes where you&#39;re going to look at to find a (some) network(s). It shows the young child trafficking network are very small and the children are most likely trafficked by their own parents than really kidnapped as we imagine with the stereotypical kidnapping scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>eg. More probable scenario: the mom never &#39;lose&#39; her kids to a kidnapper... she pimps the kid herself.</strong>  Those kids are not on these stats but are certainly in much larger number than 100 per year.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to look at the stats for what they are so the children can be really helped instead of looking at &quot;huge networks&#39; that might be very rare or not exist in the way people think.</p>

<p>The teenagers in questions are not all &quot;kidnapped&quot;; they are mostly runaways and teens who were promised modeling jobs, babysitting jobs, shelter jobs for money or drug or attention. Teenagers who made bad choices but still choices. So you&#39;re not going to find them at the same place as the young kids. You&#39;ll find most of them in prostitution rings, that&#39;s very different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well... I&#39;m not the one using &quot;LOL&quot; and throwing random baseless unrelated statements regarding a child sex abuse topic.</p>

<p>If your pizzagate is about the biggest majority of victims:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why are you guys panicking with innocent baby pictures of a father and his son, and see sex into it?</strong> Avg age 2-4 yo </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why do you panic and post half the art collection of that painter if your focus isn&#39;t about young children?</strong> avg age 6-10yo </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why do you mix McCann to this?</strong> age 4yo</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why is it that 90% of your &#39;proofs&#39; and &#39;arguments&#39; are related to babies and very young children, and not a single teenager or hebephile reference besides Epstein picture?</strong> ....</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do you guys have any clue what is a pedophile and what is a hebephile, and how they are so different that they cannot really be mixed together or even investigated the same?</strong> You have zero profiling or psychological research about both types but you are still doing some switch and bait using one or the other to prove your &#39;huuuuuuge&#39; pedophilia network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Did you read all the Epstein police reports and know how the victims got in touch with Epstein?</strong> Their own friends recruited them for money. It was a pimp &quot;commission based scheme&quot; with willing participant avg age 17, youngest 15.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How did Savile got to his victims?</strong> Most of time, the parents brought the children. No trafficking or network. The guy is actually a very opportunistic sexual predator, his victims range from 8yo to 75yo (seventy-five years old!)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bosnia &#39;pedo&#39; ring??</strong> This?  <em>&quot;1999: Whistle-blower Kathryn Bolkovac, who was working as a UN International Police Force monitor in Bosnia, *</em>reveals UN police officers were paying for prostitutes and participating in trafficking of young women from eastern Europe as sex slaves*<em>.</em> (hint: young women = adults)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>England ring?</strong> WHICH ONE!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hasterman?</strong> Do you mean Dennis Hastert? He was a teacher who had access to young boys.... Not really a pizzagate with pizza and occult. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hollywood ring?</strong> Fits exactly what I described about teenagers (recruited and abused through promises of work, money,drug or fame)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dutroux?</strong> That&#39;s probably the closest to your &quot;pizzagate&quot; and not. Maybe you guys are too scared to investigate OTO and I wouldn&#39;t blame you...</p></li>
<li><p>etc. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>how did you jump to that conclusion?!?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t promote anybody doing anything crazy like that. I&#39;ve never argued against having evidence, but stopping people from doing research and such is crazy. I don&#39;t agree with vigilante justice, but I don&#39;t think people taking an interest in helping uncover corruption and horrific crimes isn&#39;t bad either. There is a line that can be crossed, but you are taking it to the other extreme. </p>

<p>History is littered with powerful people having terrible systems of abuse and fronts for carrying out that abuse. If you want an example that has been actually admitted and (attempted) to be remediated, look into the Residential Schools for aboriginals in Canada. The Canadian, English, and certain Churches systematically tortured, murdered, and tested (medically and otherwise) on children who were taken from their families up to as late as the 1960s/1970s. Also, the Jimmy Savile thing was a more recent connection. Governments have been involved with extremely terrible things like this before, so people don&#39;t give the benefit of the doubt. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily a bad thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is let these people do their internet sleuthing. If they come up with evidence that can be acted upon, that is a plus, correct?</p>

<p>I am totally on your side about vigilante justice, but we don&#39;t go and shut everything down because one person took it too far. Also, if you are dealing with corruption, there is a good chance that these things could be a discredit to the whole investigation. </p>

<p>This all started with FBI memos and weird pictures, not based on some crazy person making a claim out of nowhere.  This might be very unfair to Comet Pizza, but life isn&#39;t fair. People will suss out fire if they smell the smoke, and while I personally don&#39;t see any smoking gun evidence with comet pizza, I also haven&#39;t really looked very deeply into it (and frankly i&#39;m unwilling to considering the content and the subject matter). As long as people are respecting those who are uninvolved, I don&#39;t think its something we should be hating on. History has shown us time and time again that powerful people and governments can do horrific things under our noses.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, there&#39;s a public campaign of harassment. Investigation is carried out by the police or other law enforcement agencies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there&#39;s no investigation then you have no need to be here vehemently denouncing silly conspiracy theory talk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no investigation. However, I&#39;m here because the harassment conducted by people with the same crazed opinions as you resulted in an armed assault upon the establishment in question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are you afraid of?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More idiots like today&#39;s one being inflamed to further acts of violence by people like you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reasonable suspicion exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. There has not been one shred of reasonable evidence presented by anyone, in this thread or out of it, to implicate the business in question in any illegal activities relating to either minors or the Democratic Party.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this case it takes the form of lying publicly while attempting to discredit public researchers who are only digging through publicly available resources. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t call &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; <em>after</em> the fact. Reasonable suspicion has to exist <em>before</em> an investigation is conducted (leaving aside the aforementioned fact that what has happened so far has not been an investigation, but rather harassment). Also, just because information is public doesn&#39;t mean that using that information inappropriately is acceptable. If someone published your name and home address on Reddit and asked for people to send you death threats, that would most certainly constitute harassment, and is in fact what has been done to the business and its staff.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Encrypting his website&quot;... do you actually know what those words mean? And why should he be obligated to do anything whatsoever to mollify his harassers?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s as responsible as anyone else you&#39;d like to blame for how this pans out.</p>

<p>No he&#39;s not, neither legally nor morally. People like you need to directly bear the blame for what happened today and previously.</p>

<p>Launched in 2006, Comet Ping Pong is Alefantis’ first restaurant in which he’s the executive chef, and only second as owner, after Buck’s Fishing &amp; Camping — which he had opened roughly two years before, and two doors down Connecticut Avenue.</p>

<p>Last year, Alefantis estimates, he bought 12 tons of Toigo tomatoes, which Stello turned into sauce and canned before trucking the jars to the basement at Buck&#39;s Fishing &amp; Camping, Alefantis&#39; other restaurant nearby.</p>

<p>I disagree. They are usually under no responsibility to inform the public, but in this case, they most definitely are. Otherwise, there would be no end to the amount of lunatics going to check things out at Comet. They not only owe it to the public, they owe it to Comet and its employees. If this pizzagate thing doesn&#39;t die out on its own, the authorities have a responsibility to address everything that&#39;s come out, from the Twitter pictures to the emails. </p>

Considering the fact that Breitbart concluded, based on his own investigation, that the Podestas were proponents of a pedo ring back in 2011 before the Podesta email leak even happened, I think it&#39;s perfectly rational for people to investigate the matter further. Do I support people harassing the owners of Comet Pizza and other individuals who are only implicated through speculative evidence? No, I don&#39;t think any decent person here does. I understand that if you don&#39;t support the investigation, as there is a lot of missing information right now, but you don&#39;t have to demean the people participating. The same goes for the other party, nobody should be harassing anyone based on drawn conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not even a little, really? If there IS a massive pedo ring operating out of that pizzeria, and the cops won&#39;t do anything, what did you expect to happen? If these allegations are true, fine.  But if they aren&#39;t, then all the conspiracy theorists constantly spreading fake stories and making something out of nothing are at least partly responsible. Yes, the dude is deranged and that&#39;s not on you, but on some level if you&#39;re responsible for spreading bullshit, eventually there will be real-world consequences and people will get hurt.  Maybe not by an armed gunman, but by everyone calling them a pedo for working as a just a regular delivery guy for just a regular a pizza place.  Just something worth considering.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just it. There has been way too many incidents when police or the media or politicians or others who blatantly lied about all kinds of thing. Start with the Kennedy Assassinations. Both of them. We&#39;re told that neither were conspiracies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know all the details surrounding it, but what I have seen is that there are numerous videos of &quot;parents&quot; being interviewed by news people that look like community theater level acting. Seriously bad. One video shows a guy smiling and joking, then he stops and takes a minute to get his acting face on and proceeds to do a completely amateurish and unconvincing acting job about his kids and what happened. Then there is another female parent who tearfully, but without actual tears, tells about going to get her child at a pick up spot, and a few minutes later in the same interview repeats the story but says that her husband had gotten the child and left by the time she got there. Etc.</p>

<p>Feel free to google &quot;sandy hook fraud&quot; or similar phrases and see for yourself. It becomes obvious very quickly that these parents were actors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so let me briefly talk about this because it&#39;s insanely important. </p>

<p>So as you now know, I was a mod for r/pizzagate and I was honored. Anyway, the admins had messaged us <strong>one time</strong> <em>before</em> the subreddit was shut down. In their first message they outlined what the issues were and we addressed them accordingly, making sure that no rules were broken. We were literally online modding 24/7. Literally. When the admins shut us down we reviewed mod logs and user accounts and found some very suspicious activity that can&#39;t be described as anything other then sabetoge. Just after r/pizzagate was made someone beat us to voat.co and made v/pizzagate. It was predominately inactive with only a few users. Following the shutdown of r/pizzagate, when then moved over to voat.co/v/pizzagate to continue our modding there since we were the original mods. The thing is the lead mod there gave us a hard time and subsequently removed us one day without warning after a voat user discovered that the lead mod was censoring and removing crucial information. After our removal, the lead mod there then appointed unvetted, unknown mods who continued to remove important things. We never knew who the guy was and we had no power to remove the lead mod. We were forced to hand over the investigation to someone we didn&#39;t know and we had no other options. Afterwards the issue was discussed,  there is only 2 things the mod can be - a plant who was there to sabetoge the whole thing or a government employee. All in all, as a x-mod, I don&#39;t trust v/pizzagate anymore.</p>

<p>The only evidence that it could be fake is that it might be illustrate the harm of baseless witchhunts, and that its part of the grand conspiracy. That is, no evidence, so far.</p>

<p>When a massive global baseless witchhunt fueled by fantastic pedophilia and Satanism allegations, and the targets are just chilling right in public, it seems inevitable that some loonies will try to fuck them up. Just like there are people who troll sex offender lists harassing and attacking the people on them.</p>

<p>There is a reason why you don&#39;t scream pedophile! without concrete evidence: it fucks all kinds of shit up, maybe permanently for some of the targets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So he did fire a gun and was there threatening people to look for the underground child trafficking tunnels that he read about in online conspiracy forums and websites and which have been debunked by multiple news outlets.  </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Jesus Christ</p>

<p>&quot;The “PizzaGate” conspiracy theory spread on social media, including Facebook and Twitter, and on Reddit, until it was banned from discussion on that website.</p>

<p>The owners and employees of the Comet Ping Pong pizza place told the New York Times they received threats because of the debunked theory, which many have said was spread as “fake news” to try to bring down Hillary Clinton and her campaign.</p>

<p>“From this insane, fabricated conspiracy theory, we’ve come under constant assault,” James Alefantis, Comet’s owner, told the Times in a November 21 report. “I’ve done nothing for days but try to clean this up and protect my staff and friends from being terrorized.”</p>

<p>This gets nuttier and nuttier:</p>

<p>Other people have gone to the restaurant to search for the tunnels, WUSA-TV reports.</p>

<p>“They putting a lot of curses and spells over the city,” a woman who was trying to find the tunnels told WUSA. “All this underground tunnel that helps them take the kids and transport them back and forth so they can do these rituals.”</p>

<p>Wtf?  </p>

<p>Oh this guy was just an actor though:
On social media, many of those who believe in the false PizzaGate theory are pointing to Welch’s past in movies as proof he is a “crisis actor,” hired to carry out a “false flag” operation at Comet pizza.</p>

<p>Hey is it possible he didn&#39;t even have a gun and it was a magic wand?  And maybe didn&#39;t have bullets but shot lightning bolts?  Have we contacted Hogworts yet?  Has Dumbledore spoken out on this yet?</p>

<p>Serious question from someone who usually doesn&#39;t post on this subreddit: If there really is a child porn ring going on and no one is doing anything about it wouldn&#39;t street justice be viewed as legitimate?</p>

<p>I think if you polled most Americans and asked them if there was a child porn ring going on and the authorities refused to prosecute the majority would be in favor of taking action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow, they are really getting desperate, hiring a crisis actor to pretend to be one of us. self-investigating with guns? none of that makes sense. if anyone was investigating, they would bring cameras, not guns. and if they had a gun for protection, it would be a small gun, not an obvious big gun. the news outlets are really pushing the fake conspiracy story. nothing about what happened looks like the actions of an investigator, it doesn&#39;t even look like the actions of a vigilante looking to carry out justice on comet. it stinks of a poorly put together false flag op</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to go that route: maybe go rent a 6 year old boy to finger your anus for a night, you might calm down.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a personal attack.  You&#39;re using a euphemism to claim that I&#39;m a pedophile because you disagree with a statement of mine.  I&#39;m not going to lie and say that I wouldn&#39;t punch someone in the throat for that shit in person.  Regardless of what you feel is going on, a person just entered a public business with a firearm and brandished it.  Either you think that was a &quot;false flag&quot; or it was a legitimate incident, but less than a day later you&#39;re making light and casually accusing someone of being a pedophile.  Socially speaking, you&#39;re clearly fucked up.</p>

<p>Pedesta emails started with strange wording, which was determined to be code, which was determined to refer to child sex.  That has spun out to accusations of necromancy, satanic rituals, and black ops sites.  &quot;Summaries&quot; listing all of that get linked here regularly.  Last week one of the top threads here was about the LARPing fuck making claims about the Hawaii site and updating about wetworks guys he bumped into at a bar.  Don&#39;t claim that these insane spin offs haven&#39;t been gobbled up by people.</p>

<p>Maybe you should go take a gun to a Domino&#39;s delivery driver, make yourself feel like you&#39;re accomplishing something great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, here&#39;s two.</p>

<p>The email referring to Obama having Pizza and Hot-dogs flown in from Chicago.  Guess what two foods Chicago is world renowned for? Pizza, and fucking hot-dogs.  Now, that doesn&#39;t <em>necessarily disprove</em> that they&#39;re not talking about raping children, but Occam&#39;s Razor says we should pick the explanation that requires the fewest assumptions.  I think a child pedophilia ring requires just a few more assumptions than getting the signature food from a city.  So, while it may not be evidence <em>against</em> pizzagate, it most certainly is not evidence <em>for</em> pizzagate.</p>

<p>The email about the kids and swimming.  The email is from one of the kids mom&#39;s.  Again, Occam&#39;s Razor points us towards the parents enjoying watching the kids playing in the pool, rather than being child rapists.</p>

<p>Oh I got a third one too. The logo for the pizza place.  First off, coincidence is a perfectly valid explanation for the original logo. It <em>is</em> pizza shaped, for fucks sake.  What about the logo change? Well, I&#39;ll tell you, if someone said my logo was associated with child rape, I&#39;d probably change that motherfucker as quick as I could.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you are watching is what happened as a result of the media refusing to cover the Podesta emails. There were legitimate worrisome scandalous things in those emails. When CNN refuses to cover them, it allows stories to go unchecked. NPR ran a piece yesterday in &quot;On The Media&quot; talking about how they will simply not cover things that may even <em>sound</em> like a positive spin for Trump. So now, our media is refusing to give <em>real</em> news (Podesta Emails) their due reporting, and this other <em>fake news</em> goes unchecked. If CNN had done their job and said the truth about what was in those emails, maybe none of this would have happened.</p>

<p>Facts don&#39;t pay the bills and it costs too much to do any real investigating.  </p>

<p>I remember when Christiane Amanpour was reporting live from the Balkins.<br/>
Now that&#39;s too risky and no one cares about real on-the-ground coverage.<br/>
People want 100 word blurbs that can be digested on the fly.  </p>

<p>Why should they care?<br/>
No matter what they do people will always see the news through their ideological lens.  </p>

<p>It started in the Vietnam War when news coverage of the war caused public opinion to shift.<br/>
The government began to see the press as the enemy.<br/>
Since then, it&#39;s been a steady erosion of its credibility.<br/>
You can blame CNN or MSNBC or WaPo but in the end, look to who benefits.  </p>

<p>Since no one is credible no one can speak truth to power.<br/>
Politicians are free to do whatever they want.<br/>
Just like now, gaters are crying false flag.  Clinton supporters are saying it&#39;s an obvious hatchet job.<br/>
Who&#39;s there to believe?  </p>

<p>We live in a world of lies now.  </p>

<p>You could be lying to me.  I could be lying to you.  How could either of us know?  </p>

<p>Would we cite obviously biased sources?<br/>
Would we cite politicized science and statistics?<br/>
Would we rely on partisan authority figures?  </p>

<p>That event was most likely meant to make sure no one outside of reddit EVER believe any of you (including the alt-medias) and anything that may ever come out of conspiracy... maybe even put doubts on wikileaks. This way they won&#39;t need to get rid of the problem &#39;individually&#39; or even try to disprove anything. Sorry guys, told you.</p>

<p>It could also be done to attack internet privacy by proxy.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s doesn&#39;t matter if there&#39;s a conspiracy or not; it discredited any future finding or facts exposed by alt medias and maybe redditors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one will agree with me here but there is a reason.</p>

<p>We are just a bunch of people behind a monitor. Some of us may have experience with investigative journalism, but most of us don&#39;t. </p>

<p>There is no repercussion for the claims we make, at least none that we feel. And, sure, if you think you are exposing something big you will probably think you have the moral high ground but people&#39;s lives actually get affected by this stuff if it gets big enough. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve yet to see any evidence that the whole pizzagate thing should lead to a criminal conviction. Some weird instagram photos? Sure. But I find it odd that this sub would want that to be the precedent for the government getting involved considering its opinion of the government in general. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was/am simply calling for people not to be scared of discussing it. I don&#39;t believe anyone should be going to comet, or leaking peoples names, etc. Hell I can admit the Instagram shit, not what&#39;s on it the posting of it to shame someone, makes me uncomfortable. Hence why generally I&#39;m not involved in any discussion regarding such matters. I just think people should be able to discuss this issue in a way that is both looking for the truth and respectful of individuals rights, no matter what some may think they are involved in. At the same time I recognize that I can&#39;t police the discussion. It&#39;s going to happen whether I like it or not. All I can do is make my points and not engage in any I may disagree with. I have to be respectful of people and allow them to make their own decisions even if I disagree with such. </p>

<p>I think people need to realize that we all come from different backgrounds and approach this in different ways. Some people view privacy on the internet differently. We can&#39;t, as stated police that, its not our place. All we can is pick and choose how and when we will enter into the discussion, if at all. </p>

<p>People just need to be respectful of other opinions and rights, rather than attempting to attack and engage in the very behavior they are accusing others of, ie witch hunts. </p>

<p>We need to understand that people are upset about this because they have been lied to and they feel disenfranchised. They feel as if they are being misled, because sadly they have been, so many times before. People belive this because for years many they were being told, no there&#39;s no pedophile problem, only to find out that there was. Whether it be the BBC, Jimmy Saville, The Vatican, members of Congress, CEO&#39;s, etc, the truth has come out - and after years of people being told they were crazy and the media ignoring it and writing it off. </p>

<p>So yea, it may not be true, you may not have proof you like, but that&#39;s no reason that others shouldn&#39;t be looking. They&#39;ve been down this road before and had the same attacks labeled against them and they&#39;ve seen where it ended up. With this in mind there&#39;s no reason why these people shouldn&#39;t be concerned, its history playing out like it has so many times before. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mostly agree with you.</p>

<p>However there is a big difference between looking into something and actually accusing a person. </p>

<p>You are right, you can&#39;t police the conversation. And that&#39;s how people end up getting railroaded by public opinion. But,
 hey, we aren&#39;t putting our lives on the line so it&#39;s all fun and games. You bring up witch hunts but if a guy calls them out he&#39;s not letting the conversation happen. How do you square that? </p>

<p>I guess I take a different view because I&#39;ve actually dealt with child abuse cases. I&#39;ve said it before but most people give zero fucks about child abuse. There&#39;s no shortage of cases that people on this sub could rally around if that was the case. But when &quot;TPTB&quot; are involved we are all suddenly concerned about the children? How convenient for the other kids who are victimized by it because, surprise, people
don&#39;t like prying into other people&#39;s lives when good evidence isn&#39;t available. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly I would disagree actually, many people do care about child abuse.  I don&#39;t know why would view it otherwise, or what may have transpired to give you that idea, but I repectfully disagree.  </p>

<p>That being said, one of the experiences that I am thankful for in my life is that of living with my sister when she first began to work for DCS (department of child services).  As such I was able to go with her on multiple cases and trips to shelters as well as foster homes and got to see first hand what some of these children experienced.  It was an eye opening experience and though I saw quite a few disturbing and honestly disgusting things, I would not trade it as it opened my eyes to the reality that many people face every day, particularly kids.  As well as giving me a rather eye opening view into how the government handles such, or in some cases does not.  So yes, this case does interest me on that level, but more so than that it interest me as a concerned citizen and member of the American government who wants to know why these type of people have any say or influence regarding elected officials, as clearly shown via the email leaks, as at the very least that in and of itself is troubling.  </p>

<p>You are right, there is no shortage of cases that this sub could rally around, but this sub - for better or worse - isn&#39;t the pedophilia exposure sub, this is a sub about conspiracies, and though pedophilia may be the overall theme of Pizzagate it is far from the only accusation and concern that people have regarding it.  Therefore this would not be the sub for looking into other such matters, unless they happened to be wrapped up in the veil of conspiracy as this particular case appears to be.  </p>

<p>As for not putting our lives on the line, I disagree.  Many people here believe that they are, rather it&#39;s true or not.  There are people here that are scared of talking out about this.  There are people here that do believe that what they are saying is being monitored and cataloged and that they run a very real risk of being under investigation for even discussing such.  Now, these fears may be unfounded but to believe that people don&#39;t have these concerns is to ignore a very real worry that some have here, whether valid or not.  And I for one won&#39;t tell these people that they are wrong (not that I believe you are), as it is not my place.  If anyone felt that way, they have every right to.  It is their life, not mine, and I won&#39;t pretend like I have a say in how they live such.  </p>

<p>As for &quot;a guy calls them out he&#39;s not letting the conversation happen&quot; I actually don&#39;t know what you mean.  Therefore i can&#39;t answer how I would square that, as I don&#39;t follow if I&#39;m being honest, and in the interest of friendly debate I don&#39;t want to assume to know what you meant.  Ergo I have no answer at this time.  </p>

<p>Because it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to go to your local court house, see who had been accused, and start making connections. That doesn&#39;t happen on this sub though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very simple though. Discuss all you want, as long as you your actions stay confined in one subreddit, reddit will not give a fuck. If you start brigading other subreddits and especially start harassing people outside reddit then reddit does care. In the end of the day, reddit is a private website and they can decide rules. One rule that is taken very seriously is no posting personal information. </p>

<p>Such a rule may seem excessive, but it&#39;s there for a reason. What happens now with comet ping pong is not so new. Witchhunts happen very often on internet. Once somebody becomes hated big on internet death threats always occur. The ban on posting personal information helps prevent this and also shifts the blame away from reddit. So look for evidence and discuss, but follow the rules. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree to an extent, but you can&#39;t hide stupidity behind opinion. If you think there&#39;s maybe something fishy going on and want to investigate more, then that&#39;s fine (as long as you don&#39;t harass anyone while doing so). But if you claim that there is a strong evidence about the pizzagate stuff, then well that&#39;s an opinion, but it&#39;s also pretty stupid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With this in mind there&#39;s no reason why these people shouldn&#39;t be concerned, its history playing out like it has so many times before.</p>

<p>Come on, at the very least you have to admit, that if even half of the pizzagate stuff was true, this would be much larger than any pedo scandal in the past.</p>

<p>Treated like terrorist?  What the fucking hell is wrong with you?  Where in that post is violence being encouraged?  The only people that even bringing that up are people like yourself; which is disturbingly ironic to say the least. And here&#39;s the thing, you&#39;re advocating for the terrorising of people on this sub. Via mass surveillance, censoring, banning, naming and shaming etc. So who&#39;s the terrorist here?  Cause no one else is coming close to what you&#39;re calling for. Goddamn I bet you&#39;re the kind of person who thinks Edward Snowden is a terrorist and the Patriot Act a god send. The kind of person who would have Glenn Greenwald locked up and as you&#39;ve states this sub scrubbed. That&#39;s disgusting and you&#39;re shamefulness is on full display for all to see. </p>

<p>Willfully agitating the mentally ILL (fixed that for you) to violence?  I, nor anyone else here, is not responsible for what others do.  Sorry, but there&#39;s far worse sub&#39;s you can label that accusation at if you&#39;re so inclined, but here yet you come here.  GTFO with all that. </p>

<p>Monitoring all of us?  You&#39;re in conspiracy and you&#39;re pushing that kind of shit?  Seriously?  Like fucking for real?  First off, its already happening, and not just to us but to you too buttercup, and that&#39;s not a conspiracy that&#39;s cold hard fact. Secondly who the fuck are you, Columbo?  &quot;I&#39;ve flagged some of you myself&quot;. What!?  Dude THATS  CRAZY. Who the fuck does that?  Do you got a special folder with screen shots and a list of names to take to the authorities?  Always wanted to be the big bad policeman but couldn&#39;t hack it or something?  I don&#39;t know, and usually don&#39;t try to judge, but you strike me as the type. Wonder why that is?</p>

<p>Bunch of evil freaks?  Yeah, once again then only one advocating anything close to violence is you and yours. Not anyone else. So what does that say about you?</p>

<p>As for conspiracy culture attracting then mentally I&#39;ll, okay, sure. So does psychiatry. So does law enforcement. Here is a list of the top professions for psychopaths:  media, salesperson, surgeon, journalist, police officer, clergy person, chef, civil servant, CEO, lawyer. Weird, I don&#39;t see you at any of those related sub&#39;s yelling about how they attract the mentally Ill, and yet those are the highest likely professions to attract such. Hmmm. Strange. </p>

<p>Now, do us all a favor and leave. You clearly don&#39;t want to be here. So quit wasting your time, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll save plenty not having to flag anyone. Maybe take up a hobby, something calming perhaps. It seems you need to take a step back. Either way, have a great day!  </p>

<p>Okay, done, and I promise no more feeding the trolls. I just couldn&#39;t ignore this in good conscious. </p>

<p>The people who think the this theory is BS are the ones that are way far gone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what I said.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things wrong with some of the theories coming forward about pizzagate. From the early days people were making connections here and there that were pure assumptions. That&#39;s what happens in every investigation, whether it is the law enforcement authorities, private investigators, or random people on the Internet doing mediocre detective work.</p>

<p>You take the base facts, and you try to make sense of it and come up with theories. The difference is that when law enforcement is doing an investigation, not only do they have much more resources, but they also do not announce every last little theory they have about the investigation until they have a solid case set in place.</p>

<p>Here on reddit, people are posting every last thought and idea they have, and many many many of these are going to be wrong. Remember that and you won&#39;t be one of the idiots that want to censor the conversations people are having online. </p>

<p>But anyway, there is a base of facts that launched the conspiracy in the first place. It&#39;s easy for anyone to look up if they want to.</p>

<p>I was initially responding to a person who simply gave an emotionally-charged response with profane language which didn&#39;t add to the conversation in any meaningful way. Literally, a troll. </p>

<p>Most of the rest of us try to have a civil discussion, talking about what we know for sure and some plausibilities. </p>

<p>Others jump to conclusions and state their theories as fact. Others are skeptics and have a civil conversation about it. Then there are others that just sit and try to derail any conversation by screaming and yelling and dropping profanity, to no benefit to anyone.</p>

<p>If you 100% think the theories are fake, then calmly state what you believe in a clear and concise manner, with supporting facts addressing each point. If you make sense, then people will upvote you and you will change minds. </p>

<p>If you do not have anything productive to share and just want to troll, then do not participate in this conversation. Go somewhere else. (As if my plea is going to stop the real trolls anyway)</p>

<p>The guy owns a pizza place and is supposedly one of the most powerful people in DC. I think he ought to know about public relations by now. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They should at least be monitoring all of you physically and paying house calls to mods/organizers/instigators. Goddamn I sure hope you fucking reckless, deluded morons are known by address/name to authorities, I&#39;ve personally flagged a few of you saying crazy shit and sent it along to them, fuck the admins they clearly don&#39;t give a shit, I&#39;d scrub all these shitty subs.</p>

<p>When this ring is cracked you&#39;ll have to come to grips with the fact that you tried to supress an investigation that saved childrens lives. </p>

<p>I never said I would ~ I said it would be brought up along with other facts.  You still haven&#39;t answered my question.  Who would still be friends with THREE convicted child molesters?  Would you?  And who the fuck do you know even has three friends, who are convicted child molesters, and isn&#39;t one them self?  Birds of a feather bro.</p>

<p>If you want facts, the emails are obvious code as their wording makes no sense what-so-ever in any other context.  The bands they host at the establishment have lots of Satanic and negative adolescent imagery (but it&#39;s for &quot;ALL AGES&quot;.  Their logo (which they changed) is a known symbol for &quot;Boy Lovers&quot;.  Why change it if there&#39;s nothing seemingly &quot;wrong&quot;?  Why does Jimmy have so many awkward instagram pictures (like #chickenlovers, with no apparent chicken in the picture, but means &quot;one is attracted to boys&quot; or children taped up)?   His instagram profile pic is of Antinous - the 13 year old boy lover to the King of Rome.  How about the sketches by witnesses of the Madeleine McCann abduction - who resemble perfectly, the Podesta&#39;s (and they were only a third of a mile from her last seen location at the time)? <a href="http://i.imgur.com/z3XBVD4.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/z3XBVD4.jpg</a></p>

<p>How about Tony Podesta&#39;s taste in art?  </p>

<p>TOTALLY FUCKING NORMAL </p>

<p>This is the tip of an iceberg and all the information is readily available for you to research your self.  I understand what you&#39;re saying in regards to needing evidence to convict these people ~ but law enforcement and the judicial system are bought and paid for.  Most the people (see previous child sex-rings: Dutroux Case in the US, the Hampstead Case &amp; Jimmy Savile in the UK etc) involved in these rings are in complete control of the investigations.</p>

<p>Still haven&#39;t answered my original question though.. I know, it&#39;s hard to think of an answer because only one fucking exists and you&#39;re denying it so hard I&#39;m surprised your brain doesn&#39;t leap out from being deprived of oxygen in that air-tight closed chamber.</p>

Buying old accounts off people and bombarding small well knit communities like these are making you look like fools.</p>

<p>Hope that payday is fat enough to let you sleep at night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You look so stupid. You probably realize this but continue to push your wallets narrative. Enjoy your life if you are this ignorant to completely discredit something with this much weird shit and evidence. This conspiracy is so popular because of all the shit that has been found. Mountains and mountains of connections to pedophilia among the global elite. Comet Pingpong is just a small but confident piece of this puzzle. People might conspire against the moon landing because they see details of a movie set and gravitational pull of a flag, this is much more than that. Tell your boss they need to redraft their game plan to try and silence this conspiracy, because it&#39;s not going away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There doesn&#39;t need to be proof because anything and anyone is suspect after seeing that a Superpac can fund millions of dollars to propagate a narrative in what used to be thought of as a somewhat neutral center, being the internet. You might not be CTR, but I can&#39;t know for sure knowing that dickheads like David Brock can infiltrate peoples perspective on the truth by pushing propaganda. If you&#39;re not CTR i&#39;m sorry.... but when I see smoke there is most definitely a fire, and i&#39;m not staying anywhere near that house.</p>

<p>Between 1992 and August 2004, 41 criminal defamation cases were brought to court in the United States, among which six defendants were convicted. From 1965 to 2004, 16 cases ended in final conviction, <strong>among which nine resulted in jail sentences</strong> (average sentence, 173 days). Other criminal cases resulted in fines (average fine, $1,700), probation (average of 547 days), community service (on average 120 hours), or writing a letter of apology.[17]</p>

<p>Or do you think they might have code words, or sly talk? Ever buy weed from someone illegally? Didn&#39;t you have &#39;code talk&#39;?</p>

<p>There is code talk through Podesta&#39;s emails. There are characters with very real criminal convictions revolving around CST in these communications.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is, none of us are trained investigators and the enthusiasm of the hashtaggers is detrimental to a real investigation. But if the conspiracy is to be believed then this would go into every level of government and I assume policing too. So the problem, random gullible internet person - is there a level of proof-of-innocence that you&#39;d be able to accept? What if Podesta came out and said &quot;I&#39;m not a paedophile, but I am gay and enjoy a BDSM lifestyle&quot; - would that be enough? </p>

<p>Taste in art is not enough to convict anyone of anything. If that was the case, half of 4chan would be verifiable paedophiles based on the hentai alone. </p>

<p>The fact alone that the code-talk is 4chan paedo code immediately makes this suspect - why would high level political movers be using the same code as the lowest on the internet totem pole?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read all of the &#39;evidence&#39;. I&#39;d say the closest thing that comes to code is the pizza related napkin thing. That is an odd exchange. But it&#39;s in no way a smoking gun.</p>

<p>Pizzagators should be sending their evidence to either the police, respectable investigative journalists or perhaps pooling resources to hire a PI. I don&#39;t think doxxing, vigilantism and libel are the answers though.</p>

<p>One of the guests was a lawyer who was classmates of HRC at Wellesley. The other was a billionaire who had a reputation of manhandling women, and then paying them off to shut up about it. We know Podesta was there. The house sleeps 10-12</p>

<p>So, you know, it is really strange shit like that. Shit like the home they picked was at the end of a cul de sac, and had a boat dock with water access. All of it, the rich, the hankie, the ceilings, just coincidence, I am sure of it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t want to be seen as a conspiritard then why are you vexed about high ceilings? How are high ceilings conducive to whatever it is we&#39;re talking about now?</p>

<p>To me it sounds like they&#39;re just massively privileged people who want specific things from the luxury accommodation they&#39;re in. The onus is not on doubters to prove the innocence of things (innocence is very hard to prove), the onus is on the believers to put together a strong case that doesn&#39;t rely on coincidence or conjecture.</p>

<p>OK wait a sec, I have a moment, let&#39;s break this down. You say &quot;Did I say anything about trafficking and abusing kids?? Anywhere?&quot; but we&#39;re in a pizzagate thread, that&#39;s the whole context for all of this. This is an &#39;investigation&#39; (I&#39;d venture it&#39;s a literal witch hunt in place) about child abuse. So I&#39;m trying to understand how the rest of your evidence fits.</p>

<p>You say:
&quot;Did you travel down the string and put together when, where and who was at that event with Podesta?</p>

<p>The two people who was riding with the summer vacation rental realtor are two billionaires who made their money off shady loans that led to the Wachovia collapse.

I guess Labor Day is a big day for Billionaires. &quot;</p>

<p>People &#39;grooming&#39; (or, teaching) young people is not suspect in and of itself. I assume labour day weekend is a big deal? I don&#39;t know, not american. But I figure if you&#39;re a billionaire you&#39;d want somewhere nice to stay for as long as you please.</p>

<p>&quot;Strange thing, a comment about one of the suggested listings did not meet two men&#39;s insistence that the home has &#39;high ceilings&#39;. Clicking the link, the only low ceilings are in bedrooms. I guess some billionaires have phobias about normal size homes.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, probably. As likely as them being child molesters I guess?</p>

<p>&quot;One of the guests was a lawyer who was classmates of HRC at Wellesley.&quot; </p>

<p>Not suspicious. </p>

<p>&quot;The other was a billionaire who had a reputation of manhandling women, and then paying them off to shut up about it.&quot;</p>

<p>A bit like Trump?</p>

<p>&quot;We know Podesta was there. The house sleeps 10-12&quot;</p>

<p>So there might have been others there?</p>

<p>&quot;All of it, the rich, the hankie, the ceilings, just coincidence, I am sure of it!&quot;</p>

<p>How do the ceilings mean anything at all?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve disappeared down a rabbit hole, man. Come back.</p>

<p>Also, we are talking Martha&#39;s Vineyard. 10 day rental. This is a billionaire with homes all over the country. Why rent one, if not for anonymity? Maybe whatever they are doing in the vacation homes, they don&#39;t want to do in the vacation homes they own?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet another person with reading comprehension problems?  (Actually, let&#39;s call it what it is: an attempt to deflect and change the subject from the topic you obviously greatly fear.)  Calling out those who seek to quash legitimate inquiry is not even remotely in the same BALLPARK as supporting the activities of a violent person!  Ironically it&#39;s the same type of violence that you advocate in addressing me.  The hypocrisy of your comment reeks, but your stupidity in revealing your true nature to all must be appreciated for the honesty you were compelled to expose about yourself.</p>

<p>What is it about PG that terrifies you folks so much?  Do you truly fear that Clinton involvement (and thus liberal embarrassment) is going to be revealed?  You must, because nothing short of a fear of that nature could possibly drive such a paranoid campaign of censorship.  Obviously if there&#39;s nothing to PG, there&#39;s nothing to fear.  But you guys&#39; knees are obviously quivering with fear that something is going to come out that will be extremely humiliating to liberals.  And that&#39;s all we decent folks need to know to confirm that the investigation and search for additional evidence must continue.  The days of being silenced by liberal bullies are OVER!  The truth WILL come out, whatever it may be, whether here or elsewhere, regardless of how hard you try to prevent it from happening.  You&#39;d be wise to govern yourselves accordingly.</p>

<p>What terrifies us is not that a pedophile might get caught. What terrifies is us how easy someone can get accused and believed to be a despicable human being despite there being no evidence against them. What terrifies us is that if we get on the wrong side of you lunatics, you just might forge a conspiracy branding us as the worst of the worst, and suddenly some armed dude shows up on our doorstep to &quot;investigate&quot;. What frightens us is the lack of protocol, it&#39;s that people are guilty until proven innocent, it&#39;s that mob justice is justified, it&#39;s the herd thinking, it&#39;s the cult-like belief without proof.</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t you call the police on this? Let them handle it. Why can&#39;t you trust the authorities on this? Why do you refuse to believe the authorities when they say there&#39;s nothing there? This is what scares us the most: You people are <strong>convinced</strong> that there&#39;s something fishy going on, and <em>nothing</em> will convince you otherwise. To what lengths are you willing to go in your witch-hunt? An armed goon shows up and fires a gun in a family establishment, what&#39;s next? Assassination, even without proof?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First and foremost, I am NOT convinced that there&#39;s anything to the PG allegations ... yet.  All I&#39;ve seen so far is a lot of smoke.  What has attracted my attention is the fact that there is a zealous effort to try to prevent any inquiry into the subject.  Reasonable people don&#39;t attempt to stifle investigation when they believe there&#39;s no basis for the questions.  They&#39;ll simply allow the process to play out, confident that there are no criminal acts that will be exposed.  What we have here, however, is the opposite.  And all it does is raise suspicions even further; it does nothing to neutralize concerns.</p>

<p>As to being branded &quot;the worst of the worst,&quot; you&#39;ve already done that to yourselves.  To be clear, this is something that has ALREADY HAPPENED, it&#39;s not something that may or may not happen in the future.  Moreover, your purported concern about &quot;mob justice&quot; is laughable in light of Ferguson and other riots, provoking violence at political rallies, and other things liberals are well known for such as the &quot;herd thinking&quot; that everyone who isn&#39;t liberal isn&#39;t only incorrect, they&#39;re downright EVIL in your minds.  I may lack the  power to correct your erroneous thinking, but I possess, and will forever regularly exercise, the power to vote to marginalize and eventually eradicate your destructive political policies and philosophies.  For the sake of your own sanity, you&#39;d best figure out a way to accept that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel worried for anyone who has guns waved in their face, especially innocent people! It has nothing to do with liberals or conservatives. Don&#39;t try to inject partisanship into every situation. I don&#39;t support violence in the slightest. This has nothing at all to do with politics. It has to do with not supporting vigilantism. </p>

<p>Again, i&#39;m not trying to censor anyone. you have the right to say whatever you want. I&#39;m just saying that inflammatory language has consequences that you should be aware of, and it&#39;s fucked up to try to ruin people&#39;s lives. I&#39;m not trying to protect any politicians. It&#39;s just that critical thinking is really important to me, i care about the truth, and it&#39;s fucked up that people on the internet are deciding someone is guilty based on their own insane &quot;research.&quot; So you can call me out as some sort of politically motivated censor shill, but that&#39;s not me at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get real!  The attempt to censor discussion about PG is SOLELY about partisanship!  </p>

<p>As to language having consequences, should we avoid all conversation about the Middle East because it might inflame terrorists?  Is there ANY safe yet important subject that can be freely discussed that can&#39;t be misconstrued by a nutjob?  Are we all supposed to walk around in total silence for fear that someone will take our words as an inducement to be violent?  No, we can&#39;t even do that because you and I both know that there are individuals that can even take a glance in their direction the wrong way.  Tiptoeing around in fear is not the way to live life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate got censored for doxxing people. Reddit apparently was worried it might lead to negative action against innocent people, and look what happened! They didn&#39;t shut you down because they&#39;re all &quot;Clinton cucks&quot; and are trying to protect them. You were censored because you were allegedly breaking the rules. Pizzagate is a conspiracy theory, and one SO OUTLANDISH, that even Alex fucking Jones is distancing himself from it. Don&#39;t pretend that anyone who refuses to subscribe to your hairbrained theories is a &#39;liberal cuck.&#39;</p>

<p>Thank you for the false equivalency of &quot;terrorists in the Middle East.&quot; You know, there&#39;s evidence against most suspected terrorists, not to mention they&#39;re not American citizens.</p>

<p>These are regular people who ARE citizens, and you&#39;re talking about what scum they are and how you hope they&#39;re hanged and fucked up shit like that. Maybe not you in particular, but there&#39;s all kinds of inflammatory shit being said about people who aren&#39;t even being legally investigated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt that any legal authorities are going to start an investigation based on some internet conspiracy theories. There are no reputable journalists/investigators currently talking about it. Even Alex Jones has said to focus on podesta/clinton/whatever, but comet ping pong is clearly just a regular fucking pizza place, and it does no good to go in there with guns threatening members of the public. There&#39;s NOTHING there, and anyone who has been to the place has said the same. It doesn&#39;t make sense to launch an investigation into James Alefantis without any actual evidence whatsoever. OMG he&#39;s gay and likes dicks and also has little kids at his restaurant...get over it.</p>

Not knowing yet whether they are tied to Comet Ping Pong is anyone&#39;s guess at this point, but I won&#39;t be the least surprised to learn that they are ... and neither will you.  In fact, that probability is what&#39;s driving this whole censorship movement, isn&#39;t it?  ISN&#39;T IT????  You HAVE to know it&#39;s coming.  &lt;wicked grin&gt;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;anyone&#39;s guess&quot;... yeah, you&#39;re guessing. yes. they found hillary&#39;s emails on weiner&#39;s computer, but there&#39;s absolutely no evidence whatsoever that they&#39;re related to Comet Ping Pong. That&#39;s just what you&#39;d like to believe. As far as i know, there&#39;s no &quot;censorship movement&quot; that you speak of. Just reddit shutting down your subreddit for breaking the rules, and journalists who don&#39;t want to ruin their reputation with insane conspiracy theories. The shit is just NOT newsworthy. When Alex Jones is hesitant to run with your theories, you know they&#39;re bullshit.</p>

<p>So just last month this guy hit a kid with his car, and he wasn&#39;t charged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, cause it looks like he may not have committed any crimes? Police have to get all the information before they can do that. If you get into a car accident you don&#39;t just get thrown in a police cruiser. He may not be at fault.</p>

<p>I like how in your first link you ignore literally all the rest of the article which basically highlights a pattern of behavior from what you&#39;d expect from someone who&#39;d do this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, this guys dad;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dentist? Crime Prevention? Boy Scout? Foster Parent?</p>

<p>What professions would the dad have to have for you to <em>not</em> suspect him of being involved in a false flag operation?</p>

<p>The only thing in any of that which is any way related is the Film Production Company, which seems to be just some shitty family project that they never use. </p>

<p>All the other shit you listed are generally considered the actions of a good person.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a weird world where being a bad person makes you a bad person, being a good person makes you a bad person in disguise, and being selected as an arbitrator for the North Carolina Dental Association makes your son a government pedophile protector.</p>

<p>why did you completely ignore him being Executive Director for Protect-A-Child, a national, non-profit organization to prevent abuse and abduction of children&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because I didn&#39;t want to go through each line of this guys resume saying &quot;this is a reasonable and nice job for someone to have&quot;, &quot;in fact, it may be the fact that this guy&#39;s father has been trying to protect children his whole life that this dude took these crazy accusations about kids getting hurt too far&quot;.</p>

<p>The rule of bullshit is that it takes an order of magnitude more effort to disprove it than to create it. For every arbitrary line you throw, i have to type a paragraph trying to teach you why it&#39;s ridiculous and I don&#39;t want to have to do that. So I pick a few and write about those.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell me this, if the shooter really cared about the children at comet, why wouldn&#39;t he ask his dad for help? You would think &quot;Executive Director for Protect-A-Child, a national, non-profit organization to prevent abuse and abduction of children&quot; would be a pretty good help in bringing down or at least investigate Comet Pong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe he did and the dad looked at the evidence and said &quot;that doesn&#39;t make any sense, I&#39;m trying to actually help children, not farm karma on internet forums and threaten a pizza place with no evidence&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>pretty good help in bringing down or at least investigate Comet Pong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have to have evidence to investigate anything. ANY evidence. Pictures of children are not evidence. Cherry picked emails talking about food are not evidence. </p>

<p>Even if this is <em>all true</em> <em>ALL OF IT</em> you still need to get evidence <em>first</em>. You need some victims, or some victims families. Or some accuser. Or any evidence at all. </p>

<p>I bet if I went through your email history or hell, your REDDIT history, post-by-post and cherry picked a 3 out of a thousand, I could make you sound like anything I wanted. That isn&#39;t evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you seriously not understand the concept of different types of evidence? That entire infographic is exactly what any rational person would call &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot;. Yeah, pizzagate could be entirely bullshit, but when there is <em>that much</em> circumstantial evidence, don&#39;t you think it at least warrants further investigation?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>where does that code from</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The code was derived from evidence collected during previous pedo ring investigations (conducted by law enforcement and intelligence agencies; not redditors), where words like &quot;pizza&quot; and &quot;cheese&quot; were used quite often to describe child victims and sex acts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that people think this is a false-flag is disturbing. Literally the very first post on the thread about it declared it a false-flag even before any alleged &quot;evidence&quot; came out to &quot;support&quot; that claim. It&#39;s psyop 101: Plant false information in people&#39;s heads early enough and repeat it enough and it becomes the accepted truth.</p>

<p>So from what I gather there are three key pieces of evidence in support of a &quot;false flag&quot; narrative, and Pizzagate followers have a pretty damn big interest in it being a false-flag: it lets them ignore the very real consequences of &quot;just asking questions.&quot;</p>

<p>1) A traffic camera was allegedly slightly moved days before the shooting. Several things wrong with this. For one, I haven&#39;t seen any evidence the camera was moved, just one single Voat user claiming it was moved, however that user did not specify a timeframe. When this was brought up as the most upvoted post in the first post about this, no one bothered to verify the claim, they just repeated it. In a classic &quot;telephone&quot; twist, it&#39;s now morphed into &quot;the camera was shut down just before the shooting!&quot;</p>

<p>Secondly, even if it was moved: so what? It&#39;s pretty much universally accepted here that the Boston Marathon bombing and Sandy Hook were false-flags with crisis actors, committed LIVE in front of thousands of national TV cameras and smartphones. So why are &quot;they&quot; now afraid of a single low-res traffic camera? It doesn&#39;t fit with the narrative of crisis actors, especially since its now being implied the shooter was one as well. It makes absolutely no sense when you think about it in the context of every other Pizzagate claim</p>

<p>2) Washingtonian published an article about the shooting before it happened. It&#39;s a well-known Google bug. It also shows differently for people depending on their location, giving credence to the fact that it is most likely a timezone related fuckery. And it doesn&#39;t even make sense, why the fuck would the powers-to-be feed media outlets stories that haven&#39;t happened yet? Say what you will about the state of &quot;mainstream&quot; mass-market journalism a la ABC, NBC, etc, but at the local level (which is what Washingtonian is), its filled with young idealistic journalists who have ethics and a spine and who still want to hold the powers-that-be accountable. Someone would have blown the whistle.</p>

<p>3) Welch had an IMDB profile that listed him as a production assistant on three random no-budget films and a five-second acting role on one, ergo he must be a paid crisis actor. This is a pretty ridiculous statement. Assuming the profile does in deed belong to him, it looks like his father runs the company and he just helps out from time to time. So, assuming without any evidence that it&#39;s really his IMDB profile, so what? Every person who&#39;s ever appeared in a film for a second is now incapable of doing anything bad without being a paid crisis actor now? He might have hit someone with his car last month, was that staged as well? Where does the line end?</p>

<p>So going through each thrown-together piece of evidence that was, coincidentally, brought up almost immediately after the story broke, we&#39;re left with three flimsy, contradictory and factually incorrect points. So then I have to ask, which scenario is more likely: that the powers-that-be elaborately staged a mock shooting of a pizza place at the center of a flimsy pedophile conspiracy theory, using a random nobody production assistant from North Carolina as the &quot;actor,&quot; informing not just national but hyperlocal news outlets with young idealistic reporters about the shooting before it even happened, and moving traffic cameras because, you know, the powers-that-be are no longer interested in executing false-flag ops in front of cameras apparently.</p>

<p>Or, someone with mental problems closely following Pizzagate took the movement&#39;s claims that the thousands of people implicated as pedophiles are literally untouchable unless they rise up and try to stop them took those calls to action too literally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are saying, a grand conspiracy is more likely than some idiot doing something stupid?  </p>

<p>Yes I think this guy was some kind of conspiracy nut who thought he will be a big hero who stopped children abuse and delivered proof of a pedophilia ring. You don&#39;t need to threaten anyone if you &quot;know&quot; there are kidnapped children in the &quot;kill room&quot; or whatever.  </p>

<p>And I already told you, maybe his father thought it was complete nonsense and didn&#39;t want to help. And that just encouraged him to act on his own. It&#39;s not like typical <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users are stopped by other people telling them their theories are stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great work intentionally using the weakest evidence as your description of pizzagate. The coincidence of the letters CP, was never raised as a concern. Instead, three companies within a block from each other all containing known pedophile symbols combined with very odd emails was the impetus to start investigating. The emails include Obama flying in $65k worth of pizza and hotdogs. An email about finding a &quot;pizza related map&quot;, and most bizarre, an email invitation to a pool party, where it is explicitly mentioned that three kids aged &quot;11, 9, and almost 7&quot; will be there for entertainment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually those were the first pieces of evidence that made me think there is something odd happening here. I personally don&#39;t think there is a satanic pedophile ring based around comet ping pong. However, there are many pedophile connections among people like Alefontis. For me, Jeff Epstein is likely the at the centre of this. Alefontis might be tangentially implicated, maybe he just facilitated parties. The most troubling aspect of the Comet Ping Pong connection is the giant walk in freezer. I have worked for restaurants that service hundreds of people a night, and they only have a small ~4&#39;x10&#39; freezer. I think the Podesta&#39;s, Epstein, and Bill Clinton are who we need to pay attention to, and Epstein is a convicted pedophile. </p>

<p>So with that said, I think a lot of the evidence can be dismissed as bullshit. But I&#39;ve yet to see one compelling argument as to why those 3 children are being cited as &#39;entertainment&#39; at a pool party.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping one of the anti-pizzagaters can address this, because that&#39;s my biggest hang up at the moment and I don&#39;t see anyone touching it. Any way I look at that particular email, it&#39;s disturbing as fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, it sounded more like the woman was making it known that her guests could bring their kids, and that if they do, then they should also bring swimwear for their kids.  It would otherwise be rude to drag your children to an adult-only event, in particular when your children drive the other guests nuts due to being bored out of their minds, and no one wants to bring their kids to a pool party without swimwear.  So I can&#39;t say that I see anything mentioned in that email that shouldn&#39;t have been.  Even mentioning their ages doesn&#39;t seem unusual, as one wouldn&#39;t want to drag a 13 year old to a party to play with a bunch of 3 year olds, and so their ages are absolutely relevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some say the pedophiles&#39; code is stronger than that of the Navajo.  Here, read in in full context:
&quot;With enormous gratitude to Advance Man Extraordinaire Haber, I am popping up again to share our excitement about the Reprise of Our Gang’s visit to the farm in Lovettsville. And I thought I’d share a couple more notes: We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure. And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun, and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo).&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a grandmother talking about her apparently delightful grandkids, and letting people know that the pool will be being used for sure, despite chilly temperatures.  Scandalous!</p>

<p>&quot;Your nephew will be at the party, so he&#39;ll provide plenty of entertainment, I&#39;m sure&quot; is something my mom would say about her grandson.  I&#39;m 75% sure she&#39;s not involved in a pedophilia ring, too.</p>

<p>And I thought I’d share a couple more notes: We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure. And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun, and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would these children be brought by Uber, and not their parents? Why would they call these kids entertainment? This is not how I get invited to kids parties. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in both of those cases there were rumours circling around for years without any concrete proof. It is also odd that the Seville case was not pursued by authorities until after his death. Seville had a reputation worse than Bill Cosby, he was a known rapist, but nothing was ever done about it.  My father was abused by the church in the 1960s, but the scandal wasn&#39;t revealed until the late 1980s. These things do get swept under the rug, that is why we need concerned citizens to take these accusations seriously, and to investigate in a lawful manner. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just fact checked some of these sources...</p>

<p>&quot;There was also recently a massive pedophile ring bust online reported by nbcnews.&quot; 2009-2011, completely unrelated to government (it was a plain ol&#39; website, boylover.net)</p>

<p>The majority of the pedophilia rings that are FULLY sourced are also COMPLETELY unrelated, just like that one.</p>

<p>&quot;There is an underground vault on the Podestas’ property which admittedly allows them to watch “very complicated video pieces”.&quot; the article continues &quot;on all four walls&quot;</p>

<p>The link to handkerchief code doesn&#39;t link it to THIS SPECIFIC handkerchief. You can&#39;t establish that it&#39;s code, and note also show what it&#39;s code FOR.</p>

<p>I mean I dunno, what single piece of evidence would need to be debunked for people to see this for what it really is--an extremely lose, circumstantial mass of unrelated coincidences that people want to believe is something more. I&#39;m certain if you went through any public figure&#39;s emails, news stories, and their relationships (even the least significant ones, like fundraisers for a politician) you could weave something just as damning as this mess. That doesn&#39;t make it a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Until there&#39;s a witness, or a mysteriously dropped criminal charge, or a single direct lead that isn&#39;t based on the incorrect belief that &quot;pizza&quot; means pedophilia this is not a conspiracy theory, it&#39;s made-up bullshit. By the way, Pizza doesn&#39;t mean Pedophilia. <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cheese%20pizza"><em>Cheese pizza</em> can mean child pornography on 4chan</a>--note the date added, this isn&#39;t related to pizzagate in the slightest--but besides a 4chan post claiming otherwise, not even FBI&#39;s extensive list of pedophilia symbols mentions pizza to mean anything. So we can use the list of codes and symbols provided by the FBI to dissect neighboring business logos, but NOT for something as basic as &quot;pizza is code for underage sex&quot; or something of that nature? <strong>The entire scandal is named after a made-up list of code words</strong> that are completely unsubstantiated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God, I am glad <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has been reclaimed.</p>

<p>The one thing I am hung up on, though, is the FBI symbols thing. I consider myself a rational person and it seems obvious that 99℅ of the &quot;suspicious facts&quot; are simply not in any way suspicious. But the restaurant logos honestly do look like the FBI symbols (particularly Besta Pizza&#39;s) and I haven&#39;t really seen anyone comment on that when debunking the rest of the supposed evidence. That Snopes article says the symbols are actually used between adults to communicate preference, rather than to indicate child sex trafficking locations... But are they really suggesting these 3 nearby restaurants are using their logos to express their preferences in pedophilia?</p>

<p>I suspect there is a more sensible explanation involving pattern recognition, confirmation bias, and the general benign prevalence of symbols like these that I just never noticed before. But I am hung up on how striking the similarity is.      </p>

<p>Edit: After looking at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for a minute I guess I spoke too soon. I wish these guys would go back to The_Donald. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be careful with that well thought out and researched talk, also,  you just forgot to call some people idiots and shills. (I.e. thanks for being open minded and civil).  I&#39;m all for not accepting face value, and researching; but, hurling insults, harrassment, and denigrating others because they don&#39;t instantly agree is nauseating.</p>

<p>Also, none of this can be true.  Someone I know (in their 40&#39;s) says that Taco Bell&#39;s symbol is the eye of the beast and that the company is involved with the Vatican in a child ring, since the early 80s.  Yep, No one has caught them in 35 years.  They must be colluding with FB I or they would have been caught.  Seriously, that is their belief.  I mention it as an example that you just can&#39;t bring sanity to some people, the tinfoil is too tight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, the FBI symbols are very basic. Spirals, triangles, and hearts. All very basic shit. It&#39;s really not surprising to me at all that someone might unknowingly design a logo that contained very similar symbols as the FBI ones.

    <div class="md"><p>Uh yes. After all the conspiracies I&#39;ve researched, all the child trafficking that takes place not only in the US, but in the UK ( and has been linked to elite politicians etc) </p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard to come to that conclusion.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just operating out of one pizza joint. To think this only happens in one spot is naive. It&#39;s merely one of many.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done a lot of research on this and 100% believe this needs to be further investigated.</p>

<p>To not further investigate it is doing all those victims of child abuse a huge disservice and the fact that you are suggesting we just close our eyes and put our fingers in our ears is a huge, huge, illogical thing to do.</p>

<p>Pedophiles want us to do what you&#39;re doing. They want us to think it can&#39;t be possible for something like this to happen.</p>

<p>So keep advocating for nothing to be done to pedophiles. See how far that gets society, ignoring children of sexual abuse. </p>

<p>Fucking wow man. Wow. Good job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;But think of the children!&quot;. We both know that&#39;s an intellectually lazy position people with weak arguments take to push an agenda. If you really give a shit about abused children you&#39;d be putting your resources into finding the actual pedophiles. I&#39;ve dug deep into the pizzagate stuff with an open mind, and I&#39;ve yet to find anything concrete. Every &quot;smoking gun&quot; relies on HUGE leaps in logic or jumping to conclusions three steps away. This is exactly what you&#39;ve done above. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s not hard to come to that conclusion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is for those of us who actually want to find the truth. You say you have an open mind, but the reality is you&#39;ve already made up your mind and you&#39;re blind to anything that doesn&#39;t support what you already believe. Try this, give me one piece of evidence that supports the pizzagate theory that doesn&#39;t involve assuming or jumping to conclusions. I&#39;m willing to bet you can&#39;t, because none exists. Trust me, I&#39;ve looked. You&#39;d rather waste time fighting invisible boogie men than actually help victims because pizzagate has been served up to you on a silver platter and you&#39;re intellectually lazy. Keep fighting the good fight man. </p>

<p>Consider every other conspiracy out there. For example, researchers don&#39;t say &quot;I believe we are being visited by extra terrestrial beings, prove aliens aren&#39;t real otherwise I&#39;m right!&quot;. It&#39;s up to the researcher to collect enough facts to convince others. The pizzagate facts are extremely dubious.</p>

<p>I have no idea how you connect Trump winning to this stupid ass conspiracy.  </p>

<p>I would however love to debate the actual information available. Because I&#39;ve been looking at it, and it&#39;s total fucking bullshit. There&#39;s so little fucking evidence there it makes Benghazi look like a god damn credible investigation (it wasn&#39;t).</p>

<p>If instead you&#39;d rather just hurl insults, well then I guess fuck you.</p>

<p>Get out more. People are not ok. 96% of people on the Internet is angry. An analyst of social media has shown this to be true. In my personal life I see the more money you have, you believe these things more. And a lot of cops for some reason...... I wonder why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit - oh holy fuck..Im putting my edit up here so people dont miss it.  <strong>What you linked to is from the 70s and has nothing to do with a pedo ring in our govt.</strong> As far as I can tell (though it was riddled with grammar and spelling errors) is this about two previoualy convicted men running an underage prostitution ring. It also take some time to paint this as a himosexual problem. So there is that. </p>

<p>That being said what the fuck does this prove with pizzagate? </p>

<hr/>

<p>Oh yeah thats a fact huh? Please do point me to some more resources that detail this ring. Besides an archived chicago tribune article that is. I mean if ots a known fact youd think thered be more links. </p>

<p>No worries I&#39;ll wait.  </p>

<p>The thing that is so sad is sinply this: in our country the catholic church has been complicit in covering uo and allowing known predators to continue to operate and where is all the outrage? Fucking pointed at a pizza place in dc because yall want to play pretend. </p>

<p>Dont worry about helping actual victoms of known abuse. Dont worry about fighting the corruption of a large institute that has political ties to every western country.</p>

<p>Just worry about that pizzagate.</p>

<p>Fuck you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1- The reporduced article has errors in it. I just read the damn thing in its entirety. </p>

<p>2- its the same govt? Well shit its the tech same govt as 1886. What is the connection you&#39;re trying to make  are you saying the govt is a pedo ring? Juat think of how many people work in the federal govt and how many would have to be complicit to keep this undercover for 30 years. </p>

<p>3- the article make no fucking mention of a govt pedo ring. It simply says the state dept destroyed one copy of the list of contacts for a mailing list for a nambla esque newsletter.</p>

<p>For you to take the above as a FACT that a pedo ring exisys, continues to exist and somehow proves pizzagate is astounding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok fair enough. Tbh my comment is perhaps misleading in itself. I dont make a point of reading MSM any more particularly often, and I&#39;ve still not looked into whether or not the BBC etc (am UK based) have covered this. 
Playing devil&#39;s advocate though, does anyone know anything about the perp? Not saying he is, but is there any chance he could be a patsy or otherwise put up to do this as some way to discredit the whole #pizzagate thing as fake news. (I.e. Just yet another reason Clinton lost the presidency)
Again, I&#39;m not coming down on either side here, just intrigued by the whole thing and tbh nothing would surprise me these days. Thanks for the heads up on the CNN report though. </p>

<p>Edit: Ok so a quick search has shown that at least a couple of MSM outlets have covered this story (The Daily Mail for instance.... yeah), the BBC and Sky News however did cover the story, although I had to look in the &#39;trending&#39; sections of both sites to find it.</p>

<p>Curiously though, there does seem to be some suggestion that this guy is a plant: <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/3768709/pizzagate-scandal-shooter-at-comet-ping-pong-pizza-undermines-citizen-investigation/">http://www.inquisitr.com/3768709/pizzagate-scandal-shooter-at-comet-ping-pong-pizza-undermines-citizen-investigation/</a> although I&#39;d have to do more digging to see who is suggesting this.</p>

<p>Interesting development none the less and I&#39;m glad no one was hurt.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Looks like the story of this guy being a plant originated on Heavy.com, or at least that&#39;s where Inquisitr got their bit. After reading the full article though, I&#39;m inclined to believe that he&#39;s just acted of his own volition and not put up to it. Unless he&#39;s been heavily pressed by someone, it would appear that he&#39;s pretty much the kinda guy who might do this sort of thing. Of interest is the fact that he follows Alex Jones, posts anti-Muslim videos and his family have worked to prevent child abuse in the past. (No judgement) <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2016/12/edgar-maddison-welch-comet-pizza-pizzagate-washington-dc-gunman-suspect-photos-pictures-facebook-conspiracy-north-carolina/">http://heavy.com/news/2016/12/edgar-maddison-welch-comet-pizza-pizzagate-washington-dc-gunman-suspect-photos-pictures-facebook-conspiracy-north-carolina/</a></p>

When Wikileaks dropped some politically related emails, there were patterns that lead many of us to believe we got a behind the scenes peek at the ring.

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that there&#39;s no evidence and no victims coming forward just proves how good a job they&#39;re doing covering their tracks!! Also the police and FBI are ALL obviously in on it. Clearly, it will take more direct action from patriots like this to really crack the case and save these kids. </p>

<p>/s obviously. But isn&#39;t that the logical outcome of this line of thinking? If you truly believe this is a massive child trafficking ring, and the police are in on it why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> you grab a gun and try to save some lives? </p>

<p>Of course, maybe you should also first consider that just maaaaybe there&#39;s nothing here. And in that case, that this &quot;&quot;investigation&quot;&quot; is ruining the life and business of some random guy who just happened to be tangentially connected to a guy whose emails were hacked? And that this very nearly resulted in violence? Which may not be avoided next time? And maybe by continuing to feed the fire, you will bear some personal responsibility for all of this? </p>

<p>What if I&#39;m right? Than maybe future children will not have to face similar horrors, though I doubt the problem will stop, children who have lost their lives and souls to this will maybe somewhat be vindicated, and most importantly, those found guilty will be brought to justice.</p>

<p>Though I doubt any of this will happen. Pedo pockets run deep apparently, and in this world, you just throw $ at problems until they go away.</p>

<p>The people trying to save freedom of speech by asking folks to put a lid on libel (pizza nonsense)?</p>

<p>Recently MSM have been trying to disprove/discredit the pizza pedo scandal but not presenting any evidence to corroborate with the idea these people are innocent (from at least the articles I&#39;ve read) it&#39;s just slandering of the people looking into this , these are posts the article quotes from the reputable source that is 4chan:<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry to say this guys but it was a mistake,&quot; said one recent post. &quot;Not every conspiracy theory is true.&quot;</p>

<p>How exactly do you prove something that didn&#39;t happen? By the way, you&#39;re a pedophile and you have to prove to me that you&#39;re not. If you say, &quot;I&#39;m not a pedophile&quot; it only proves I&#39;m right, because that&#39;s exactly what a pedophile would say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understand that argument, what I was trying to say and point out was that the allegations of pedophilia being made because of say logos that have been seen, or possibly doctored photos, or creepy as fuck imgur posts that allude to child abuse aren&#39;t being mentioned and other reasons aren&#39;t being given for such posts and the existence of them, nor are the Podesta emails being talked about.</p>

<p>To be fair though, if somebody made allegations to me that I was a satanic kiddie fucker, I&#39;d try pretty fucking hard to distance myself from such spurious allegations. If these allegations are indeed full of shit,aren&#39;t there defamation and libel laws in America? Why wouldn&#39;t you use them laws to fight the allegations? I haven&#39;t seen John Podesta talk about this stuff yet (may of missed it), so I&#39;m pretty much forced to come to the conclusion that he&#39;s more involved in this.</p>

<p>Maybe start enacting libel laws against the media who are apparently peddling and supporting lies?

    <div class="md"><p>Are you a shill working to keep this unsubstantiated &quot;news&quot; alive so that the government can turn around and say &quot;hey, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> on reddit is spreading fake news&quot; - at which point the government talks to the reddit staff and says &quot;shut down that crap or we&#39;ll shut you down&quot;.</p>

<p>I get that there&#39;s something wrong. I also get that losing the freedom to talk about what&#39;s wrong is even worse.</p>

<p>If you have actual facts, substantiated and corroborated (just like in a court of law) of the wrongdoing of any involved in the pizzagate scandals, then bring it forward and put it in print.</p>

<p>If everything you have is &quot;he said, she said, some blog said, they said...&quot; then you really need to leave it at the door - it is NOT fact until corroborated, witnessed, and verified. This is the reason the major news outlets aren&#39;t running with the story - if they can&#39;t verify it as fact, THEY CAN&#39;T RUN IT else it&#39;s libel and they will go to court and be fined millions of dollars in damages and possibly even be shut down.</p>

<p>So this isn&#39;t about &quot;what you believe&quot; or &quot;big government coverup&quot; - this is about libel and the government using that libel at this point in history to punch a huge hole in the first amendment.</p>

<p>If any party being talked about gets hurt or is financially damaged because of this &quot;news&quot;, and if the news stays as it is now - completely unsubstantiated - it will be bad for reddit and Americans alike. </p>

<p>And people who are blah-blah-blah about &quot;the man covering up so I&#39;m going to talk louder and bang the table&quot;, well, I&#39;d be real cautious of who, exactly, they&#39;re working for. The government at the behest of the rich people want nothing more than to nullify the constitution and each of the amendments that have been a pain in their side since this country was founded.</p>

<p>peace. out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll simply repost this comment as I believe it accurately describes exactly how I feel. </p>

<p>I was/am simply calling for people not to be scared of discussing it. I don&#39;t believe anyone should be going to comet, or leaking peoples names, etc. Hell I can admit the Instagram shit, not what&#39;s on it the posting of it to shame someone, makes me uncomfortable. Hence why generally I&#39;m not involved in any discussion regarding such matters. I just think people should be able to discuss this issue in a way that is both looking for the truth and respectful of individuals rights, no matter what some may think they are involved in. At the same time I recognize that I can&#39;t police the discussion. It&#39;s going to happen whether I like it or not. All I can do is make my points and not engage in any I may disagree with. I have to be respectful of people and allow them to make their own decisions even if I disagree with such. </p>

<p>I think people need to realize that we all come from different backgrounds and approach this in different ways. Some people view privacy on the internet differently. We can&#39;t, as stated police that, its not our place. All we can is pick and choose how and when we will enter into the discussion, if at all. </p>

<p>People just need to be respectful of other opinions and rights, rather than attempting to attack and engage in the very behavior they are accusing others of, ie witch hunts. </p>

<p>We need to understand that people are upset about this because they have been lied to and they feel disenfranchised. They feel as if they are being misled, because sadly they have been, so many times before. People belive this because for years many they were being told, no there&#39;s no pedophile problem, only to find out that there was. Whether it be the BBC, Jimmy Saville, The Vatican, members of Congress, CEO&#39;s, etc, the truth has come out - and after years of people being told they were crazy and the media ignoring it and writing it off. </p>

<p>So yea, it may not be true, you may not have proof you like, but that&#39;s no reason that others shouldn&#39;t be looking. They&#39;ve been down this road before and had the same attacks labeled against them and they&#39;ve seen where it ended up. With this in mind there&#39;s no reason why these people shouldn&#39;t be concerned, its history playing out like it has so many times before. </p>

Many believe these emails will trace back to the documented and ongoing pedo ring. The term pizzagate is just the name of the current investigation into the ring. But there are plenty of archived sources documenting the ring independent of pizzagate. Start with the Franklin Coverup and the John Wayne Gary and the Delta Project coverup.

    <div class="md"><p>Problems with PizzaGate I&#39;ve seen:</p>

<p>(1.) Joe Biden did not tell that 13 year old girl she makes him horny. Not really related, but Pizzagaters want it to be, so I want to start with this one. What he actually says is really obvious if you listen through a pair of cheap laptop speakers. From memory, it&#39;s something like &quot;by the way, I know how hard it is for a 13-year old girl to stand up here next to me. Talk to my daughter Ashley, she went through the whole thing.&quot;</p>

<p>(2.) The &quot;code word&quot; explanations were all invented. Yes, there is an obscure leftover of gay culture known as the &quot;handkerchief code&quot; but it doesn&#39;t cover these words at all: pizza, pasta, cheese, hot dog, ice cream, dominos or map. </p>

<p>The handkerchief code only covers these: handkerchief, white, black.</p>

<p>So, that&#39;s quite a stretch. The rest of the words sprouted from &quot;cheese pizza&quot; being a reference to &quot;child porn&quot; and the rest is 4chan pretend detectives letting their imaginations run wild as they read the Podesta emails.</p>

<p>That is not even circumstantial evidence. You have to be honest with yourself about this. If circumstantial evidence won&#39;t hold up in a court of law, this wild conjecture certainly won&#39;t.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not code; it obviously seems to be code for something. I&#39;m saying that it&#39;s bullshit to say the code has been cracked. Everywhere I see this, people say &quot;see handkerchief code&quot; and link to Wikipedia. Yeah, well, the handkerchief code doesn&#39;t cover those words. There is no evidence that &quot;map&quot; means semen, etc. It&#39;s just people saying &quot;if you interpret it this way, it fits! And look, here is a picture of people eating pizza! That proves it!&quot; No, it doesn&#39;t. And the rest of the &quot;evidence&quot; doesn&#39;t tip the scales, either. It&#39;s all still wild conjecture and confirmation bias, not remotely evidence.</p>

<p>(3.) So Comet Pizza has perverted graffiti on the bathroom walls... so what? This is pretty ordinary for a club that has rock bands playing there. My wife just got her picture taken at a local bar that doesn&#39;t even have rock bands, but they have a chalkboard bathroom with a wall of books (lending library) and it&#39;s kind of cute and fun, so my wife and her friends took their pictures in there.In the photo of my wife, she has a dick coming out the side of her head with instructions &quot;snip here&quot; and &quot;shave here&quot; with arrows pointing to the foreskin and balls respectively, which she didn&#39;t notice when she was taking the picture, but it is clearly written on the chalkboard wall behind her.  I&#39;m sure the idea of the bathroom was to have a kind of cool upscale communal thing (lending library and easy way for people to write messages to each other), but of course people used the chalkboard painted walls to draw pictures of dicks with the chalk.</p>

<p>(4.) People seem to want to tie humanitarian efforts at saving children to a pedophile ring because of Bill Clinton&#39;s ties to Jeffrey Epstein and a picture of a recent success story happily eating pizza. The other possibility is that these really are humanitarian efforts and those people really are happily eating pizza because they were saved from a life of misery. </p>

<p>Bill Clinton being a pervert doesn&#39;t prove that a humanitarian organization dedicated to saving kids is really a front for a global pedophile network.</p>

<p>(5.) Podesta is a life-long art collector and seems like he&#39;s probably a liberal, open-minded guy since both he and Hillary Clinton are well-known for their belief in extra-terrestrials and alien-driven UFOs. So, it is not really strange to me at all that he is friends with an artist who references the occult and may dabble in it herself. Many people dabble in the occult or practice the occult regularly who are not actually Satanists or anything like that. I realize this may be hard to comprehend if you come from an anti-Zionist worldview where Jews are evil because they killed Christ and they control the world through black magick, but the fact is Aleister Crowley is probably the most well-known occultist in our modern era because he put most of the secrets out in the open which he ever learned. His belief was that people should get to know their true self and improve their lives without the restrictions imposed on them by mind-controlling religious institutions. To understand how Crowley wasn&#39;t really &quot;Satanic&quot; as he is often portrayed takes some research to understand. His position about God and the Bible is rather like Einstein&#39;s: he considered both to be superstitions for the naive. However, he did believe that secret information was contained in the Bible for those who knew how to read it. Crowley knew the Bible backwards and forwards, he knew Hebrew, Latin and Koine Greek so he studied it in its original languages. He was a master of Qabalah and knew that the tradition didn&#39;t begin with the Jews, but was also found in Greek culture (Greek Qabalah is proven to pre-exist it&#39;s first appearance in Jewish culture, btw) and he also found reason to believe it corresponded to ancient Egyptian culture. I never verified this last claim myself, but there are many authors who claim Qabalah first came out of Ancient Egypt and perhaps even before that. One of Crowley&#39;s most important rituals was the Bornless One ritual of Greaco/Egyptian origin and which is basically an exorcism.</p>

<p>Many, many artists and open-minded liberal types are or were into Aleister Crowley at some point in their lives. Practically any rock star you can think of (even the notoriously atheist Frank Zappa!), many comic book artists (of note: Grant Morrison and Alan Moore), actors, iconoclasts like Timothy Leary and Robert Anton Wilson, and many kids in high school, art school and colleges who go on to be the next generation of artists inspired by Aleister Crowley. And why not? His message was about liberation. Free-thinking artists are not generally interested in conforming to anything, especially something like The Bible, which most people don&#39;t even seem to understand.</p>

<p>So, my point is that it&#39;s not really weird for Podesta—a certified art snob and liberal guy—to be hanging out with artists who are into the occult. &quot;Spirit cooking&quot; came from Crowley&#39;s writings, but that doesn&#39;t mean this artist is anything more than a hack using shock as an easy way to make money. She may also really be into the occult, but if you&#39;ve ever known people into the occult, a lot of them are completely full of shit. They have wishful-thinking ideas about how successful they are with magick and a lot of self-delusion. They want to believe in magick, maybe they even like the idea of being in touch with &quot;dark forces&quot;; such people are often completely misreading Crowley and making fools of themselves. Crowley wrote that he interpreted every worldly interaction as a direct interaction with God. He wasn&#39;t trying to be evil. The scarier aspects of his &quot;Book of The Law&quot; which he channeled upset him so much that he put them in a drawer and tried to forget about them for several years, thinking they must be bad junk from negative forces. When things kept happening to push him back in the direction he was trying to avoid, he looked more into it and began to see there were other ways to read the channeled writing and perhaps it wasn&#39;t so negative as he thought. After all, the Bible itself is really quite full of a lot more violent &quot;negativity&quot; than what you find in Crowley&#39;s &quot;Book of the Law.&quot; If he channeled the sort of vicious Biblical passages you find in the Old Testament, I&#39;m sure he would have been even more freaked out by it.</p>

<p>I would also like to point out that the often cited and generally misunderstood quote from Crowley about sacrificing virgin boys is actually a veiled reference to semen. Why? Because Crowley was pointing out the absurdity of Victorian morality: it was illegal to write about sex during Crowley&#39;s time, but it was perfectly acceptable to write about violence. Crowley was not the nicest guy, for sure, and he had a sadistic sense of humor. This probably did not benefit him in the end because he garnered such a bad reputation for writing stuff like this that he was called &quot;the wickedest man in the world&quot; ...however, this reputation is probably also why he is now legendary and his writings will be preserved for some years to come. In that sense, it probably benefited him greatly because he was very serious about his religion, not for personal glory but because he dedicated his life to it for liberating the world. His &quot;Book of the Law&quot; predicted that there will be some apocalyptically dark times and those who follow his religion will be the new rulers of the world...and that world will be based on freedom of the individual.</p>

<p>I understand all this will sound horrifying to a Bible-thumper, but it doesn&#39;t freak me out a bit, personally.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>What I do find disturbing</strong> is the Instagram account featuring a very little girl who looks like she might have downs or something that was hashtagged #hotard by the Comet Pizza guys. While it certainly doesn&#39;t indicate she&#39;s a pedophile victim, it is in poor taste no matter how you look at it. I know they all deleted their Instagram accounts now and it&#39;s very possible that they realized there&#39;s no way to explain some of these inside jokes, if they are innocent. Imagine how crazy that would be to be just a bunch of freewheelin&#39; weirdos having fun in your rock n&#39; roll pizza joint and all of a sudden the world thinks you&#39;re running a pedophile ring because you drunkenly hashtagged &quot;hotard&quot; on some image. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what happened, but it&#39;s very possible. Of course, it&#39;s also possible that they really are a pedophile ring and they&#39;re abusing that little girl who looks like she has downs, but I wouldn&#39;t jump to that conclusion, personally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you missed the mark on the code words. I am aware they don&#39;t make sense and seem to be code. That does not mean the words mean what people have come up with. As I said, this is pure conjecture, not even circumstantial evidence. It&#39;s bizarre that you people don&#39;t see it. You&#39;re acting like the code has been cracked, which is why you believe the rest of it so easily. This is called confirmation bias. Start down a new reality tunnel by being a bit more critical about all these pizzagate claims. Most of the pieces do not fit together at all unless you start off with a bunch of false premises. You&#39;re wiling to believe them because they fit your expectations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never said it couldn&#39;t be. Just pointing out there&#39;s a big difference between evidence and confirmation bias. Until you get some real evidence, acting as if you have it makes you look pretty stupid and is also pretty careless with other people&#39;s lives, which is certainly not very &quot;Christian&quot; (which seems to be the prevailing background of a lot of pizzagaters).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you&#39;re making people focus on a very very much alleged pedophile ring out of a pizza place. Meanwhile there is a real child sex slave ring In America, but of course why would that matter since it wasn&#39;t a topic on r/The_donald, right? If you want to help society do that, but all you do is yell into this echo chamber and defend a guy who DID shoot into a basement of a pizza place. If he believed there were children down there, why did he shoot into it!?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, accusations aside I&#39;ve never been to <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>.  Not once in my life, as I am not a fan of Donald Trump, nor do I pretend to be. Nice try though.  </p>

<p>Secondly, as I have stated previously, this sub for better or worse is not <a href="/r/pedophilesexposed">/r/pedophilesexposed</a>.  This is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  Hence I, and everyone else here, is discussing conspiracies, something that last I checked Pizzagate falls under.</p>

<p>Third, when the hell did I EVER defend the person?  When?  Please show me, cause last I checked i wrote:  &quot;Edit 3: It&#39;s sad that this must be said, but let me make this clear: NO ONE in this thread has encouraged, advocated for, or condoned what happened at Comet Pizza. Let me repeat that, NO ONE in this thread has encouraged, advocated for, or condoned what happened at Comet Pizza. Not a single person. Nowhere in this thread, nor any other that I have seen has there been any discussion regarding this being okay, in any way shape or form.&quot;  </p>

<p>Please explain to me how that is a defense or even an acceptance of what this person did?  Not once did I say that what he did was okay.  You are saying the equivalent of &quot;some Christians killed abortion doctors, therefore all Christians must be condoning of said violence if they speak about Christianity.&quot;  Which is so far off base as to be laughable.  </p>

<p>Third and finally, how do you know who the fuck I am?  How do you know what I support?  Do you know every view I have on this matter?  Considering you said &quot;all I do is yell into this echo chamber&quot; I would assume you know what I am doing at all times and every view I have on this matter.  Which is just a bit creepy and strange honestly.  </p>

<p>But here, let me make it very clear for you as I have stated numerous times in this thread already and I&#39;ll say it again since you can&#39;t seem to fucking get it:  I, nor anyone that I have seen in this thread, advocates, encrouages, or stands by any violence regarding this matter.  What this individual did is wrong.  What he did should not have happened.  What he did was in no way justifiable.  That being said, that is no reason why people should just shut down and not discuss this matter.  That, to use another analogy, is like saying that since some Muslims flew some planes into some towers they all need to be shut down, deported, and not allowed to pratice their religion.  Maybe you believe that, but i don&#39;t.  I don&#39;t believe in punishing the whole for the actions of the few.  That is a means of control that I will not stand by.  </p>

<p>So which is it my dude, you want to control the conversation and dicate what is said or do you want to allow people to form their own opinions off of information?  Because here&#39;s the thing if you think that this sub is resposible for this person, then do me a favor next time there is a right wing hate crime go to <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> and let them know how it&#39;s their fault.  Next time there is an attack go to <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and let them know how it&#39;s their fault for reporting on it (you know how what happened with the Boston Bomber happened in <a href="/r/new">/r/new</a> not in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but guess you ignored that huh).  Even talking about the news at all can create copy cats.  So is it their fault when they report on something of questionable nature?  Where do you draw that line?  You seem to know so please inform the rest of us. </p>

<p>Next time you want to attempt to build a straw man though, realize that it will fall apart in a second when someone can simply look back at what was said previously and it flies in the face of any and all accusations you have made.  And in case it wasn&#39;t clear enough, here&#39;s what I posted yesterday further down in this sub, where I make my feeling extremely clear (this is the third fucking time I&#39;ve had to do this too as you people keep wanting to make this shit up, hopefully this will be the last):</p>

<p>I was/am simply calling for people not to be scared of discussing it. I don&#39;t believe anyone should be going to comet, or leaking peoples names, etc. Hell I can admit the Instagram shit, not what&#39;s on it the posting of it to shame someone, makes me uncomfortable. Hence why generally I&#39;m not involved in any discussion regarding such matters. I just think people should be able to discuss this issue in a way that is both looking for the truth and respectful of individuals rights, no matter what some may think they are involved in. At the same time I recognize that I can&#39;t police the discussion. It&#39;s going to happen whether I like it or not. All I can do is make my points and not engage in any I may disagree with. I have to be respectful of people and allow them to make their own decisions even if I disagree with such.
I think people need to realize that we all come from different backgrounds and approach this in different ways. Some people view privacy on the internet differently. We can&#39;t, as stated police that, its not our place. All we can is pick and choose how and when we will enter into the discussion, if at all.
People just need to be respectful of other opinions and rights, rather than attempting to attack and engage in the very behavior they are accusing others of, ie witch hunts.
We need to understand that people are upset about this because they have been lied to and they feel disenfranchised. They feel as if they are being misled, because sadly they have been, so many times before. People belive this because for years many they were being told, no there&#39;s no pedophile problem, only to find out that there was. Whether it be the BBC, Jimmy Saville, The Vatican, members of Congress, CEO&#39;s, etc, the truth has come out - and after years of people being told they were crazy and the media ignoring it and writing it off.
So yea, it may not be true, you may not have proof you like, but that&#39;s no reason that others shouldn&#39;t be looking. They&#39;ve been down this road before and had the same attacks labeled against them and they&#39;ve seen where it ended up. With this in mind there&#39;s no reason why these people shouldn&#39;t be concerned, its history playing out like it has so many times before.</p>

<p>TL:DR quit making shit up that&#39;s easily disproven.  </p>

As this place hosts some gay-friendly events, the classic link between pederasty and pedophilia was done. From then on it was just a stupid snowball creating an avalanche of total nonesense: taking the smallest clue as evidence and dismissing anything that didn&#39;t fit the narrative.</p>

<p>A classic conspiracy shitstorm that would have wanished, but given the tribune the PEOTUS gives to such ideas, no wonder some now feel emboldened enough to take action.</p>

<p>Playing nicely into the government&#39;s stated intention of them taking on the role of what&#39;s true, what isn&#39;t, and who gets to say what.</p>

<p>Nice job guys, nice job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure about that. How do you explain all those weird Posdesta and co emails in the wikileaks. </p>

<p>&quot;now, might actually get someone killed&quot; this whole thing with the guy going in there with a gun sounds a bit contrived. </p>

<p>Reddit users are pretty good at separating fact from bullshit. All the stuff I&#39;ve seen from wikileaks emails etc, certainly sounds like more investigation is warranted. And you can&#39;t really investigate if people are afraid of mentioning words... even scary words like pizza and hot dogs. That&#39;s fucking retarded. </p>

<p>Let the information pour and let the truth come out, wherever it leads. Fuck the censors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1- The reporduced article has errors in it. I just read the damn thing in its entirety. </p>

<p>2- its the same govt? Well shit its the tech same govt as 1886. What is the connection you&#39;re trying to make  are you saying the govt is a pedo ring? Juat think of how many people work in the federal govt and how many would have to be complicit to keep this undercover for 30 years. </p>

<p>3- the article make no fucking mention of a govt pedo ring. It simply says the state dept destroyed one copy of the list of contacts for a mailing list for a nambla esque newsletter.</p>

<p>For you to take the above as a FACT that a pedo ring exisys, continues to exist and somehow proves pizzagate is astounding. </p>

<p>The people who think the this theory is BS are the ones that are way far gone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what I said.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things wrong with some of the theories coming forward about pizzagate. From the early days people were making connections here and there that were pure assumptions. That&#39;s what happens in every investigation, whether it is the law enforcement authorities, private investigators, or random people on the Internet doing mediocre detective work.</p>

<p>You take the base facts, and you try to make sense of it and come up with theories. The difference is that when law enforcement is doing an investigation, not only do they have much more resources, but they also do not announce every last little theory they have about the investigation until they have a solid case set in place.</p>

<p>Here on reddit, people are posting every last thought and idea they have, and many many many of these are going to be wrong. Remember that and you won&#39;t be one of the idiots that want to censor the conversations people are having online. </p>

<p>But anyway, there is a base of facts that launched the conspiracy in the first place. It&#39;s easy for anyone to look up if they want to.</p>

<p>I was initially responding to a person who simply gave an emotionally-charged response with profane language which didn&#39;t add to the conversation in any meaningful way. Literally, a troll. </p>

<p>Most of the rest of us try to have a civil discussion, talking about what we know for sure and some plausibilities. </p>

<p>Others jump to conclusions and state their theories as fact. Others are skeptics and have a civil conversation about it. Then there are others that just sit and try to derail any conversation by screaming and yelling and dropping profanity, to no benefit to anyone.</p>

<p>If you 100% think the theories are fake, then calmly state what you believe in a clear and concise manner, with supporting facts addressing each point. If you make sense, then people will upvote you and you will change minds. </p>

<p>If you do not have anything productive to share and just want to troll, then do not participate in this conversation. Go somewhere else. (As if my plea is going to stop the real trolls anyway)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well... I&#39;m not the one using &quot;LOL&quot; and throwing random baseless unrelated statements regarding a child sex abuse topic.</p>

<p>If your pizzagate is about the biggest majority of victims:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why are you guys panicking with innocent baby pictures of a father and his son, and see sex into it?</strong> Avg age 2-4 yo </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why do you panic and post half the art collection of that painter if your focus isn&#39;t about young children?</strong> avg age 6-10yo </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why do you mix McCann to this?</strong> age 4yo</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why is it that 90% of your &#39;proofs&#39; and &#39;arguments&#39; are related to babies and very young children, and not a single teenager or hebephile reference besides Epstein picture?</strong> ....</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do you guys have any clue what is a pedophile and what is a hebephile, and how they are so different that they cannot really be mixed together or even investigated the same?</strong> You have zero profiling or psychological research about both types but you are still doing some switch and bait using one or the other to prove your &#39;huuuuuuge&#39; pedophilia network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Did you read all the Epstein police reports and know how the victims got in touch with Epstein?</strong> Their own friends recruited them for money. It was a pimp &quot;commission based scheme&quot; with willing participant avg age 17, youngest 15.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How did Savile got to his victims?</strong> Most of time, the parents brought the children. No trafficking or network. The guy is actually a very opportunistic sexual predator, his victims range from 8yo to 75yo (seventy-five years old!)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bosnia &#39;pedo&#39; ring??</strong> This?  <em>&quot;1999: Whistle-blower Kathryn Bolkovac, who was working as a UN International Police Force monitor in Bosnia, *</em>reveals UN police officers were paying for prostitutes and participating in trafficking of young women from eastern Europe as sex slaves*<em>.</em> (hint: young women = adults)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>England ring?</strong> WHICH ONE!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hasterman?</strong> Do you mean Dennis Hastert? He was a teacher who had access to young boys.... Not really a pizzagate with pizza and occult. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hollywood ring?</strong> Fits exactly what I described about teenagers (recruited and abused through promises of work, money,drug or fame)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dutroux?</strong> That&#39;s probably the closest to your &quot;pizzagate&quot; and not. Maybe you guys are too scared to investigate OTO and I wouldn&#39;t blame you...</p></li>
<li><p>etc. </p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>You mix everything together, throw names around while each case had a very different modus operandi, targets, etc.</p>

That just to show how the info that was taken from those emails were cherry-picked by pizza peeps and you didn&#39;t even really verify the so called &quot;adoption scandal&quot; of Silsby.</p>

<p>Why the adoption should be higher than the previous and next years? Because half of the population are kids........................ Doesn&#39;t take a math genius to figure out even without looking at the casualties there&#39;s most likely more kids orphans than parents whose kids died. The point is the stat is intriguing and it&#39;s the theories why that are interesting, not how to disprove there&#39;s anything that went on there. It&#39;s not a competition, dude. Wanna save kids or not?</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re just using bad faith and fallacies for a mysterious reason and motivation. Doesn&#39;t make sense to look at Haiti? That&#39;s what I&#39;m suggesting. Don&#39;t go insecure thinking I&#39;m trying to disprove the fail pizzagate by using Haiti; both are possible at the same time but maybe you guys don&#39;t have much interest in black little kids, I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not a secret either there&#39;s a lot of child labor there, just read the reports, check which corporation did the pay-to-play. Lot of relationships. You guys are horribly insecure and terrible investigators. I also find it interesting the Epstein note is of no interest to any of you and was mentioned many times....!

<p>why did you completely ignore him being Executive Director for Protect-A-Child, a national, non-profit organization to prevent abuse and abduction of children&quot;?</p>

<p>Because I didn&#39;t want to go through each line of this guys resume saying &quot;this is a reasonable and nice job for someone to have&quot;, &quot;in fact, it may be the fact that this guy&#39;s father has been trying to protect children his whole life that this dude took these crazy accusations about kids getting hurt too far&quot;.</p>

<p>The rule of bullshit is that it takes an order of magnitude more effort to disprove it than to create it. For every arbitrary line you throw, i have to type a paragraph trying to teach you why it&#39;s ridiculous and I don&#39;t want to have to do that. So I pick a few and write about those.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell me this, if the shooter really cared about the children at comet, why wouldn&#39;t he ask his dad for help? You would think &quot;Executive Director for Protect-A-Child, a national, non-profit organization to prevent abuse and abduction of children&quot; would be a pretty good help in bringing down or at least investigate Comet Pong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe he did and the dad looked at the evidence and said &quot;that doesn&#39;t make any sense, I&#39;m trying to actually help children, not farm karma on internet forums and threaten a pizza place with no evidence&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You have to have evidence to investigate anything. ANY evidence. Pictures of children are not evidence. Cherry picked emails talking about food are not evidence. </p>

<p>Even if this is <em>all true</em> <em>ALL OF IT</em> you still need to get evidence <em>first</em>. You need some victims, or some victims families. Or some accuser. Or any evidence at all. </p>

<p>I bet if I went through your email history or hell, your REDDIT history, post-by-post and cherry picked a 3 out of a thousand, I could make you sound like anything I wanted. That isn&#39;t evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not playing devils advocate and I&#39;m not arguing with you. I&#39;m having a discussion with you while utilizing critical thought and knowledge, while not relying on confirmation bias, to support what I am saying. </p>

<p>Making assertions based on all of the available information is far better than blind ignorance.</p>

<p>When those assertions are based in critical reading/examination/thought and writing? Yes. When based on inductive and deductive reasoning? Yes. When based on information that is not clarified and can&#39;t be quantified? No. When based on 4chan and reddit ramblings? No. Be skeptic, question everything, but don&#39;t be so quick to hop on shit because you think it&#39;s one way when, in fact, it could be something totally different. </p>

BTW, when I say &quot;you&quot; I am not talking about you specifically. I mean it in general terms.</p>

<p>It absolutely can. However, people need to think long and hard about it. </p>

<p>&#39;Needing&#39; evidence - in this context, of an &#39;investigation&#39; or &#39;enquiry&#39; - suggests that you already have a conclusion. That&#39;s not how it works. In an investigation you look for the evidence, and if it isn&#39;t there, you abandon the investigation.</p>

<p>Of course, child-trafficking has nothing to do with pedophilia right? Not even when there is a common thread between the Laura Silsby case and Comet Ping Pong in the form of the 42nd President of the United States.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a fun question for you. Who is the statue in James Alefantis Instagram profile picture of? </p>

<p>This is from Wikipedia:</p>

<p>For centuries, pederasty had long been socially acceptable among Greece&#39;s leisured and citizen classes, with an older erastes (aged between 20 and 40) undertaking a caring sexual relationship with an eromenos (aged between 12 and 18) and taking a key role in their education;[20] and Hadrian took Antinous as a favoured servant when they were aged about 48 and 13. Such a societal institution of pederasty was not indigenous to Roman culture, although bisexuality was the norm in the upper echelons of Roman society by the early 2nd century.[21]</p>
