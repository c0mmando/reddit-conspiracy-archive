        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yes, there&#39;s some damning code in the Podesta emails. Yes, I believe Assange and Wikileaks have been compromised since this presidential election cycle in the US and Brexit. Yes, there are Lucifarian pedophilia rings of an international level. This is where energy should be redirected. </p>

<p>But no, Comet Ping Pong is not some sex/murder venue. No, Instagram and hastags do not a child abuser or murderer make. No, it is NOT ok to look at every instance of pizza, or ping pong, or graphics with hearts or spirals on the Internet as being a pedophilia reference. <em>And most fucking certainly</em>, NO, you are not researching, investigating or infiltrating a criminal offense, by watching YouTube and clicking links. </p>

<p>There are WILD speculation and reaches. There is a crazed &quot;<em>WE must be vigilant</em>&quot; narrative overtaking this sub. I am not shilling, CTR or concern trolling you with this post. I am a regular reader and commentor of this sub for over 3 years. My journey through understanding American, then global politics went through many phases of personal reflection, anger, absolute disgust and depression, optimism, anxiety and yes, more anger, as people with patience and understanding explained different theories on religion, medicine, science, psychology, philosophy &amp; kept posting complex and informative, yet.open.for.discussion! posts and comments. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not exactly sure how the crowd that used to amuse me in YouTube comments has now somehow been localized to this sub. I&#39;m not sure how to say this without sounding arrogant or cruel, but many of the recent threads have been at a remidial level of understanding of politics and society. This is middle school mentality. This is not even a high school level of critical thinking or how to determine a viable source. This is herd mentality, mixed with a very concerning belief that YouTube views somehow equals authenticity. And much of the commenting here in the past 20 days is immature and highly repetitive. </p>

<p>This sub used to have issues with NeoNazis or people in a psychotic state flooding posts or comments for a few days at a time. Occasionally, it&#39;s the <em>reddit is fucking with my sub and that&#39;s censorship!</em> type brigades. But in general, the discussions have been about disillusion of rights, religious dogma, suppressed technologies, history or knowledge, metaphysical or biological questions and information. </p>

<p><em>There is no Pizzagate Army. You are not enlisted to harass the members of this sub, the creators of content or commentors on those content sites and yes, the owner and employees of a dive pizza bar in DC. You are not entitled to witch hunt. You are not on a CSI team by looking at Google Maps or people&#39;s social media accounts.</em></p>

<p>Please, respected or exasperated members of this community, pleaseeeeee, speak up. Mods, please explain how this slippery slope threatens this sub as a whole. </p>

<p>I have yet to see a single comment in this sub that is Pro-pedophilia. <em>Absolutely no one here is saying that the actions of individuals that engage in sex abuse of children (or very specifically, who engage in ritualistic acts that involve or mimic abuse or sacrifice of any individual for occult beliefs) IS A GOOD THING.</em> </p>

<p>Please, if this one issue seems to be a pressing and logical concern of yours, go to the Voat forum, or create and moderate your own sub, or start your own YouTube channel. Please, stop flooding this sub. Please, if you choose to subscribe and comment here, read a fuckton of that sidebar information and previous TOP posts.  If you don&#39;t want to abide by the community rules, GTFO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well feel free to offer up an alternative term under which people can organize online, as far as researching the history of child predator problems in government. </p>

<p>I agree that even if there was something nefarious happening at CPP, it doesn&#39;t matter now because a few idiots decided to attack those people directly on their social media. So even if there had been something going on there, the whole place would be cleared out by now, any evidence that may have been would now be gone.</p>

<p>But regardless, &quot;pizzagate&quot; is obviously what people are using currently in order to organize online when it comes to concerns and research into the greater problem as a whole. Do you have any constructive ideas on an alternative term for organizing such awareness and research?</p>

<p>As far as the &quot;middle school mentality&quot; issue you describe, I think a lot of it comes from people knowing that child predator rings are very real, and that governments are often involved, like you acknowledge, but people also feel helpless and don&#39;t know what to do about it. Since all their lives, they have been taught that they should rely on the authorities to handle such things, but obviously in many cases the authorities are compromised. And at the same time, we can&#39;t have stupid nut jobs doing things like intimidating restaurants with a rifle, and some of the recent &quot;Anonymous&quot; videos didn&#39;t exactly help with that. Given their underlying &quot;you must take matters into your own hands or you condone child rape&quot; messages. </p>

<p>So how about some more practical solutions? What about raising awareness as far as the common warning signs of child abuse, so that people could get involved if they noticed the signs in a child in their own life? Child abuse exists everywhere, including average citizens/families, not just governments or big cults. </p>

<p>Then what about cases where there is a lot of evidence of child abuse (victim witnesses, the burn scars, etc), such as was the case in the infamous Boys Town situation, how about some people being dedicated to keeping an eye out for such cases in their own states, and then trying to organize large public protests when a case like that is current? Or what about people simply taking the time to spread informative sources like that Conspiracy of Silence documentary, so that people know some of the issues to look out for?</p>

<p>There are several things people can do to empower themselves when it comes to this issue, without breaking the law or doing crazy stupid shit. If you want to see people steer away from emotionally-driven hysteria, then try promoting more strategic and practical ways to be involved. You ought to know by now that simply insulting or guilt tripping people won&#39;t be effective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this response. My efforts about awareness in this area will be private and I&#39;m not going to speak online about it, until after I understand some of the legal ramifications. </p>

<p>And because of the nature of the seriousness of this issue and its actual global ramifications, the majority of the discussion about just this ONE location, (instead of the authors of those emails!) seems detrimental to the cause entire. Not to mention the amount of bullshit, abusive language, disturbing imagery and speculative descriptions. It&#39;s not good for the soul to go looking into the darkness without keeping your feet firmly planted on good soil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, you bray on for no one but yourself and advance couched advocation of  censorship. The mods do their due diligence and it is just you who so brashly clarion call hysterically for changes in content that apparently YOU must first approve of. The reason there is such a flurry of Pizzagate posts is because it is a hot topic that is pretty pervasive throughout global social media. People are starving for information on the topic and some want to gain recognition by associating themselves to releasing some ground-breaking information. This is causing repeats of informational posts, duplication of post subjects or other blind alley or shit posts. Unfortunately, new Pizzagate info around Comet Ping Pong is not forthcoming, as I would imagine they have closed ranks and are quite busy sanitising any further incriminating details within their ranks. </p>

<p>Honestly, there are prolific networks of protected paedophile rings globally, many with government and law-enforcement connections and Pizzagate is but the tip of the iceberg. I can&#39;t explain why the mass outrage is propelling the investigations into these crimes now when they have been occurring for years, but I can tell you that the rage and the interest in pursuing justice for these victimised children are overwhelming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the paintings, etc, are real, then I <em>do</em> believe Pizzagate is real. How could I not? </p>

<p>Is the shooter a false flag? Nah, the world is pretty wonky as it is; it doesn&#39;t need that much help. </p>

<p>Will the shooter be used as a narrative to discredit the claims? Why would they not? It&#39;s a news story that writes itself <em>and</em> something the editor can get behind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s speculation. The #chickenlover Instagram photo? That&#39;s a little girl, the same baby as the one teething on the money. But somehow that&#39;s &quot;evidence&quot; of a homosexual male abusing a male baby? Is some of the imagery or verbage a bit shocking? Sure. It&#39;s a gay-owned, hipster, punk, dive bar scene. Do any redditors ever hang out with people with too much money and education? They&#39;re &quot;witty&quot; like this. </p>

<p>Children in trafficking rings would not be photographed or escorted in public. They would not be well-fed and dressed and smiling for a selfie. They are hallowed souls. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://sli.mg/a/CteeyU">pics he posted</a> made me raise an eyebrow, then <a href="https://i.sli.mg/bDa9Wl.png">the source code</a>.</p>

<p>This could still a cause of <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1461923/7066841">Google glitching the time</a>, but it might not also.</p>

<p>Regardless, things like this need investigation.</p>
