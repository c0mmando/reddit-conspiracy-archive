    <div class="md"><p>The question is more aligned with should it be allowed to happen rather than can it.</p>

<p>Should Texas be allowed to secede? Should California? If a states interests are no longer served by its place in the union, why can it not leave? </p>

<p>If we formed a group of 50 people, and one person did the economic work for at least 45 others, and the others contributed nothing, and some how those 45 other members individually get more voting credits per person in the group electoral college, and they vote against that one members beliefs and interests, why can&#39;t that member/s leave? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not? Why shouldn&#39;t states get to secede if their voters aren&#39;t given equal value, and they are paying for other states that can&#39;t support themselves.</p>

<p>Why does California have to be held back by regressive social and economic policies they disagree with?</p>

<p>Why do we have to be the United States of America when the country is not united anymore? It&#39;s more divided than ever, and the political parties (chiefly republican and right wing extremists) refuse to negotiate or cooperate. They have explicitly said this. </p>

<p>We are too far apart at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>California built the west coast. Seventh largest economy in the world, and held back because of supporting conservative states and probably half the country that voted for Trump. </p>

<p>California showed up for work. Made $100 bucks. Had to spend $20 taking care of welfare states that criticize California&#39;s governance. Then California voters are worth less than other voters through the electoral college, and California gets legislation and a president handed to them, they don&#39;t agree with, they were against, and are socially and economically regressive. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense. I don&#39;t understand how conservatives are against welfare, but they are okay with California paying for them while they bite at the hand that feeds them. </p>

<p>California, New York, and other blue states should get to secede. This government does not represent California, we&#39;re paying too much, taxed disproportionately high without equal representation.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see a model where the electoral college is adjusted to reflect economic strength.</p>

<p>Ooo, that&#39;d make things really interesting. - you&#39;re state is failing - you&#39;re a dumb ass that can&#39;t pay our way - no votes for you. </p>

<p>Agriculture with the farm bills, anti competitive legislation favoring California&#39;s tech and entertainment industries and investment into film production by members of the federal government make California&#39;s economy what it is.</p>

<p>Federal taxes = taxpayer money. The middle class pays for California. California doesn&#39;t pay for the rest of the states. Dafuq you talking about? State taxes are used in state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so anymore. </p>

<p>At a governance level, because of the electoral college, gerrymandering, liberal ideas are not given equitable weight compared to their per person votes.</p>

<p>It was made very clear that conservatives will not cooperate or negotiate with democrats in any way at all ever. If Hillary won, there&#39;d be no cooperation. Even worse than Obama. They said so.</p>

<p>Democratic states are taxed higher, represented less per voter, and there are no negotiations or compromise.</p>

<p>I fail to see how powerful democratic states are served by their existence in this union. </p>

<p>If politicians were able to compromise and negotiate, and Californians were fairly represented in the electoral college, this wouldn&#39;t be an issue in my eyes. </p>

<p>If liberals and conservatives were closer, this wouldn&#39;t be an issue.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s at a dysfunctional level at this point. </p>

<p>What would you say to a Californian that had to pay higher taxes to cover failed red states, that gets less voting weight, that has the seventh largest economy in the world, that does not have a say in the senate, house, Supreme Court (soon), executive branch, and wants out? </p>

<p>Californians are opposed to everything the 2016 federal government is after. </p>

<p>Californians don&#39;t benefit from Trump pissing off China and Mexico and Europe and allying with Russia. We don&#39;t benefit from military spending as most of the contracts go to smaller states and even the generals want the spending cut. We don&#39;t want vouchers and charter and private schools. We don&#39;t want tax cuts of 14% for the wealthiest and less than 1% for everyone else. We don&#39;t want a Irresponsible government that doesn&#39;t believe in climate change. We don&#39;t want a corrupt government filled with billionaire sharks waiting to eat pick the public apart. We love social safety nets in government hands, not private billionaires and foreign corporations that love to play &quot;Oops bankruptcy all your money is gone.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always find discussions about succession to be quite interesting. Personally I feel that succession is likely inevitable, but I&#39;m finding this discussion is missing the point to some extent. I&#39;m seeing lots of comments about &#39;blue states&#39; and &#39;red states&#39; and voters not being adequately represented, but even in California the red vs blue split is more about urban vs rural voters not so much about state vs state differences. Interestingly this urban vs rural issue goes back to the American Civil war if not further. I think because the split is urban vs rural in nature as opposed to state vs state, east coast vs west coast, etc. we probably won&#39;t see any significant succession related events in the near future.</p>

<p>An example to illustrate my point, back in 2012 when Obama was reelected there were calls in Texas for a succession referendum by some individuals. While most of Texas is &#39;red&#39; the major urban centers are largely &#39;blue&#39; just like everywhere else in America, and urban Texans responded with a message of unity with the other states. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see any major state vs state friction until the crushing weight of the US national debt comes to bear. I suspect that when it comes time to determine who is going to pay for the $19 trillion (and growing) in debt, that&#39;s when relations will break down. We ain&#39;t seen nothing yet.</p>
