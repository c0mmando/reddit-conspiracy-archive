       This is definately something to be concerned about, I posted a while back (atleast if it feels like a while ago, maybe only a week or so) about Steins recount and the possibility that they will throw the election back to Hillary and kick off a civil war. The fact that trump has appointed Maddog Mattis might be his insurance policy to ensure the Military is on his side in the event of a steal. This could get rough, if you are in a large city in America I suggest you get some food and water together, incase it gets ugly

       I don't think it will matter, Clinton conceded the election to Trump. It's like the 2004 election where Kerry conceded while Ohio was basically still up for grabs.

       1) Clinton had nothing to do with it. And, 2) Bernie and Trump Both are more dishonest than she has been per fact-checking. Her reputation for being dishonest is perpetuated by false news and propaganda. Hillary Clinton has a 72% Truth rating versus 14% for Trump, and 14% for Bernie Sanders.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you possibly believe Clinton can't be trusted to be honest? Don't like facts?

       Really? That's your big deal? You think that overshadows a lying, fraudulent, sexual predator who screws over small businesses to build his projects and refuses to pay them? The Clinton/LIAR narrative is debunked and widely inaccurate. Trump is a very very dangerous man. I don't know why you voted for him but you will regret it one day if not already.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about his inescapable conflicts of interest? They are major NATSEC problems and threats that could easily start a war. There's no way to escape them. The day he's inaugurated, Trump can be blackmailed, his properties around the world will be attacked. Do you think he should go to war with Qatar one day just because his tower there was demolished?

       Everyone lies. dont blame him for using us laws to his advantage. Sexual Predator where are all those women allegations against him now? He wont pay people that dont do good work... they then sue him thats buisness.

       Plus Clinton was much worse i seen what she has done while secratery of state I saw the emails from Wikileaks.

      <p>
       You know who would have started a war? Clinton. I mean they were setting up more anti russian narrative over time only a matter of time.

       Trump winning averted ww3 for a little bit longer.

      <p>
       Should you make assumptions into whats gonna happen? Qatar gave money to the clintons so did saudi arabia what do they do to women and gays? But you trust the person that took over 25 million dollars in donations from them?
      </p>
      <p>
       You make lots of assumpions sit back relax see what happens dont get your panties in a bunch you dont know whats gonna happen and you cant change it.

       I will gladly debate this with you if you could be so kind as to remind me on Dec 10th or later. I am in the middle of school Finals and honestly don't have time. But I'd be happy to sort it out, and naturally I will concede IF I am wrong. Not trying to be a dick, but this is relatively low priority until finals are over.

       Those downvotes. You realize you're in the conspiracy sub right? Most people here, left or right, despise the Clintons. Lies? How about murder? Blatant corruption? Politifact is controlled. Either you've drunk too much of the koolaid or you're on the payroll.

       Clearly your not a trump fan based on your other post, and to be honest that is perfectly fine. However, this is about stealing an election, and regardless of whether you like the candidate or not, this is a slipperly slope if you don't believe in being in-partial about your preferred candidate and preserving democracy.

      <p>
       As much as I hate Hillary and Bernie, If they won fair and square I'd fight against stealing the election from them.

       If you want to base it on principle then wouldn't supporting constitutional election law be the principle in question? Afterall, that is the principle our country is founded upon. Not sure where you are getting the idea that correcting what was done incorrectly to begin with is considered "stealing." In that case, destroying thousands of ballots on Nov 8—which isn't debatable, it's a fact —was an attempt (almost successful even) to steal the election in the first place, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       And actually it is about you or I, given your an American citizen. As an American citizen, I really don't dig people trying to rig the system by throwing away fellow American voters ballots. Yours mine or anyone's. It's bigly illegal and unAmerican, right? Are you wanting your candidate to win by any means necessary, or any legal means necessary?

       Also "Fuckery" already happened on Nov 8. Do you expect peeler to sit back and show that to persist and do nothing? You know better than that. Fair and square is the only way out here. No one will accept voter suppression. You wouldn't, why should anyone else?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows, maybe it'll be advantageous for you. Looks like many promised are being reneged in already. Trump voters might have been conned. Not looking very good. What happens when coal miners get screwed, which is guaranteed. What about Medicare? That affects everyone, parents, grandparents etc. What then? Will you be willing to pay for your parents health care? And Disability, what if you became disabled? Ryan wants to gut ALL of that. Do you support doing that?

       Is not a Hillary thing. It's an election thing plus voter ethics and integrity. Anamolous evidence related to voter log counts vs actual votes triggered a legitimate problem. You can't have more votes than voters typically. Clinton remained outside of the folks who identified and zeroed in on this. She's only recently become involved because the NSA and FBI notified her campaign (and the opposition) formally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently numerous polling machines showed upwards of 1000 more votes than voters. In one county ward some 5000 votes were discarded due to mislabeled ID validation. It's a real mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, after an audit, they determine new totals, they'll need to be authenticated and subsequently update official totals. If the new totals affect the election outcome, who knows what they'll do.

       But your missing the bigger point here. If it were Hillary, as much as it would pain me, I'd still take the same stance. It's not a path I want to embark on regarding election manipulation. Extremely slippery slope. This isn't about Trump or Hillary, it's about the integrity of our Nations election process, which frankly, already has more than enough problems.

       I mean, I don't honestly know how much the tampering affected anything else, but way more than the HRC switcheroo, I'm concerned about people getting the other elected officials and ballot issues properly represented. Yeah, it's the principle of the thing.

       1) Clinton had nothing to do with it. And, 2) Bernie and Trump Both are more dishonest than she has been per fact-checking. Her reputation for being dishonest is perpetuated by false news and propaganda. Hillary Clinton has a 72% Truth rating versus 14% for Trump, and 14% for Bernie Sanders.

       How can you possibly believe Clinton can't be trusted to be honest? Don't like facts?

       Clearly your not a trump fan based on your other post, and to be honest that is perfectly fine. However, this is about stealing an election, and regardless of whether you like the candidate or not, this is a slipperly slope if you don't believe in being in-partial about your preferred candidate and preserving democracy.

       Those downvotes. You realize you're in the conspiracy sub right? Most people here, left or right, despise the Clintons. Lies? How about murder? Blatant corruption? Politifact is controlled. Either you've drunk too much of the koolaid or you're on the payroll.
