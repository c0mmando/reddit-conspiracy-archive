<p>Why would he respond to any of this. He is probably quietly deleting any and all information regarding pizza, and sealing off his pedo bunker in his house. </p>

<p>Well Alefantis did. I think most people would respond to allegations as serious as this especially when they are a public figure and the allegations are supposedly false.</p>
