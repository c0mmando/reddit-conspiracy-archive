       No. China has on its own been the enemy of all western developed countries. With their constant stealing of IP, massive knock off market, stealing research and development, installing viruses/backdoors/malware onto all electronics they can so they have a larger bot net to attack the west's internet, their vastly fucked up trading policy where it's just a one way street with them, and most importantly but not last their almost constant attacking of the environment through massive amounts of pollution that rivals all other countries by leaps and bounds as well as their destruction of fish populations by over fishing at a rate of 8x their quota per year for decades. It's not a conspiracy it's just that China the nation is a gigantic asshole who doesn't care how much damage they are doing to the world or all other countries. I mean they literally steal peoples hopes, dreams, and thoughts all to then take credit for any discovery. Evil.

       This is very much the view of the west that I hear but most of these claims like the knock off market and IP /research stealing I see as acceptable because they slow down human progress especially in healthcare or technology we should be working towards the betterment of humanity, not personal gain. Agreed spying on its own people is bad but no worse than the US or the UK or Russia or I'm pretty sure most of the other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Environmental damage is a world wide issue that every country is dealing with and in some areas, China is most improved (not hard considering they were the worsed).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that I'm really arguing but they aren't that bad but the media and new seem to want us to fear them.

       Do you actually think the rise of China was an accident? Somebody financed it, encourage critical technology to be exported, companies to move there and managed the political sphere to support all this.

       Now think again.

       IMHO China itself plays it smart. Why shouldn't they?

       Some things  most people miss are  that when money is spent it isn't gone and when water is used it isn't gone either. The faster money is spent the more it outruns interest and taxes so that's a good thing.

       Yes, but using the US as an example arms manufacturing have gotten so large they influence government policy, The people that own the weapons manufacturing own food and pharmaceuticals companies. so although the money is still is the system it's held by few people.

       They've been set up for a long time now. Fake news fails to report it.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...The United States is encircling China with a network of bases, with ballistic missiles, battle groups, nuclear -armed bombers.
       </p>
       <p>
        This lethal arc extends from Australia to the islands of the Pacific, the Marianas and the Marshalls and Guam, to the Philippines, Thailand, Okinawa, Korea and  across Eurasia to Afghanistan and India. America has hung a noose around the neck of China. This is not news. Silence by media; war by media.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2015, in high secrecy, the US and Australia staged the biggest single air-sea military exercise in recent history, known as Talisman Sabre. Its aim was to rehearse an Air-Sea Battle Plan, blocking sea lanes, such as the Straits of Malacca and the Lombok Straits, that cut off China's access to oil, gas and other vital raw materials from the Middle East and Africa....

       American's are the good guys and all those who oppose our will are the bad guys! America is resisting evil and we show we will not back down with our brave military men and women! Don't worry I'm a well informed American as I read my newspaper and watch my cable news daily! America and her institutions have done so much good for this world! We are more safe and more free than ever before! How can you deny this? This is fact. In America you can be anything you want, this is not possible in other countries like it is here!   /s

       You want me to continue?
(to be fair America is no different than any other empire so theres that)

       The pollution is because they have our factories now. Overfishing, $ manipulation and meddling in africa is done by USA too. As far as the artificial islands, well, SLR will get them soon enough so fuck that.

       Some things  most people miss are  that when money is spent it isn't gone and when water is used it isn't gone either. The faster money is spent the more it outruns interest and taxes so that's a good thing.
