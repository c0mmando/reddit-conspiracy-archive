    <div class="md"><p>No. China has on its own been the enemy of all western developed countries. With their constant stealing of IP, massive knock off market, stealing research and development, installing viruses/backdoors/malware onto all electronics they can so they have a larger bot net to attack the west&#39;s internet, their vastly fucked up trading policy where it&#39;s just a one way street with them, and most importantly but not last their almost constant attacking of the environment through massive amounts of pollution that rivals all other countries by leaps and bounds as well as their destruction of fish populations by over fishing at a rate of 8x their quota per year for decades. It&#39;s not a conspiracy it&#39;s just that China the nation is a gigantic asshole who doesn&#39;t care how much damage they are doing to the world or all other countries. I mean they literally steal peoples hopes, dreams, and thoughts all to then take credit for any discovery. Evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very much the view of the west that I hear but most of these claims like the knock off market and IP /research stealing I see as acceptable because they slow down human progress especially in healthcare or technology we should be working towards the betterment of humanity, not personal gain. Agreed spying on its own people is bad but no worse than the US or the UK or Russia or I&#39;m pretty sure most of the other countries. </p>

<p>Environmental damage is a world wide issue that every country is dealing with and in some areas, China is most improved (not hard considering they were the worsed). </p>

<p>Not that I&#39;m really arguing but they aren&#39;t that bad but the media and new seem to want us to fear them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>...The United States is encircling China with a network of bases, with ballistic missiles, battle groups, nuclear -armed bombers.</p>

<p>This lethal arc extends from Australia to the islands of the Pacific, the Marianas and the Marshalls and Guam, to the Philippines, Thailand, Okinawa, Korea and  across Eurasia to Afghanistan and India. America has hung a noose around the neck of China. This is not news. Silence by media; war by media.  </p>

<p>In 2015, in high secrecy, the US and Australia staged the biggest single air-sea military exercise in recent history, known as Talisman Sabre. Its aim was to rehearse an Air-Sea Battle Plan, blocking sea lanes, such as the Straits of Malacca and the Lombok Straits, that cut off China&#39;s access to oil, gas and other vital raw materials from the Middle East and Africa....    </p>
