       Does anybody follow this guy?  I literally just started seeing his videos pop up on youtube.  I find him fascinating and I enjoy listening to him talk.  He's a very good speaker and presenter, and has good imagery and examples for while he speaks.  But I kind of feel like he is a nutjob haha, i'm not sure why.  I would like to see more of his resources for myself.  He talks so fast and so persuasively, it is easy to get wrapped up and I feel like I need to take a step back and not take it all without vetting
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anybody on here know more about him, or have an opinion to render on him?

       I have watched many of his videos and I too find him of above average intellect.  He has been branded by many as a nut job but some of those same people might now be rethinking a portion of their opinions based on the information David Icke put out long ago about the "elites" and their pedophile activities and worse....

       I think with him and other "conspiracy theorists" is that you need to split the message and the content and judge each one individually.

       I like listening to what he says, but don't believe a lot of what he says. Weather you believe him or not, I think it's "required material" if you are going to get into the conspiracies.

       I do enjoy his work but I don't think I could sit through 8+hours of him. My sibling has been to see him a couple of times and finds him informative. They're not as far down the rabbit hole as I am when it comes to conspiracies. I feel sometimes like Ickes whole "Reptilian Elites" spiel is just there so the people will dismiss him as a whack job and laugh at him, thereby ignoring some of the other revelations he makes.

       I agree - the thing that confuses me is that he is clearly a very intelligent man.  Did he sit down and weigh the 'reptile' thing as "well, this will attract more attention than it would turn away." or, does it have some truth to it?   I just can't see why a man with his intelligence would say something totally ridiculous with no reasoning to it and not realizing it would deter a LOT of people - why say it, if there was no truth to it whatsoever or unless he KNEW the benefit of the lie would outweigh the consequence?  Make sense?

       I listened to him talk about it in one video.  His explanation made logical sense, but like all other conspiracies, there isnt any REAL evidence.   Theres little clues and hints and relationships that logically fit together; but it is like the glue is missing from the structure to solidify it

       There are indeed aspects of mammalian physiology that come from our ancient common reptilian ancestor. That just doesn't' make people reptiles. And actually, there are many conspiracy theories with real evidence.

       Well- his point was that the original people who mated with this predominant reptilian specimen, creating a sort of half-breed, continued to interbreed with themselves, creating a royal bloodline that contained the original traits of this reptilian specimen- and one of the traits he claims that they have is a lack of empathy.  This allows them dominate the environment and inflict horrors on others and feel no consequence, while the rest of us out-bred those genes.  It makes perfect sense.  But the problem is, theres no way to really prove that point, even if our brains contain original aspects of this anatomy, or whatever.  Unless we bash their heads open and see for ourselves

       He's awesome! Read his books. He's pretty much the "dot connector" and does a good job explaining how multiple subjects are connected. I first started reading his books in 2002-2003. Got the biggest secret as a Xmas gift. My life hasn't been the same since.

       I have a theory that he is the High Level Insider on 4chan lol.  A lot of what he says lines up with that poster, particularly the bits about higher consciousness and being trapped in this low state of auto-pilot consciousness- granted, david isn't the first philosophical thinker to go there, but there is something stark about it.  Trying to remember if somebody mentioned his name in one of those threads
