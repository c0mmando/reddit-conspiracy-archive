       ...and walks into comet pizza with a gun you mean? Whose ass do you think that will bite? Certainly not theirs. When they control the narrative they control the outcome. They won a long time ago by making people believe pizza is a codeword in those emails.

       They don't control the narrative anymore, which is they are resorting to false flags and propaganda on steroids. The entire establishment power structure is crumbling, and they are becoming increasingly desperate.

       No, they are firmly in control. You don't actually know anything they don't want you to know. They control assange, snowden, wikileaks, most of the "fake news" sites, half the posters here and on 4chan are paid to promote the stories they want. The reason they can do false flags is exactly that, they control the narrative. They can do a fake school shooting and know they can keep any mention of the problems with it out of the minds of 99.9% of the population. Now they are coming for that last .1% - US.

       I hear you. I just think what we're seeing is a self-aware establishment who are not stupid and can see the media's power to control the narrative

       We should condemn acts of vigilante of course without solid evidence. I'm sorry but it will only hurt our movement in the long run. But I think this story is fake personally it could be real and we should be ready to condemn it in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality there has to be real solid evidence to justify it and noone has come forward without being stopped yet. We are getting close though. I've never seen such a weird conspiracy theory have so much backlash from the media when its been around for 20+ years these kind of accusations.

       You're right, I can't argue with that. I don't think this was a genuine act of a vigilante, though.

      <p>
       To me the media backlash is indicative of there being truth in the allegations made by pizzagate. Never seen such desperation - truly a sign of the times we are living in.

       If a crazy man is saying nothing but crazy things then he is ignored. The only time anyone challenges the validity of a crazy mans words is when they have some merit. Simply if pizzagate was a lot of bull then they would've ignored it like a UFO sighting.

       The way I look at it there are 2 groups at play here.  The coordinated effort to expose, and the responses to it.  So there's a polarity/dualism to the whole dynamic.  And yes, that's precisely the kind of dynamic you need to engage widespread change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether these events are being coordinated by both sides, who knows.  Certainly the responses to it are having the effect of making this story go huge.  Every single mistake is being amplified and having the opposite effect.  The scale of the cooption, if that's what it is, is being exposed and it's staggering in scope.  Anytime you have truth by fiat you will have hermetic forces that will push in the other direction, particularly when the fiat truth is clearly incomplete.

       They called it fake because they know it will serve as a better distraction for many of the "critical thinkers" out there.  If they actually wanted it to disappear they would've simply ignored the issue, the fact that they continue to harp on it demonstrates that they're using it to distract from everything else that is going on, which is obvious when you look at what's happening in Brexit-land as well certain places in the United States.

       They don't want it to go away. They feed the flames through agents (Trump shills) on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and similar platforms because they need the populace to focus on everything, but Trump's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, his trips of Epstein's lolita island, etc. Trump is establishment's wet dream, but they don't just want the populace to vote for Trump, they need to trick the populace into believing Trump is anti-establishment as the only way to put awakening masses back to sleep. You can tell by the relentless Trump propaganda on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       that it's the goal. The more people focus on pizzagate, the less people focus on Trump's involvement and his subservience to the establishment.

       First the girl said Jeffrey Epstein raped her and took her virginity, and then Trump  proceeded to rape her next
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the story changed to how Trump raped her and took her virginity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then she said she made the whole thing up, which is a remarkable tale. How exactly did she know Trump and Epstein were friends and that Epstein was a pimp?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason the Trump lawsuit got dropped is because were we talking about Epstein too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Epstein is an Israeli Jew, allegedly a Mossad asset. Epstein's operations being exposed was bad for the Mossad operation of entrapment by providing children to pedophiles and then blackmailing the pedophiles. This is how Israel controls governments around the world, and it was more important to keep that a secret by throwing Hillary under the bus and dropping the Trump lawsuit than it was to smear Trump with child rape allegations

       I was that kid. I have no feelings for this game one way or other. I told people what happened and well It was bad for me. This is fun to watch not for the kids, which there is nothing I can do for them. I know this for a fact. It is you I am watching. People don't deal with this kind of stuff well. It is easier for you to pretend It doesn't happen. Sports?
