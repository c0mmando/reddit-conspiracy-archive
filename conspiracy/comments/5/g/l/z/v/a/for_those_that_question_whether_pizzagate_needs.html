<blockquote>
<p>Other than his civil suit against David Brock for the return of antiques and art, he seems to have worked in pet rescue and adoption in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware and has now disappeared, with a settlement payment of $850,000 in exchange for silence about Media Matters’ alleged financial misconduct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the PDF seems to indicate Grey was sued for blackmail and that Grey responded with a denial of those claims. It would be pretty ballsy to pay blackmail money regarding pedophilia and then attempt to sue your blackmailer. Kind of defeats the purpose of paying your blackmailer, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>He countersued to get his $850,000 back, plus $500,000 for each of three counts of alleged blackmail, and another $2 million in compensatory damages based in part on what Brock’s lawyers called abuse of the judicial system and legal fees.</p>

<p>Grey, who relocated to Massachusetts, declined to comment when contacted by FoxNews.com. Brock and Alefantis remain in Washington, where Brock has released a new book attacking Fox News. He is also under scrutiny from several members of Congress amid reports Media Matters for America is in possible violation of IRS laws governing nonprofits.</p>

<p>Explain how. I found the Instagram stuff weird myself until I realized it&#39;s a rock n&#39; roll pizza joint catering to hipster parents. The most disturbing one was #hotard until I realized that was one of the guys&#39; nicknames. After that, the rest of the pictures only look sick if you&#39;re coming at it with confirmation bias. Just like the clip of Biden supposedly telling a 13 year old girl she makes him horny (which is not what he said). </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>(1) it&#39;s not the same position as a Dahmer victim, the legs are very different; this one is floating, the Dahmer victim was propped up in an arch on the floor and his shins were flat. In fact, <a href="https://remedianetwork.net/2014/06/23/the-arch-of-hysteria/">it has nothing to do with Jeffrey Dahmer or any serial killer</a>. Since you are repeating this false claim, I can only wonder how &quot;naked&quot; the children portrayed in his art really are. Edit: nevermind, I found the art in question and it&#39;s equally non-disturbing, imo.</p>

<p>(2) art is often weird, so what — if I had his kind of money, I would collect some weird fuckin&#39; art, believe me. We have 4 pieces of &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=big+eye+art&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD_LTu297QAhVINSYKHU-tDPgQ_AUICSgC&amp;amp;biw=1587&amp;amp;bih=1193">big eye</a>&quot; art in our place we had before the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1126590/">Big Eyes</a> movie came out. The kids all look sad, but it is cute and weird. Both my wife and I just like it, probably because we&#39;re sort of jaded but innocent at heart. To you, this art would probably be proof we&#39;re sick pedophiles, but if that&#39;s the case then a whole lot of people were pedophiles in the 70s because this kitsch stuff was very popular.</p>

<p>PS - I also really like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=al+columbia&amp;amp;biw=1587&amp;amp;bih=1193&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjijaCs097QAhWEjlQKHRXEDHsQ_AUIBigB">Al Columbia</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The argument against it is that Hadrian commissioned hundreds of Antinuous statues after Antinuous&#39; death so statues of him are very common today. </p>

<p>My argument against that argument is when you search &quot;Antinuous Museo del Prado&quot;, you can&#39;t find that picture. So it isn&#39;t hard to assume that Alefantis personally went to the Museo del Prado, took a picture of that statue, and set it as his Instagram&#39;s profile picture. And that Instagram is completely filled with pictures of kids and sexually graphic pizza images. It&#39;s just too much, I don&#39;t see how anybody can defend that. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The statue is the Arch of Hysteria. Not based on Jeffrey Dahmer victims. The art of the kids in his house is a famous artist, and yeah if you find liberal art offensive you will be offended.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the girls on the Instagram photos is the daughter of their Event Organizer at Comet Ping Pong.</p></li>
<li><p>The pizza place next door: the logo has one more side than the pedo sign and the sign isn&#39;t uncommon but also sold as stock logos <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-317486462/stock-vector-business-abstract-spiral-triangle-icon-corporate-media-technology-styles-vector-logo-design-template.html?src=tjEz19K-_2nutUct-ifI-w-3-2">1</a> <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/89/6c/c4/896cc4f9e129b5056e81d5a778e595b6.jpg">2</a> It is a simple geometric design, easy to make a mistake like that. Some of the other logos in pizzagate is a standard double paddle that is used all over ping pong places and the heart from a neighboring business is a heart used for Hart of Autism.</p></li>
<li><p>Most references to italian food, pizza, walnut sauce, cheese is because John Podesta is part Italian and loves to cook for everyone. <a href="http://www.rodale.tv/video/john-podesta-can-cook">http://www.rodale.tv/video/john-podesta-can-cook</a></p></li>
<li><p>The pedo code words were made up on 4chan by a troll and people went with it, because kids are stupid.</p></li>
<li><p>L&#39;Enfant referenced in some videos and images from instagram refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L%27Enfant">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_L%27Enfant</a> who runs a well known bar in DC <a href="http://www.lenfantcafe.com/">http://www.lenfantcafe.com/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Everyone knew Jeffrey Epstein because he was heavily involved in politics, even Trump <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/">http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/</a> &quot;&quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,&#39;&#39; Trump booms from a speakerphone. &quot;He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>The little girl in the video, they were just referencing it because the caption mentions pizza. Something an owner of a pizza place would do</p></li>
<li><p>The photo of the fake baby with a price was a reference to a doll being sold at a store and they were making fun of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Spirit Cooking is from a marina abramovic which is an Art event of sorts in which many famous personas have seen. Everything is simulated not using real blood, semen, etc. Also, John Podesta never responded to attending but only his brother. Unless you are christian, or easily offended by Death Metal, you probably don&#39;t care about this.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Again you have no proof on whether or not it has basis in reality. How can you be so sure? And if you are a decent person, you would extend some reasonable doubt towards something that may involve innocent children&#39;s lives getting ruined. Instead of dismissing it outright without evidence on your part either. You just can not claim that it&#39;s nothing at this point. I agree with you that not every piece of evidence may be relevant or anything at all. But at the very best some of this stuff points at individuals in positions of power with some very bad and immature taste. I have a fine arts degree and I agree that spirit cooking is most likely nothing but weird conceptual art. But here are these people with huge amounts of power and responsibility enjoying what amounts to graphic representations of cannibalism and torture. The art world has long become a money laundering bubble. I mean I&#39;m talking about the kinds of money that one would kill a human over. At the very least this swarm of elite artists/politicians/celebrities are just obviously out of touch with what normal is and it is really really not a stretch of the imagination that some of them would engage in real dark activities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this.  I think it&#39;s important to remember that this whole ridiculous conspiracy theory hinges on made up 4chan bullshit specifically designed to troll idiots.  </p>

<p>Too bad it&#39;s all getting gobbled up.  Cheese pizza?  Come on people.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t understand the mindset here.  I personally think Donald Trump is a vile, reprehensible narcissistic human being who&#39;s built all his success around being born with a silver spoon in his mouth and sociopathically screwing over everyone less powerful than him foolish enough to give him an ounce of faith.</p>

<p>Would I believe he&#39;s a pedophile running a secret child sex slave ring?  Probably not.  There would have to be a considerable amount of hard evidence for me to accept that reality, and I&#39;d still be intensely surprised despite believing Trump has little to no moral character.</p>

<p>Yet so many people seem to be willing to just jump to the conclusion that because they believe Hillary &amp; Podesta are dishonest and corrupt in politics they&#39;re probably also capable of literally raping children all based on the flimsiest &quot;evidence&quot; imaginable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh look guys, another person who cannot back up his assertions. When the burden of proof is required they fail...</p>

<p>Your link on the Arch of Hysteria is a bit deceitful. Here is the reference written by an actual professional: <a href="https://remedianetwork.net/2014/06/23/the-arch-of-hysteria/">https://remedianetwork.net/2014/06/23/the-arch-of-hysteria/</a>. The link you posted has only one reference to a connection to Jeffery Dahmer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But we know that the Arch of Hysteria is specifically depicting Dahmer’s victims, not just someone suffering an ailment, because the statue has been decapitated, just like Dahmer’s victim was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, another assumption and not backed up by anything relevant to Louise Bourgeois reasoning for the creation of the Arch of Hysteria. Hysteria, has a history of being associated with demonic possesion. Doesn&#39;t show anything.</p>

<p>The link to the FBI symbols are real, but the association is false. The Besta Pizza symbol has one more edge than the FBI symbol. I have already shown you. The pedo code words are nowhere to be found in any of the links you provide or an real reference. Again nothing.</p>

<p>Again read your own link idiot. John Podesta was never involved in that email exchange. Look at the headers for whom Marina was communicatiing with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From: Marina Abramovic &gt;&lt;<a href="mailto:marinaxabramovic@gmail.com">marinaxabramovic@gmail.com</a>&lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:marinaxabramovic@gmail.com">marinaxabramovic@gmail.com</a>&gt;&gt;

<p>This hypothesis doesn&#39;t hold water, considering that there&#39;s a photo in Geberth&#39;s book <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BDXNBQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false">&quot;Sex-Related Homicide and Death Investigation 2nd ed&quot;</a> [EXTREMELY NSFW] that shows the victim in the same pose from a different angle, and he&#39;s clearly still in possession of his head.</p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that that the 81-year-old Bourgeois would have needed access to these photos sometime between the end of the trial (2/15/1992) and when the Arch of Hysteria piece was completed in 1993.  Highly unlikely, given the fact that there was no &quot;web&quot; to really speak of until 1994, and these photos weren&#39;t published in Geberth&#39;s books until years after the piece was completed.</p>

<p>Now the Podesta Bros may have purchased the piece due to the similarities to Dahmer&#39;s &quot;work&quot;... I don&#39;t fucking know, that would be pure speculation.  But to claim that Bourgeois was influenced by Dahmer while creating this piece is an absolute stretch at best... unless this little old lady traveled from NYC to Milwaukee in 1992 for a <em>personal showing</em> from Capt. Ferrier&#39;s ghoulish photo collection.</p>

<p>So as with everything in pizzagate, we&#39;re expected to swallow ridiculously tenuous &quot;evidence&quot;, and act like it&#39;s a smoking gun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was actually a nice read. In fact, I think I may have stumbled onto something. From your &quot;reference written by an actual professional&quot;:-</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Against the combined historical voices of medical history, which proclaim ‘There is no injury and no infection! Lest the body snap, hadn’t the hysteric better snap out of it?’, we are challenged not to ignore this anguish. <strong>Bourgeois is undoubtedly tapping into <em>Freudian analyses</em> of the hysteric, heavily overwritten by notions of dysfunctional female sexuality</strong>. The emasculated male form here both questions and ridicules this tradition. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Louis Bourgeois apparently uses Sigmand Freud&#39;s psychoanalytical research as his inspiration... Oh my, are we talking about the <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/14/freud-s-grandson-linked-to-madeleine-mccann-and-vip-pedophile-ring.html">same Freud family</a> which is now being REKTED with pedophile scandals? <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/14/sir-clement-freud-exposed-as-a-paedophile-as-police-urged-to-pro/">Remember Sir Clement Freud?</a></p>

<p>Hmm... Let&#39;s see, the Podestas couldn&#39;t possibly be linked to this guy, now could they? <a href="http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/top-news/podesta-brothers-revealed/">LOL WHOOPS, they stayed in his villa while they were in Portugal, AROUND THE TIME OF MCCAN&#39;S DISAPPEARANCE!</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Read your own reference:-</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The arch of hysteria was diagnostically indistinguishable in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries from that of tetanus. Whether or not a pain was taken seriously by the medical profession might come down to whether that pain was ascribed to an <strong>emotional imbalance</strong> or a physical disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously, what the fuck you do think constitutes emotional imbalance? &quot;Demonic possession&quot; in older times in majority of the cases was a disguise for conditions resulting from lifelong abuse by older family members, religious priests and whatnot. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you some stuff to read:-</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3743691/">Behavioural consequences of child abuse</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>All types of abuse are damaging to children—physically, emotionally, and psychologically—and can cause long-term difficulties with behaviour and mental health development. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reminds me, have you as of yet seen <a href="https://i.sli.mg/kHXqhi.jpg">this poster</a> for one of Comet Ping Pong&#39;s concerts, <strong>which very clearly depicts out of body experiences that children have when experiencing extreme abuse??? And then you come in here with your anti-conspiracy guns blazing accusing us of nothing but conjecture???</strong> Seriously, bugger off.</p>

<p>EDIT: Forgot to address your response regarding Abramovic. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>She responded to his brother. John was not involved in this. She was asking for Tony to bring his brother. <strong>John never responded...</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That does not solidify your position that he did NOT attend. It&#39;s left up to speculation and I would actually hazard a guess he did, given how he likes to &quot;cook&quot; as you yourself acknowledge.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just jump from &quot;Freudian analyses&quot; to Sir Clement to argue against the art piece. Ignoring that leap of logic.</p>

<p>I appreciate your links of Sir Clement. Interesting story. So, his accusers came out after his death when he is unable to refute anything. Either way it seems his wife eventually sent a few forgiving words to the accusers. </p>

<p>So, how is this connected to Podestas? The McCann disappearance happened when Sir Clement was in the UK and rented his place out. The only claim that they were at his rental and on that day is from an &quot;FBI anon&quot;. Take that with a huge grain of salt as I bet that came from 4chan. Unless you can actually provide me with a reliable source for the supposed FBI source.</p>

<p>We can keep discussing the Louise Bourgeois and her dark reasonings for the arch of histeria, or spirit cooking where speculation leads only to John Podestas brother being eager to watch her famous art events... none of it leads to a Ring of Pedophiles.</p>

<p><a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/1998874">http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/1998874</a> An interview with the girl they hosted for the band at Comet. Apparently she has a friend do the designs. She seems like a fairly normal young girl to be doing that job. I don&#39;t see how any of that points to pedophilia. Seems more of a feminist type of art.</p>

<p>Now personally, after all the other wierd shit I&#39;ve seen in these emails this just sounds like more BDSM talk to me. Susan &quot;whipped&quot; Sherry and me?

<p>1) Herb had a friendly game of dominos with his daughter and a family friend while on a trip, and then dropped an e-mail to his friend saying that he was sorry he missed him during his visit.</p>

<p>or...</p>

<p>2) 83-year-old Herb and his 67-year-old sex partner (whom he hooked up with after his wife of 51 years died a few years prior) had <em>his fucking daughter</em> beat the shit out of them during a kinky BDSM session, and then dropped a coded e-mail to his buddy Podesta to brag about it... who then made sure his own wife was on the reply so she could enjoy the cryptic debauchery.</p>

<p>B.) their taste in extremely pedophilloic artwork and moreover the description of their basement as a room to &quot;showcase video artwork that is unmarketable to most purveyors&quot; <em>paraphrasing</em></p>

<p>C.) the Besta Pizza logo, the Clinton foundation shit across the street and the fucking weird shIt alefontis posts on his IG</p>

IF anything it begs further scrutiny on the statements that don&#39;t have a frame of reference. The reality being that child sex trafficking in the DC area is a pandemic. The gay DC community knows its a problem, but don&#39;t want the bad press that comes along with outing their powerful friends... most associate with powerful gay federal judges/police/politicians/agency/diplomats...etc..etc. Who provides boys to fuck for the Muslim diplomats when they come to town?

    <div class="md"><p>In light of how large Washington DC is and how little some people may know about where every damn street is, if you had to draw someone on map on a handkerchief then they would have to at least know where one of the intersecting cross streets or something very close to it was. Otherwise as a professional, I would just give you the address and let you type it into your GPS, which is what people do now and have been doing for the last 20 years. </p>

<p>You can probably even remember in your own life the last time someone tried to give you directions the long way like we used to do back in the 90s <em>go down first Street take your third right, go up two blocks take a left, go down to your seventh red light and take a right etc</em> . I am sure that you looked at them and said no thanks just give me the address I&#39;ll just put it in my GPS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And in larger cities, you name a couple main cross streets. Say, Dundas West and Spadina. And then, if someone doesn&#39;t get it, you may say, &quot;here, lemme draw you a map.

<p>Being &quot;on (something)&quot; just means you consumed it and may feel its effects. Here&#39;s another (made up) example to help make more sense of the wording: &quot;do you think I&#39;ll paint better on mushrooms or on LSD?&quot; </p>

<p>I think they rape children and put a hankerchief under to collect semen and blood. On that hankerchief is the DNA of both the victim and the corrupt politician. Then they paint &quot;art&quot; on the canvas using the hankerchief as a starting point (hence the need to return such an important piece).</p>

<p>At this point, the painting is trifold:</p>

<p>1- It is proof of crime that can be used against the corrupt politician, thus maintaining their little mafia.</p>

<p>2- It is &quot;art&quot; which is &quot;worth&quot; a lot and can be sold around in these disgusting elite groups.</p>

<p>3- It is a satanic artifact that contains the energy of the crime on which their demonic masters thrive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So like, what do you do? You seem to spend all day, every day, on Reddit, 
talking about pizza gate from the looks of your comment history. Are you an adult with a job? Or just someone that was so enthralled with this story that they made a new account and made it their full time job to investigate. I don&#39;t have the time to look at all of your claims, but where are you getting this stuff from? It&#39;s almost as if someone is paying you to disseminate this info.</p>

That&#39;s a whole hell of a lot of insanity to come up with from one email about a found handkerchief.  Could it possibly be a handkerchief with a black and white map print on it?  Google that, you&#39;ll find tons.  Maybe one of famous pizza places?  Who knows, but that&#39;s far, far more plausible than this explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s reaching, but it does create an interesting scenario.</p>

<p>In your story, anyone can purchase this &quot;art piece&quot;.  Let&#39;s say someone had an &quot;art piece&quot; of this nature created by an ex-president of the USA.</p>

<p>With this art in their possession, they could (potentially) singlehandedly expose this crime.  That makes this &quot;art&quot; <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> valuable.  So let&#39;s say they buy the piece for $50,000,000.</p>

<p>Then, someone else who wants to bring down the pres offers that person $100M for the painting.  This offer is of course overbid by a person faithful to the pres, who offers $150M, shutting out the exposer.</p>

<p>It creates wealth out of nowhere, value from nothingness, an entire economy of highest bidder holds a trump card.  Just a game to keep money moving around...nothing but Thursday night poker for the elite.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re just a small-time politician who wants to make a big run for office?  What do you do to earn $50M in value from a donor?  You give them something worth $50M in exchange.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the reasonable deduction from all of this rampant and unfounded hypothesizing I found myself engaging in was this: people are using this &quot;art&quot; to evade the tax man. It&#39;s simple: I sell you this bag of dog waste that Damien Koons scooped up from the gutter in the Bowery which is so relevant and your insurance agent assesses it at $1,000,000 and you have an instant non-taxable commodity. Okay - maybe it&#39;s taxable - but it&#39;s &quot;art&quot; so it falls through all kinds of loop holes. Then you turn around two years later and pass it onto your &quot;friend&quot; who happens to have an apartment in TriBeCa you want to buy. You two strike a deal in which you transfer the now famous bag of dog excrement to your friend for three million dollars and he sells you the apartment at a steep discount for one million. He saves on capital gains, you get a $4,000,000 apartment for $1,000,000; he owns the perceived value of the dogshit container, and your apartment is still worth four million on the books.</p>

<p>It was done for precisely this reason. No one can come out against the circle, if the attempt it they can be destroyed. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no reason to think modified forms of these practices didn&#39;t come down in one form or another to this very day, especially given that they were highly effective. I love your spin on it though.</p>

<p>The thought of an airplane filled with $65k worth of hot dogs is hilarious to me.</p>

<p>(Real hot dogs. Not codeword hot dogs.)</p>

<p>Edit: Just did some math for shits and gigs.</p>

<p>A Nathan&#39;s hot dog stand in New York was charging 3.15 for a plain hot dog. This price is considered to be very high. $65,000/$3.15 per dog = roughly 20,635 hot dogs. Keep in mind this is a high rate for a hot dog, an order as large as this would likely come straight from the manufacturer, lowering the price by cutting out the middle man, and also have a very discounted price considering the volume of the order (think sam&#39;s club&#39;s discounted prices based off of bulk buying.) We&#39;re looking at easily over 25,000 hot dogs (and that&#39;s a very low estimate). Imagine &gt;25,000 hot dogs in an airplane and honestly tell me you aren&#39;t cracking up at the thought. Because that image is hilarious to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s clear that there&#39;s something odd about the email in question. But that doesn&#39;t automatically make it suspicious.</p>

<p>The first email in the relevant bit of the exchange is from a real estate agent (Kate) and she writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From: Kathryn Tate [mailto:<a href="mailto:kathy@ktate.com">kathy@ktate.com</a>]
Sent: Tuesday, September 02, 2014 10:04 AM
To: Sandler, Susan
Cc: Sandler, Herbert
Subject: You left something at the Field house</p>

<p>Susan &amp; Herb</p>

<p>I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No mention of a map, which is odd if you think that a map would be completely obvious to the person who found it and could help identify the owner. But the description is that it&#39;s just white and black.</p>

<p>Then, some hours later, Podesta&#39;s pal (who received the above email) writes to Podesta:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you&#39;re busy, so feel free not to respond if it&#39;s not yours or you don&#39;t want it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So she hasn&#39;t actually seen the handkerchief in question (because the realtor has it). Plus as you can see this email is full of typos (Susan even mis-spells her own name as &#39;Susaner&#39;).</p>

<p>So my guess is that &#39;map&#39; is a typo for &#39;mark&#39;. </p>

<p>A &#39;pizza-related map&#39; on a handkerchief she hasn&#39;t even seen is an odd idea. </p>

<p>A friendly joke about Podesta&#39;s fondness for pizza leading to a &#39;pizza-related <em>mark&#39;</em> on a handkerchief isn&#39;t quite such an odd idea.</p>

<p>And yes, Podesta is a noted foodie and is so enthusiastic about pizza that he has an outdoor pizza oven in his backyard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I imagine in your head this is &quot;Checkmate, pizzagate is real!!!&quot; Gotcha.  Good talk</p>

<p>I went ahead and looked up the &quot;he&#39;s lying about having a basement thing.&quot;  So I assume you mean when he said in an interview that there&#39;s no basement at Comet Pizza.  Then you&#39;re probably thinking that his statements in this article: </p>

<p>indicate there are a basement.  He says tomatoes kept in a basement, did he say &quot;tomatoes kept in the basement of Comet Pizza&quot;?  That doesn&#39;t prove.. anything</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With what logic?  What basement is he referring to and how do you know that?  You&#39;re acting so condescending as if you have some kind of special insider knowledge, you don&#39;t know anything beyond a vague suspicion based on vague shit</p>

<p>There&#39;s a business next door called Politics &amp; Prose that has a basement.  Politics &amp; Prose is not in the same building, though it is in the same complex, a few doors down. The whole strip of stores is kind of on a hill, so the ground level exit from Comet out back is on the same level as the *<em>basement *</em>exit from Politics &amp; Prose, they both exit to the parking lot.   Here you go, you can even look at it.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure he does.  I just doubt he keeps 10,000 tomatoes worth of it, dipshit.  It&#39;d be perfectly reasonable to keep such things in a storage facility, as many high-volume restaurants do</p>

<p>It&#39;s hilarious that you&#39;re so vehemently arguing these sort of meaningless details.  If it&#39;s so obvious that there&#39;s a cabal of power-elite satanists raping and eating children, shouldn&#39;t you have a little more evidence?  Shouldn&#39;t one of the thousands of patrons of Comet Pizza.. noticed that?  Lol</p>

<p>Down and around what corner?  You poorly quoting a tv show I&#39;ve never seen doesn&#39;t really help me very much.</p>

<p>You refer to photos of basement construction. I looked them up, there&#39;s literally sunlight coming in a doorway in one. Some basement huh?</p>

<p>You&#39;re so on about proving whether or not there&#39;s a basement that you have stepped back and thought what difference does it make? Even if he were lying about having a basement, so what? You need so much more than that, and you can&#39;t even inconclusively prove whether or not a room exists. Good luck proving the illuminati is eating kids </p>

<p>My dad uses handkerchiefs and some of them was from his father with his initials embroded in them (on them?). These are one of the few things he has of his father that isn&#39;t stuffed away in storage. His father died early - age 52 - and he sees this as something important to him. </p>

<p>Point is, you never know. If someone left something at my house or a friends house I would ask tell them about it. You never know what an item holds of value to someone else. Assuming is stupid just because you would look at it as a piece of cloth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. It was nice of Susan to email Podesta to inquire about whether he wanted his hanky sent to him (I mean, it&#39;s his property after all, so it was the polite thing to do for a friend). </p>

<p>But Podesta said not to bother. So, according to the conspiracy theory, Podesta carries round a handkerchief with an incriminating map on it, but this vital map is so unimportant to him that he just discards it without a second though and is quite happy to let this sinister evidence -- setting out the exact locations of serious wrongdoing -- fall into the hands of an outsider.</p>

<p>That being said - its still perhaps a little thin to draw conclusions.  I bet if people scoured through anyones emails they could eventually start to see things that seem weird.  Especially if inside jokes etc. could easily be misinterpreted.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on dude, what kind of grounds for suspicion is a person&#39;s amount of detail when describing a random object? They probably were describing it so that Podesta could inquire into whether it actually was his handkerchief or not. Or, maybe, some people just write with a few more adjectives than you do? </p>

<p>And art tends to have more value beyond what&#39;s at face value, which you have to be aware of. Like, I saw an incredible museum exhibition over the summer about the depiction of prostitution in French art. If I tell a random person this they&#39;d think I&#39;m a fucking pervert for liking that kind of a show, but if you know about art history you&#39;d know that many of the most prominent French artists of the 19th and early 20th century, like Picasso, Lautrec, Manet, Degas, and Van Gogh, explored these ideas at least at one point or another in their lives, so this lead to an all-star roster of incredible artists all exploring a similar theme that happens to be quite risque. </p>

<p>So, I dunno, I guess my answer is that we&#39;d have to ask Mr. Podesta what he finds so interesting in that art before making judgement on that particular facet. It could be just because the artist is a big name (he is a collector after all), or he&#39;s looking at them from a humanitarian angle and finds this to be an important subject matter to support and spread awareness of. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you&#39;re aware of how there are holes in this whole pizzagate argument. I won&#39;t shame anyone for being intrigued by the conspiracy, but all I ask is that you evaluate ALL possible angles (including the simple and innocuous ones) before accepting the cutely ribboned narrative that the conspiracy theorists have woven out of these random pizza-themed emails. I tend to lean on the side of skepticism myself, which leads to a lot of arguments whenever I&#39;m on this subreddit. </p>

<p>It&#39;s because the language seems weird and excessively detailed to me.    </p>

<p>Take a second to envision what this lady is describing.  A handkerchief that has a map on it that &quot;seems pizza-related.&quot;  What the fuck does that even mean.  What would that look like?  What would this item be?  A map that has all the different pizza locations in town?  Printed on a handkerchief nice enough that people that it was necessary to try to track down the original owner?  Who would make such an item?  There is no one that would make a map that is pizza related and then print that on a nice handkerchief.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd.  Seriously, tell me how this pizza-related map silk handkerchief came into existenece.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno if auto-correct would do that. And the amount of typos in the email suggests auto-correct wasn&#39;t a factor here.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all done it: Meant one word and said or typed something completely different.</p>

<p>Looking back through my posts in this topic, I can see that I have done exactly the same thing on two occasions (giving the realtor&#39;s name as &#39;Kate&#39; when it was &#39;Kathy&#39; and typing &#39;though&#39; instead of &#39;thought&#39;). Both caused by not really paying attention.</p>

<p>The other thing that amuses me about this pizza map hogwash is the fact that Susan&#39;s email specifically refers to &#39;the kitchen island&#39;.</p>

<p>Given the starring role of sinister secret islands in this entire rigmarole, it&#39;s pretty funny that no-one has yet woven that into a theory and instead everyone is making heavy weather of a fucking hanky.</p>

A witness, a whistle-blower, any pictures or videos of any of these acts actually taking place. Everything is circumstantial, &quot;so in so is connected to this pedophile so they must be kidnapping children and raping them in this pizza place.&quot; </p>

<p>This is how pizzagate works:
When I was a kid my old neighbor was a pedophile.
&quot;Dane_Gleesac has ties to well-known pedophile! </p>

<p>His childhood neighbor was a convicted pedophile see [article that talks about my neighbor as a pedophile]
[Article where I talk about the neighborhood I&#39;m from]</p>

<p>While he was in jail, Dane received money from the pedophile - $30 a week for mowing lawns - seems like a lot just for mowing a small lawn [image from Google maps of the house with the acreage of the house][article where I talk about mowing lawns throughout my neighborhood as a kid when people were away]  could it be this money was for keep quiet?? $30 a week for 5 years is over 3000!! </p>

<p>Dane has a history of making questionable remarks about children [article quoting me talking about children that at face value means nothing but when you think I fuck kids could be deemed bad] [unrelated article where the author talks about my passion for children based charities] [article where said charity may have done something questionable but completely unrelated to child sex trafficking]</p>

<p>Dane is a pedophile previously on a pedophiles payroll, now works with charities with children - he&#39;s fucking kids in a pizza places basement. </p>

<p>There is no evidence there. It&#39;s all made up bullshit. Sorry but you&#39;re ridiculous for believing this shit. Good luck on your witch hunt</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But art, instagram photos, and &quot;symbolism&quot; (whatever the fuck that means in this context) isn&#39;t enough either. You can still take these things literally. Podesta is an art collector and purchases big name artists to show off, a guy runs a family-themed pizza place and ends up in photographs with children, and there&#39;s no symbolism in real life; this isn&#39;t some hipster experimental movie. </p>

<p>Just keep an open mind and evaluate all evidence. Sometimes it feels like things connect when they don&#39;t. That&#39;s just how the human brain works, and you have to remember to look at things from all angles, even the less exciting ones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, let me explain what I mean.</p>

<p>By &#39;art&#39;, I&#39;m referring to numerous illustrations of kids in bondage all over his house.</p>

<p>By &#39;symbolism&#39; I&#39;m referring to the symbol that the FBI recognizes as a code for &#39;little boy lover&#39; being not only on display outside of the pizza place, but in a few other murals, websites, and pieces of art as well.</p>

<p>And the photos of children that I&#39;m worried about are the ones labeled &#39;hoetard&#39;, the ones with references to &#39;kill rooms&#39;, the one where someone is pulling out a child&#39;s teeth, and the one with a little girl&#39;s hands taped to a table.</p>

<p>You&#39;re downplaying how weird all of those things are <em>individually</em>, much less together. </p>

<p>I am trying to keep an open mind. It took me awhile to give this conspiracy even a passing glance because it sounded so stupid. And I can&#39;t help but feel stupid for even talking about it. But all the same, these things are all unnerving as hell and I&#39;m not just going to brush them off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dude is a collector, he has a lot of different art, and if you&#39;re into that scene you&#39;re used to seeing weird shit than most people (saying that as an art enthusiast myself). A lotta collectors are just playing pokemon cards and are trying to catch all the big names, and this artist is likely one of his targets. </p>

<p>And symbols don&#39;t mean shit. Some geometric shapes accidentally resemble other geometric shapes sometimes and accidentally carry the meanings of other interpretations. Examples: the swastika as a symbol of nazism and a hindi symbol of peace, random triangles vs the illuminati, and how the equation c=3 looks kinda like a penis. </p>

<p>and photos are photos. Some people say weird shit or take odd pictures that doesn&#39;t make sense without context. That doesn&#39;t invite you to invent a context to make it about pedophilia. </p>

<p>I get how intriguing this shit is and how fun it is to imagine uncovering a crime ring through an internet forum meme board, but you really should keep the eye of skepticism high for as long as you can. This whole mess still depends on a lot of assumptions and nothing concrete. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I get that high art can be weird. Kids in bondage crosses a line IMO. But if that was the only thing, I&#39;d just let it go.</p>

<p>The pictures are weird, but similarly explainable. If THAT was the only thing, I&#39;d just brush it off...</p>

<p>The symbols are actually what pedophiles use to identify each other. There is a purpose to using them. Maybe in this case it&#39;s just a weird coincidence. And if that was the only thing... you see where I&#39;m going with this.</p>

<p>But they changed the symbol when people started calling them out. </p>

<p>Then you have the association between Clinton and that woman who was caught illegally smuggling children out of Haiti. Under the guise of humanitarian work... and her fake lawyer who&#39;s married to a wanted human trafficker...</p>

<p>Then you have convicted pedophile and rapist Jeffrey Epstein himself claiming to be a cofounder of the Clinton foundation. All for humanitarian purposes, naturally...</p>

<p>At what point do you consider it healthy be suspicious about all of this, as a package? I&#39;m not pretending to have the answers. I recognize that many people here are taking this way too far and acting like fools. I&#39;m not calling for anyones head or anything like that. And tbh I&#39;d rather not be involved at all. But we have seen these types of pedo rings covered up time and time again... so I guess that&#39;s my only question- at what point do you start to take this seriously?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s shocking to get rid of a symbol when people point out that it might resemble something unintended. Like, what if I don&#39;t follow politics but I went into a store and saw a Make America Great Again hat, and thought &quot;yeah! this is an encouraging message to get behind!&quot; and bought it and started wearing it around? Then I walk around and people think I&#39;m a trump supporter for wearing that cap. I&#39;m gonna take the hat off because people are assuming I&#39;m a trump supporter and I&#39;m definitely not. The hat is a symbol for being a trump supporter to most, and I don&#39;t want to invent that association so I disassociate myself with the hat. Same thing here likely with this so-called pedophile symbol. </p>

<p>People and life is more complicated than this. Donald Trump is a good friend of Jeffrey Epstein, is Trump involved in this conspiracy? I&#39;ve never heard him mentioned in any of these threads. Does the Clinton foundation provide millions of people with anti-HIV medication just for the sole purpose of hiding kid-smuggling activities? Is anyone who helps this humanitarian effort of fighting HIV through the Clinton Foundation implicated in this too? </p>

<p>Pedo rings are a real thing, and I would be fucking proud if someone&#39;s gonna find concrete implicating proof of some kind of trafficking ring accidentally through all this &quot;investigating&quot;. But right now all I see is a bunch of armchair detectives pretending that if you find enough coincidences it becomes concrete evidence. This pizzagate shit is a joke that&#39;s been unconsciously invented by conspiracy theorists to dislike their hated liberal politicians even more, and there are better uses of people&#39;s time out there if they genuinely want to fight human trafficking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By some accounts, Trump was involved in Epstein&#39;s pedo resort. One of his employees testified in court that he witnessed Trump receiving oral sex from two 12 and 13 year old girls. Trump has made comments indicating that he was at least aware of Epstein&#39;s activities before the news broke. As far as I&#39;m concerned, anyone who visited Epstein&#39;s pedo resort island is suspicious. We have wikileaks to thank for morphing into a clearly politically motivated organization, which is why we may not be seeing anything about the right on this issue. </p>

<p>And no, not all humanitarian work is a guise for sex trafficking. But anything Epstein was involved in IS suspicious. And the woman smuggling children out of Haiti is just... well what else could you make of that, her lawyer, and the fact that Clinton herself came down to save her ass? </p>

<p>I do get where youre coming from. I&#39;ll even take your advice and slow my roll a bit. But these things don&#39;t get broken wide open on their own. Reddit isn&#39;t going to crack the case but somebody has to bring attention to it before anyone else will touch it. Otherwise, you never know, we&#39;ll look back 10 years from now saying &#39;how did we miss the signs while all these children were abused&#39; just like everyone did with Saville, the Catholic church, and other high profile pedophile rings...</p>

An art gallery is just an art gallery. And a pizza restaurant is a pizza restaurant.

If y&#39;all actually were hunting down pedophiles I&#39;d be thrilled, but all I see is a game of 6 degrees of kevin bacon where we try to find every possible way to connect a random DC pizza place to all the liberal politicians that right-wing redditors hate, on the assumption that there&#39;s a secret child prostitution dungeon somewhere in that pizza place because some emails about pizza from a clinton staffer&#39;s email account could be also about diddling kids if you replace the word pizza in every instance with child. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all.   I understand.  Your previous message was one that sounded like you were immune to manipulation or disinformation.  Then, paired with claims that pizzagate is cut and dry not an issue, I saw a sort of arrogance without thinking of the potential to be swayed here.  Reddit = social manipulation capital of the internet.  </p>

<p>I only want to bring in more people and have them see this stuff.  Now is not the time to claim its true OR false.  It is technically speculation, but when paired with the efforts of a guy to &quot;attack&quot; CPP, a removal and change to the camera overlooking CPP only the day before and the total lack of coverage or attention to the details on behalf of your media, means.......we are up against an effort. </p>

<p>If there was nothing to this, the media wouldn&#39;t have to attack or discredit in any way shape or form.  They <em>could</em> lay out the details for everyone and laugh the conspiracy movement into oblivion, but they do not.  They don&#39;t let people decide, they chose to label and discredit.  They ignore the details and mock the process.  That should tell you enough.</p>

<p>So she hasn&#39;t actually seen the handkerchief in question (because the realtor has it).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The simplest explanation is that she talked to the realtor on the phone to tell here where the pillows are (discussed in the other part of the email), and they talked about the handkerchief, too.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand what people think is so strange about the handkerchief. There are handkerchiefs with maps (<a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/map_handkerchief">1</a>, <a href="http://scoutmob.com/p/City-Map-Handkerchief-beebe">2</a>, <a href="https://www.taylorstitch.com/products/map-handkerchief">3</a>) and there are pizza-related handkerchiefs (<a href="http://www.cyberoptix.com/products/pepperoni-pizza-pocket-square?variant=11763907971">4</a>, <a href="http://wrenbirdarts.com/products/embroidered-i-love-you-more-than-pizza-handkerchief">5</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/400977907/th-limited-pizza-party-handmade">6</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/452477004/blue-and-white-edged-digital-print">7</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/119262979/turbo-pizza-no3-mens-silk-pocket-square">8</a>), and <a href="https://www.etsy.com/search?q=pizza%20accessories">lots of other pizza-themed merchandise</a>. And there are <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OOwXSjY.ping">maps that seem pizza-related</a> (though that one isn&#39;t a handkerchief). What&#39;s so hard to believe about a handkerchief with a &quot;map that seems pizza-related&quot;? People are acting like she said she found a leprechaun with a pot of gold.</p>

<p>This was a realtor in Martha&#39;s Vineyard (who appears to specialize in vacation rentals) e-mailing Sandler&#39;s daughter, who then e-mails Podesta.... who subsequently tells her that this crucial piece of DNA evidence (and conclusive proof of ritualistic child sex abuse) is &quot;not worth worrying about&quot;.  Call me crazy, but I&#39;m thinking that Podesta would be <em>very</em> interested in getting the handkerchief back if it is as nefarious as you assholes say it is.</p>

<p>You guys are on to something, though... in the same e-mail, she talks about &quot;the pillows you purchased&quot;.  Pillows is widely known throughout the pedophile community as code word for fat kids.  Did Podesta and Sandler&#39;s daughter purchase a bunch of fat kids at the Martha&#39;s Vineyard home?</p>

<p>And you treat it as established fact that pizza is an operative word. There&#39;s no evidence of that. You may speculate but there is absolutely no hard evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit- it appears in several emails.  And yes - that is exactly my threshold for code.  If it makes no sense and it is repeatedly used in sentences that make no sense, either the person doesnt know what the word means or it is code.  And since everybody knows what pizza is, you can go fuck right off for trying to act dumb</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let me get this straight. If it confuses you and it&#39;s used several times, it is code. You seem to know a lot about code talk. Can you show me example of when you used that method(something confusing used more than once) and it did indeed turn out to be code? Has that ever worked for you? </p>

<p>P.S. When I use code, i make sure the sentence makes sense to a normal person reading it, but it is assumed that the people that I am really talking to KNOW what I am talking about.  Its like using an inside joke for your friends while you are talking to an unsuspecting bystander. Its quite easy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t find the connection between food and child sexual exploitation that convincing. I have no reason to believe that they are speaking in code. In fact, I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that they are just taking about food. </p>

<p>I think that people are seeing what they wan to see. Finding patterns where none exist. Tens of thousands of emails and only a few oblique references to food that sound slightly odd. That&#39;s what we have. No witnesses. No known victims. No DNA evidence. No video or audio evidence. No financial records to suggest a massive pedo conspiracy. In other words, not a single piece of evidence that could be presented in a court of law. </p>

<p>If you are going to accuse someone of pedophilia and child rape (!), you better have some evidence. Otherwise it&#39;s a witchhunt and a politically motivated one at that. </p>

<p>There is no evidence. Nothing. You look through tens of thousands of emails and this is all you have. Not a single thing.

<blockquote>
<p>Napalm Sticks to Kids</p>

<p>French fried eyeballs and baby ribs.</p>

<p>Napalm sticks to kids like glue,</p>

<p>It sticks to me and it sticks to you.</p>

<p>Drop some Napalm from the sky,</p>

<p>And watch those kiddies DIE DIE DIE!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So,  shall we dissect the Marine Corps for child murder?   No,  lots of groups talk a lot of shit,  somehow its an approved element of their camaraderie.   Its not proof of crimes committed.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is a sideline.    The real issue is that there are already proven cases,  and the FBI admits there is an epidemic:</p>

<p>Dr. Lori Handrahan’s forthcoming book Child Porn Nation: America’s Hidden National Security Risk details America’s child sex abuse epidemic.  <a href="https://medium.com/@LoriHandrahan2/duke-universitys-associate-director-of-center-for-health-policy-drugging-raping-his-own-infant-67fb4e765261#.kbe1bhoju">https://medium.com/@LoriHandrahan2/duke-universitys-associate-director-of-center-for-health-policy-drugging-raping-his-own-infant-67fb4e765261#.kbe1bhoju</a>   Yes,  Hastert,  Savile,  Sandusky,  plenty of the elite are involved,  as are plenty of mid and lower level types.    Pizzagate does not deserve to be at the center of this investigation.   In the big picture,  its a sideline.   Hastert by himself,  with  his protectors,  is a bigger catch (that was not followed up on).  <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/06/who-else-knew-about-denny-hasterts-cover-up.html">http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/06/who-else-knew-about-denny-hasterts-cover-up.html</a>  Until the police start doing their job and stop protecting these corrupt traitors,  there is no way to tie together the real pedophile criminals into a larger conspiracy.   Will Pizzagate be at the center?   We have already seen that hotter leads are abandoned!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI&#39;s Joseph Campbell says child exploitation in the US has reached near-epidemic levels. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-33682953">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-33682953</a> “The level of pedophilia is just unprecedented right now,” Campbell said. “We have so many cases constantly of individuals in all walks of life, from the very wealthy … to all other levels engaged in child pornography, child exploitation … it just seems to be almost an at epidemic level.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it seems very likely that it&#39;s code.  Who would make a &quot;pizza map&quot; let alone care about it enough to have it sent to them?</p>

<p>That being said, it&#39;s an enormous, <strong>enormous</strong> leap from that to &quot;pizza&quot; meaning a map of a pedophilia ring that implicates the highest reaches of American government.  It&#39;s crazy to me how many people are so willing to accept such a far-fetched conclusion on such little evidence. </p>

<p>Yes it&#39;s theoretically possible that  something like that exists.  But such a monumental claim should be backed by monumental evidence.  Not wildly speculative Da Vinci code clues allegedly left by the organizers of the ring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t make sense of it either. That&#39;s why I haven&#39;t actually formed an opinion about what it means. The widely accepted explanation for that single email was a post on 4chan by one user who posted their interpretation of what those words mean.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that it&#39;s obviously code, but we don&#39;t know what that code is. I&#39;d like to see more theories about it, and something more credible for the interpretation than one post on 4chan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it so hard to believe that there could be such a thing as an actual black and white handkerchief with a map and something about pizza? Businesses make bandanas ALL THE TIME for marketing/PR. I have a cousin who has a company that 90% of what they make are custom-made hats, t-shirts and yes BANDANAS (a.k.a. handkerchiefs) for businesses. Lots of businesses put a map with their location on their promotional materials, including their bandanas. Why is it so hard to believe that John Podesta had a promotional bandana from a pizzeria (white bandana with black printing or black with white printing) that had in part, a map showing the location of the pizzeria? Maybe he had been there, or maybe the owner had given it to him or maybe it was in some sort of marketing gift bag or who knows? There are literally 1,000s of possible explanations that are INFINITELY more plausible than “code for an international pedophile ring involving top political officials”.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>

<p>The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you&#39;re busy, so feel free not to respond if it&#39;s not yours or you don&#39;t want it.</p>

<p>The connected person who&#39;s twitter header says &quot;You and Pizza&quot; (nonsensical) and profile says &quot;Keeping D.C. Cheesy&quot; (WTF is the context?)</p>

<p>The person then made their tweets PRIVATE once news broke and removed last name and location from their profile. Why do you need to hide your tweets? Just stay off twitter or mass block all the nutty conspiracy trolls. This is the defensive behaviour of someone who believes they have something to hide.

    <div class="md"><p>There are two people being quoted, one who calls it black and white (realtor), one who calls it a pizza-related map (susan). Susan does not think it is important in that he may not be interested in getting it back. Realtor calls it black and white, Susan who looked at it closer sees it has a map on it with pizza of some sort. I mis-characterized who doesn&#39;t care, but it makes no difference. If your assertion is correct that this is a semen-stained DNA map to podesta you think it is normal Susan doesn&#39;t think he will care about it? And you think it is more likely that it is semen rather than an actual map printed on a hanky?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;first email&quot;, there is only one, with 3 quoted replies in it. The &quot;first one&quot; actually says nothing at all about this, it is all details about houses. The second is an email from Kate to Susan saying she found a hanky. The third is from Susan to Podesta asking him if he wants it.</p>

<p>Did you read the email? You should.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was actually a nice read. In fact, I think I may have stumbled onto something. From your &quot;reference written by an actual professional&quot;:-</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Against the combined historical voices of medical history, which proclaim ‘There is no injury and no infection! Lest the body snap, hadn’t the hysteric better snap out of it?’, we are challenged not to ignore this anguish. <strong>Bourgeois is undoubtedly tapping into <em>Freudian analyses</em> of the hysteric, heavily overwritten by notions of dysfunctional female sexuality</strong>. The emasculated male form here both questions and ridicules this tradition. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Louis Bourgeois apparently uses Sigmand Freud&#39;s psychoanalytical research as his inspiration... Oh my, are we talking about the <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/14/freud-s-grandson-linked-to-madeleine-mccann-and-vip-pedophile-ring.html">same Freud family</a> which is now being REKTED with pedophile scandals? <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/14/sir-clement-freud-exposed-as-a-paedophile-as-police-urged-to-pro/">Remember Sir Clement Freud?</a></p>

<p>Hmm... Let&#39;s see, the Podestas couldn&#39;t possibly be linked to this guy, now could they? <a href="http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/top-news/podesta-brothers-revealed/">LOL WHOOPS, they stayed in his villa while they were in Portugal, AROUND THE TIME OF MCCAN&#39;S DISAPPEARANCE!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please, another assumption and not backed up by anything relevant to Louise Bourgeois reasoning for the creation of the Arch of Hysteria. Hysteria, has a history of being associated with demonic possesion. Doesn&#39;t show anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read your own reference:-</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The arch of hysteria was diagnostically indistinguishable in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries from that of tetanus. Whether or not a pain was taken seriously by the medical profession might come down to whether that pain was ascribed to an <strong>emotional imbalance</strong> or a physical disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously, what the fuck you do think constitutes emotional imbalance? &quot;Demonic possession&quot; in older times in majority of the cases was a disguise for conditions resulting from lifelong abuse by older family members, religious priests and whatnot. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you some stuff to read:-</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3743691/">Behavioural consequences of child abuse</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>All types of abuse are damaging to children—physically, emotionally, and psychologically—and can cause long-term difficulties with behaviour and mental health development. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reminds me, have you as of yet seen <a href="https://i.sli.mg/kHXqhi.jpg">this poster</a> for one of Comet Ping Pong&#39;s concerts, <strong>which very clearly depicts out of body experiences that children have when experiencing extreme abuse??? And then you come in here with your anti-conspiracy guns blazing accusing us of nothing but conjecture???</strong> Seriously, bugger off.</p>

<p>EDIT: Forgot to address your response regarding Abramovic. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>She responded to his brother. John was not involved in this. She was asking for Tony to bring his brother. <strong>John never responded...</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That does not solidify your position that he did NOT attend. It&#39;s left up to speculation and I would actually hazard a guess he did, given how he likes to &quot;cook&quot; as you yourself acknowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But we know that the Arch of Hysteria is specifically depicting Dahmer’s victims, not just someone suffering an ailment, because the statue has been decapitated, just like Dahmer’s victim was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This hypothesis doesn&#39;t hold water, considering that there&#39;s a photo in Geberth&#39;s book <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BDXNBQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false">&quot;Sex-Related Homicide and Death Investigation 2nd ed&quot;</a> [EXTREMELY NSFW] that shows the victim in the same pose from a different angle, and he&#39;s clearly still in possession of his head.</p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that that the 81-year-old Bourgeois would have needed access to these photos sometime between the end of the trial (2/15/1992) and when the Arch of Hysteria piece was completed in 1993.  Highly unlikely, given the fact that there was no &quot;web&quot; to really speak of until 1994, and these photos weren&#39;t published in Geberth&#39;s books until years after the piece was completed.</p>

<p>Now the Podesta Bros may have purchased the piece due to the similarities to Dahmer&#39;s &quot;work&quot;... I don&#39;t fucking know, that would be pure speculation.  But to claim that Bourgeois was influenced by Dahmer while creating this piece is an absolute stretch at best... unless this little old lady traveled from NYC to Milwaukee in 1992 for a <em>personal showing</em> from Capt. Ferrier&#39;s ghoulish photo collection.</p>

<p>So as with everything in pizzagate, we&#39;re expected to swallow ridiculously tenuous &quot;evidence&quot;, and act like it&#39;s a smoking gun.</p>
