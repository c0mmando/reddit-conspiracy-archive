       Good afternoon r/conspiracy.  I have been on this sub for over 7 years.  We are under siege.  Our ideas are under attack.  Your voice is more important now more than ever.  This subreddit is being looked at under a microscope right now. Keep overturning those stones. Don't let them win.  Keep reading, keep researching, keep communicating, keep fighting.

       Stand behind your words. If you believe in something, no matter how passionate, then you should stand behind them not behind tons of alts. That's your choice, you are right in that sense.

       As a person who has been n this sub for seven years you should be considered a leader. Lead by example. As a person wh obviously believes in freedom of speech, lead by example. But if you make the claim you have made here, and then one looks at your name, and then looks at your post history, you don't come off as a leader. You come off as a troll, especially when you are trying to get others to do something which you really aren't doing as you are posting behind and alt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stand up for what you believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the "point of this post" I've touched on that a bit and I'm sure you can read between the lines. However, let me build on your "instructions" for a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the members here, who happen to be reading this, utilize critical thinking, reading and examination. Do not allow confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance to steer you down the wrong path. Always rely on inductive and deductive reasoning and make sure your intrinsic and extrinsic values are not in conflict with logic and reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks and have a good one,
      </p>

       THE LORD HERESY no alts.

       You should of just let my words stand.  They promote unity as where you promote "trolls" and so called subreddit "leaders".  I am no leader.  I am no troll.  I research.  I dig in the mud under VPNs and MAC spoofers. I am not in the business of letting anyone get close to me.  Keep your same subreddit account for 7 years and post with it.... That's a good way for people to get close to you.  If you post on the same account in this subreddit for 7 years, you better not be researching under the radar  or they will pinpoint you quick as shit.  My words are all that matter, not the number next to my name.  Thanks

       No, I shouldn't just let your words stand because I don't agree with them, or what you are doing and felt I should speak out. Yes, this place is being looked at, especially when looking at yesterday's events but we don't need more of that. We need people to keep looking at things, a lot of different topics, but people need to
       <em>
        learn
       </em>
       how to filter the bullshit and get back to being skeptics.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are the one who mentioned being here for seven years, I didn't know it until you posted. Naturally, one would think that a person who has been here for seven years is here because they are respected, didn't violate the rules to the point of being banned, etc. So why was the information useful? Why did you post it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are in the business of not letting anyone get close, because of your research, then there are two things you need to consider: 1. don't make it a point to post. 2. when posting don't mention how long you have been here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you are probably going to use another alt soon, that is fine and dandy, but your words, as far as I can tell, aren't adding up to something of value. Now that may be
       <em>
        my opinion
       </em>
       , based on my reading of your posts, and I haven't read your other posts under accounts. However, to me it seems like you are simply egging people without regards to anything else. Others may feel that isn't the case while some may call you a shill and say you want people to keep at it because of all the psyop shit going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       In closing, I'm just giving my take on how it looks (based on your words and posting history) and offering the readers a solid direction when it comes to evaluating what they've come across.
