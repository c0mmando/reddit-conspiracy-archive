<p>The fact that he was 125 lbs soaking wet, and the fact that it takes much stronger people to fire some of those automatics</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He had a Izhmash Saiga 12-gauge , Bushmaster Model XM15-E2S .223, Glock 20 10mm and a Sig Sauer P226 9mm.  Out of all those guns the only one that sticks out a bit as needing a larger person to fire is the 12 gauge, but then I think back to when I took hunter safty when I was 12 and weight 128 and had no problem with a 12 gauge, sure it has a kick but the kick is more of a push then a snap and the snap type recoil is what takes a larger person.  But even then when I was 13 and went hunting for the fist time with a 30.06 and still weight around 128 I had no problem with the recoil.  </p>

<p>EDIT:  also he did not even take the 12 gauge into the school, it was in the trunk. </p>

In your comment I replied to you made it sound like you did not believe a a person Weighing 125 pounds could handle the firearms used.

    <div class="md"><p>There were and continue to be loose ends everywhere with the Sandy Hook shooting. Also with the Boston Marathon Bombing. Also with the Colorado Dark Knight Rises shooting. The media does not cover these events with any kind of thorough investigations, they just take what law enforcement feeds them as gospel. Law enforcement meanwhile, doesn&#39;t share nearly enough information, and the stuff they do share tends to be easily debunked.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook is the most implausible of all of the mass murders that have been accused of being false-flag attacks. The fact that this thread is asking for hard evidence and no one can produce that speaks volumes. Also the fact that a Connecticut passed a whole bunch of gag order-type laws in it&#39;s aftermath was extremely unique and bizarre.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without being close to the story and sources, it is always difficult to prove anything &quot;irrefutably&quot;. Often times, claims are accepted as truth, unless evidence that contradicts it is provided or there isn&#39;t any material impact of the claim (e.g. &quot;Aliens visit earth everyday and replace everyone&#39;s shoes with an exact replica without anyone noticing.&quot;) There is also always a number of unknowable elements, like what Adam Lanza was thinking, actions he performed that there are no witnesses to, or exactly how he carried out the acts.</p>

<p>While it may be possible that it isn&#39;t true, the more important question would be how anyone can conclude that it isn&#39;t true without clear contradictory evidence, in the face of various sources claiming it did happen.</p>
