    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not telling anyone what to do. Merely pointing out that reddit is obviously not about to stop censoring subreddits and sending in shill accounts to mock and downvote people genuinely here to try and learn more and research into the PG allegations, I just joined voat it&#39;s atmosphere is much more pleasant and all relevant posts actually stay up and are discussed with much less friction from douchebags trying to take over the threads and turn the whole thing into a joke. It&#39;s pretty obvious reddit is run by people who want to push the msm bs narratives and will continue its outright attack on its users. I&#39;m merely stating that people wanting to work together to get some traction and keep the momentum moving forward to spread ideas with out being harassed so heavily exists outside reddit, unless you enjoy spending more time arguing with these jokers who do nothing but try and derail conversations, naysay, answer every post with &quot;there&#39;s no evidence&quot; or &quot;that&#39;s been proven to be debunked&quot; than actually conversing with like minded individuals who want to get to the bottom of this and put a stop to these sick Bastards once and for all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The father of the gunman wrote a screenplay, The Mill from 2008, where, the top listed &quot;actor&quot; &#39;<em>new world agenda</em>&#39; was listed on IMDB as &#39;<em>youtube man</em>&#39; - yet their actual YT channel is a TON of #pizzagate videos currently - and even the latest one is focused on THEMSELVES being linked to this father....</p>

<p>I just find that a really REALLY weird loop of connections - and I do not know what to make of it.</p>

<p>How in the heck is a person who is ostensibly exposing/investigating/discussing #PG with many videos on the subject, linked to the <em>father</em> of the kid who appears to be a plant which went to CPP with a gun to &quot;investigate&quot; -- yet their father wrote and made an actual film where the youtube persona was top billed....</p>

<p>It just feels... odd.</p>

<p>I have a lot of other comments about this -- but what do you think? Is this not freaking weird?</p>

<p>With that said, anyone else who might feel the need to be a vigilante needs to STOP right now and reevaluate their mental and self control. It is an incredibly counter productive to the ENTIRE movement to pull stunts like that. We need to approach this through awareness, investigation, and hopefully legal means. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying... I am asking!</p>

<p>So this guys father wrote a screenplay turned movie, The Mill, (I haven&#39;t seen it) his son has an IMDB page... the top listed &quot;actor&quot; in the mill is &quot;new world agenda&quot; listed as &quot;YouTube man&quot; - yet &quot;new work agenda&quot; has many vids re: #PG and it&#39;s kinda weird that several of these vids are in quick succession and also reference himself...</p>

<p>Is he a tool, exposing trolls? Or is he possibly one who is tied to this that is trying to raise awareness?</p>

<p>I&#39;m torn and this is super weird. What is your opinion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I saw New World Agenda&#39;s video covering this. It&#39;s probably just a little poke to the &quot;truther&quot; community. They are flaunting their psyop in our faces. He&#39;s like one of the biggest false flag debunkers and they did a sloppy job covering this shit up. I almost think they are doing this deliberately to keep the conspiracy scientist occupied and confused. Very sloppy falseflag and im certain that they knew that internet sleuths would be able to expose this with ease, the fact that they aren&#39;t trying anymore just means that they are baiting us</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that will happen.</p>

<p>The very name of this sub is our greatest protection.</p>

<p>Since society has been conditioned to reject anything with the &quot;conspiracy&quot; label, it actually allows us <em>more</em> freedom in an increasingly censored environment. </p>

<p>Since everything we discuss here can be dismissed by the mainstream, we&#39;re left with the ability to discuss just about anything! </p>

<p>So long as we live in a society that mocks independent thinking and research, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will be safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But see this is the problem from where I sit. Do you guys actually do anything when the rules are violated? I can say, based on recent experience, that being called a shill, a cuck (lol@that one) and everything under the sun, since I don&#39;t agree with the <em>evidence</em> of pizzagate, that you guys don&#39;t do anything about it. It seems to me that you have favorites and will do shit when it benefits you or you have an issue with the person, but when certain people are attacked, you don&#39;t seem to step in. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s based on my personal experience and being warned when I insulted someone back.</p>

<p>I placed them on ignore so I can&#39;t see the comments but you should still be able to see them. Called a shill several times in the last 48 hours, told I was CTR and was being paid, etc. </p>

<p>You (mods) let the donald members come here and take over. However, in your defense, meaning you personally, when you said &quot;I will agree that I see no good reason you were warned for rule 10 on the comment you made a month ago though.&quot; that shows me there is still some time and someone with a level head behind the scenes. </p>

<p>In regards to the posts I linked to, if they weren&#39;t handled then, they don&#39;t need to be handled now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, to show that when mods don&#39;t do shit, especially when reports go out, that members take matters into their own hands. If I tell someone to move on, and they don&#39;t, then yes, get placed on ignore and go fuck yourself. Now if mods would do their job, instead of crying and makign it seem as if Spez is the antichrist, then we wouldn&#39;t have these problems.</p>

<p>So calling a cuck isn&#39;t a violation of the rules? Calling someone a shill isn&#39;t a violation of the rules?</p>

<p>That&#39;s great to know. So now I&#39;m going to take off the gloves and starting throwing bricks at those who deserve it. </p>

<p>But just remember, according to you shit like, &quot;You were the one implying there was nothing material. BTFO. I was the one saying yes there is. <strong>Where is the backpedaling, cuck</strong>?&quot; is <strong>NOT</strong> a violation of the rules but telling someone to &quot;fuck off&quot; is a violation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me calling someone a cuck is an admission that you have no valid argument or even notable intelligence, still hardly an attack to use buzzword of the week on somebody who&#39;s winning an argument. It&#39;s an admission of defeat.<br/>
Telling somebody to &#39;move on&#39; is basically a &#39;red rag to a bull&#39; situation and guarantees that they&#39;ll do no such thing. If you throw your bricks <em>within the frameworks of the rules</em> nothing will come of it and if it does complain in the modmail.<br/>
To be clear &#39;fuck off&#39; or &#39;go fuck yourself&#39; is not acceptable.</p>

<p>Once again, you are proving everything in my initial post to you to be true. </p>

<p>So to be clear, cuck <strong>IS</strong> acceptable, yet telling someone to fuck off, after you have told them to move on is not acceptable. It&#39;s not abusive nor is it an attack. </p>

<p>Again, you are proving the double standards I am talking about and the readers are seeing this. You made this thread with intentions of keeping this place afloat but look at what you are doing.</p>

<p>Pointing out that you showed evidence of your own rule breaking and not immediately punishing you for it? That favouritism eh?<br/>
I might point out that <strong>&#39;depending on context&#39;</strong> is the relevant phrase here.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see cuck as an insult, no. It has no valid meaning whatsoever outside of it&#39;s actual intended usage, aside from saying &#39;I have no argument&#39;, and is an admission of mental inferiority IMO. It&#39;s a self-insult.</p>

<p>Depending on the context is relevant here? So me telling a guy to move on in a good way and then, when he doesn&#39;t move on and continues his assault, I&#39;m wrong for telling him to fuck off? Where is the context sensitivity in my situation? In regards to the cuck comment, you already said how you take it, as a sign that a person can&#39;t do X, Y and Z yet you are excusing it. </p>

<p>And you know, just like everyone else knows, what people (mainly Trump supporters) are implying when they type it. And it&#39;s not like I couldn&#39;t take the insult, I did and told him he was on block just because he used it. But again, you are proving exactly what I am saying. </p>

<p>You guys have different rules and standards for different people, apply the rules how you want and then only speak out when shit is about to hit the fan. You, the mod who made the thread under that dumb as fuck duck to the right of our screen, to a couple of others. That&#39;s not an attack, that&#39;s my observation based on my personal experience which you know about. </p>

<p>I believe the main example of the context is that you&#39;ve spent so long wringing drama out of a situation of your own creating, and have consistently attacked mods throughout this exchange and somehow still haven&#39;t been banned for it.</p>

You are the one who typed this thread yet you are making it seem now that you are above criticism/critique and twisting it to be an attack.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it only gives them a reason to use it for nefarious means of course. I imagine if there was a group of people dedicated to discrediting us doxxing the sub and getting it banned would probably work in this crazy atmosphere.</p>

<p>I almost wish they would because the backlash would be so much that I don&#39;t think they could recover from the amount of woke people who wouldn&#39;t blindly trust the news channel anymore.</p>

<p>I am not implying I want this done. I don&#39;t. for real please don&#39;t. I was just saying if reddit were to ban this sub it would look really bad on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree totally with this post, although I fear that those seeking r/conspiracy damage would likely come here posting information they know to be damaging for such purposes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey axo, do you know <a href="/u/lawofattraction33">/u/lawofattraction33</a> ? 3 years ago he made a post that went under the radar, which directly pertains to PG. As far as Msm openly covering up CP rings. Can I directly link to that post so it&#39;s attached to this sticky? It&#39;s in our best interest to get people like him/her back in here. </p>

<p>Open discussion of CP rings is not safe for anyone,  tptb are not to be trifled with, your/your family&#39;s wellbeing is 100% at risk. This is not a game so we should not treat it like one. Doxxing is a bad way to put a spotlight on anyone, period. <em>Especially</em> in this society of non-factual &quot;journalism&quot;. One unaware intern could fracture your entire life into 10000000000 pieces because they saw some crazy guy Doxxing someone else. By using this seemingly innocent comment that interns life could also be fractured in the same sense. When they realize what they did they could have a mental breakdown. I&#39;m not sure who said this but,  &quot; one loose thread can unravel the world &quot;. This rings true for both sides, please be careful not to implicate your loved ones in your efforts to find the truth.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been active here for around 3 years,  mainly because of this sub. Yet the staggering amount of information that has been posted here gets overlooked 7/10 times. Simply due to the sheer amount of controlled opposition that is present.  I personally have deleted comments because I let the rationale of others win me over, only to later find that I was right or on the right track. Feeling beaten and betrayed by my own conscious I resorted to lurking. Since PG started, the landscape of the battlefield has shifted, the slumbering giant is waking up and they know it.  We cannot win by taking advantage of the ones we will ultimately be fighting side by side with. We cannot win with selfish motives or shallow commitments. We can only win by standing as one and acting as one together.  The slumbering giant is only a giant when everyone is present.  Fight them not ourselves.  Stay vigilant friends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to my friend, somebody posted a picture of a Lolita doll in The_Donald last night, sometime between the times of 12am-1am est.  if you don&#39;t know what that is, there was a story about them from the deep web from years ago.  The image was nsfw according to him, appeared to be a girl of legal age (18+), nude with no arms and legs, and was photoshopped wearing a MAGA hat.</p>
