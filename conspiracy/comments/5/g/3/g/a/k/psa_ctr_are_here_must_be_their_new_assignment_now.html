Thats why I&#39;m considering the possibility they are here to derail discussion rather than actually change peoples minds, and keep us regurgitating the same info over and over again and rebutting the simplest arguments to waste our time. Thus the &quot;Trump is one of the establishment&quot; threads. The same thing is posted over and over by every poster saying &quot;yes, we know but he is better than clinton&quot;. The next time we see a thread like that posted, ignore it. Stay skeptical of Trump and do not be suprised when he doesn&#39;t end corruption, but don&#39;t waste time and effort talking to shills who reply with one word snarky rebuttals </p>

<p>I think he knows about it and I think he may have partaken. </p>

<p>&amp;gt;“I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine for a 2002 profile of Epstein. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>

<p>That is a direct quote from Trump. In a rational world that statement would count as evidence. If your neighbor said that about you when the cops knocked on his door investigating child porn allegations against you, a judge would issue authorization to proceed with an arrest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I read somewhere that he flew on the Epstein &quot;lolita express&quot; so that is definately not off the table. I&#39;m not of the opinion that Trump is clean tbh, I don&#39;t think he would have gotten anywhere near elected if he had been. Its worth accepting though that in the current system we will NEVER have a leader who is not involved in the deep dark stuff going on in our world. We just have to settle for the lesser of evils. They made it that way on purpose, their sick moral code involves us having consented to or been pre warned of all major events, thus all the foreshadowing in films and TV.</p>

<p>Edit: to those who downvoted this post, if what I said about Trump possibly flying on &quot;lolita express&quot; is false, would you mind dropping some links or explaining why? I can&#39;t find a source on it so its far from proven and I don&#39;t wholly believe it but I&#39;m sure I read something posted here probably beyond 6 months ago, please don&#39;t take this spitballing as me attacking Trump, I have no evidence one way or another I&#39;m just posting hot off the brain</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be right. I guess its just wishful thinking that they are actually scared of what we are doing right now but they are ultimately scared of what might happen if their next war isn&#39;t Nato vs Russia or Black vs while or liberal vs conservative but us vs them. Unless this really gets around they will follow their usual proceedure, throw a few lower end peons under the bus to make us think we got the pedos then whitewash the rest as they have done in the past. I think you are right about their levels of control but they also rely on us to follow our biology and not make waves amongst our own real life social circles for fear of ostracisation. The more people willing to spread truths the more scared they will get. The closure of r/pizzagate and all its siblings is what inspired the pissing their pants talk, not only that but the msm going on about how its all fake news very soon after it broke. I haven&#39;t known them to crack down so quickly before, as you said though they might be trying to give us the impression we are onto something big to discredit us when we get to the bottom of this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>liberal whiners? by that, do you mean &quot;people who aren&#39;t stupid enough to believe that a billionaire Clinton donor and family friend and Bill&#39;s golfing buddy, Donald Trump, is going to bring hope and change&quot;?</p>

<p>any trump supporter is the equivalent of a Russian who thinks that the Putin donor/family friend/golf buddy who gets set up to &quot;run against&quot; Putin&#39;s wife for president is somehow going to change the Russian political system... when really it&#39;s just a billionaire Putin buddy who got set up to &quot;represent&quot; the opposition to the Putins, so that the same interests are controlling the tops of both &#39;sides&#39;.</p>

<p>They were doing more investigating and research into conspiracies especially some of the more dangerous ones than we were here. </p>

<p>Honestly, ever since then I have spent almost 100% of my time over at T_D...good to see at least a bit of credibility coming back to this community since you guys are not backing off of the pizzagate stuff. </p>

<p>This sub will be the next to be silences if they can finally put a muzzle on T_D. I don&#39;t think they will be able to honestly, but that is simply due to the incredibly high level of energy that sub has. Any other sub on here would have been destroyed with the tactics the Admins are using...hidden and public. We should be thankful they have been so focused and high energy with everything they do, otherwise we might have Hillary in the white house, and our freedom of speech would have been completely destroyed. They were in the end game steps towards fully implementing censorship online. They will still try and go through with it, but it is going to be much harder to do with so many red pilled and ravenous centipedes to deal with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the strategy.</p>

<p>People discovered that no matter what you say, 1/3 of the people will believe you, 1/3 will not, 1/3 don&#39;t care or could be swayed.</p>

<p>I think TD and Trump used this. Make shit up, whatever you want. Say it a whole bunch, say it louder, and you win. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s how it looks:</p>

<p>&quot;Obama caused the economic crash of 2007.&quot; - TD</p>

<p>&quot;No, he didn&#39;t, he wasn&#39;t even president, source, multiple sources, reputable, if you were alive you know this.&quot; - fact checker</p>

<p>&quot;STUPID CTR SHILL CUCK, CENTIPEDES ATTACK, SPREAD THIS EVERYWHERE, MEME IT. OBAMA CAUSED THE ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OF 2007.  UNDER OBAMA THE ECONOMY HAS TANKED. MEDIA, BOOKS, PRIMARY SOURCES ALL LIE.&quot; - TD</p>

<p>At this point, the memes fly across Facebook and chain mails so much so, 1/3 of the public thinks Obama caused the recession of 2007. Which makes no sense at all.</p>

<p>A conspiracy theorist would talk about the rise of shadow banking being the primary problem among several other reasons. Shadow banking is a big thing and Trump is moving all the shadow pawns back into place for the ultra wealthy and another economic collapse. Wealthy people love economic collapses. LOVE THEM! </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say a wealthy person owns 90 houses out of 100. Everyone else owns 10. The wealthy persons takes a 10% hit, still has more money than they know what to do with. The public takes a 10% hit but can&#39;t afford it and go bankrupt. Wealthy person comes in and buys assets at 25% original value. Economy recovers. Wealthy person loans money to poor everyone else with low interest rates to buy back their houses at 100% value. The ultra wealthy just made 300% on the asset, and 5% per year on the loan which will actually work out to just as much interest as the asset was worth.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how it looks and what you can expect:</p>

<p>Average Joe loses $100 house. Ends up losing $50 of equity and still owes $50</p>

<p>Wealthy Mr. Smith buys house for $25 during collapse.</p>

<p>Economy recovers.</p>

<p>Joe buys back house at $100. By the time he pays for house, he&#39;ll have paid $200. He&#39;ll never get to that point. </p>

<p>Mr. Smith just made $175 on a $25 investment.</p>

<p>Ever wonder why wealthy people love giving out loans with low interest through their banks, why banks love giving out low interest loans. They love economic collapses and so do the wealthy. It&#39;s a feeding frenzy. </p>

<p>Trump was just elected and his fellow sharks are salivating.</p>

<p>They&#39;re going to eat up public school funds, VA, social security, Medicare, wreck the economy on purpose, they&#39;re going to take in trillions, and leave the country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the house loan thing happened when Clinton was in power and he prepared the field for the next president. Then we know what happened. Doesn&#39;t mean it cannot happen again though! We know the construction and loan industry made a ton of money out of this, and people just got ripped off. I&#39;m sure you and I wish the scenario you described won&#39;t happen because you being right would suck for all of us haha!</p>

<p>I agree with you that no matter the side, people are not always aware of the neuro-linguistic techniques being used on them and most business people or leaders are trained for this.  What they do with their skills is another story; hopefully it&#39;s used positively... (let&#39;s be realistic, usually it&#39;s not). Can&#39;t we be honest? I think that whole &quot;trigger&quot; thing is generational or at least, that seems to be what people have learnt to do in the last decades. So if you ask me, people being triggered and reacting violently are a cultural issue more than a political issue. I so want to see change in that in the next years. In the end, we all pay the price for not monitoring the government (no matter its &#39;colors&#39;), so as a people, everybody need to team up to discuss about what they want, doesn&#39;t matter who voted for who.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t deny it, Trump is a master troll but I follow him for years, I thought he was joking when he became candidate, I didn&#39;t take this too seriously for months and here we are today! I&#39;m looking forward to see results now ;)</p>

<p>One thing for sure, the constant insults in any debate are not acceptable, no matter who is right and I hate it as much as you! That&#39;s not my vision of free speech. You see, I&#39;m a Trump supporter (heehee) but I cannot agree with blind faith no matter who is talking. I&#39;ve been banned from a &#39;safezone&#39; for saying out loud I didn&#39;t approve what was going on and how it was actually embarrassing. It was obvious they would end up in a mutiny there. But that safezone is showing a very disturbing &quot;concentrated&quot; mass of aggressive people who probably never had interest in politic until recently and even caught myself I&#39;m wishing they do not represent the whole crowd of supporters at some point! But realistically, those guys are super loud online and they totally overshadow the other supporters (and everybody) who can align more than 3 words without using the word &quot;cuck&quot; (oh god...!) They actually censor their own supporters online, so I know there&#39;s other people who like Trump or who are more on the right but are not acting like teenagers. Don&#39;t worry, they are embarrassing a lot of people on the right too, probably the majority actually.</p>

<p>If that can make you smile, these aggressive people are on a path of self-destruction because of their own &#39;divide and conquer&#39; &amp; censoring, so maybe you&#39;ll see a bit less of them and more dialog. I hope so. Know that dialog there is most likely to be considered concern trolling so.... that&#39;s really a reddit thing, not a Donald Trump thing.</p>

<p>So that being said, I really appreciate you took the time to explain what you think about this and in a respectful manner. I can&#39;t say the scenario you described is impossible, it&#39;s quite rational. I think I&#39;ll save your post for later... hopping you&#39;re wrong, of course xD</p>

<hr/>

<p>Also. We need to acknowledge that it&#39;s true a lot of people didn&#39;t have their voice heard in the last years. You guys will need to be tolerant because there will be a few months of ranting. <strong>People need to get that frustration out of their system and that&#39;s also partly what&#39;s going on. So the left also needs to be patient and not go too emotional about it, it&#39;s temporary.</strong> I&#39;m sure things will get better and it will go back to something acceptable in a few months.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, there are debunks but they get downvoted and are not shared. The conspiracy &#39;proofs&#39; are not updated. That&#39;s not very inspiring to contribute either in debunks or extra clues due to the way the information is used (or ignored). Example:</p>

<p>np.reddit.com<a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/5ez5r9/podesta_occult_some_debunk_14_fish_on_podestas/">/r/conspiracy/comments/5ez5r9/podesta_occult_some_debunk_14_fish_on_podestas/</a></p>

<p>Second, I&#39;m not trying to patronize or anything (really!) but it&#39;s difficult for people who believe parts of the pizzagate to side with the whole movement because rational questions are downvoted or dismissed. And it feels like we need to do the whole investigative work from scratch on our own because there&#39;s blatant fallacies or bad associations, and most of the pizza crowd does not want to engage in an intellectual analysis of the links/evidences/clues. Please note I said &quot;most of the crowd&quot;, not &quot;all the crowd&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>So sometimes it&#39;s not that the whole conspiracy is rejected, it&#39;s more the vocal immature crowd that comes with it and doesn&#39;t want to discuss the points logically that is rejected.</strong> I&#39;m not saying you are part of it, I think it&#39;s alright you asked why that person thinks &quot;pizzag8 is dumb&quot;. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s right either to just reject the conspiracy because we don&#39;t like the people &quot;pushing it&quot; but it&#39;s normal there&#39;s 2 sides in this. Now just so you know, I know some people investigating this are very rational too, I had nice discussions with them. I wish there were more of those guys actually, we could all work together and get as much truth out of this as we can! Maybe even debunk it and go on a totally new track too, we never know. I&#39;m not posting my findings on pizag8 or pedo because I&#39;m worried how the info will be used and distorted. I&#39;m probably not the only one.</p>

The difference between us and you is that we are intending to actually discuss it. If you don&#39;t think its a real thing then if you post in a civil manner (the opposite of your post above, incase you aren&#39;t sure what a civil post looks like) then plenty of people will debate you. One or two will call you a shill perhaps, but if you don&#39;t fly in with preconceptions expressed like this &quot;and i think #PIZZAGTE!!1 is one of the dumbest things ever&quot; then you might be taken seriously and receive less shill accusations. If you always post in the same manner you have done here then I can safely assume its your posting style that is the problem, along with a few people who are too keen to shill-brand. </p>

No one is curtailing your speech you snowflake, I&#39;m saying that when you talk shit expect not to be taken seriously, and maybe even to get some shit back. Why don&#39;t you understand free speech? Its incredibly simple. You can say what you want, no one has to listen, no one has to reply, but expect to not be taken seriously when you post like a child. You speak, people speak back in response. People are also free to call you a shill, and depending on the context, they may be warned or banned or not acted on at all by the mods here.

We maybe need a new sub for people as crazy as you, you are way beyond aliens and flat earth and any of the more out there conspiracy theories discussed here. Oh wait, there&#39;s already a sub for that, r/politics. You spend plenty of time there posting your shit. You&#39;re welcome here if you can either post in a civil manner or handle the inevitable flak that will come your way when you post in the manner you do (thats free speech for you, bud). If you can&#39;t post constructively and voice your skepticism in a reasonable manner go back there. Or stay, and whine like you currently are but accept that people wont take kindly to it.

<p>Not in the numbers people here think they do, the front page has more conservative subs than sjw ones, the GOP is in power, trump was elected. If people think tumblr blogs and twitter feminists are on par with the united states government that&#39;s laughable but they can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I barely focussed any attention on the marjiuana_overdose guy(and thats one guy, not &quot;people&quot;) I had a quick look through his history after he posted twice in a mocking manner and contributed nothing to the discussion, merely to see if he deserved the accusations of being a shill. I never told anyone to be paranoid about CTR, I told them to keep asking questions and be skeptical of everything, just a reminder that not all posts here are grass roots, which they aren&#39;t. I don&#39;t know how you can claim I focused my attention only on people who say its not CTR when I replied to the vast majority of posters here, whether they agree or not and my first reply at least is always civil and explains my position as well as I can. I only resort to shit slinging and adhominem when the person I&#39;m replying to goes at it first. Its cute that you came here to defend your friend but I never said he didnt have the right to comment here, he has the right, ofcourse but people have the right to reply as well, this isn&#39;t a safe spece and if he posts like a childish prick then he wont get serious replies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a huge percentage of the people in high powered positions are pedophiles; or are aware that their colleagues are pedophiles and have done nothing; then we have a true conspiracy.  The public has a massive distaste of pedophilia, so exposing it would be a good play to disrupt the powers that be. The issue does suffer from &quot;the turd in the punch bowl&quot; effect;  as discussing it is so distasteful for some, that even with strong evidence people will still be in denial or don&#39;t even want to discuss it.  *edit:  replyed to wrong person, but right thread.  Directed at OP of this reply thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but if we are refering to the commenter above, the best thing for him to do if he doesn&#39;t like what he reads is to just go read something else if it makes him uncomfortable. I don&#39;t get why he goes in and posts derailing childish comments when he could just leave it alone. Theres a difference between not wanting to discuss it yourself and wanting to derail the discussion others are having. I like your &quot;turd in the punchbowl effect&quot; thing, a good metaphor but gross lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look man, theres plenty of disagreement in this sub. You clearly haven&#39;t been here long. We still can&#39;t agree on what happened on 9/11, whether Alex Jones is limited hangout, whether Trump is a honeypot etc.. But theres a way to disagree that will foster discussion and theres a way (demonstrated by our friend above) that gets you no reply, shill accustations and snarky dismissals. Post a constructive arguement and we can discuss it, post HURR DURR PIZZAGAT IZ DUMB and you will get the response you deserve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, you guys only want validation. It&#39;s sad. And gross (I&#39;m not a validation circle fan... teehee) Man, your account is 6-months old. Are we comparing our e-peen and you think you&#39;re better because you&#39;re 1 mm longer? Come on.</p>

<p>LOOK MAN, HIGHEST COMMENT:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey CTR. Check it out! <strong>When we prove what you&#39;re obviously hiding, we are going to hang you in the streets.</strong> You are a disgrace to humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SOUNDS PRETTY RATIONAL AND SOLID LOGICAL DISCUSSION THERE. Appropriate penalty for the crime too (duh). Is that what you did in the last years? I&#39;ve seen better here tbh. I also know there&#39;s very smart peeps here, I&#39;ve seen them before that mob of zealots appeared. Preach to your choir, boy.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Go check what&#39;s the highest comment too and the others that are hidden and tell who is not even trying to give a logical argument and who support that zombie validation mentality. You do nothing but validating. No proofs, no extra info, nothing. Only the little high-fives lol. You know, that&#39;s what facebook is for.</p>

<p>Your quote: &quot; You clearly haven&#39;t been here long.&quot;</p>

<p>Wow the denial is real.</p>

<p>Funny how you have nothing more to say about the quotes above other than acting like an outraged snowflake. Again, no content, just outrage outrage outrage. Reminds me of a certain group you claim to despise...</p>

<p>Anyone that posts views that you dont like is &quot;whining&quot; and &quot;moaning&quot; and &quot;derailing&quot;. Got it. You are so oppressed. </p>

<p>Honestly thank you &quot;Europeanquarantined&quot; you proved that &quot;CTR&quot; is just a phrase that allows you to get triggered and avoid debate. I honestly could not have asked for a better example of this than your responses.</p>
