       Trump was elected as a repudiation of establishing candidates like Hillary Clinton, whom he has been long time friends with. Immediately after winning he starts handing off cabinet positions to complete establishment shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some have theorized Trump has been controlled opposition from jump street. If that were the case, why was he allowed to win the election after absolutely running Bill &amp; Hillary through the mud?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump was meant to win all along, why then was their a Soros funded media propaganda campaign against him, and why are we seeing all of this recount nonsense now?

       Nothing makes any sense

       My theory is: Trump might've started off as controlled opposition, and then somewhere in the process decided he really wanted to win, broke the 'script' and actually went and won the whole damn thing legitimately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's clear that since the day of the election, Soros &amp; Hillary have waged this campaign to try and steal it from him. Paying people to protest &amp; riot immediately afterwards, then planting the seed in the MSM of "Hillary won the popular vote" to subtly undermine people's acceptance of the result. Then getting another candidate (Stein) to instigate the recounts so it wouldn't look like it's Hillary just being a sore loser, which she is.

       Because this elections purpose is to spark civil war. When Clinton steals the white house Trump supporters will send the country into chaos which will allow tptb to further the police state. I been saying it all along that this election is about creating crisis. Phase 4 of ideological subversion.

       My personal theory is that they told him he would die if he continued his "you'd be in jail" and "drain the swamp" bit. This was the first thing that occurred to me during his victory speech where he thanked Hillary for her service to our country. Such an abrupt and drastic shift in tone had to mean something. That's how I see it anyway. Of course it's been a while since anyone has killed a president, so maybe this seems far-fetched.

       maybe, but an election is also kinda like a boxing/MMA fight, you say some nasty things in the build-up and then try to kill eachother in the competition, then when it's over you shake hands and can be civil again.

       I believe the elites plan a Republican-flavored agenda in the event that the Republican wins and a Democratic-flavored agenda in the event that the Democrat wins. To me Trump and Hillary are two rich retired elderly people fighting to be voted president of the country club. There's genuine competition there, but the stakes aren't nearly as high for them or for us as the media would have us believe. It's just like sports: the results might be hotly debated by they're ultimately inconsequential. The really important thing is the game/spectacle itself, and that you're watching and rooting for a team.

       The one thing that stands out to me about the Trump picks is that they are all hardcore neocon Zionists.   Don't forget that Netanyahu himself coined the term "war against terror" back in the 80's.   Trump fits in well with the longstanding Israeli attempt to demonize Muslims in order to justify Israeli atrocities and territorial expansion.   Trump's role will be to attack Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Israelis, like the banks, fund both sides.   They have the neocons on one side and the "progressive liberal interventionists" like Hillary on the other.

       It just seems to me that he was controlled opposition. And what happens when you have controlled opposition no matter who wins the person controlling them wins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway the plan for the ruling elite to destroy the poor people is still underway they are just hoping to get us rowdy and get crazy. Simply because trump won it might have prolonged war or make it come faster compared to hillary having won.
