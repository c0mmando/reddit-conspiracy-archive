       Okay, so during my campaigning for Gary Johnson, I met with Jill a few times and had lunch. Always very articulate and friendly, she told us that of course she wanted to win, but if not her then Gary followed by Trump. She made no effort to even try to keep from cutting into Hilary's crowd, and honestly I think she would probably have been pleased if she kept Killary from winning. But she made it perfectly clear she knew Hilary was a criminal, Jill called her a demon and a war criminal multiple times. She was mainly outraged by the children Hilary has killed. I just find it hard to believe she is now working for Clinton without being threatened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been trying to call her all day asking her what is she trying to accomplish, but after I got off the phone, something seemed off about her voice and I just watched some youtube videos of her. I don't think whoever I talked with was Jill. And she was very vague about the whole thing, I got no concrete answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, she campaigned on not taking any corporate money, and she even criticized Gary over accepting corporate donations. His response was he only took no strings donations, which I can confirm as true. But everyone is now saying that Soros gave Jill $7 million and now a Soros lawyer will handle the recount. This isn't the Jill I knew, in fact just checking out her twitter page, it looks off...
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what to think. She's a pretty nice lady, I would hate that Hillary would end up killing her so she could flip 3 states and win.

       I just heard her interviewed on NPR.  She was clear and articulate and stated her reasons for going forward with this effort, which cleared up a lot of confusion for me.  She said that she would be doing this recount no matter who would have won.  She has equal disdain for both Hillary and Trump, and thinks the country will head down very similar paths no matter who is President.  This recount isn't an effort to get Hillary elected; she said it was an effort to check and verify battleground state results due to the US having an election system that in her words "invited" corruption and vote tampering.  She's trying to root out possible corruption and cast light onto a shitty voting process.  She also said that she doesn't actually expect it to change the outcome of the election.  If any google wizards are out there, I encourage you to find the interview and link to it here.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the OP is attempting to troll us with disinformation.  Stein's true intentions are being ignored, letting all of America to speculate about what she's trying to accomplish.  Yawn.  There are bigger fish to fry here.  Let her do her thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I found the interview, NPR apparently does a good job with transcripts AND audio on one page.

       I think it's too convenient that she's pushing for a recount in three states where Trump won. Come on, we gotta be more critical here. This is most definitely an effort to get Hillary elected. Now why is Jill Stein working for Hillary? Was she working for her the whole time or just now? Was her life threatened by Hillary's goons?

       Exactly. As the Green Party, why would they have any interest in these specific states unless they're trying to get Hillary elected? Just so strange. I don't think I trust the green party anymore. It's all a scam to get us skeptics invested in elections. Only revolution is realistic.

       Getting the recounts cost money though. She cant afford to recount all the battleground states, and who would give her money to recount ones hillary was winning? Only the losing side has an interest in paying for recounts, and she's getting free press(and maybe some credit from disaffected dems) for something she probably knows won't do anything

       Because the reality is that IF the election was fraudulent, the places that this would happen are swing states. These three in particular are ones where the result isn't what was expected - all they need to do is prove a discrepency in these states and that opens it up nationally.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's basically a smell test - if the election was at all tampered with in a meaningful manner, it will have been in these states.

       This sub should be praising any investigation in to election fraud.

       My point was that she
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       making her intentions clear by doing interviews such as this one.  However I think the mainstream media isn't covering it, they're just going with stories the fact that Jill Stein is doing a recount vote period.  No explanation.  No bothering to get the facts.  In such a vacuum of information, people are free to make up whatever they want.

       The explanation just doesn't make a lot of sense. If she was genuinely concerned with the integrity of the election, she would be pushing for a recount in all of the close states. She isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       She is either trolling for weed money (and somehow transparently ripping off the wealthiest people in the world), or she was bought / pressured, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is literally no way this is "principled", just look at the states involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is on my home domreddit but I think it explains why we shouldn't casually dismiss this:
      </p>

       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5f3s8x/a_certain_ceo_is_trying_to_cripple_our_domreddit/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       She doesn't need to flip enough electoral votes to overturn the election. She doesn't even need to flip a single state. She just needs to give the media an excuse to "plausibly" question whether even a single state was compromised. Even if the Fake News doesn't adopt the narrative en masse, whoever is behind this will be happy to discredit Trump and create division, empowering those willing to create chaos to bring our country down.

       There are three possibilities that I can see.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Jill Stein was always controlled opposition. Your guess is as good as mine why they needed this controlled opposition, but perhaps to corral people into the election circus who would have otherwise dropped out after Bernie lost the nomination. She works for the same people Hillary works for, so it's no surprise that after the election, Jill Steins true colors are revealed (not green, well maybe green as in cash). She helps put a nice face now on this effort to win back the election for Hillary, because it would be a little too obvious if Hillary herself was raising the money. (evil Jill hypothesis)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Jill Stein was sincere in her opposition to the power elite. But she did a little too good this time (or she was blamed unfairly for trumps win). So they threatened her life or that of her family unless she goes out and stumps for this recount stuff, as a way to partially make up for going against the Clinton mafia. (compromised Jill hypothesis)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Jill Stein knows what she's doing, this recount won't actually help Clinton but will expose that the Green party got way fewer votes than it should have. (Secret agent Jill hypothesis)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I hope it is 3, I'm afraid that it's 2, and I don't want to believe 1 as someone who supported her campaign. But we have to be open to the possibilities. I think the change in character here, where before she was saying Hillary is the devil basically and now she appears to be working for the devil, is too strange for the hypothesis that this is the same old Jill we love. Something is going on here.

       I think the Democrat party made a deal with green party. The green party will be the future of the Democrats. The Democrats have ruined their name and want to become the greens as the climate change talks heat up. I'm thinking they cut a deal to get the green party growing and this is just part of the deal.

       I like the way you laid that out. I don't buy the evil Jill hypothesis, it's unlikely given the tone of her campaign and the sudden change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's a mixture of 2 and 3. I think 2 happened, but 3 is what Jill thinks she's doing. However the people in control think they can pull off 2 (and possibly give Hillary the election) by tricking Jill in to thinking she's doing 3.

       In regards to point 2, they could be blackmailing her with something? Just a thought. Or maybe she took the money with a plan in mind hoping she can keep Soros and his cronies away. Who knows until more info comes out and time goes on.

       It's called one-party consent, and it's legal. There are only eleven states that require both parties to consent: Hawaii, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Washington.

       Jill had a strategy,   I suppose,  or was given one,  for picking three states that could theoretically benefit Hillary and harm Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       My position is that if Jill was serious about "electoral integrity" she would also be calling for new elections (with radically altered safeguards),  and exposing the fact that Hillary is NOT the rightful DNC candidate, but Bernie would be.    This would be interesting,  because it would also bring Bernie into the fray,  for not insisting on legal action against Hillary for stealing the primary,   which is has now been shown to have been extremely likely:
       <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6J1ecILnk3UUy1KZ2FUT29iQ1E/view?pref=2&amp;amp;pli=1">
        https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6J1ecILnk3UUy1KZ2FUT29iQ1E/view?pref=2&amp;amp;pli=1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words,  or TLDR,  Jill's message has not been clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand,  if I were Jill,  I would probably realize by now that very little of her message ever got out to the masses.    I would probably be taking ques from the "big dogs"  that face time and controversy are what gives you the power of face time and "credibility" within what was more a competition of spectacle,  a reality TV show called an election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Winning in this game might even
       <em>
        require
       </em>
       periods of confusion and subterfuge in order to stay interesting enough to merit a seat at the table.    Its likely that Jill's 1% of the vote shocked her.   It sure shocked me.   She was so far and away a better choice than either Trump or Hillary,  and yet the grip of the two party system could still be that universal when both main parties were criminally corrupt.    Jill might have attracted some new consultants,   and Hillary ain't one of them,  I seriously doubt it.

       I am beginning to believe she knew her vote count was seriously deflated, and she took matters into her own hands. I hope she knows what she is doing. She certainly didn't strike me as a James Bond secret agent.

       I honestly don't know much about her, but from the news I have read on her. It seems like she would care a lot more about the pipeline protest, then trying to help Hillary. She demonized Hillary, why would she be trying to help her?

       I knew her personally and she told me if she lost, she would rather Gary win and then Trump. In fact she was very cool with the idea of spoiling Hilary. She called Hillary a demon multiple times and there's no way she would voluntarily help her. I took a look at her Twitter page and everyone is saying she is now working for Hillary, I find this highly unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess at the moment she saw that 1% she knew it was clearly a deflated number, I expected her to at least get 2.5% minimum. So she takes matters into her own hands and now I really have no idea what she is doing. And has somehow gotten $7 million from someone like Soros or something, and she plans on proving that third parties are being deflated.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to this researcher, whom I am currently authenticating his work, Jill should have gotten 3% and Gary 6%. Even without media coverage or debate inclusion. But I think keeping the Libertarian Party under 5% is their goal. 5% is the magic number so we can become a minor party and if we had received it, we would be mounting a major offensive in 2018 and 2020.

       I am not sure, I have only called her once (on election night to congratulate her for her 1%, which she claimed was being underreported, but I didn't give it much thought).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea if it's really her, or if she is drugged or someone else. I am just waiting to on new video footage on facebook. Hope she's fine, she's kinda batty, but means well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did some google searching, and found a site. Using his methodology, Johnson should have gotten on election day: 6% and Jill 3%. Some are a bit higher, but most hover in that area. It looks like he put a lot of work into it, and he did predict that the MSM was lying about Clinton's imminent victory, and he predicts a Trump win. So I guess he isn't a complete nut, but he needs to make his site more readable.

       At this point, everything's theory, like Julian Assange being alive or dead right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is certainly odd that she received more money for the recount (2x as much) than her entire campaign run; however, no one knows the intention behind her actions right now. She may also be exposing, what you said, about receiving 3% of the vote. She has made the point of taking action in the past, and doesn't seem entirely unlike her, even if the contributions are dubious, there is no evidence to say her and the Clinton intentions are aligned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, one of the only ways for the third party candidates to receive attention is through controversy (the Trump effect).

       What would be funny is if she recounts one state, finds no issue and then just keeps the $7 million. Stealing from Soros is a kick ass crime. She has a clear no refund message on her site.

       Pretty sure they already linked it to Soros at The Donald. Its obvious hes behind this recount campaign, started it by paying people to riot after the election, then planted seeds of dissent in the MSM with the talking point of Hillary winning the pop vote, now this is step 3.

       Rand Paul was by far the best debater in the primaries and he was given the silent treatment by the MSM while Trump and Clinton were given 24/7 coverage (even before the primary debates). Johnson wouldn't have been allowed to compete even if he were allowed to debate, sadly.

       In 1996 Ross Perot won the main debates soundly and he was also dismissed/ignored by the MSM.

       I agree Gary wasn't the best public speaker, but Rand and Ron are better speakers and they did get the media blackout.

       I really liked Gary though, he's the kinda guy you know has your back, despite his oddball personality, he was fun to volunteer with.

       Thanks, I thought we blew it and only got 3%, but according to some research I have been doing, it looks like we might have won 6% (minor party status FTW). I think third party voter suppression investigation is what Jill is up to, but has evidently run into some trouble from Killary.

        The Mysterious Case Of Jill Stein's Surging Recount Costs

       Just yesterday we noted that Jill Stein was acting on behalf of Hillary Clinton to raise money for recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.  As we noted then, we continue to be astonished by the amount of money flowing into the fundraising campaign and would love to see which of Hillary's mega donors have spent the most on the effort...somehow we suspect this isn't just a "grassroots organizing" effort as Stein described it.

       don't mind all these people that don't believe you. and thanks for sharing this.
I believe this 100%. Something is up. Would have never voted for Stein if she was going to pull this shit. 
The media refused to cover her. She was even cancelled from talk shows last minute. Now all of sudden, after the election she's on front page news, collecting millions of donation money within a span of a few days? 
Didn't she previously say" if trump was elected I wouldn't sleep well at night but if Hillary was elected I certainly wouldn't sleep well at night" ?
      </p>
      <p>
       If her political campaign platform was all a show then she did a great job fooling everyone. Even better than Sanders.

       AFAIK she still hasn't explained this. Everyone is assuming it is Soros money. One alternative might be Trump himself because he knows that her investigation will lead to the discovery of fraud. Just a guess.

       just think of all the other things the money that was "raised" could have been used for. But no, it has to be used to recount votes, almost one month after the election.

      <p>
       my guess is that the soros-backed protests didnt achieve the effect they wanted, so now its this.

       Bernie and Jill took a turn for the crazy on Twitter... I'm not following the news too carefully, but has anyone heard Jill say any of her recount stuff outside of Twitter? Cause we kinda know twitter ain't above a little shenanigans.

       I think on Facebook from yesterday. Hopefully she succeeds with whatever shes up to. Uncovering massive voter fraud might trigger a whole new election perhaps.

       I hope she doesn't succeed to what she is up to because it is exactly outlined as a part of Soros' strategy for a coup de etat.

       A whole new election is likely to cause more civil unrest in this country, similar to what we saw in Ukraine when they had an election crisis. Watch some of the Vice videos in the Ukraine if you haven't. It's not pretty. And someone will be the patsy waiting to save everyone from all of it, put in by the real power structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're here, why do you want a new election so bad? Surely you realize the guy behind the curtain is the same.

       What retarded post. So you met her in your own words only few times for short amounts, you call her supposedly weeks?, months after you last spoke to her and in a telephone call you expect her to sound exactly the same?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can barely even recognize family member when speaking over the phone, their voice over the phone changes so much.

       Dude first, calm down. Next read my post. I met her quite a few times during this election cycle. And I watched all of her youtube videos. And comparing her voice from youtube, whoever I spoke with on the phone did not sound like the same person to me and was very evasive.

       She is a paid shill, always has been. The green platform is utter retardation. Of course its her and of course she is doing this to benefit her lord and master Hillary Clinton and her owners as well!

       She is put there to rile up the imbeciles who then on go and vote for the democrats as the "closest" party and of course to take votes away from much more sensible third parties like the libertarians and constitutionalists.

       This I just can't believe, she was well known for her utter contempt for Hillary and basically endorsed Donald over Hilary.

       But we don't believe she harmed our Libertarian Ticket this year, in fact she skimmed off about 1% off of Hillary.

       Well, it was a drugged sounding voice and she was not articulate. And extremely evasive towards all my questions.

       And then she starts working with Hilary, who she has called a demon multiple times. I think whatever she got into, shes now over her head.

       Exactly. As the Green Party, why would they have any interest in these specific states unless they're trying to get Hillary elected? Just so strange. I don't think I trust the green party anymore. It's all a scam to get us skeptics invested in elections. Only revolution is realistic.
