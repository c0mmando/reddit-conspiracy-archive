       Ok, i decided to search for a new country. I just feel there's nothing that can save the USA anymore. We became a country in which the idiots are the majority and the small intelligent minority is working to pay huge taxes so this idiots can survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soo... I need some input to find my new country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Criteria. 
1) Intelligent people who can take care of themselves or starve to death.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) A country where the majority are not unemployed, singers, actors, artists, painters, dancers and anything that has to do with the entertainment business. Which also takes them back to the stupid unemployed issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Low taxes, citizens pay the bare minimum only for public utilities. Where people need to pay on their own for everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) No people with issues. For example, whites feeling supremacist, blacks crying that their ancestors were slaves, gays being out of their mind etc.... i want a country where this people are like 1/6 of the population or less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, job and payment i can handle that. I have skills i can sell anywhere but i want to live with intelligent people. House etc doesn't matter i'll buy one and cost of living i can handle it if the above are met.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone have any suggestions?? Any experiences with a country like that? I wana go and never look back. The US for me is compromised, the dumping down has succeeded, i want to move out before they collapse everything if possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks 😅🤓

       that's how most of us feel. finding "no people with issues" may be a problem, i think. reading the responses to your post, it's not impossible -- an island where you can grow your own food.

       Buy beach front property in Thailand, Vietnam etc. Bring collection of movies/books with you. Buy a boat, learn to sail. Explore islands. Become a nomad of sorts. Do that for about ten years.

       I think irrigation /plumbing is more of a problem there. You could get used to it after a year. Fish, rice, fresh vegetables is practically free. Internet is hit and miss. If u live near a major Hotel could work out of it. You never know, you might like it. Hear good stories about it, if your tired of society and all.

       More like sick of it. I feel abused and unfairly treated here, it makes me depressed. And the more i listen to all this spoiled people who literally survive out of welfare complain and act like they're progressive and smart while i pay over 1500 tax it makes me wana puke. I want out and i want it now 😖

       Only that i dont bother anyone, i just want them to stop affecting my life and demanding stuff from others. Everyone has issues, but when they start projecting their issues onto me or the government then i dont like it. Why is it so hard to mind our own business. We are a big country and when you have all this people acting like that then it becomes a mess. Some dont have money, some dont wana pay college, some make kids they dont afford, some think the word is hunting them because they're black or gay or whatever, some demand free medical, some demand higher salary, some demand this or that.... so how do we satisfy all this people? And who will pay for some of the demands? Why can't we just say you're all on your own. Gov pays only the most basic utilities and then its up to the people and the businesses? You failed in life then its your problem, you have issues then its your problem, you can't afford something then its your problem. I think this is the way it should be,

       What you are describing does not exist to my knowledge, everywhere you go there will be those kinds of people. The best thing that you can do is have a tight circle of friends who are perfect just for you and ignore everyone else, get off of news sites and delete Reddit acc you're life will instantly be improved.

       Well not when every month i have to give up 1/3 of my salary. Not when some psycho attacks me and calls me names because he didn't like who i voted for, or when they block the streets until their demands are met. Not when the gov keeps charging its credit card to pay and satisfy this people when eventually someone will have to pay it. Not when the gov is forcing me to pay things that i dont want and even recently messing my health insurance. Not when the gov decides what the minimum wage will be and screws up the economy, because it just doesnt make sense to pay min $15, then i want a raise because my job needs skills, so i should get $8 more, which eventually all they will achieve is to get replaced by automation. I wish i could ignore them, but want it or not they affect me.

       I lived in CR for a sec. Lots of ex-pats there. Heads up on a few things to be prepared for:
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn Spanish. No one speaks English off resorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carry cash. The police expect Americans to offer bribes when they notice you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get used to rain. The wet season is months long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch for monkeys &amp; falling coconuts. Not even kidding here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imperial is the only beer around. Hope you like it. It's terrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch for bacteria warnings in the water. It's a thing. Pay attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, Pura Vida. It is there philosophy of life &amp; culture and it sounds very nice. In reality, however, it means you will have to allow 4+ hours to run to the bank, set up utilities, grocery shop, pretty much any necessary activity. Be aware that many roads are treacherous, crumbling and full of batshit crazy truck drivers who give zero fucks if they run you off a cliff, so try to keep your routine close to home. It also means you need to familiarize yourself with squatters rights &amp; how to hire armed security for your home as kidnappings &amp; looting are frequent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that pretty much covers it, but I'll edit if anything else occurs to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enjoy your new life! 😂😂😂

       They also have 15% tax. Guys this place is amazing. Beautify nature, the demographics are great, good diversity, it looks like a dream. I hope its easy to learn Spanish though.

       Hmm... so basically the USA isn't good enough for you?  Consider for a moment what the U.S. Border Patrol does (albeit imperfectly, but what do they DO)?  Keep people OUT.  What does the North Korean/Cuban/Chinese/etc. Border Patrol do?  Keep their own citizens from ESCAPING.

       I suggest Switzerland/Hungary/Poland/Latvia/New Zealand. All of these have smart people, have low taxes, and all but New Zealand are in the Schengen area. Stay away from the Nordic countries if you want low taxes.
