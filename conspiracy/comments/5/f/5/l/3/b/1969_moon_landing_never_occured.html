       Back in 1969, the first ever moon landing from Earth was televised to 600 million people. Or was it? A lot of people believe that America wanted to be the first country to set foot on the moon, but lacked the proper technology. America just decided to fake the whole thing. However, there were little slip-ups that prove that it may have not have been as real as we thought it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       For starters, there's no wind in outer space. If you Google 'moon footprints' you'd likely find that every footprint ever made on the moon is still there, as there isn't any wind to blow them away. So can anyone explain how the hell the flag started blowing in the nonexistent breeze when it was placed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, everything is surrounded by pure blackness. If you're standing on the f*cking moon shouldn't you be in the middle of star central?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also this picture that's became famous for something in it that's a little off. Can you spot it?
      </p>
      <p>

        http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/apollo/apollo16/hires/as16-107-17446.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In case you didn't see it, there's a rock with a C carved into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image-of-c-rock.jpg">
        http://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image-of-c-rock.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would anyone on the moon feel the need to put a C on a random rock? Remember, their names were Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong. Do you see a C in either of those names? I don't. A lot of people think it was a prop rock that was labeled, so they'd never accidentally have the same rock visible more than once, but a set decorator forgot to make sure it was out of view of the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's much more proof that you could dig up on the Internet, but that's all I've got for now.

       You've literally pulled out 3 of the worst pieces of evidence for the moon landing hoax. Like you're offering debunkers juicy pieces of low-hanging fruit. [Edit: see Rockran's comment ITT] But although these 3 have been pretty well debunked, there is a lot more evidence that hasn't!

       There's a lot. Start with Dave McGowan's 'Wagging the MoonDoggie' though not all of it is undebunkable, most of it is.

       In regards to the youtube video, the backgrounds aren't identical. They're similar, but so is any distant background if you move 1km to the side. Just goes to show how far away the background is for a 1km difference in location to only create a small difference.

       My statement was confusing, I admit. But read it again carefully. I said most of it is undebunkable, which means most of it is not debunkable (or at least most of it has not been debunked). I disagree about your reading of that video, but that's life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Couldn't pick something special from Moondoggie. It has been quite awhile since I looked into this and was ultimately convinced that it was a hoax. However, I was surprised by the number of claims in support of the hoax that did not hold up to closer scrutiny. It had me going back and forth there for a good long while.

       Same for me, but the reverse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw too many wildly-false claims. For instance, the claim that there was no space in the lander for things like a toilet - Except they didn't use a toilet. They used plastic bags and a hose. So the author is inventing problems to point at.

       Yes, well that's the thing about debunking: if you want to debunk then you've got to debunk everything. All the debunking I've seen has, for the most part, only swiped at the low-hanging fruit. I've seen too many things that I view as smoking guns. Only one is enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree there are many wildly (and less wildly) false claims. I would not be surprised if some or all of those are put out by TPTB in order to be easily debunked so that they can say the idea is absurd and the claims have been debunked. But even if that's not the case, it doesn't mean that there is no solid evidence out there that stands up to close scrutiny.

       No, that video is not the best evidence, but I think the second overlay I mentioned is solid. It's by no means the only evidence.

       I get where you're coming from, but you also have to holistically at the entire view, including the foreground and the background points B, D, and E. They all move and change ever so slightly. Yet are we to believe that there is another point on the moon with the same nearly identical configuration of features? You can if you want. As for me, I have other things I need to attend to besides this cozy back-and-forth. Take care, dude!

       1km isn't that far. Look at your own horizon, assuming mountains, move a km and the mountains will still look the same.

       I admit this is something to investigate further. But you are pulling these numbers out of thin air, when in fact it needs further quantification. The horizon on the moon is much closer than on Earth (2.4km vs 4.66). I think if you moved 1 km away, things would actually look much different. There are many parameters to take into account here, including how high and far away those features are supposed to be. And we would need a more precise calculation of how far you'd have to move in order for the changes we see to occur. I think 1km overestimates it by a lot.

       Dude, those 2 images don't show the same thing. did you even look at them?  your C rock image looks super edited, considering the rock is in plain view in the first image, with similar shadow layouts (indicating this rocks was not moved from scene to scene, this is the same scene as evidenced by the shadow at the bottom right of the rock belonging to the object in the foreground but without any markings.

       Thats the thing i was going to say. If you compare the rocks shadows, you can see that the 'c rock' image is clearly edited.  Looking at the cross hatch marks, the rock in question is up 1 row, and to the right 1 row. you can compare the shadows of the little antenna thing and other features. the C is totally non existent.

       Because it's not there. Looks like the second pic is edited. I'd do an ELA on it but I'm mobile right now.  A better questions would be why the lunar rover blocks one of the cross hairs when the cross hairs are the final layer added to the photograph? I'm sure there's a logical reason, however.

       I didn't see it in the first picture because it literally isn't there.  Your second picture pretends to be "zoomed in" on the first picture, but it's just fake BS.  If you open both on the same screen, it's obvious that the second picture has nothing to do with the first.

       I get where you're coming from, but you also have to holistically at the entire view, including the foreground and the background points B, D, and E. They all move and change ever so slightly. Yet are we to believe that there is another point on the moon with the same nearly identical configuration of features? You can if you want. As for me, I have other things I need to attend to besides this cozy back-and-forth. Take care, dude!
