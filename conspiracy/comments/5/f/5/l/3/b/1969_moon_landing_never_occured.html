        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Back in 1969, the first ever moon landing from Earth was televised to 600 million people. Or was it? A lot of people believe that America wanted to be the first country to set foot on the moon, but lacked the proper technology. America just decided to fake the whole thing. However, there were little slip-ups that prove that it may have not have been as real as we thought it was.</p>

<p>For starters, there&#39;s no wind in outer space. If you Google &#39;moon footprints&#39; you&#39;d likely find that every footprint ever made on the moon is still there, as there isn&#39;t any wind to blow them away. So can anyone explain how the hell the flag started blowing in the nonexistent breeze when it was placed?</p>

<p>Also, everything is surrounded by pure blackness. If you&#39;re standing on the f*cking moon shouldn&#39;t you be in the middle of star central?</p>

<p>There&#39;s also this picture that&#39;s became famous for something in it that&#39;s a little off. Can you spot it?</p>

<p><a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/apollo/apollo16/hires/as16-107-17446.jpg">http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/apollo/apollo16/hires/as16-107-17446.jpg</a></p>

<p>In case you didn&#39;t see it, there&#39;s a rock with a C carved into it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image-of-c-rock.jpg">http://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/image-of-c-rock.jpg</a></p>

<p>Why would anyone on the moon feel the need to put a C on a random rock? Remember, their names were Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong. Do you see a C in either of those names? I don&#39;t. A lot of people think it was a prop rock that was labeled, so they&#39;d never accidentally have the same rock visible more than once, but a set decorator forgot to make sure it was out of view of the camera.</p>

<p>There&#39;s much more proof that you could dig up on the Internet, but that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now.</p>

<p>Peace Out,</p>

<p>Squiddy</p>

<p>Moondoggle makes a looooot of claims, got a favorite? </p>

<p>In regards to the youtube video, the backgrounds aren&#39;t identical. They&#39;re similar, but so is any distant background if you move 1km to the side. Just goes to show how far away the background is for a 1km difference in location to only create a small difference. </p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t pick something special from Moondoggie. It has been quite awhile since I looked into this and was ultimately convinced that it was a hoax.

<p>Same for me, but the reverse. </p>

<p>I saw too many wildly-false claims. For instance, the claim that there was no space in the lander for things like a toilet - Except they didn&#39;t use a toilet. They used plastic bags and a hose. So the author is inventing problems to point at. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, well that&#39;s the thing about debunking: if you want to debunk then you&#39;ve got to debunk everything. All the debunking I&#39;ve seen has, for the most part, only swiped at the low-hanging fruit. I&#39;ve seen too many things that I view as smoking guns. Only one is enough. </p>

<p>I agree there are many wildly (and less wildly) false claims. I would not be surprised if some or all of those are put out by TPTB in order to be easily debunked so that they can say the idea is absurd and the claims have been debunked. But even if that&#39;s not the case, it doesn&#39;t mean that there is no solid evidence out there that stands up to close scrutiny. </p>

<p>If they move, even a smidge, then that tells us the location has changed. </p>

<p>Entirely consistent with the claim they&#39;ve moved a km or so. </p>

<p>1km isn&#39;t that far. Look at your own horizon, assuming mountains, move a km and the mountains will still look the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I admit this is something to investigate further. But you are pulling these numbers out of thin air, when in fact it needs further quantification. The horizon on the moon is much closer than on Earth (2.4km vs 4.66). I think if you moved 1 km away, things would actually look much different. There are many parameters to take into account here, including how high and far away those features are supposed to be. And we would need a more precise calculation of how far you&#39;d have to move in order for the changes we see to occur. I think 1km overestimates it by a lot.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats the thing i was going to say. If you compare the rocks shadows, you can see that the &#39;c rock&#39; image is clearly edited.  Looking at the cross hatch marks, the rock in question is up 1 row, and to the right 1 row. you can compare the shadows of the little antenna thing and other features. the C is totally non existent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s not there. Looks like the second pic is edited. I&#39;d do an ELA on it but I&#39;m mobile right now.  A better questions would be why the lunar rover blocks one of the cross hairs when the cross hairs are the final layer added to the photograph? I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a logical reason, however. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get where you&#39;re coming from, but you also have to holistically at the entire view, including the foreground and the background points B, D, and E. They all move and change ever so slightly. Yet are we to believe that there is another point on the moon with the same nearly identical configuration of features? You can if you want. As for me, I have other things I need to attend to besides this cozy back-and-forth. Take care, dude!</p>

<p>If they move, even a smidge, then that tells us the location has changed. </p>

<p>Entirely consistent with the claim they&#39;ve moved a km or so. </p>

<p>1km isn&#39;t that far. Look at your own horizon, assuming mountains, move a km and the mountains will still look the same. </p>
