    <div class="md"><p>agree, Antarctica has always been a &#39;mystery&#39;. why can&#39;t (regular) people go there; what&#39;s the BIG secret? granted, we don&#39;t want to &#39;disturb&#39; the environment but there are too many rumors about wth is up.</p>

<p>did Admiral Bird really fly into the hollow earth? according some of the &quot;flat earthers&quot;, this is &#39;the edge&#39;. as i&#39;m not really interested in this (don&#39;t have much info to share), you should research for more info.</p>

<p>Admiral Richard E Byrd - Hollow Earth Video Interview to 12:00 (20:09)</p>

<p>(note: no one can confirm what Byrd claims as valid, always. be aware of propaganda, it&#39;s rampant)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve met one guy that went there on a tourist boat, got out, walked around, all that jazz.  as far as an individual &quot;exploring&quot; the continent i think the fact that it is one of the most inhospitable places on earth is the biggest factor.  people might try to stop you, but only for your own safety.</p>

<p>I doubt that anyone would try stop you unless you started straying to close to something like a secret military base.</p>

<p>Your biggest obstacle in the poles is the environment. Cold temperatures &amp; winds requiring expensive equipment to just survive 10 minutes outside... ice that may fall away under your feet at any moment into a crevasse a few hundred meters deep.</p>

<p>&quot;Byrd claimed that his expeditions had been the first to reach both the North Pole and the South Pole by air. However, his claim to have reached the North Pole is disputed.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Byrd">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Byrd</a></p>

<p><em>BUT</em> he did go to Antartica,</p>

<p><strong>Operation Highjump</strong></p>

<p>&quot;In 1947, Admiral Richard E. Byrd led 4,000 military troops from the U.S., Britain and Australia in an invasion of Antarctica [Operation Highjump and follow-up], but encountered heavy resistance from Nazi &quot;flying saucers&quot; and had to call off the invasion.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always been in the &quot;aliens started religions&quot; camp myself. </p>

<p>Taking the Christian bible for example -- I&#39;m perfectly aware that it&#39;s entirely possible some guy or multiple guys wrote it all down for shits and giggles. Maybe they were just an ancient version of 4chan.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;ve always had a nagging suspicion that part of the reason it&#39;s been followed and worshipped for so long and with such passion is because a bunch of people actually <em>saw something.</em></p>

<p>I know that people witnessing very advanced technology could view it as magic or &quot;miracles&quot; and would likely, at that stage of human development, view the beings with this technology as gods, angels or even demons.</p>

<p>Plus, a lot of descriptions of things that happened during that time as well as artwork portraying those events, angels, etc seems exactly how I&#39;d expect people back then to view ufos or aliens. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just one of those things that, if I found out it was aliens those people were seeing, I&#39;d totally not be surprised. It&#39;d make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, exactly.</p>

<p>While most people don&#39;t need the threat of eternal damnation in order to be a good person, if it turns out religion is a sham, there&#39;d be a lot more tolerance and a lot less fear and shame.</p>

<p>For example, there&#39;s probably a ton of people who would be able to embrace their sexuality if they knew God wasn&#39;t judging them. More people would be tolerant of LGBT people in general too, since there&#39;d be no holy text telling them it&#39;s wrong.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s not even mentioning all of the ridiculous religious wars. I&#39;m sure there&#39;d still be wars, but probably not over anything as idiotic and pointless as whose god/religion is the real one.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be so much easier for people to unite and enjoy themselves if everyone realized there is no God who knows everything you think and do and is constantly judging you for it. And since it seems like we&#39;re all being purposely divided and told to hate each other, they&#39;d never let us know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you all remember when all the politicians and the like went to Africa for Mandela&#39;s funeral...?   There was a theory at the time that many were purchasing property during their visit...  We all know it wasn&#39;t in reverence to the deceased leader.  With the Obama selfies at the funeral and the fake/laughable &quot;signer for the deaf&quot;.  There was some other reason all those people made that trip....  on a personal note I have always been perplexed on what role the Voortrekker Monument played into the &quot;conspiracy&quot;.  If you get the chance look it up there is strangeness galore associated with this monument and I believe human sacrifice...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They went to buy green certificates (CO2 rights) for their yachts, and private jets.</p>

<p>The idea is simple. You give an African banker cash money and in return he&#39;ll give you some xeroxes stating that you are allowed to exhaust X amounts of CO2. This really benefits the planet and you and me. This is the only way we can actually reverse the climate, you should believe this without questioning because there are many experts who are actually being paid to talk to us about this BS.</p>

<p>First I thought the sun was responsible for warm days and so on but I now see I was wrong all along. Now that I know that the African banker is the de facto climate oracle I rest my case of being a man made climate change (CO2 only) denier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The intense struggle at the top of the world’s power structure will not end on November 8th no matter who wins the so-called US Presidential election, US agency sources say. However, there is strong likelihood the issue will be settled by January 20th, 2017 when the new President is supposed to formally assume the reins of power, they say.
At the highest level, the battle is between the 13 bloodline families who have ruled the West for centuries, if not millennia and their age old opponents, the gnostic illuminati who are opposed to bloodline rule.
The people behind Hillary Clinton are the bloodlines, who report ultimately to Baron Evelyn de Rothschild as well as to the old Italian aristocracy behind the P2 Freemason lodge. This can be confirmed by endorsements from bloodline controlled media such as the Economist Magazine owned by the Rothschilds and the P2 Agnelli brothers. It can also be confirmed by wikileaks e-mails showing Hillary Clinton is intimately subservient to Lynn Forest de Rothschild, who is the wife of Baron Rothschild.
The main source of the bloodlines’ power is their control of the process for creating and distributing money, ie their ownership of most of the world’s central banks. They have used this money power to bribe, blackmail and assassinate people at the top levels of power in order to ensure their control. They also control the corporate media and have been using every propaganda tool in their hands to create the appearance that Hillary Clinton will win a close race against Donald Trump. You can also confirm this by holding your nose and watching election coverage on CNN also known as the Clinton News Network.
The people behind Donald Trump include the gnostic illuminati, who recruit geniuses of each age who are not part of the ruling bloodlines, sources in the illuminati say. The illuminati favour meritocracy and, since the world’s government agencies and military are meritocratic, it means they control most of the people with guns with the exception of a few mercenaries on the bloodline payrolls.
Direct reporting from a White Dragon Society member in the US also reveals overwhelming support for Donald Trump at the street level. Here is his report:
“I went to a Hillary ‘rally’ two weeks ago…there might have been 1500 people tops. On Friday night I went to a Trump rally in Hershey PA. It filled up a hockey arena, at least 15,000, plus 7000 outside…Trump is turning rednecks into peaceniks. Hillary is turning dovish liberals into warmongering self-loathing retards.”
This is what Pentagon sources had to say about the US Presidential election:
“The election will be allowed to proceed to not spook the public so vote fraud and other crimes will be exposed. Immediately thereafter the Republic will be announced, Hillary and cabal arrested, and corrupt agencies like FRB, DOJ, FBI, IRS, DHS and CIA abolished or reformed.”
The agencies have being doing their bit by using the internet to pump out a flood of information about pedophilia, corruption, human sacrifice and other outrages perpetrated by the bloodlines. Click on the links below to see examples of this.

The bloodline families are now in a state of absolute terror, literally fighting for their lives, fleeing to Antarctic bases and trying to pull off something horrific. This writer was accused by many trolls of “smoking something,” when he started writing recently that many members of the elite were fleeing to Antarctic Bases. Well now you can confirm on the official US State Department website that US Secretary of State John “Skull &amp; Bones,” Kerry will be flying to Antarctica on November 8th election day.
<a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2016/11/264091.htm">http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2016/11/264091.htm</a>
The corporate media whores at the press briefing were told Kerry was going there to study “climate change,” however sources in the CIA say the real reason Kerry is flying to the South Pole is
to attend a secret meeting of top bloodline power brokers to plot civil war. Here is a direct quote about the matter from a senior CIA source in Washington DC:
“These assholes WANT civil war. Why else would JK be out of the country. Climate change my ass – He is meeting the elite boys in Antarctica for instructions.”
Here is what a CIA source in Asia had to say about this:
“I was called last night on a secure line. My contact in…wanted to let me know that his team was leaving to Antarctica for a very important meeting with several heads of State and senior diplomats from various countries and would be out of touch for about week. He is going as an observer on behalf of… This is all kept on a need to know basis. No media on this one. He told me that they were going to ‘The Special Off the Grid Base.’ Several countries have their permanently stationed representatives at this Above Top Secret Installation.”
The main topic of discussion is likely to be the imminent ratification of the Paris accords which would mean a transition of the world’s financial system away from bloodline control. The negotiations that begin on November 7th (as this newsletter goes online) in Morocco are supposed to ratify these agreements.
Pentagon sources, for their part, are saying “The counter-coup against Hillary has gone kinetic with spacecraft flying cabal members seeking to escape justice shot down, underground bases in Italy destroyed by quakes, while a skirmish in Antarctica caused Kerry to visit. 
The illuminati are saying the bloodlines have a submarine in Guam that is going to be used to fire a nuclear missile at Tokyo in an attempt to blame the attack on the illuminati. The bloodlines may also try to stage a fake alien invasion or else use an EMP attack on the US power grid to stave off a change in government, CIA sources say.
The bloodlines are also trying to buy their way out of trouble. That is why Evelyn de Rothschild has been trying to create $41 trillion based on forged gold backed certificates, as reported previously by this writer and by Neil Keenan. In fact, last week a Rothschild agent approached the White Dragon Foundation and offered them whatever amount of money they wanted to start up their proposed meritocratically staffed future planning agency.
However, if the WDF (Part of the WDS) accepted this funding, it would mean acknowledging the Rothschilds and the bloodlines would retain their god-like power to create money out of nothing and thus their control over this planet and its inhabitants. The WDS believes any new financial system needs to be based on reality (and thus the creator) and not on fraud. It further believes the process of creating and distributing money should be a transparently run public service and not a private monopoly.
Pentagon sources agree saying “The Paris agreement entered into force globally on November 4th which means the cabal must be terminated right after election so the Global Currency Reset can proceed to benefit all of humanity.”
They add that although the “FBI punted on the e-mails Hillary is still on the hook for pedophilia, Clinton Foundation pay for play, obstruction of justice, racketeering and IRS violations.” Not to mention mass murder in Fukushima, Iraq, Haiti and elsewhere. NSA and CIA sources say Bill Clinton now has full blown AIDS and may not live long enough to face justice.
In Japan, meanwhile, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Shinzo Abe slave regime are “waving the white flag of surrender,” royal family sources say. Michael Greenberg, the head Rothschild agent in Japan, is now in custody at the Yokota airbase in Japan, the sources say.
In South Korea, cabal stooge President Park Gyeun-hye’s government is being rocked by exposure it was de facto run by a religious cult. This information has caused Park’s support rate to fall to 5% and sent hundreds of thousands of protesters on to the streets to demand her resignation.
<a href="http://mashable.com/2016/11/06/south-korea-protest-park-geun-hye/#xTNZFPmQouqt">http://mashable.com/2016/11/06/south-korea-protest-park-geun-hye/#xTNZFPmQouqt</a>
Meanwhile, NSA sources reveal Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is a drug dealer who works for the Ayala and Tan crime syndicates and that his so-called war on drugs is just an excuse to murder the competition so that his gang can monopolize the drug trade in the Philippines.
In China, for its part, sources in the military and intelligence community say while President Xi Jinping has secured support at the very top of the ruling communist party, a weak economy means he has little rank and file backing. His crackdown on corruption too, although popular at first, is now seen as an attack on rivals, they add.
There are also signs that increasing numbers of people in the Russian government are beginning to realize President Vladimir Putin is not real. This can be seen in the fact that Russian diplomats use an ET emoji in their communications to describe Putin.
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3908668/Vladimir-Putin-alien-Diplomats-use-grey-ET-emoji-Russian-leader-private-WhatsApp-chats.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3908668/Vladimir-Putin-alien-Diplomats-use-grey-ET-emoji-Russian-leader-private-WhatsApp-chats.html</a>
“[US President Barack] Obama, Xi Jinping and Putin are all freaking out because their entire power structure is crumbling around them,” was how a senior illuminati member described the situation.
In these circumstances, it is worth noting there will be a “once in 70- year super moon,” November 14th. It should be an interesting week.

<p>Now, I don&#39;t know a ton about occult practices, but I do know that the timing of moon phases and rare astrological phenomenon definitely play a part in rituals and masses.

    <div class="md"><p>It is a little strange how off limits Antarctica and the South Pole are to most people. You can&#39;t just go there and explore where you want, no matter how well prepared you are.
Just as strange is how off limits little Beauchene Island in the Falklands is to visitors and how it is blurred out on Google Earth.<br/>
When Flash Earth was still available I was able to look at some pretty weird looking &quot;formations&quot; on the southeastern part of that island.<br/>
The whole Falklands War itself has some odd anomalies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well from research, sources say there is an opening to some inner chambers within the earth (has to do with south pole and north pole). Much like an inner earth but not quite, it&#39;s more of a honeycomb. And &quot;supposedly&quot; there are bases located within those chambers that have to do with &quot;aliens&quot;. There is a reason to why there is a no fly zone over the poles; there&#39;s also a reason to why there are basically no pictures available of what it looks like over Antarctica from space.  </p>

<p>Given the players, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it has something to do with ET contact. Kerry is Secretary of State - foreign state relations. The Pope and Kirill - world religious leaders. Aldrin...maybe he made first contact on the moon?</p>

<p>Antartica is literally a no man&#39;s land...actually a &quot;no humans&quot; land, so it makes sense as a sort of planetary neutral meeting ground. It&#39;s also extremely isolated.</p>

<p>Weird. Interesting read.</p>

<p>I tried googling the &quot;ark of gabriel&quot; but didn&#39;t get many hits other than sites like that one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious if they (not the writer for this article, but whoever first put that info out there) aren&#39;t actually talking about the Ark of the covenant instead.</p>

<p>I did a little googling on that too, since I don&#39;t personally know a lot of details about it or its significance. Both arks seem very similar even though the author of this article says it&#39;s not to be confused with the Ark of the covenant. </p>

<p>On its wiki page, it says there has been some speculation that the Ark of the covenant is hidden in Saudi Arabia, which is where this &quot;ark of gabriel&quot; was.</p>

<p>Both are said it will be found close to the &quot;end of days.&quot;</p>

<p>The article says the Ark of gabriel is some sort of ancient weapon. From what Wikipedia is saying the Ark of the covenant with some priests collapsed the walls of Jericho, thus could be a &quot;weapon.&quot;</p>

<p>The Ark of the covenant apparently contains the stone tablets with the 10 commandments, while the Ark of gabriel contains &quot;instructions&quot; to Muhammad.</p>

<p>As for Buzz Aldrin being there though, maybe the Ark of the covenant is some sort of alien technology. I mean, the thing did have to have a veil over it at all times.</p>

<p>I&#39;m personally not religious, so I&#39;d probably believe alien technology over the actual religious interpretation, but it&#39;s an interesting idea for why all of these people have been going down there anyway.</p>

I think they are in the modteam because they want to impose a pro-FSA/Zionist vieuw on reddit so that they can overthrow the legitimate Syrian goverment and start installing their Wahabi Nusra al quida friends for a world goverment.</p>
