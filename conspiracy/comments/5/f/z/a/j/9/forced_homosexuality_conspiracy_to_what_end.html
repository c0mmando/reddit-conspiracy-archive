       First rule of this sub is: No bigoted slurs, so I am not going to present my own opinions (as I am against the idea of homosexuality and no matter how civilized, argumented and empirical I present my stance, I always seem to appear bigot/hitler/facist/homophobe, which is a debate for another time, cause of differences in opinions in liberal and conservative thought) but just pure facts. So I would like all of you to read, and share your opinions, cause I would like to better understand the endgame of it all
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Psychiatry, Psychology, APA and Homosexuality
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       According to the American Psychiatric Association, until 1974 homosexuality was a mental illness, type: Urge disorder. Note that it was the same category as Pedophilia and Zoophilia (presumption of urge disorder being sexual arousement towards seemingly unnatural/unprodictive relationship) homosexuality was listed as a mental illness in DSM (The DSM – Diagnostic and Statistical Manual – is the APA’s standard classification of mental disorders)
      </p>
      <p>
       There was NO FUCKIN REASON to conceptualize homosexuality as anything else then mental disorder, until Gays from San Francisco in 1970 made a big fuss about all that and again in 1971, and again in 1973 when APA became uncomfortable with all that. Forced by a large group of people (remember 70's and rioting against every god damn shit, and how you had to make amends with people ? ) APA suggested that Homosexuality should be declared normal - but there is a body of people (all US psychiatrists) who need to vote - and vote was severely influenced by media and gay groups. So in the 7th edition of DSM all of a sudden (fuck the 1000 years of human science of psychology and psychiatry) removed homosexual behavior from mental illness
      </p>
      <p>
       WHAT IS IMPORTANT - this is one of FEW instances in all of worlds history that a scientific theory and practice was not triggered by a scientific breakthrough, but rather to please a group of people. There was no new fact or set of facts that stimulated this major change. Rather, it was the simple reality that gay people started to kick up a fuss.
      </p>
      <p>
       APA issued a statement saying that "homosexuals seem happy so it may not be a mental disorder &gt; besides that that statement was a disgrace for any scientific body, should we now also need research to confirm that heterosexual people are happy with their orientation? What the fuck is with that, seriously ? Being happy is now "all clear" from any kind of mental illness ? Arent those with Sadistic disorders extremely happy when inflicting pain on others ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Being pressed to vote "YES" for clearing gays, those who did, should be noteworthy, were ONLY in 55% majority
      </p>
      <p>
       So all the people who had this terrible “illness” were “cured” overnight – by a vote! Nothing like Nations World Health Organization’s decision to eradicate smallpox. This was in 1967, and by 1977, after a truly staggering amount of work and effort, the disease was a thing of the past. Why didn’t they just take a vote? Because smallpox is a real illness, just as homosexuality was (again, fuck 1000 years of psychology and psychiatry in particular)
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Science to defend now "normal" homosexuals
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Then, lets fuck up OTHER REAL SCIENCES for the sake of gay people who are now really strong voice heard all over the planet:
Someone (real geneticists are really ashamed of such claims) found that there is a "Gay DNA", dubious and soon viral article with no actual traceable source &lt; article being all over the place, yet there is not a single published work to support that claim. Yet, it has become so powerful argument that people now write: homophobes dont understand that gay are born that way (take note that "homophobe" is a word used to describe anyone, may that even be Gandhi or Mother Theresa, should they accidentally say anything against homosexuals)
      </p>
      <p>
       first of all - there is literally no proof that we as a civilization understand even the 1% of the behavioral DNA. We currently understand only the outlines of behavioral DNA studying only how environmental influence defined certain species behaviors, the actual DNA research into behavior is literally at least 50 years in the future
      </p>
      <p>
       second - if there is a gay DNA, motherfuckin nature would remove that with surgical precision just due to the fact that gay people - can not multiply. From an evolutionary perspective, genetically determined homosexuality would have become extinct long ago because of reduced reproduction.
      </p>
      <p>
       third - but hey, lets fuck up the theory of evolution: maybe this and maybe that influenced the gay DNA to survive &gt;&gt; equals to an idea that a rose without thorns (thorns made possible for roses to survive critters eating them) somehow survived 3 million years and is alive and well now, as a species.
      </p>
      <p>
       When that theory took a bad turn, specially with 2 separate Scandinavian scientist groups proving that any genetics effect on sexuality is minor at best, due to identical twins research (one sister being lesbian and other straight, both severely resenting sexual preferences of another), they now envisioned an "Endocrine disorder theory" (fuck the DNA theory from before, doesnt work and this new theory cancels it out)
      </p>
      <p>
       Endocrine disorder - because your hormones didnt work as a baby growing up, you became butch girl or feminine gay, and that is ok, cause it's a variety of nature
      </p>
      <p>
       now, go into medical science and find ONLY FUCKIN ONE instance where endocrine disorder is not considered illness ? Let's say for example that you have a Thyroid gland disorder - metabolism really fucked up, you are about to die. You go over to the doctor and he tells you: "Oh, go home, you are OK, it's just a human nature variety" &gt; fucking NO! for fucked up hormones, you need serious medical help. If that homosexual agenda theory is what they are holding on today, then they are in a much more serious problem than just mental issues
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Criticism immunity
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Here things become really weird. From mid 90's in the western countries, and early 2000's in the rest of the "liberal democratic" world,
      </p>
      <p>
       Advocates of the homosexual agenda seek special rights for homosexuals that other people don't have, such as immunity from criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the fact still in mind that it was actual mental illness 40 years ago, and that Psychiatry is not a science depending exclusively on technology (was already highly developed as a science before 1970s) , today's stance about homosexuality is really contrasted towards works of such names as Freud (homosexuality is a result of depression and paranoia), Jung (sexual abomination and rebellious behavior), Jaspers (sexual perversion activated by trauma via  fetichism, exhibitionism)
      </p>
      <p>
       Criticism immunity has  succeeded today so that anyone opposed to ACTUAL changes happening is automatically evil, being called "bigot" and "homophobe", both words presenting opposite side as something base-evil
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who actually oppose, are against following things:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        legalization of Gay marriages and adoption
       </li>
       <li>
        promotion of pride parades and financing them
       </li>
       <li>
        changing of heterosexual behavior to support homosexual (a
        <strong>
         child
        </strong>
        in EU is forbidden to say "mom and dad", and must say "Parents", and several ridiculous other "laws")
       </li>
       <li>
        demand public funding to address homosexual issues (that Hetero do not enjoy)
       </li>
       <li>
        banning of confused children to correct their homosexual issues
       </li>
       <li>
        immunity from insulting religious groups
       </li>
       <li>
        branding any kind of philosophical, social or scientific word against homosexuality as a "hate speech"
       </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <strong>
         The REAL problems of homosexuals
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       the following facts are gathered from articles published by mostly gay groups, gay supporting groups and prominent gay websites:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        higher suicide/suicide attempts
       </li>
       <li>
        higher promiscuity
       </li>
       <li>
        higher substance usage
       </li>
       <li>
        severely higher bipolar disorder
       </li>
       <li>
        higher anxiety issues
       </li>
       <li>
        physical health issues due to promiscuity in youth
       </li>
       <li>
        higher alcohol usage
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Again, "blame it on someone else" method is used to describe these findings and actual response from gay communities is that all of this is caused by OTHERS homophobia and intolerance
      </p>
      <p>
       Any psychiatrist would address those conditions in the individual and not searching for outside cause, but hey, im quoting a woman from my country who is one of the best Europe's psychiatrists with 3 doctoral degrees, and highly valued member of EPA (European Psychiatric Association) :
      </p>
      <p>
       "I cant do that, I cant even try to cure them by "homosexuality is an issue" approach as I would lose all my 3 degrees tomorrow morning"
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Conclusion
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I am pretty sure, taking all of these facts into account that Homosexuality agenda is a conspiracy. My own experience tells me that many of those people are confused and ACTUALLY NEED HELP, but someone from USA/EU decided they dont need help, but rather recognition, rights, and compulsory homosexuality movement. To what end ? Isnt the Homosexuality movement the actual reason why there are obese people today promoting obesity abd are proud of it ? Why even radical Muslim figured out how "human-righty" world has become so they are now asking for "Sharia for Belgium" .. ? What would be the actual difference to recognize a Pedophile as "born that way and not mentally ill ?" consent ? An Iranian refugee has recently raped a 14  yr boy in Germany and was cleared of charges cause he didnt understand what NO means, cause he doesnt speak the language .. So, "human rights" country like Germany cleared him cause it's his RIGHT to rape (dick in ass rape) 14 yrs boy ? Apart from consent, what is the difference ? Animals also, couldnt a Zoophiliac tell that he is "born that way" and its his urge and his right to rape a goat ?
      </p>
      <p>
       What does opening such a Pandora's Box achieve, and what is the endgame ?

       Well you have multiple topics mixed together, it seems, so it's difficult to give a response that covers them all at once, since I perceive the different topics in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think "disorder" and "illness" should refer to conditions that cause suffering and/or an inability to function in life. I think most can agree that homosexuality is an abnormality, but it also doesn't inherently cause the person to suffer, doesn't cause the people around said-person to suffer, and doesn't cause an inability for the person to function. There is also no delusion, cognitive dissonance, thought disorder, etc involved, and so on. Which makes it a non-issue, unless the person feels that their homosexuality was caused by some sort of trauma, in which case the person is suffering and should seek out therapeutic treatment to resolve any unresolved trauma they might have. But in that case, the trauma itself is the underlying, actual problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it's impossible to conclude whether higher rates of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, etc are symptoms of the abnormality that causes homosexuality, or if they are the effects of living in a society that can be very harsh towards people who are homosexual. So this topic becomes a clash of perceptions without the ability to prove/disprove one way or the other. So there isn't much point in focusing on it, since the debates could never lead anywhere conclusive or productive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then as a final topic, I do think that government/political powers have been taking advantage of the homosexual community, as far as using them as political pawns to further an irrelevant agenda. Mainly by using shaming and virtue-signaling in an attempt to snuff out critical thinking and free speech. Obviously this is detrimental to society. However, the culprit is not homosexual people, themselves, but rather the puppet masters pulling people's strings. Most people are very vulnerable to being manipulated, homosexual people are no different in this regard. The manipulators deserve our ire, not their manipulated targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if people did apply critical thought to the topic, then again it is as straightforward as I explained above. Pedophiles who act on their urges hurt children, for example. It is not a matter of no harm to self, no harm to others and no loss of ability to function, because the
       <em>
        harming others
       </em>
       factor is involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Applying even more critical thought, since homosexuals are to be considered equals along with everyone else, that means equal responsibility and equal application of the law, not special protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes obviously there is an agenda at work, but remember that it comes from the puppet masters in all levels of government, not from the clueless puppets, themselves.

       I agree with you completely, I am just mad at the result - being the people who are prone to accept that kind of behavior cause "puppet masters" served the story so nicely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole problem was my own personal experience of watching someone really close getting sucked into it. The people involved in that story (total of 7-8 lesbians) are all exclusively immoral selfish people. That girl became a sex-toy for satisfying someones sexual perversions, to the point of her actually feeling attachment to 2 consecutive girls literally abusing her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once my moral compass broke, I hacked both girls emails (accessing FB and cloning their IM's) , and tried to show my girl of interest what they are doing to her: cheating, calling her a "monkey on a leash", sharing her private porn images to one another, both of them constantly searching for male partner (even though they are very vocal about their lesbianism), all of them (7 girls involved) being with every one of them at certain point, one of them hiding the Hep C with more than real chance that they all got it by now, trophy gossip (I fucked this girl, I fucked that girl) without a single world of love and affection between any of them - even my very bad deed (which I am really ashamed of, dont judge please) didnt help her get out of that. side-effects of severe depression of living such life had finally taken it's toll and she is literally destroyed. Escaped her parents home, living like a bum, becoming alcoholic, abandoning university. And she had the potential to be someone really unique and beautiful

       Bad personal experience is an anecdotal argument, which could be further explored by a similar pattern. None of the facts written in the opening statement were a personal experience, but rather solid research into the topic, done by me. My personal experience was just a trigger to realize how all of that doesnt appear all "rainbowy" as presented in the media. Especially with young people.

       Solid research? I guess our definition of that term may vary quite a bit.
Saying that kids in the EU aren´t "allowed" to use the words mom and dad anymore, being forced to replace that with a "genderneutral" term is just outright bogus and made up by you. Such a law exists nowhere in the EU. So much for the "solid research"...
      </p>
      <p>
       I´d take your opinion more seriously if you managed to stick to proveable facts, not some BS you read "somewhere in the internet"...you´re basically sabotaging your own arguments by using these "facts".

       Such thing as "parents" instead of "mom and dad" is not an actual law, but suggested heavily and already implemented in EU nations (a kid from my country is going into italian school where kids are already corrected when saying "mom and dad" instead of "Parent"

       you can trace all the relevant data from this link to see if my words hold the truth. Even if it's not legalized, intention to behave in such manner and insisting on it is just as same, literal proof of neo-liberalism taking over and censoring any behavior not aligned with theirs.

       See, that link of yours is exactly what I meant. You´re mistaking an opinion published by a site that is obviously leaning to the right/conservative/negative bias side and mistake anything you read for the truth. A classical echo chamber scenario....you only read what suits your own mind and prejudices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your original statement tried to tell us that this "parents/mom and dad" thing is a LAW, now you´re backpedaling right after you provided us with some random link and not the link to some European state´s law books with a paragraph explicitly saying that calling mom and dad mom and dad is punishable under the law.
Exactly that kind of reality bending is what will fuck up our world.
      </p>
      <p>
       To escape filter bubbles, here´s what I propose:
Make it a habit to study an opinion, an author or a point of view you totally and completely disagree with. Under all circumstances, refrain from drawing quick conclusions and dismissing the other reality tunnel offered by the first disagreement you run into. And don´t "search" for things confirming your point of view, just work through it with an open mind...you can draw your conclusions afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should also get rid of that tin foil hat. There´s no "conspiracy", no secret gay group trying to turn the planet into a giant dark room. Learn the usage of the word "sombunall" (some, but not all"). Let´s see where this little word will lead us:
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of the fearmongering "Gays try to homosexualize the entire world", "sombunall homosexuals overdo it with pushing their agenda into society" still accurately describes the situation, but will not build up the angst ridden scenario that obviously is your agenda.
Another thing to mention: groups are fiction. Only persons are real. There is no "THE gays", "THE neo-liberals", "THE whatever"....the only thing there is are persons...individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       To abbreviate it, here´s my recommendation for you: study Robert Anton Wilson´s books. "Cosmic trigger" is a good start for you, I believe.Read it and try to learn something from it...
      </p>
      <p>
       Again: I, too, am criticising homosexuality, but there´s one wee thing that you do what I don´t...I don´t live in the illusion that I hold the absolute truth. Nobody knows everything, nobody can know everything. As Wilson has written: "Convictions cause convicts". Once you´re buying your own shit too much, you have fallen into a trap you cannot escape from without a maximum of effort. I do, for example, criticise the transgender thing and wonder why there still are large suicidal tendencies among those with a sex change surgery, although these transpeople should be in perfect unison after that; to me, it seems that the issues of such people lay deeper and the surgery only cures the symptoms of that and don´t solve the actual issue. I don´t go digging up obscure websites confirming my prejudices, no, quite the opposite, I confront myself intentionally with opinions located on the diametral side of the spectrum because I actually want to know what the fuck is going on in our society, on this planet. I don´t expect a certain outcome of my research, I suck up all relevant articles from BOTH sides and try to make sense out of that bulk of opposing data. Just like a scientist doing an experiment, I am open for ANY result, even if this result opposes my own reality tunnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most easy thing to do is identifying a bias in others, but the hardest thing to do is identifying your own bias. Remember: "Convictions cause convicts" ..."He who understands too quick understands nothing". Please, get out of your filter bubble. I´ve no problem discussing homosexuality and how it has changed our society since it became tolerable/acceptable. But please don´t undermine every legit criticism by using these vile alt right tactics. Keep it real, scientific and based on hard facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S.: You definitely will like R.A. Wilson as he uses the same strategy as you...intentionally mixing actual facts with completely made up bogus bullshit. But Wilson did this to teach his readers his credo of "Think for yourself, fool!", not using it for the opposite as you...

       Again, something forced by society has as much as the same impact as an actual law. No one would arrest you for jacking it off under your jacket, but is still socially unacceptable, and it would be frowned upon, marking such deed as something awful and putting your choice to do that at shame.
      </p>

       Im in a bit of a fuss at the moment so I would make a short reply, I urge you to look into Psychologism in Sociology - much more important people than us redditors discussed this topic. Validity of Psychologism observed through sociology. One could really argue that individuals are building blocks of social occurrences, but there are those like Durkheim who wanted to explain social events via something he envisioned as a "social consciousness", as a whole, not via individual consciousness. Take a short read about that topic (weirdly enough, english wiki article on that topic is really poor) if it will change your mind about individuals in sociology

       To me the issue is that it should never have been made a thing to be "straight".  Normal should be default and standard.  To introduce a new normal implying that the choice to be straight or gay is somehow a totally innocuous choice that we can just arbitrarily choose violates some very fundamental ethical principles.  For instance, if all members of society were to choose to be gay, the end result would not be desirable.  We would likely have serious issues with reproduction.  This fundamental biological reality cannot be overlooked and certainly isn't something that society should dismiss without a lot more public debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have basically done is introduce something like religious freedom but then mandate that we teach every religion to the kids as if they are all equal.  That fundamentally violates the principles of virtually every religion.  So this situation was not tenable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely disagree with the concept of imposing normative social behavior through the medical community so I'm just not even going to go there and address that.  But there is a reason that the LGBT agenda has hit a wall and they are going to have to turn on their senses of empathy that are so over-developed and understand that.

       I'm actually talking about the choice of embracing your urges or denying them.  We all have urges to do lots of things that we don't act on every day.  I realize that attraction is rarely a choice, but the act of teaching the next generation that it doesn't matter who our sexual partners are seems a) to possibly be a subversive attempt at population control or b) lack any understanding of how impressionable children are.  Telling someone that the choice of sexual partners has no consequences seems to be a bit far fetched.

       What consequences does that have? For centuries homosexuality has been persecuted in the West and yet homosexuals have still existed. Meanwhile, in more historically accenting societies like pre-Western influenced China homosexuality never stopped to be a minority. Telling children that homosexuality has no consequences is only meant to reduce bullying and intolerance. Besides, you may choose your partners but you can't choose your preferences. If you are gay you can't just choose to be with someone of the opposite sex without forcing yourself and causing yourself psychological problems.

       Yeah I very specifically have an issue with what I believe is an impressionable socialization period in a child's life.   I do not feel that teaching the child that there are no consequences is a fair way to treat the child.  I mean what you have just said by itself is a huge issue for gay people, let alone the fact that as a parent and human I want my genes to be passed on into the future.   So at a basic level we are to impress upon small children info about something that is misleading according to current environment?  You just got a bunch of people to barely accept gay marriage and you saw the resistance to that and now you think you are going to get them to accept teaching their kids that there is nothing wrong with being gay.  I mean in a lot of cases religions specifically forbid it.  It's a HUGE uphill battle that resulted in galvanizing support for its opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another consequence of all this is that you are having sexual conversations with kids that are much younger than I was when I had talked about it.  In TV shows that never really spoke about this type of thing before, we are seeing explicit conversations that far more blatantly discuss sex because well the details here lead to questions for kids now.  I have a lot of compassion and for the gay people that want to just be accepted by everyone.  But I also have empathy for those that are concerned for the effects that changing sexual socialization might have on our children and families.

       I get what you mean. I don't think talking about sex with children is the tight thing to do. We should limit ourselves to tell children that it's ok if a boy likes other boy or a girl likes other girl and that the rest shouldn't treat them like if they were different.

       All that you said is true AND let me add this: all the arguments that a gay can use to defend homosexuality can also be used by a pedophile or a zoophile.

       That's an excellent question, but perhaps not in the rhetorical way you intended it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also interesting that you brought up consent, since that is one of the main reasons that arguments in defense of homosexuality do not apply to pedophilia and zoophilia.

       Well, applying the consent argument on animals is hypocryte, because we do not have their consent to kill them when we want to eat either, plus i am sure you have already seen videos of dogs trying to "fuck" someone's leg because they are horny, so what if someone fucks with his dog when his dog is in that stage, he in a way has the consent of the animal no? 2nd thing, i do not want to sound weird, but, according to science AND nature itself, it isnt pedophilia if the child has started its puberty (sperm production for boys around 10 years old) and menstruations for girls (around 9) i know it sounds creepy but menstruations mean she is ready to have children. Why do you think girls were getting married at such a low age until late 1700's.

       I pretty much agree. So if you want to be consistent, you have to either decide between "prohibit killing animals" or "allow sex with animals". Which way you want to go on that is up to you. I think we should prohibit both, but I think it will take a long time to get there. But yes, we're in agreement that it is crazy hypocritical to say "oh sure, you can slaughter animals and eat their flesh, but fucking them is
       <em>
        a bridge too far
       </em>
       ".

      <p>
       Sort of, but not really. I don't want to get too far into the zoophilia part of this argument, since I think we both agree that it shouldn't be allowed. But the long and short of it is that animals don't have the language and understanding necessary to give consent, and humans are generally not able to tell with any degree of certainty whether or not an animal is consenting.

       One more note: if a

       is dancing and grinding with you, that is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the same as consent. It is not the same thing as permission to grope them or fuck them.

      <p>
       You're right that precision of terms is important. We can talk about statutory rape instead of pedophilia if you want. The arguments about consent and power dynamics are pretty much the same though.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is that even very young children are developing sexually. We like to think of them as asexual, but that's actually not the case. This is most obvious with teenagers, but it's true even of much younger children. But this does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       mean that it is OK to have sexual contact with them. There are a lot of reasons for this, although we could put them all under the umbrella of "it causes a lot of psychological harm, and it's our job as adults to protect children from psychological harm". If we want to get more specific, we can talk, as I said, about consent and power dynamics.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is often simplified to "children are unable to give consent", and while that's a useful shorthand, I think it causes some problems because it opens the door for arguments like "Oh, but she's a really
       <em>
        mature
       </em>
       14-year-old". Those arguments are bullshit, but I can see how someone might think they're reasonable given the "children are unable to consent" argument combined with the fact that psychological development is not uniform amongst kids. This is why looking at power dynamics, the craving that children have for adult approval, and their desire to be "grown up" can be more useful. Those are (some of the) reasons that a child may endure abuse and
       <em>
        appear
       </em>
       to consent, even though they're experiencing trauma. And they're some of the major reasons that it's important to prohibit adult/child sexual contact.

       Okay, I'm going to answer this as best I can, no insults, though I feel you will dismiss anything I say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will just say that scientific declarations have often been founded on pandering since ancient days. Eugenics was because racists wanted a reason to be racist. And loads of other malarkey throughout time. Science is done by people and people will skew results for their own end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also: You act like wide acceptance of homosexuality is a new thing. During Samurai Japan; people debated hotly whether loving a man or a woman was better, and felt loving women made you more feminine. It was genuinely weird not to have ever had a same sex lover.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ancient Greeks; the so called fathers of scientific thought trumpeted same sex preferences, as did the Persians and even the Middle East had several famous gay men.
      </p>
      <p>
       In medieval America; people who would be labeled Trans today were common as was homosexual practice in many tribes/cultures from the Aztecs to the Algonquin
      </p>
      <p>
       There are several Myths all over the world of Men turning into women and Vice Versa that they are too many to count. Along with myths of homosexual gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this has been around for a long time and rather like race; fluctuates a lot in acceptance or not. We went through a long period in this culture of not accepting it. Now we do. So things change. Very likely in a few hundred years things will switch again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you get to the science aspect. There are animals that only engage in same sex coupling across the board. Even in monogamous or mate for life species. Some of this can be called aggressive domination, but that doesn't explain say, Duds which are rams that only mate with other male rams. Or Swans that will deliberately trick a female swan so they can raise children together. Fact is homosexuality is part of nature. We don't know why; but it is and exists in most animals on the planet. It may be a failsafe that those with unsuitable genes won't mate, a way to prevent overpopulation, it could be like some species and allow bisexuals to attract more of the opposite sex; it could be a mutation like heterochromatic eyes, but it exists in enormous amounts in the natural world.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also seem to have a misunderstanding of Evolution having a sort of divine will. Sometimes evolution actually leads to a species downfall and doesn't necessarily produce something better. This is a common misunderstanding outside actual scientific study, but I highly suggest you read up on it, as it is fascinating stuff and can put an end to much of the pseudoscience we tend to assign to evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The basics: homosexuality itself does not harm either party unless other issues exist. Something that must exist to be a mental illness. None of the issues mentioned are universally part of homosexuality and differ a great deal on the individual. Ergo not mental illness.  Does Homosexual behavior make one more susceptible to these issues? That is a different case entirely. But so does being poor; and last I checked, being poor is not a mental illness.

       Yea, everything in society trends towards something just a little more shallow or a little more fake or makes something that isn't normal into something that we either have to call normal (against our instincts) or be seen as a hater. I don't think any of this ever organic. There are people that set these trends that society adopts. We really are headed somewhere we don't want to go.

       You obviously never read Marx´ "Das Kapital" or "Das kommunistische Manifest if you say that..."post factual", as it is called now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I agree on some parts of this text, it is stuffed with half-truths, blatant lies and prejudices presented as facts. I´m not a friend of homosexuality myself, but I can smell bullshit from quite a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is everyone always bringing up Germany as an example when it comes to refugees (a.k.a. muslims)? As far as I know, you people should be in perfect unison with the radical branch of Islam, they "cure" homosexuality in a way that you sad persons wish you could "apply" to gays yourselves subconsciously....with a nice sword strike, right? So, the "Islamisation of Germany" that I seem to be completely missing out on although I actually LIVE in Germany is just the usual fear mongering from people who only parrot what their filter bubble is amplifying, with the typical lack of actual knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I repeat: I do agree on some of your criticism. I, too, think that the LGBT has lost its core ideas and even some of the Stonewall riot veterans are ashamed what their movement has become. I absolutely support people going out into the streets demonstrating because the only reason of being thrown in jail is their sexual orientation. Locking up the "unnormal" won´t solve any problems, folks; plus it´s not very far away from what the radical muslims do. The old and worn out "Out of sight, out of mind" attitude won´t do shit...
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless some of the criticism is valid. I can understand all the people feeling "rushed" by the LGBT agenda, I too have my experiences with criticising homosexuals, breaking a new taboo; I too feel that the original LGBT goal of equality does not play the main role anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW: When the first few refugees arrived in Germany, one case of a German (!) abducting a refugee boy (!!), raping and killing him was in the news. That case is factchecked and true....the case of a refugee raping a German kid is NOT! 
I don´t know where you have your info from, but I can almost predict that the website you got it from starts with a "b"....and continues "...reitbart".
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling the media "Lügenpresse", but instrumentalizing exactly those "post factual" disinformation tactics you accuse the media of is just plain pathetic and speaks volumes, my friend...
      </p>
      <p>
       I´m totally open to discuss all the issues involved in homosexuality, but I´d like to keep it real and factual. And you should , too if you really want to find out the truth and not just confirming your own prejudices. Trying to undo some lies with even bigger lies is what 8-year olds would do...are you one?

       Well, anal sex isn't something particular of homosexuals and male homosexuality isn't necessarily tied to anal sex. So I don't really get your point. Anyways, how is the anus not "designed" to sexual intercourse when the male G-spot is accessible precisely through the anus?

       Anal sex is tied to homosexuality in particular male homosexuality. Why? Because you cant have vaginal sex. What would be the point of not ass fucking? Just to suck each others cocks? I would assume that a larger percentage of male homosexuals perform assplay to not performing assplay. Thsts kind of the point to sexuality, is to have sex. Gay men can only have oral and anal.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just because weve found a "g-spot" in our assholes doesnt mean it was created for gay men to have more pleasurable anal sex.

       If you think that sex is just penetration and oral then I'm sorry for your sexual partners, man. Lesbians cam have sex without the need of any penetration at all, for example. The thing is that there's this false believe that it's only sex if there's penetration. That's why gay men perform anal and why heterosexual couples have vaginal sex most of the time. Humans (just like other animals) have many ways of getting sexual pleasure and all of them are completely natural. Anyways, what's so wrong about anal? I mean, yes, it can cause serious issues if you don't do things properly, but if you do both the penetrator and the penetrated satisfy themselves. What's wrong with that? It doesn't affect anyone.

       Well i wasnt talking about lesbians munching each others carpets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point im trying to make simply is that gay men can not bear children. You can not impregnate someone via anal. The natural reasoning for sex, and why it feels really good for any human or animal, is reproduction. Gay men can not reproduce. And by hollywood and the Entertainment industry normalizing not just gay sex but a whole swath of very uncommon sexual acts, could be detrimental to society. Similar to Rome or something, thats why i originally said it reminds me of Caligula.

       Now this is not to say that gay marriage shouldnt be legal, because honestly i could gove two fucks. No pun intended

       It's a common misconception to think that sex is only meant to be for reproduction. Otherwise, animals wouldn't have that many ways of getting sexual pleasure different from penis-vagina penetration, as I already said before. And if homosexuals are abnormal just because they can't reproduce, most people are abnormal as well because they don't have sex to reproduce as well. That's, by the way, a very Christian morality. Christianity considers that the only sex act that isn't a perversion is the one whose only objective is to have children. I hope you agree that we can't expect everyone to follow some religion's values.

       I understand that humans have grown into beings that like pleasure. The point of sex IS reproduction. Sex feels good, so the species wants to reproduce.
      </p>
      <p>
       And i have to say that most animals in the world, more than likely, only have sexual pleasure via vaginal intercourse. Ive never seen a dog fuck another dog in its ass. Never saw any animals screw the same gender. Not to say that doesnt happen, but if it does, its not common at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the point im trying to make. The more and more humans "normalize" not just gay sex but extremely wierd fetishes like incest or even pedophilia(yes, just read Salon) can be extremely harmful to our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this is not the exact same but its somewhat similar. China enacts a one child policy, now they dont have enough children and young workers to pay the elders social security. If we normalize sexual acts that confuse people and really distance people from reproducing and the want to reproduce, we could all be fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       And i remember a douchey liberal on Bill Mahers douchey liberal show one time said that he wants people to not have children for the next 30 years because of "over population". This is the type of thinking thats dangerous.

       Same-sex sexual relations are documented in more than a thousand species. And sex has way more natural functions in animals: relieving stress, establishing social roles and ties, creating emotional bonds, etc. Some species of animals like bonobos (apes considered to be the most genetically similar animals to humans) are known to be organised around sex and the emotional bonds it creates.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, well, homosexual population doesn't magically grow just because we accept them. If we have to blame someone for the aging and decrease of the population of developed countries is heterosexual people who don't have children or, if they have them, they have one or two and when they're in their late 30s or early 40s. I mean, this problem is also happening in countries like South Korea and Japan where homosexuality is far from being accepted.

       Yeah I very specifically have an issue with what I believe is an impressionable socialization period in a child's life.   I do not feel that teaching the child that there are no consequences is a fair way to treat the child.  I mean what you have just said by itself is a huge issue for gay people, let alone the fact that as a parent and human I want my genes to be passed on into the future.   So at a basic level we are to impress upon small children info about something that is misleading according to current environment?  You just got a bunch of people to barely accept gay marriage and you saw the resistance to that and now you think you are going to get them to accept teaching their kids that there is nothing wrong with being gay.  I mean in a lot of cases religions specifically forbid it.  It's a HUGE uphill battle that resulted in galvanizing support for its opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another consequence of all this is that you are having sexual conversations with kids that are much younger than I was when I had talked about it.  In TV shows that never really spoke about this type of thing before, we are seeing explicit conversations that far more blatantly discuss sex because well the details here lead to questions for kids now.  I have a lot of compassion and for the gay people that want to just be accepted by everyone.  But I also have empathy for those that are concerned for the effects that changing sexual socialization might have on our children and families.
