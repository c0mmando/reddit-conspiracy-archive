    <div class="md"><p>Really not possible with how weird it is. I can sort of describe the site.</p>

<p>The background is FILLED with contact info (names, emails, phone numbers, ext.) along with &quot;Auto Added&quot; all over the place, making me think it&#39;s a bot putting it all there. The background is flashing rainbow colors w/ 2 really weird pics and 1 normal pic in the front. The 2 fucked up pics include what looks like a woman breast feeding, but the color is inverted and the eyes are removed so you can see through the pic, and the other one is just a really weirdly colored spider gif with many colors missing and what few are there are just... bright neonish colors. The final one is some sort of pic w/ 4 well dressed people standing around. just don&#39;t click the pics because there appears to be a link to some really weird site PLASTERED with this gif of porn pics changing really fast (looks like its all legal, I can&#39;t perfectly tell but it seems that way). I wrote some more in a comment here but I don&#39;t know what to make of it besides red herrings if the site was scanned by a bot to hide whatever that contact info is for. Also there is weird music in the background that I can&#39;t explain... it seems like some looping off beat music you might here in some really cheaply made game&#39;s menu screen, but again it&#39;s off beat, not G major but... I just don&#39;t know. It&#39;s all reaaaally weird and I am not going any deeper than that into this. I&#39;ll grab the popcorn and watch the fireworks that come from all this instead of being part of the show if you get my meaning</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like some sort of information storage site. It just has lists of personal contact info and these random images, lights ext... I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>The only thing I could think of is that if this might be some way of hiding the info from, say some sort of bot system that might be looking for the info shown. I could see it easily confusing the shit out of any program that might be hunting for key phrases or anything because of the shit show the code must look like.</p>

<p>All I know is that this is pretty damn creepy and Someone might want to look into what all that contact info could be about. I&#39;m not digging any deeper because I don&#39;t feel like finding something I don&#39;t want to.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Also there seems to be a link with those fucked up pictures if you click on them. I don&#39;t even know WHAT the fuck to make out of it. It just shows what looks like random porn pics one after the other in a gif. They don&#39;t look illegal from what I can see but again, this is as deep as I&#39;m digging. (one of the pics has the woman w/ a hand over her mouth but I&#39;m not making assumptions since the rest SEEM of age and of consent and S&amp;M is a thing...) The page itself is silent and The gif is just plastered all over some sort of wavy green and black background.</p>

<p>Literally the only thing I can think of all this being is something to throw off whoever or whatever is looking at it. If someone wants to keep this possible clue up feel free, but I am out of it as this point</p>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<p>Something is in the code of the site. Some link or something, seems to give access to something I am too chicken shit to go deeper. I said on another post I am too chicken shit and I indeed am. Good luck to whoever is going deeper because I am fucking done. If you choose to you might want to hide your info in case something follows you that you might not want. All I know is I&#39;m spooked out</p>

<p>EDIT: took a peek at the code, I don&#39;t know what the fuck is even going on with it. I think there are pics there but I don&#39;t even know and I am soooo fucking out because I have no clue what I put into the web address bar from the code but something came up, I could look at it if I chose, but I am so not doing it. good luck to whoever wants to go deeper because you might get into some DEEEEEP fucking shit.
