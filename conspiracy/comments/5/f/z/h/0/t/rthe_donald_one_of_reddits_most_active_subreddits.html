<p>When you go into an intentionally biased political advocacy group to shill for a contrarian belief system, you are trolling, not debating.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re being intentionally obtuse here. This isn&#39;t a real world forum where people come together and each gets five minutes on the mic. This is reddit where any non-hive mind opinion simply never sees the light of day. Look at <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> for a case study on how &quot;open&quot; political discourse goes on reddit. The &#39;debate&quot; is completely monopolized, and the downvote armageddon that comes down on any post that varies from the preferred narrative has nothing to do with the objective truth being presented. If I wanted to discuss one of Donald Trumps policies in a manner that wasn&#39;t intended to disparage him then I would be downvoted and nobody would ever see my post, and as a result nobody would have a discussion of it. But if I framed the discussion a way that paints him into an SS uniform I would not be surprised if my thread ended up at the front page with three hundred thousand replies.</p>

<p>If you think people don&#39;t downvote Trump related posts simply because they dislike Trump then simply go over to <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> and look at the percentage of downvotes their posts get. These downvotes serve no purpose whatsoever other than to spite the people they disagree with, and this happens in a subreddit that is supposedly a &quot;Safe space&quot;. </p>

<p>You need to work on your reading comprehension. No, I did not say that praising the Raiders in the Broncos subreddit is an argument which is part of a political advocacy group. That is some Mary Lou Retton level of mental gymnastics. All I said is that you would get banned for doing that. I used it as a metaphor to show the prevailing approach that many reddit communities employ to handle trolls, to illustrate that the_donald is not instituting a radical practice. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, you do not have a right to legislate to me, or anyone, what is and isn&#39;t a fact. You do not hold a mandate on truth. You do not get to tell other people what they can and can not believe. You can&#39;t argue for reasoned debate and preempt the conversation with the notion that the other person&#39;s belief system is inherently refuted and factless. Political beliefs are often subjective. Opposing sides can take the same data and draw completely different conclusions from them. You can&#39;t take abortion, gun laws, immigration, the economy, etc.. and distill them down to irrefutable facts which prove the righteousness of someone&#39;s beliefs. You don&#39;t get to hand pick winners and losers in the marketplace of ideas because you believe your belief system is more honest or accurate. Trying to force someone to acquiesce to your &quot;facts&quot; is not a very persuasive technique, and certainly doesn&#39;t win elections or effectively change public perception. Instead, you should make better and more persuasive arguments. If people reject what you consider to be an irrefutable fact, than perhaps you aren&#39;t communicating very effectively.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I want to live in a world where I am free to examine evidence and draw whatever conclusions I personally think are appropriate. When you say I want people to not disagree with me you are mischaracterizing what is actually happening. It is one thing to disagree with me, it is something entirely different to baselessly rebrand my mostly mundane beliefs as white supremacy and hate speech and then censor my freedom of expression.</p>

<p>In Broomfield CO, at the intersection of 132nd and Lowell, I stood on the corner with a trump sign with three other people. I had a propane tank thrown at me. I had a lady threaten to have her dog attack me if I didn&#39;t leave the intersection. People yelled the most filthy things you can imagine at me. I was doing nothing but standing there with my sign. In San Jose, Trump supporters were attacked by a mob for just wearing Trump hats. In Chicago, they literally started a riot to prevent Trump from speaking. Now, on reddit, we are getting the virtual equivalent of the same treatment. Our ability to impart our beliefs is intentionally handicapped and that is openly embraced by the liberally dominated community here. Because we &quot;antagonize&quot; them. We aren&#39;t allowed to have what they consider to be controversial beliefs, and if we try, they doxx us and encourage people to believe we should be regarded as the moral equivalent of Nazis following Hitler. Any type of opposition to us is fair game since we are so morally inferior and obnoxious in their eyes. All because we upvote pepe memes that say liberals are cucks. </p>

<p>I think you have it backwards. It isn&#39;t myself, or the Trump community, that wants to live in a world where no one disagrees with us. </p>

<p>Are you seriously trying to argue that they haven&#39;t taken measures to suppress content from r/the_donald? They flat out admit to it. They changed the way the algorithm sorts content on r/all, the CEO literally edited our comments, and now they have completely censored stickies from just the Trump subreddit from showing up on r/all. If you have ever participated in the community you will notice things happening to posts and votes which don&#39;t happen in other communities. Frequently, the entire new queue will just freeze at 1 upvote for example. Sometimes a post will have dozens of downvoted literally 1 second after it is posted. </p>

<p>Ironically it is because of their efforts to suppress us that we are getting more and more exposure. It is the Streissand Effect on steroids. Ultimately, they would have to ban all of the users to get rid of our message; the existence of the subreddit isn&#39;t even required. Based on their actions it appears to me that they would like to completely remove our voice, but they must realize that is impossible. </p>

<p>Frankly, I hope they do at some point ban the_donald. All of the users would get displaced here and other communities. The smorgasboard of red pills dispensed would cause a full on revolt from the average redditor and probably kill this website. </p>

<p>No Dissenters/SJWs, this is a pro-Trump subreddit</p>

<p>Is this not censorship to you?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take it a step further:</p>

<p>Censorship is the suppression of free speech, public communication or other information which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect or inconvenient as determined by governments, media outlets, authorities or other groups or institutions.</p>

R7: Negative Campaigning
Posts &amp; Comments
Do not engage in negative campaigning.
This sub is not a debate sub. There are other subs you can visit if you would like to debate the merits of each candidate. We are a pro-Hillary grassroots sub whose goal is to support and elect Hillary Clinton as president.
Automoderator will remove a post or comment if it:
contains anti-Hillary content
contains a right-wing talking point
uses commonly abused video content
contains anti-Democratic party content</p>

<p>Both subs are upfront about the candidate that they support and the sub is created to promote that candidate. </p>

<p>I double dare you to go to r/politics though and post anything pro trump or anti hillary and see how fast you get banned. Or better yet! Post about pizzagate in that sub and see how fast you get banned! Now what is interesting about that, is that r/politics doesn&#39;t SAY that they are a partisan sub, in fact, they pretend that they are impartial when they aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>That is precisely what this website is. The reason that reddit is successful is because it has embraced freedom of expression. </p>

<p>Of course they are not legally obligated to uphold freedom of speech here. But, just to be clear, you are actually advocating for censorship to suppress dissenting political views? Do you think that is a successful business model for a content aggregation website? </p>

<p>Oh you poor thing, did I infiltrate your safe space? I am going nowhere. I plan on blasting my righteous beliefs directly at your pro-censorship face until you retreat to some form of intellectual honesty. You can fuck off with your virtue signaling and moral superiority. No one is spreading hate, that is complete and total bullshit. No one is spreading intolerance, more fabrications. There is absolutely no racism to be found or tolerated. Quit making shit up.</p>

Sorry, no conspiracy there my friend.  I thought once the election was over it was agreed here that it was time for the-donald to get the fuck out of our subreddit?  That they were no longer welcome here with their shit? </p>

<p>Are you seriously trying to argue that they haven&#39;t taken measures to suppress content from r/the_donald? They flat out admit to it. They changed the way the algorithm sorts content on r/all, the CEO literally edited our comments, and now they have completely censored stickies from just the Trump subreddit from showing up on r/all. If you have ever participated in the community you will notice things happening to posts and votes which don&#39;t happen in other communities. Frequently, the entire new queue will just freeze at 1 upvote for example. Sometimes a post will have dozens of downvoted literally 1 second after it is posted. </p>

<p>Ironically it is because of their efforts to suppress us that we are getting more and more exposure. It is the Streissand Effect on steroids. Ultimately, they would have to ban all of the users to get rid of our message; the existence of the subreddit isn&#39;t even required. Based on their actions it appears to me that they would like to completely remove our voice, but they must realize that is impossible. </p>

<p>Frankly, I hope they do at some point ban the_donald. All of the users would get displaced here and other communities. The smorgasboard of red pills dispensed would cause a full on revolt from the average redditor and probably kill this website. </p>
