       Remember the days when who you were in real life was completely separate from who you were in real life. Remember that separation? That shit flipped. Everyone and who they are is online. Now, this doesn't surprise because social media is something that inevitably would have grown into a thing with something like the internet around. But we've made their jobs a little easier because social media is something they can use to heavily curve the thoughts of many in directions they'd like them to go. Social media is essentially the battleground of information, with the masses on the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that this happened doesn't surprise me. But it's from this that we must grow out of. Encryption was great because it was what allowed the separation to exist. But all this information has given the thoughts of the many into the hands of the few. I don't know about you, I've never particularly seen corporations or systemizers as having my interests in the foresight of its interest. (They've become an end, but forgotten they are a means to human happiness and ultimately love. A corporation is an entity. Why?...) I see them as a cancer to the world honestly, but with soo soo much potential for love and good. Many of these revelations have fostered this feeling inside of you too, hasn't it? It has for me. Information is weaponry in this day and age. The coveted are our minds and soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is just evidence of the magnificent potential lying ahead should it be so chosen. Never has information been so widely available to everyone with truly no cost so long as you're in most civilizations on this planet. (The fact that there aren't is disturbing.) Those who had information in the past held hostage something that truly is the ultimate key and tool for going through the universe, and rightfully the most desired thing in existence. Knowledge. Here we stand in an ocean of unlimited knowledge that would carry us like like eagles through the universe should we so becken. And still we beg for scraps from the man. Infinite awaits and still we believe what happens in front of our puny eyes somehow outways the universe we're floating in. The greatest crime we have committed is treating existence so casually. Always be humbled by the structure we live in. And try to learn its lessons.

       Listen here sonny! I remember back in the ol days ya'll had to telnet into a gopher client to git yerself some Internets!
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember riding into the ol internet on the back of my bbs, and dang it weren't it dangerous! Ya had t'have yer trusty FProt by yer side eeeeeeverywhere ya went lest thems nasty cyber hackers rastled yer ftp client outta yer hands! Heh heh heh! Thems were the days!
      </p>
      <p>
       Then came the ol dot come gold rush! In rode the big boys like Compuserve and America Online. Them ol boys thought they could rastle them listservs to their own purpose! Damn near drove 'em extinct. I hear tell you can still find them listservs out there somewhere!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now don't you be talkin t'me about them high rollin Amazons and Googles y'hear? Them boys think they gots this interwebs under control but these is the wilds y'here? These wilds gots a way of going back to the ways it was wither them Amazons and Googles likes it or not. You'll see whippersnapper. They thought they had file sharing controlled  when them done killed Napster but they never saw his children the Torrent boys comin' did they?

       I must admit I'm terrible for upvoting I always forget but I've rectified now. Double props for the Nietzsche quote.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with your points. I remember 2002 when the Iraq war was brewing my entire knowledge of the situation was gained from my dad and internet forums. Now in 2016 if I read "social" media I wouldn't have a clue what was going on. Although social media provides a wider audience it has diluted the sharing of knowledge to clickbait headlines, one line arguments and TL:DR. This, in my opinion, was intentional. So although you say social media is the battleground I fear the battle has been lost.
      </p>

       EDIT: I'm comparing 14 year old me in 2002 to a hypothetical 14 year old me in 2016 not me in 2016 with my hatred of Facebook!

       Yea I remember very well. Well apart from AOL which I've never had. Ever heard of too much of a good thing? In some ways the limited access made the time on the internet all the better. Now it's something that just constantly distracts me from shit I should be doing that would be more productive than chatting shit on reddit.

       It's only because most of you want centralised Web sites that are controlled by corporations.  The entire reason why the Internet was initially so hard to control, was because there were decentralised protocols which weren't in the hands of a single organisation.  I've written a
