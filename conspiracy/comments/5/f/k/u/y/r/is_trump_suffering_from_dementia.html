His father succumbed to dementia. His handlers would want to minimize his exposure as much as possible which would explain the lack of press conferences. It would explain a lot of other things too. Why he keeps trying to ditch the press, why he offered Kasich the role of basically being in charge, why Pence probably is in charge, why he won&#39;t go to security briefings, why he surrounds himself with family members even in contexts where it&#39;s inappropriate, why he is so belligerent, why he seems to espouse the opinion of the last person he talked to. A huge amount of his behavior is instantly understandable if you assume he&#39;s mentally deteriorated.</p>

<p>He was also Trump&#39;s Campaign Finance Chairman and that was no big secret, so those who might claim to have been duped by Trump can&#39;t in good faith claim ignorance.</p>
