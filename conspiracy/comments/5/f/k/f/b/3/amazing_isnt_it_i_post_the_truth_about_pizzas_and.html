    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all the same, on all sides, all the time, no matter what. </p>

<p>You will never get your own actual proof of <em>anything</em> from sitting on your butt in front a computer monitor. You can&#39;t know for <em>sure</em> that what the MSM says is true or not, if alt-news claims of &quot;insiders&quot; talking about what the NYPD claimed to have found is BS or not, and as soon as certain things were sent to &quot;private&quot; nobody else coming into the discussion could ever know for <em>sure</em> what was on those social media sites and what is just made up hoax material, and none of us can know for <em>sure</em> if the wikileaks emails are even legit. </p>

<p>This is actually how the vast majority of daily life works. There is a ton of stuff you can&#39;t know for sure, and the best you can do is to make the best guesses you can. Welcome to being human, it&#39;s complicated af.</p>

<p>And if TPTB want to overthrow the constitution and go full blown police state, then they will. They will whether or not there is a successful false flag, or a real flag, or someone burns a flag, or whatever the hell they decide to base it on. If they want to &#39;erase&#39; people, then they will, whether people are researching this theory, or that theory, or no theories. If they want to collapse the West, then they will. If they want to wrongfully arrest people, then they will. And if people want to research &quot;pizzagate&quot; then they will.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always going to be chaos, there will always be a significant element of uncertainty, and over 99% of what happens in the next 10 years of your life will be completely beyond your control, that&#39;s just how life is. </p>

<p>And given all of that, perhaps some people just want to look into things and research for themselves, for whatever reasons, and it doesn&#39;t even matter if their theories turn out to be right or wrong, because whether or not we are right or wrong in our opinions has no bearing on reality <em>whatsoever</em>. Over 99% of the U.S. population will never so much as speak one word about &quot;pizzagate&quot;. Even if it was 100% real. </p>

<p>In a world, in a society, like ours, it is best to focus on being right with yourself, on doing and saying what you feel is right, because there will come a time when that is <em>all you have</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you taking such an uppity, condescending tone with everyone when you, yourself, are not applying any critical thought to anything you&#39;re attempting to rant/debate about? Do you just not realize it? I have moments like that sometimes, some days are especially irritating and stressful, the misanthrope streak starts to kick in for a bit.</p>

<p>But anyway, during the American revolution, the government and the regular citizens all <em>had the same weapons</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize, condescending foolishness, that the Vietnamese peasantry beat the might of the U.S. armed forces to a standstill, and then defeat, even though out gunned, out equipped, and out-technologied... don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>And I guess, again, you fail to realize that the American patriots DID NOT have the same quality and quantity of weaponry as was used against them by the British... again, a smaller more agile and <em>DETERMINED</em> force taking on and defeating a much larger and better equipped force.</p>

<p>Example next - the Afghani rebels fighting the Soviet army to a standstill for TEN YEARS regardless the Soviet supply chain was &quot;right next door&quot; and the Afghans were armed with rifles and decrepit missiles.</p>

<p>I think if history has taught us anything, it&#39;s that people who whine about the high cost of freedom... aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>You seem to be falling for the current theme on &quot;public entertainment&quot; that the people can&#39;t fight back and should just bow down, or die. It&#39;s quite a common theme in all the popular shows - sounds like it&#39;s working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trigger words - setting off the masses. No substance to their rants, just saying the same things over and over - and getting the same results. Let them die down for a day or so and then trigger them again. Doesn&#39;t matter if the subject of the trigger is contrived, real, or imagined, all that matters is that they&#39;re triggered and say whatever it is they say.

    <div class="md"><p>First of all OP, you need to get your facts straight.  No one is saying things that aren&#39;t just stated facts.  If you do, then report it to mods.  We don&#39;t like disinfo.</p>

<p>We have pictures and we know who went on the lolita express.  no one is saying &quot;they raped and killed kids on lolita express&quot;...that would be disinfo and the way this place works is if that&#39;s wrong then people say so. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s not libel to say for example bill clinton went on known-pedophile epstein&#39;s plane.  Not only was that from the MSM possibly over a year ago, but it&#39;s also revealed in the flight manifest.  Or that a pizza place has a pedo logo in it--the logo is published by the FBI as a pedo symbol and people have eyes....so....   </p>

<p>We are talkign about facts</p>

<p><strong><em>You</em></strong> are talking about conjecture</p>

<p>It turns out you&#39;re also wrong.  Just becuase your&#39;e ignorant doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re right.   You need to get with the program and do some more research if you think this isn&#39;t real and we&#39;re just gobbling on about nothing and slandering everyone.  That&#39;s not the case.  We&#39;ve made real connections and those connections keep getting added.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re holding out for some kind of smoking gun like video of a kid being raped, I&#39;m guessing that even if we DID present such a thing, you&#39;re the type of person that will still claim that is a false video made in a government studio, maybe the same one that filmed the moon landing and ISIS beheaddings.  My point is, how much &#39;circumstantial&#39; evidence do you require before you have to admit the mathematical impossibility that these people are all in one big network?</p>

<p>How many connections do you require?</p>

<p>Le&#39;ts flip it around.  Hypothetically.  Say you are talking about charles manson.  Would it be strange to you to find out that he knew a bunch of other murderers and serial killers?    Ok now pretend he&#39;s not &#39;guilty&#39; yet, but he&#39;s in court and you&#39;re a juror.  Do you think he&#39;s a monster if he has 20 friends that are convicted murderers? Maybe he&#39;s just the man who knew too little right?  An innocent. Someone who just brought them the donuts and was present at every murder but made sure to blindfold himself and put his fingers in his ears and just pretent he wasn&#39;t there.</p>
