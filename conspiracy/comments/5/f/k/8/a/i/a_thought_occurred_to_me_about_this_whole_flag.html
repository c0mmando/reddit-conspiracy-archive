    <div class="md"><p>For the past 20 years, the Congress has made seven attempts to overrule the Supreme Court decision regarding the burning of the American flag by passing a constitutional amendment that had an exception to the First Amendment and allowed the government to ban flag desecration. The Amendment was first proposed in 1990 but failed to receive the required two-thirds majority votes of the House. After 1994, when the Republicans took over the Congress, the Amendment has consistently passed in the House but failed in the Senate](<a href="http://thelawdictionary.org/article/is-flag-burning-illegal/">http://thelawdictionary.org/article/is-flag-burning-illegal/</a>)</p>

<p>so, you&#39;re saying he isn&#39;t the first government official to try and have the ruling reversed... but he must be... this is such a big deal!!! /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I’m sorry, is that the Constitution? No.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, it is. It&#39;s called the Supremacy Clause, Article VI, Clause 2. It places the Federal Government and the States subject to the rulings of the US Supreme Court. This is Civics 101. Maybe you should read the US Constitution.</p>

<p>&quot;Because you don’t have the right to sedition.&quot;</p>

<p>The Sedition Act of 1918 only applies in a time of war. The last time the US was at war, via a Constitutionally required Declaration from Congress, was during WWII. The charge of sedition is fallacious at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;So again, no, it’s not the Constitution.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, it is. Article III, Sections 1 and 2.</p>

<p><em>Article III</em>
<em>Section 1.</em></p>

<p><em>The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.</em></p>

<p><em>Section 2.</em></p>

<p><em>The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority;--to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls;--to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;--to controversies to which the United States shall be a party;--to controversies between two or more states;--between a state and citizens of another state;--between citizens of different states;--between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.</em></p>

<p><em>In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.</em></p>

<p><em>The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.</em></p>

<p>Marbury V Madison upheld the US Constitution via Article III. The Federal Government and the individual States are subject to Supreme Court rulings. Period.</p>

<p>You do understand that all of an American Citizens Rights are not enumerated in the Constitution, right? That a Citizen has far more rights than those that are spelled out in the Bill of Rights?</p>

<p>Yes, it is ironic that you are choosing to ignore the US Constitution in your argument that the Constitution and both forms of Government (Federal and State) aren&#39;t subject to US Supreme Court rulings.</p>

<p>By your logic, no Supreme Court Case has any legally binding affect on any US State or Territory since it is not in the US Constitution.</p>

<p>Except for the pesky little fact that in Article III, it clearly states, in black and white, that ALL US States, Territories, Federal Government, and US Citizens are bound by US Supreme Court findings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Supreme Court rulings 1. cannot make law 2. cannot change upheld law 3. cannot interpret the Constitution.</p>

<p>You are arguing that the US Supreme Court is not a Constitutional Authority that has Supremacy over US Citizens, States, or the Federal Government. Even though Article III clearly states it does.</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court decides Civil Rights cases, cases between States, cases arising out of Congressional Action (i.e. Civil Rights, Education, Sodomy, Free Speech, etc), and cases between Citizens. Again, Article III.</p>

<p>Taken straight from US Law, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2384:</p>

<p><em>If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.</em></p>

<p>And 18 U.S.C.A. § 2385:</p>

<p><em>Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises, or teaches the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying the government of the United States or the government of any State, Territory, District or Possession thereof, or the government of any political subdivision therein, by force or violence, or by the assassination of any officer of any such government; or</em></p>

<p><em>Whoever, with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such government, prints, publishes, edits, issues, circulates, sells, distributes, or publicly displays any written or printed matter advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence, or attempts to do so; or</em></p>

<p><em>Whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any such government by force or violence; or becomes or is a member of, or affiliates with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof—</em></p>

<p><em>Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by the United States or any department or agency thereof, for the five years next following his conviction.</em></p>

<p>One person burning the US Flag does not rise to the Legal definition of sedition. Sedition is not a right. Free Speech and Protest is. It looks like you desire to remove both of these rights from all Americans. Sad really.</p>

<p>Ah, yes....the only Constitutional Supreme Court cases are the ones YOU decide for the rest of America.</p>

<p>Is that you, Trump???</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If two or more persons</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meaning, according to Law, ONE individual burning the Flag is not a crime...just as the US Supreme Court confirmed.</p>

<p>Besides, Congress repealed the Sedition Act on December 13, 1920. Meaning...just in case you have trouble reading English...that it is no longer Law and no longer enforceable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, hey, look, NOT A SINGLE FUCKING WORD ABOUT ‘ONLY DURING WARTIME</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, if you actually took the time to read the Sedition Act of 1918, you would see that you are dead wrong:</p>

<p><em>SECTION 3. Whoever, when the United States is at war, shall willfully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States, or to promote the success of its enemies, or shall willfully make or convey false reports, or false statements, . . . or incite insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States, or shall willfully obstruct . . . the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States, or . . . shall willfully utter, print, write, or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the form of government of the United States, or the Constitution of the United States, or the military or naval forces of the United States . . . or shall willfully display the flag of any foreign enemy, or shall willfully . . . urge, incite, or advocate any curtailment of production . . . or advocate, teach, defend, or suggest the doing</em></p>

<p>But again, the Sedition Act was repealed by Congress and is no longer valid or enforceable.</p>

<p>Incorrect. Since the Sedition Act was repealed, the next case to deal with Flag burning was Texas v. Johnson in 1989, which, in fact, confirmed that burning the US Flag is indeed a Constitutional Right under Freedom of Speech.</p>

<p>Islam is not a religion, and as Islam’s tenants are “kill everyone who doesn’t agree with us”, it is incompatible with the US Constitution.</p>

<p>Oh, hey, look, NOT A SINGLE FUCKING WORD ABOUT ‘ONLY DURING WARTIME’, BECAUSE “CONSPIRACY TO LEVY WAR” IS <strong>BY DEFINITION</strong> <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> DURING WARTIME.
