<p>Your entry will never even get wiki&#39;ed and if it does it will be removed and could be counter sued and liable. What has it uncovered, have any of those pizzas places been permanently closed and what arrests through this speculation have been made?</p>

<p>Instead what is happening to those idiots making these submissions, haven&#39;t many of them been shut down and removed off the majority of the net, and you-tube could soon follow suite removing them next year. Proving that they have been illegal and quite baseless</p>

<p>What was so unimaginable for you sycophants too understand</p>

You&#39;re about standing in the path of aprox 100,000s of people who think otherwise.  At the current rate it may see an increase to millions in the coming months.</p>

<p>If you youtube pizzagate there are as many users with growing audiences since the past few weeks.  The trending activity has skyrocketed since Reddit banned the sub for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t give a shit. I am not standing in the way of anything. It is not me who needs to worry about anything.</p>

<p>This pizzabait shit was the work of sycophants, basing speculation as evidence. Except where was the crime I ask when pizzabait is being such down. Not any of their supposed speculation.</p>

<p>So you tell what it was all about? It must be because the internet is gullible and because the internet is manipulated. Gee go and figure that out...</p>

<p>What did pizzabait cause, its affects are triggering some very severe protocols to become enforced all over the internet. And that&#39;s the problem with dumb they are so easily blinded by hate and the baseless whims provoking them to act stupidly, but never asking what that other picture was going to be. </p>

<p>Imagine vetting you-tube vids and them being passed through much tighter censorship bodies and that&#39;s where this future is headed now. While also employing mod&#39;s conforming to more mainstream agendas on social networking. </p>

<p>What did you think would actually happen from baseless speculation upon acting like johnny law.</p>

<p>So put that in your WIKI and RIP. Thank you I am sure that the rest of this planet is just so grateful for these pizza trolls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell the truth, speak the truth. That truth is a bunch of trolls got trolled. This is what happens when sycophants start fawning all the facts, twisting them into fiction, and acting like the law.</p>

<p>What did they think considering would happen? Put that in your WIKi pizzabait RIP&#39;s free speech, because what good is a phone call if you are unable too speak.</p>

<p>It is up to the law too prove that guilt. When they are guilty scream it. Hey there is no crime afterwards. Not go around prior committing hate crime almost entirely based upon speculation that the law has proven to be largely false. What has happened here, have those pizza place been shut, which named people&#39;s arrests have been made?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re looking at here is radical cyber-vigilantism.  If you start with why this happened then you&#39;ll know that for vigilantism to occur there has to be law, order and justice that is not occurring in or by the system.</p>

<p>Bad people and the corrupt have disrupted and prevented justice all throughout history.  You can find it in just about any history book.  If the prevention or blockage of justice is significant enough it will eventually be met and countered by another force.</p>

<p>Take the French Revolution for example or even the U.S. Revolutionary War.  Injustice was countered by another force regardless if it was through a new order or by chaos of the people.</p>

<p>There does not have to be arrests made for &quot;justice&quot; to occur.  That is the danger of this escalation.  If the police and law do not do something to look into this problem then people out there will do it on their own.  It&#39;s not the people that are the problem.  If law gives the people justice and investigates appropriately then the problem goes away.  <strong>Something</strong> is preventing that from happening and that&#39;s the lingering shadow that people want dealt with.</p>

<p>This is the truth that people are not seeing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that is you largely thinking and assuming conspiracy. Provoking that term revolution and this is where what you have provoked turns against you from going about it wrong and therefore becoming complicit.</p>

<p>I know there are parts of the system that are corrupt and where those rules sometimes do not apply to wealth, status, and power. Been on that receiving end.</p>

<p>However if you are going to blow that whistle it needs credibility to run its course establishing that those facts are accurate for a case to be made instead of vigilantism based off some other speculation.</p>

<p>What credibility was there here, none, what evidence has there been, emails that you haven&#39;t got any real understanding, except filling in the blanks with your own imagination turning into speculation and circumstance, then that result was by large fiction and more and more hearsay. Turning into hate crime and offense, because that law hasn&#39;t had a chance to do its job, or you have assumed that it wouldn&#39;t, promoting your own actions that are as complicit.</p>

<p>The Emails supposedly had credibility airing that leak, we can argue compromised, because they acted estranged after going for a specific side and not fully connecting those dots in the fashion that they would have previously, which meant an obvious agenda and not neutrality. But what turned from there, was an investigation that has acted and was acting. But because you didn&#39;t get justice, those facts have became obscured by your own version of the truth. Yawn</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We were arguing about baseball and you just grabbed a pool cue and chucked it like a javelin.  You&#39;re all over the place in your argument.</p>

<p>I think what you assume is credible and not credible needs to be reevaluated.  Additionally, you should probably find truth through investigation instead of judging others as the answer to the situation.  Your logical fallacies are about a book thick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAHAHA</p>

<p>Not at all. credible was the recognition of it becoming resolved by the law publicly. Not in some other far flung reaches of the darker corners of cyber space where the lines of reality soon become quite blurred into other fiction. Where every troll shouts agenda, and the rabble they feed is soon calling for pitchforks and bonfires. </p>

<p>Where was the crime I ask and who was guilty. Hmm that answer is now found in the stricter protocols of agent smith, and those other tricksters pretending to be Neo. Neo would have hit the waves with credibility connecting all the dots with hard facts and evidence feeding it into the right channels, not using some other baiting complicit fantasies. Then this story proven to be valid would have sparked real action, like those pizza places being shut down and all the guilty arrested. Did the estranged even order pizza, or was that the works of somebody else blowing those leaks out of context into larger disproportion. </p>

<p>What was the larger agenda here, because what has it actually caused. Again I challenge that WIKI to speak the truth. Pizzabait RIP&#39;s free speech. Because vigilantism is not the law when it hasn&#39;t offered much in the way of a shred of credibility apart from nefarious speculation, that has later attacked and incited because of it.</p>
