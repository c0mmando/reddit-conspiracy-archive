        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You’ve probably all seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/">the thread posted today by Spez</a> regarding his “apology” for editing user comments and the subsequent light censorship of <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> subreddit. I believe it was all a test to see how the community would react to censorship regarding the <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. Judging from the highest rated comments, it turned out to have an overwhelming positive reaction from the community. Either that, or the comment&#39;s votes were manipulated to make it seem that it was popular opinion, causing your average Reddit user that read that thread to mindlessly go along with the hivemind. To find any differing opinions in that thread, you have to sort by controversial, as almost no dissenting opinions reached over 100 points. Censorship is a hot topic for most Redditors, so you&#39;d expect biased censorship like this to be more strongly contested than it was.</p>

<p>He started the thread apologizing about editing user’s comments and betraying our trust, then suddenly turned it into “I need to censor this subreddit because they’re mean!”. How do you even go from &quot;I made a mistake&quot; to &quot;I am punishing this subreddit I don&#39;t like&quot;? Spez was looking for any excuse to censor <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>, even a <em>mistake he made himself</em> is a reasonable excuse in his eyes.</p>

<p>Knowing how <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> will react to this censorship (not well, which is understandable), I&#39;m sure that in a few weeks Spez will use that as an excuse to give that subreddit the axe. He will cry &quot;I had to do it guys, they were too toxic and out of control! I warned you <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>!&quot;. This way he can maintain his facade of being the victim and the good guy. He will likely be widely praised for his &quot;bravery&quot; for &quot;finally doing it&quot;.</p>

<p>Read his exact wording here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, <em>if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line—up to an outright ban</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;See the situation improve&quot;? What are <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> users doing right now that is so toxic that needs to be improved? I can find lots of &quot;toxic&quot; users in EVERY subreddit. The vast majority of <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> users aren&#39;t toxic and aren&#39;t doing anything against the rules.</p>

<p>What constitutes being &#39;toxic&#39; anyway? Upvoting a lot? Spamming memes? Using features built-in to Reddit that are available to everyone? &quot;Toxic&quot; is very broad term that can be conveniently used wherever the admins disagree with something, and it seems like a very dangerous precedent to set - &quot;don&#39;t be toxic or you&#39;ll be banned!&quot;. I can find widespread &quot;toxic&quot; behaviour from lots of other subreddits that aren&#39;t banned. Why aren&#39;t anything being done about those? I can find &quot;toxic&quot; power-moderators that mod over 100 subreddits who repeatedly abuse their power and threaten users. Moderators have the power to prevent people posting in their subreddits and delete submissions, they should be far more closely watched than your average &quot;toxic&quot; user. Why aren&#39;t anything being done about these power-mods?</p>

<p>Basically the admins have set the precedent where they just have to cherry-pick &quot;toxic&quot; behaviour from subreddits they don&#39;t like, and they can simply ban them. <a href="/r/Pizzagate">/r/Pizzagate</a> suffered a similar fate. Moderators were warned that the subreddit would be banned if doxxing didn&#39;t stop, so the moderators took a strict stance on doxxing to appease the admins. Shortly after, they banned the subreddit anyway.</p>

<p>As we saw from the leaked admin chat logs, Spez is already being urged from other moderators to take down <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. You can tell he isn&#39;t against the idea. He is likely thinking of a way to do it without being condemned by the community for censorship.</p>

<p>Today Spez has sent a clear message: if you oppose the admin&#39;s ideologies, you&#39;re in trouble. But if you’re on his side, then you’re free to do whatever you want. Everyone who values this website and free speech should be worried of what is likely to come from this.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Spez was testing community reaction to light censorship of <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. Expect <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> to be banned soon, or censored further, for “toxic” behaviour. The admins will use this excuse in the future to ban or censor other subreddits they don’t agree with.</p>

<p>At this rate reddit is probably going to wind up like one of those graveyards, voat will go the same way a few years from now and we will just go on hoppscotching around until we have to type in actual ip addresses from private invites.</p>

<p>Because Trump supporters have been violent all election cycle (they haven&#39;t), the best thing we could come up with while we&#39;re winning is to firebomb a black church... cuz logic? </p>

But these days, all of Reddit is now closed discussion. Admins can and do change comments, shadowbans are rampant, and subreddits are regularly deleted. Furthermore, post votes are regularly manipulated and sometimes things are just straight up removed from the frontpage. Reddit will die off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems new platforms become &#39;main stream&#39; when they fill a void or offer some freedom other sites lack. FB &amp; Twitter are in decline and it looks like Reddit will start the death spiral soon.
One day I&#39;ll wake up and a new platform will be on everyone&#39;s lips. Free speech seems to be a secondary issue since all these sites are based on someone&#39;s belief to start with...whether it&#39;s an agenda or the almighty dollar.</p>

<p>As users we just jump around to the platform we feel most comfortable with at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that it will be banned soon but I believe the true reason is not because Spez thinks they are mean.</p>

<p>If you look at the leaked chat logs between the power mod users of reddit and Spez it is clear that they are very hivemindish and crave power.  One user repeatadly jokes &quot;oh spez make me CEO for a day so I can ban the_donald&quot;.  These people crave power and attention.</p>

<p>So when you have a subreddit like the_donald that gets HUGE amounts of attention it makes them jealous.  So all these power mods get together and pressure Spez to ban the_donald.  I believe this to be the true reason the sub gets banned soon.  </p>

<p>The_donald also has a very tight community unlike a lot of these other subs.  I can&#39;t even imagine what its like to mod <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.  This makes them even more jealous.  the_donald is very powerful compared to them even though they have less subscribers they can organize better and have a better sense of community.</p>

Whiteout a push-back ( triggering ) it gets bland and boring and interest drops.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re probably right that the &quot;mass user base&quot; is satisfied with the <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> filter, but I don&#39;t think that really matters to the people who think they matter.</p>

<p>Not only are a lot of the powermods/default mods pushing to outright ban the sub, but there are an entire shitload of comments with thousands of upvotes <em>still</em> calling for the sub to be banned. The loudmouths aren&#39;t satisfied at all.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s exactly the kind of bullshit that&#39;s showing their true colors. </p>

<p>They bitch and cry that the subreddit is taking up too much space on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, so the algorithm gets changed. </p>

<p>Then they bitch and cry that they&#39;re &quot;abusing&quot; stickies, so now they&#39;re the only sub who isn&#39;t allowed to have stickies on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. </p>

<p><strong>But wait!</strong> Now Trump supporters are somehow &quot;leaking&quot; out of their sub and trying to join discussions about our President Elect in other subs, which is apparently &quot;ruining&quot; reddit, so they need to go!</p>

<p>There&#39;s also plenty of people in the announcement post who are saying they should be banned because they&#39;ve already broken tons of rules and have &quot;never been punished&quot;.</p>

<p>No matter what, there&#39;s a huge group who won&#39;t be satisfied until there are literally no Trump supporters on Reddit to &quot;ruin&quot; their circlejerks in the default sub. </p>

<p>This whole thing is so fucking gross. I rarely ever even post on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> myself, and I&#39;ve leaned very far left for my entire life and even I see how absolutely fucked up all of this bullshit is. It makes my skin crawl.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as some do not like <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> , they need that space. Reddit NEEDS to give them that space. </p>

<p>What happens when you ban subs that you or your investors or advertisers don&#39;t like, is they then infultrate all other subs. </p>

<p><a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> is <em>their</em> safe space. They are their own quarantine. If you break that, they will infect everything. </p>

<p>I beleive the move to allow people to filter certain subs was a positive move. It allows <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> to be themselves and it removes their cuck crap from those who don&#39;t want to see it. </p>

<p>When I am browsing reddit outside of my normal RES enhanced account environment, I  don&#39;t want to see 2XChrom shit. I don&#39;t care about your periods. I don&#39;t care about your vag shit. I don&#39;t care about your BF being an ass. I don&#39;t want to see it in a default list. Yet there is it - Amy Shumer Live defaulted. All dedicated to everything VAGINA. I don&#39;t care! It&#39;s not relevant to me.  I don&#39;t want to see that or problems around it. I understand it is relevant to others, but I personally do not think it should be defaulted. For those who want it - have at it, it&#39;s all yours. </p>

<p>Perhaps that was a stick to make an account so people don&#39;t have to see that in their feed. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a perfect analogy, but just like I could care less about <a href="/r/TwoXChromosomes">/r/TwoXChromosomes</a>  , people could care less about <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> . It&#39;s part of society. It&#39;s part of Reddit. Unless Reddit wants to redefine it&#39;s platform as a space space for only certain groups, it would do well to leave it alone. </p>

<p>Bullies thrive on attention. They LOVE attention. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">The Streisand Effect</a> is real, and the more people bitch and wine and gripe about <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> , the more you validate them. Just ignore them and call them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWh9JbBZC_Q">a silly place.</a></p>

<p>I admit I upvote a good amount from there myself even though I am banned because sometimes they have a point, or just plain hilarious.  Other times I just SMH. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, T_D frequenter here.</p>

<p>If you go there right now, you can tell something&#39;s up.  T_D is kicking and screaming (understandably so).  I think it&#39;s subtly aware of its impending death.</p>

<p>Also, if you visit one of the sister subs that are meant for actual debate, you&#39;ll notice an abundance of posts that seem designed to piss people off.</p>

<p>My theory is that Reddit has figured out what buttons to push to piss off T_D, and is going to do so until it&#39;s declared dead within the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Also, today&#39;s front-page post from r/self is laughable.  They wouldn&#39;t have a damn thing to say if they actually agreed with T_D&#39;s politics.</p>

<p>Judging from the highest rated comments, it turned out to have an overwhelming positive reaction from the community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reddit hates freedom.  I have been using this site for six years now, and I have known for that long.  This site is dominated by the safe space demographic, and that is what they want this site to be.  They will shut down anything which is inconsistent with Frankfurt School Utopianism.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like real racism.  I don&#39;t like it when I go to 4chan and see the n-word and Heil Hitler and denial of the Holocaust.  The difference, however, is that I don&#39;t think that any of those people should be told <strong><em>not</em></strong> to say those things.  I think they are sick, yes; but I am able to hide their threads, so if I don&#39;t want to see that stuff, then I don&#39;t have to.  I don&#39;t believe in the owner of a site engaging in censorship, but that users of websites should do it themselves.</p>

<p>I use the RES ignore list on this site.  Many users of this sub and the news subs are on said ignore list.  I don&#39;t cry to the moderators or anyone else that those people should be prevented from spreading their material, though.  I just make a choice about whether or not it is something that <strong><em>I myself</em></strong> want to see.  Recently I&#39;ve been putting PizzaGate posters on ignore too, because I don&#39;t want to see that either.  Again, though, I&#39;m not going to spez and getting them banned.  That is the difference.</p>

<p>They choose what they want to post.  I choose what I want to read.  Everyone&#39;s rights get respected, and there is no problem.  Bottom up individual censorship is fine.  Top down, centralised, globally enforced censorship where no one has any choice, is evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And another post that should be in the final sub.<br/>
We all know that the Donald sub is banning more people than any other sub. So this is one of the few places that doesn&#39;t allow freedom of speech while they on the other hand request freedom of speech.  </p>

<p>You can&#39;t have it both ways, so stop banning people there or be ready to follow what you do to users that exercise that freedom.  </p>

<p>Besides the top members of that sub are more aggressive than the tree and the sneaker sub together.<br/>
How I know that, I told at sneakers that I wouldn&#39;t pay $200 bucks for crap shoes and in the tree one about the guy in Germany that smoked and destroyed a bridge in a car accident. A 200 million Euros bridge.  </p>

<p>The difference between the tree, the sneakers and the Donald sub is that the people in the Donald sub would actually use violence as a normal medium as they can&#39;t use words in a proper manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you had a toxic community of people taking up all of your admin time and then targeting admins who are volunteers you might do a cost / benefit analysis too.  You have to consider if it&#39;s worth letting certain patrons in your business.  Maybe it&#39;s not such a good idea to let the guy that juggles fire into the bar?  I mean it might be okay if you have an outdoor venue and a lot of space, but is it really worth the potential consequences?</p>

<p>Horseshit. Every one of these &quot;hate crimes&quot; we&#39;ve heard about so far have turned out to be staged. Like that college girl who said she was attacked and had her burka stolen - she literally admitted to making it up, and is facing charges for filing a false report.

    <div class="md"><p>My god - no proper punctuation, misspelled words. That source reads the same as a text from a 12 year old girl. Anyway, I googled this girl&#39;s name and found some other articles on the incident, thanks for the lead.</p>

<p>Her Facebook post about it has comments alleging that she made up the incident to get insurance money out of it - she owed more on the car than it was worth. Either way, in this case I don&#39;t know if she made it up or not because the only way we&#39;d know that at this point is if she admits to making it up.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll point out, however, that the police in her city/county and neighboring municipalities have not had any similar reports. It would make sense to me that if someone is willing to key a car with a never Trump sticker, they&#39;d be willing to key more than one such car. So it&#39;s odd to me that it&#39;s a one-off.</p>

<p>The only response, though, would be to take her at her word until proven otherwise, but I&#39;m still doubtful of the validity of her claims. Given no other similar incidents have been reported, and that she was driving a crappy car and had family flying in for Thanksgiving - whom she&#39;d probably need to pick up from the airport - I mean...maybe she wanted a way to get out of picking them up, a la &quot;car&#39;s in the shop, sorry get a taxi&quot; style. I&#39;ve used that excuse before - parent flying into town, asks me to pick them up, car&#39;s a complete mess and I have no time to clean it, I have literally $0 to put gas in because I was making minimum wage, and the airport&#39;s an hour and a half away - so I said &quot;in the shop, needs a new starter&quot;, because I didn&#39;t want my mom knowing what a shitty financial situation I was in. Just a thought anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t be a problem if TD wasn&#39;t going around harassing mods, harassing public people, and in general being asses.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t make this as simple as, &quot;They don&#39;t like what we say and believe in our sub so we&#39;re getting banned.&quot; This isn&#39;t a free speech topic, and it&#39;s not censorship if a corporate company wants to keep a toxic subsection of reddit off the front page. Most people don&#39;t want to see the TD shit. There&#39;s millions of subscribers on reddit. There&#39;s 300,000 on TD, and several far more popular subs exist. Yet TD stuff frequently ends up on the front page. r/all should be a place where most people get to see what most people like. It shouldn&#39;t be TD&#39;s worship which angers everyone that hates politics and at least 2/3 of the people that follow politics. I think r/all could just block all politics from the front page. That&#39;d be an improvement as well. </p>

<p>The problem is more aligned with a sub being a harassing agent and manipulating the front page of r/all. </p>

<p>Spez didn&#39;t say, &quot;We don&#39;t like what they say.&quot; He said, &quot;We don&#39;t like what they do.&quot; This is a discussion forum and TD has become a problem. Whether those people causing the problem are a majority or minority doesn&#39;t matter. The problem of harassment exists. If I tell 100,000 people we should kick a puppy, or nothing is wrong with kicking puppies, and 10 of those people go out and kick puppies, that message contributed to that harassment. </p>

<p>If those harassing agents think TD is a great place, stop harassing mods, stop manipulating the front page, stop taking the discussions from TD and harassing people in the real world. </p>

<p>The mod team at <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> has been very strict on rule violations.

<p>To add: Trump supporters have gotten their share of &quot;harassment&quot; from regular Reddit users as well. I put that in quotes because I&#39;m hesitant to call mean words harassment, but spez seems to think that&#39;s okay to do, so what about everyone calling Trump supporters racist, misogynist, xenophobic, islamophobic, etc., for the last year?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No need for me to site sources. Go to TD and look for posts and ask if it entails harassing others or are there posts that are violations of TOS. Every day you can go to that sub. </p>

<p>Sources don&#39;t need to be cited. Go there, right now. </p>

<p>As of recently I&#39;ve seen calls for attacks on TD mods the community didn&#39;t like, attacks against spez, attacks against Clinton an Stein. I have seen posts of them reveling in Jill Stein on suicide watch, attacking private businesses and individuals without evidence and based simply on heresay.</p>

<p>TD calls for witch hunt and a witch hunt is initiated. </p>

<p>Just go there, daily. When people say toxic, check the sub for signs of hate, intolerance, ignorance, cooperation with other political parties and views.</p>

<p>How does TD feel about the republican leadership and what is said there? </p>

<p>How many attacks against politicians have you seen called for? I regularly see them say they&#39;re targeting &#39;x&#39; person next for being a cuck.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what people are talking about. They are taking a discussion forum, gave toxicity support and fed it, picked some witch hunts, and set the subscribers loose. </p>

<p>If you have no idea what I&#39;m talking about, you either don&#39;t go to the sub often, or are an idiot for not remembering it. </p>
