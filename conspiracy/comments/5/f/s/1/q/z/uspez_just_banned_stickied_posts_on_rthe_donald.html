<p>CTR was hired by the Clinton Campaign around 2014 for two reasons:</p>

<p>1) Create talking points for surrogates and Clinton allies to push on the major networks</p>

<p>2) to aggregate talking points surrogates, opponents, and allies pushed on the major networks.</p>

<p>They were then paid by the campaign during 2016 to push similar talking points online. </p>

<p>That is not the reason T_D&#39;s stickies no longer reach <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. They would switch out new posts every 20-60 minutes and these posts would spam <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think &quot;&#39;can&#39; be used against them&quot; is optimistic. The writing is on the wall, in a manner of speaking, and both President Obama and President-elect Trump are in favor of more governmental control over news and social media.  Isn&#39;t it convenient that censorship issues are being decided now while both &quot;sides&quot; of the American people are still bitterly divided over the election?  The strategy is to keep us fighting each other and not questioning or challenging the leaders who are taking away our First Amendment rights.  I like to think it&#39;s the first of all the amendments because it&#39;s the most critical in ensuring and maintaining democracy.  Here it is, in case you haven&#39;t read it in a while (better read it now before it&#39;s scrubbed from history):   Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</p>

<p>Notice the word &quot;ABRIDGING&quot;?  I believe that taking down private websites and blogs is abridging our freedom of speech.</p>

Just because censorship is being done on behalf of a private entity instead of the government doesn&#39;t make it any less distasteful for proponents of the open exchange of ideas.  Reddit is supposed to be a neutral platform, that is how they&#39;ve almost always postured it, that is the point of reddit.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, If a group is using a feature as an exploit, it&#39;s fixing the functionality of the site, rather than censorship. Was this implemented across all subs or just T_D? If it&#39;s the latter, it&#39;s a little messed up... But I still get it. Instead of filtering the sub out, I would like to see the T_D that actually make the front page, but seeing every Damn Twitter announcement donald makes just because they are forcing it to the top is just stupid. As seen right now, they are on the front page (multiple posts), so saying they are &#39;censored&#39; is a bit of an overstatement.</p>

<p>Edit: Also if it is the latter, they really should just implement that sticky rule across all subs.</p>

If their &quot;message&quot; is to ruin Reddit for everyone else and manipulate their posts to the top everyday then yes that should be stopped. The rules didn&#39;t need to be changed before because no major sub was abusing the system to completely dominate r/all.

<p>If reddit were to change the rules or how the site works in general to fix that issue then that would be fine. But what they are doing is not right. To single out one sub to prevent them from using the site in a way that other subs are allowed to use it is the wrong solution.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what they did though, they changed the system so that only 3 posts per sub can be at the top of r/all, because r/the_donald had like 15 at the top at almost all times, it made r/all literally unusable at times. They also added filtering so you can filter any sub from r/all. The only special restriction on r/the_donald is that they can&#39;t sticky every post to get it to the top. This isn&#39;t just because the admins don&#39;t like r/the_donald, this is because they abused stickying in a way no other sub does to constantly have specific posts at the top.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not censorship to stop posts from a sub from showing up on r/all. The sub is the same, and people can go check it out if they want. People don&#39;t like to see posts from r/the_donald because it&#39;s a toxic community that&#39;s super agressive and mean. Why push them on people?</p>

<p>As for hating a group of people, what did they expect? Regardless of the various reasons people support Trump, he represents some very ugly things, and having to see the darker side of our culture emerge again is horrifying to most people. </p>

<p>They&#39;re not being propagandized into hating rural white males, they&#39;re being propagandized into using that hate to ignore that this is a class issue, and we&#39;re all in the same class. Then again, the angry rural white males have been propagandized into thinking brown people from other countries are the  reason they&#39;re broke, and that they need a slimy real estate goon flanked by white supremacists and kooks to change the system by working with Wall Street bankers and the GOP establishment to MAGA.</p>

<p>When the hate dies down, and the Trump supporters realize they&#39;ve been duped, we&#39;re going to have to start working together to fix this shit.</p>

You wouldn&#39;t turn around and go &quot;oh well that&#39;s neat, suzie go ahead and play outside with mr. Friendly neighbor&quot; no you&#39;d keep your daughter inside and the fuck away from the sicko next door. I&#39;m sorry, but this is fucking bullshit that I even have to argue why pedophilia is wrong. You&#39;ll get outraged when you hear about someone fucking toddlers, but then turn around and say <em>why?</em> </p>

<p>What&#39;s illegal? I&#39;m asking specifically about pedophilia (<em>attraction</em> to children), not molestation or pornography.</p>

<p>What about pedophilia is &quot;completely wrong&quot;?</p>

However, it created a haven of pedos who then would then PM each other illegal content, which <em>does break the law.</em> And also, the sub got the attention of the mainstream media, and the site got called out for harboring pedos and such, so the admins also banned it to save face and not seem like the site was being used for illegal purposes.

 It&#39;s not about what&#39;s morally correct, it&#39;s about what they think the majority of their users would prefer to see. They&#39;re creating a bubble for hard-left millennials. If they keep going down this path, it&#39;s going to lead to a mass exodus, and while that might be great for those who stay, it&#39;s going to murder Reddit&#39;s page ranking etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I respect that opinion. It&#39;s certainly dangerous as it forces you into a situation where you must be skeptical... lest you be led about like a child.

<blockquote>
<p>Allowing child exploiters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Someone that believes the legal age of marriage should be lowered is not exploiting children. People that are exploiting children, in a verifiable, provable way, are engaging in illegal acts, and I think we can agree that that shouldn&#39;t be &quot;openly tolerated&quot; but regardless of what people want... it will still exist.</p>

<p>I agree that a site like Reddit must comply with the legal requirements of the country allowing them to reside there. It sucks, at times, when that movie you wanted to see is on youtube just long enough for you to watch it get banned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for the sake of what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Free speech, freedom of expression, freedom to imagine and communicate with others. Those fundamental things that allow us to collaborate, for &quot;good or bad&quot; that also allow us to witch hunt, to give in times of need, and to criticize whomever we choose.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not why...</p>

<p>Why do we have to defend those that we deem reprehensible? That doesn&#39;t seem logical?</p>

<p>Because we have no way of determining what will be popular/unpopular speech, tomorrow. We don&#39;t know if this next idea is something humanity needs, or not. And if we start closing doors with some &quot;moral certainty&quot; we cheapen the whole of mankind. We literally retard ourselves, and our ability to imagine (And yes, I mean imagine anything) as a species, for the sake of sensibility or whatever it will be called.</p>

<p>When we are allowed to freely think, and express those thoughts, we are able to communicate as a species. And that&#39;s probably our most important asset. We can communicate and think about amazing things (Take that dog!) We can discuss them and decide whether or not such things should be allowed (legal/illegal/acceptable/bannable.) and we grow as a species, and as individuals.</p>

<p>The moment we decide &quot;Hey, you can&#39;t depict Mohammed&quot; we eliminate a portion of mankind (&quot;Good, they&#39;re reprehensible!&quot;) we restrict the ability of individuals to express themselves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s for these reasons that I equate censorship, with genocide, for they have the same goal. Control over mankind, in some limited form or fashion. One appears to be nice, formal, about ideas and expression. The other is a violent reaction that usually stems from hate or ignorance (or the combination thereof.) However, they are merely facets of the same stone.</p>

<p>The legal age of marriage and consent has been steadily increasing as the psychological understanding of the human mind has gotten better to determine when is a person old enough to make the decision for themselves. Even 18 years old is just barely there. The discussion can take place but the posting of pictures can not as it&#39;s illegal. Jailbait was banned because it depicted numerous girls that were of dubious ages, some very obviously below 18. No significant discussion of laws or legality of the age of consent or marriage was had there. The majority of posts was for material with pornographic intents. Your whole defense of it was pedantic. The discussions can be had, there hasn&#39;t been a popular message board discussing pedophilia as a topic that has been censored, only subreddits that have disseminated it. And the people that cry free speech are ridiculous to expect the administration not to shut down subreddits that proliferate things that are legally child pornography.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The legal age of marriage and consent has been steadily increasing as the psychological understanding of the human mind has gotten better to determine when is a person old enough to make the decision for themselves. Even 18 years old is just barely there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a difficult problem, because the fact is, some people are not &quot;psychologically ready&quot; for marriage when they are 30. Some are ready for such when they are 15. Edge cases will exist.</p>

<p>So this problem is one of finding a close approximation somewhere between those edges. And that is something that the society should have a say in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The discussion can take place but the posting of pictures can not as it&#39;s illegal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily. Posting an image of a girl under the age of 18 is not illegal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jailbait was banned because it depicted numerous girls that were of dubious ages, some very obviously below 18.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost, but not quite. It contained &quot;suggestive&quot; images of girls under the age of 18. And that is illegal in certain US jurisdictions... and to avoid a lawsuit... goodbye sub.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a business, and reddit knew quite well that they were profiting from the ad revenue generated by that single sub. But they also knew the social implications. IMO, they played their hand quite well, on <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a>&#39;s removal.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean that the sub ACTUALLY allowed illegal content. The &quot;suggestive&quot; term was never fully determined by a court of law, therefore no evidence of that crime ever surfaced for such proceedings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No significant discussion of laws or legality of the age of consent or marriage was had there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the comment section, sure... such discussions were had. But that was not a stated goal of the subreddit. You&#39;re just assuming what the userbase wanted using generalizations. They were individual subscribers there for a myriad of reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The majority of posts was for material with pornographic intents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Calls for what might be deemed suggestive material, had it ever come to that. Since it never did, your comment is hearsay. (Law is a bitch.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your whole defense of it was pedantic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would bet so. Will you accuse me of being literate, next?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The discussions can be had, there hasn&#39;t been a popular message board discussing pedophilia as a topic that has been censored, only subreddits that have disseminated it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also untrue, even in the case of the <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a> sub. You&#39;re just selectively mis-remembering like a sweaty Arkansas governor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the people that cry free speech are ridiculous to expect the administration not to shut down subreddits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No... you completely miss the point. What actions reddit takes, are for the good of their own private &quot;individual.&quot; Reddit can&#39;t take away our free speech, they can merely censor us on their platform. They provide a platform for [stuff] and as long as that [stuff] doesn&#39;t cause trouble, it is allowed.</p>

<p>If they ban all subreddits tomorrow, that&#39;s totally within their rights. It would be a shit storm, but that&#39;s their decision to make.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>subreddits that proliferate things that are legally child pornography.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again, you use the same false delusion to &quot;prove your point.&quot; What you think happened, clashes with recorded history. Resolve that inconsistency so we can actually discuss this.</p>

The JDIF and pro-settler zionists have been astroturfing this place, r/politics, r/news, r/worldnews for atleast as long as I&#39;ve been active here (around three years). There have even been subreddits whose soul purpose is to ridicule and brigade anti-Israeli posts and comments.

I don&#39;t know anything about spez as a person, but that move was straight out of the israeli/ sjw propaganda playbook.  use the backwards apology to play victim and cast blame for your actions elsewhere.  that is a really slimey narcissistic sociopath move.</p>

<p>If you have a good reason to censor (and I personally believe you have to manage the trolls), then please do so transparently.  But to combine a fake apology with some sort of feigned victimization to enact a policy is a strategy we see again and again from certain identity groups, and i think it&#39;s very telling.</p>

<p>edit:  did they just change the comment points algorithm?  Because the format just changed for the points on my comments in most threads.  some thread it still says &quot;points&quot;, but in most it does not- it&#39;s just a number.  i think this happened in the last hour.</p>

<p>No, they just happen to have an average of 6k points on all their first-page threads, while having bellow 100 comments on half of them. On a subreddit with 300k subscribers. And when the top rated comment on all of those threads doesn&#39;t have more than 100 upvotes. </p>

<p>The front page doesn&#39;t have that many points even on circlejerck subredits with 5+ million subscribers.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to believe that this is normal behaviour and they don&#39;t brigade their own subreddit, I don&#39;t think I will be able to persuade you for anything.</p>

<p>1) I am not aware of any documentation on the approved usage of stickies. The do&#39;s and don&#39;ts should really be posted somewhere to if there are consequences to not following the rules.</p>

<p>2) Any other sub that abuses stickies in the future needs to have their stickies taken away as well. </p>

<p>On the other hand, all users now have access to a feature that used to be locked behind reddit gold: Everybody can now filter <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> for themselves. Filter once on a desktop, and it applies to all platforms.</p>

<p>Brings it into visibility and puts it on the &quot;hot&quot; page. Not everyone browses &quot;new&quot; and upvotes shortly after a thread is created have a much higher vote weight. This results in a thread unnaturally exploding upwards since instead of just the people on /new seeing it, everyone sees it. The front page takes it a step further and often takes the high vote count (relative to time) and launches it up the front page, making it even more visible.</p>

<p>Built on supporting free speech.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing this absurd fallacy is still used the moment a business stops applying their entire guiding business model.</p>

<p>If every shop in the area caters to only red or blue shirts and you create a business that says &quot;we sell to both red <strong>and</strong> blue shirts&quot; and gain a fuckload of business based on that model, i&#39;m afraid the &quot;omg private business!&quot; bullshit doesn&#39;t tend to work.</p>

<p>They can do whatever they want. But guess what? Criticizing them over it <strong>is just as allowed</strong>.</p>

<p>So why are <strong>you</strong> complaining?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Downvote brigading, or just brigading, is when a group of users, generally outsiders to the targeted sub or community, &quot;invade&quot; a specific subreddit or larger community and flood it with downvotes in order to damage karma dynamics on the targeted sub. Users can also be targeted by a downvote brigade in certain situations.</p>

<p>While it often refers to an attack that is intentionally orchestrated by the &quot;brigade&quot;, whose members consist of separate people, it&#39;s also sometimes used to refer to sockpuppet tactics, in which people create extra user accounts for the purpose of acquiring more voting power (this in particular is very very much against reddit rules), or simply an unplanned circlejerk of downvotes against a particular user or community.</p>

<p>edit: spelling</p>

I am not saying HRC was any better, but this man just seems to truely not give a fuck about the country and its values. Plus if there was anything in the articles from MSM that are willfully false then he is totally within his rights to sue the shit out of them.

<p>If this is not the most blatant act of censorship then I don&#39;t know what is</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strongly disagree. Spez has a point. He&#39;s almost always a bumbling, pro-censorship idiot but this time he has a point. Its been known for a while that votes are &quot;weighted up&quot; early on in the post&#39;s lifespan. Making a new post a sticky allows it instant visibility by changing the colour and putting it at the exact top of &quot;hot&quot;, the default sorting, thus allowing it to accumulate an unnatural number of upvotes early on in its lifespan.</p>

<p>As he correctly pointed out, this is causing these posts to unnaturally shoot up to the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> (due to the very high vote weight) and circumvent the normal process. It&#39;s distorting the natural cycle of the website. Active users vote on new, bringing it to rising/hot where it receives additional votes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to remember two things on the matter: if content important to TD is on TD, TD will upvote it. This doesn&#39;t disable that, it just enforces the natural cycle of the website. Likewise, this doesn&#39;t actually disable TD&#39;s ability to get to the front page. What this <em>does</em> disable is the ability of the ~50 moderators of TD to hand pick what reaches the front page. </p>

<p>What I do have a problem with is that they chose to selectively block TD on the matter (no other sub has had stickies censored) because, while I appreciate the sentiment that others aren&#39;t doing this, it&#39;s still a lazy solution. Weighting votes differently on a sticky&#39;d topic would be better. Likewise, <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5fu2bn/something_suspicious_is_happening_with_our_rall/">this claim</a> from TD is deeply concerning.</p>

<p>But &quot;most blatant act of censorship&quot; is a joke. Remember them putting subreddits under quarantine? Even on reddit, limiting the appearance of stickies on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> isn&#39;t even a drop in the bucket. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best way would be to use a system that proportions the amount of upvotes differently  to equally distribute each subs user base likliness to reach the front page. Ie: If the donald users upvote 5x more than R/finance, require 5x more upvotes that R/Finance to hit the front page. Make the system equal. The reason the donald spammed the upvotes is because they were censored throughout the election. I agree that their techniques are annoying, but they are just trying to show that they aren&#39;t racist,misogynist, xenophobes. </p>

<p>By the way they are actually a good group of people, with only a few bad apples. They are just being annoying because nobody allowed them to speak freely through-out the election, and now they are retaliating.  </p>

<p>They limit the anything that is under 20 years. However, they are dealing with history/information and are posting facts, not opinions. But if you state your negative opinion about Trump in the donald what happens?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does TwoX allow posts that aren&#39;t about women and women&#39;s issues?</p>

<p>From what I just read they allow everyone to post there. In addition, while they are centered on women, they allow room for debate/discussion. But if you state your negative opinion about Trump in the Donald and want to debate what happens?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does HistoryPorn allow photos taken in modern times?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Refer to what I said about Askahistorian as it is applicable.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s talk about how if you have a dissenting view/opinion in the trump forum how you can be banned. I can understand if the place was &quot;for all things&quot; trump but you can&#39;t even criticize the man, constructive or not, without being banned. And let&#39;s not forget that they label people as SJW. <strong>NONE</strong> of the subs you just mentioned prohibit people or give them labels that are meant to be inflammatory. </p>

<p>You are asking people who are pro-Trump to promote anti-Trump material and they just don&#39;t freaking have to do that.  They want their safe space to worship their icon and they are entitled to it.  Want to complain about it?  Make your own sub-reddit.  That&#39;s what they are here for.</p>

<p>The Trump sub can be pro Trump, I get it, but when you&#39;re denying others the right to post then that&#39;s s problem.</p>

<p>That&#39;s censorship. Doesn&#39;t matter if pro Hillary or pro Trump supporters do it. And guess what? Reddit is a privately held company, so if the Trump supporters feel a certain way, they can go make their own website and continue their operations. </p>
