<p>Could be that our country can&#39;t exist without a banking system... so we gotta keep one of &#39;em kicking around for the future... especially if yer gonna run off every other vulture bank that has been picking at our bones... Maybe GS has been chosen as the one best suited to roll over and be a good dog. </p>

<p>Are you suggesting that Goldman Sachs has some kind of special knowledge and experience?  They don&#39;t.  They literally do 2 things, they perform quanitative easing, someting that sounds smart but it&#39;s not, a child could undestand--it&#39;s really cutting your brownie pan in half again as more kids show up to the party; and changing the federal interest rate for banks to borrow money  that&#39;s the gas and brakes...and somehow they need a freaking PHD and fancy words for it.  The great greenspan meddled with these two things in different ways and mucked up the economy both times, and yet was applauded as some kind of economic hero. He wasn&#39;t! He was experimenting.  And we all got to take part in the clinical trial the size fo the population!</p>

<p>I know to you this will sound very simple, it&#39;s a lay understanding, but you have to admit that in a reductionist way, I&#39;m right about it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you dont need to teach me. i graduated as an economist from one of the top unis and subsequently went to work in the field of finance...all whilst being a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; since i was a teenager. </p>

<p>tell me would it make you feel better if it was someone from CitiBank? or JP Morgan? Or does it have to be a small mom and pop type rural bank or something? </p>

<p>Or someone with no industry experience? career politician? </p>

<p>to tell me that it may seem simple etc is so fucking condescending. dont make assumptions about people who you are talking with.</p>

<p>edit: sorry if i misunderstood you and you werent being condescending. really early hours so vision literally blurry lol. </p>

<p>all im trying to say is that not everyone works at banks because theyre evil. for many its just a way of making money and seeing all the things wrong about it from the inside. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, I didn&#39;t mean to insult <em>you</em> but rather the federal reserve and its hallowed status.  Sorry if I made you feel like you didn&#39;t have worth in the world, but that wasn&#39;t my intention and I think you assuming that&#39;s what I intended is a fault of yours not mine.  And I&quot;m not wrong about QE being an easy concept, nor am I wrong about the interest rate.  I&#39;m sorry you can&#39;t just agree with me on taking a broad view.  I never said everyone who works banking is evil.  Not sure where you&#39;re getting that. But I do think &gt;10% interest is usury, nearly every fucking person outside of banking agrees, and yet all banks do that so, you can resolve that however you want</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry you misunderstood me again:</p>

<p>1) i know what QE. I am saying that i am an economist by education and work in finance
2) GS dont do QE themselves.
3) QE is a very easy concept to understand.
4) Everything about the current system is - Fractional reserve banking, QE, EVERYTHING IS EASY - especially for people like me
5) The implications of low/negative interest rates are EASY for me to understand - again look above why.
6) I do NOT disagree that QE, fiat money etc are bad and are  causing problems</p>

<p>WHAT I AM saying is that you cant assume everyone who works at a bank is an evil mastermind.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve hated Rothschilds etc since i was a teenager. Skipping out on a job interview for them to work at M&amp;A was one of things i still regret. Id still jump in a heart beat to go back  to uni and work at Goldman Sachs.</p>

<p>You know why? Because for the first 5-10 years its simply a job and experience. Sure you might be around people who influence the wya you grow up thinking but tbh liberal american college does that as it is.</p>

<p>Most people just learn the technical skills, the relationship building aspects etc then jump to corporate or w/e. You cant simply say they are all evil.</p>

<p>Also, where are you getting the 10% figure from? Current Fed interest rates are 0.5%. I think you are a bit confused. you seem to not like QE which comes at v.low IR and also dislike v.high IR? </p>

<p>What is your educational background besides conspiracy theories? Now im not using this as an insult because ive prob read all the same books about the 1913 Fed act, the start of Rothschilds, conspiracy to destroy gold standard etc AND AGREE WITH THAT SHIT....like i dont believe in &quot;independent&quot; central banks and money printing and massive inflation, bubbles etc. but it seems to me you are making assumptions on people (e.g. your GS comment) without having a knowledge of the industry.</p>

<p>banks like GS are very diff from the Fed. They perform a number of services such as Corporate Finance (M&amp;A advisory) and do Equity &amp; debt capital markets work (selling equity, selling debt), do equity research etc.</p>

<p>The fact that you think GS prints US money is funny. Although they undoubtedly profit from it. </p>

<p>Yes I agree you know so much more than I do about banking, given that I don&#39;t work in finance.  And not to insult you but I find it terribly uninteresting, so you win, whatever it was you are saying.  I really don&#39;t care. What we agree on is that the fed is evil, that&#39;s enough</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rothschilds are Jesuits.  It&#39;s not a surprise.  We knew that Hillary and Trump were both Jesuits (so it wasn&#39;t an election but a selection of two bad choices) but we chose Trump because he wasn&#39;t a decades long criminal gangster that wanted to nuke a bunch of innocent people while the other guy wanted to waste money that comes from the ether anyway to build a wall we don&#39;t need.</p>

<p>The Jesuits are pedos, drug dealers, warmakers, kingmakers, and assassins</p>

<p>That&#39;s why pizzagate is being shunted off.  It&#39;s become pizza-priestogate and again nothing will happen even though the R in rome stands apparently for rape</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones always came off as a sensationalist that played on outrage and shock value. He seems to have started off with the intent of exposing the elite purely, but may have been bought off at some point. I haven&#39;t been following closely and can&#39;t say I know this guys history altogether. I was always skeptical to Inforwars and stopped listening once it became evident they were pushing the same &#39;divide and conquer&#39; tactic you see everywhere. They have some people in their panel that <em>really</em> get under my skin, well mostly this one guy, I don&#39;t know his name. Inforwars as of right now is basically: &quot;Everything bad bad bad, bad government, muslims migrants are coming be very afraid, Justin Bieber wants you to hand over your guns, also here comes a horde of huns from the eurasian steppes as well, Michelle Obama has a penis. I&#39;m going to keep shouting in order to appeal to the lowest common denominator until everyone agrees, raah raah raah.&quot; More polarization and deviating from the main objective in my opinion. Get people on board to to oppose the establishment, only lure them into another establishment, or the same one with a different face,</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t these guys just come off as a part of one of the political wings? Is it just me?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not implying that everyone who listens to him are dumb, far from it. I get the appeal, and he might be right about a couple or a number of things. I don&#39;t see any reason to trust him though. I don&#39;t think his intentions and motives lie where they&#39;re needed, at least not anymore. He basically runs a eccentric news show and creates revenue(?), can&#39;t muster trust for these guys.</p>
