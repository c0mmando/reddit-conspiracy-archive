        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For the past month, I&#39;ve seen only a few posts (not even a dozen) about Standing Rock. Everything is being buried by PizzaGate this and PizzaGate that, a conspiracy that is a just a rehash of the Satanic Panic of the 80&#39;s. Yes, child trafficking does happen. But if there was some global elite conspiracy to do it, they would not leave such an obvious trail. It took decades to pop the lid on what the Catholic Church had been covering up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at Standing Rock...</p>

<p>They are facing eviction by any means necessary. The police have blockaded the camps and refuse to let aid workers and supplies into the camps. The government has sent in agent saboteurs. The oil company has hired private military contractors to harass the protestors by setting fires and spraying them with chemicals. It&#39;s only a matter of time until live ammo is used.</p>

<p>But today I see all of ONE post on Standing Rock. The rest are &quot;OMG YOU GUYS BREAKING PIZZAGATE NEWS!!&quot; that end up just being incoherent ramblings about Satanic rituals most of the time.</p>

<p>This sub has been compromised by a psyop. Leave it while you still can, before it takes hold of your brain. Stuff that started this whole PizzaGate stuff was purposely put in the emails on WikiLeaks, WikiLeaks has been compromised since this past summer, nothing from there can be trusted anymore. There are other websites that are focusing on bad shit that is actually going on, like the global elites intent to cause environmental catastrophe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate does the same thing, you can find post after post literally telling people we should stop paying attention to anything but Pizzagate. Most of the posts related to pizzagate are regular pedo crimes with the words &#39;pizza&#39; and &#39;global elite pedo circle satan&#39; stuffed into the title yet present no proof whatsoever of any connection, almost as if every single sex crime involving minors happened on the orders of the same people.</p>

<p>Odd that I don&#39;t see you decrying &#39;distraction&#39; posts when they actually happen within pizzagate, just when they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Not to mention that, although pizzagate did originate in Wikileaks, the foundation of evidence compiled consists mostly of non-Wikileaks sources/information.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is not a distraction. It is an enormous story. Just because it happened to surface around the time of the DAPL protests does not mean it was conjured to distract the public.</p>

Document the events. Typical psyop</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I am skeptical of PizzaGate because as I said in another post, it has &quot;think of the children&quot; all over it. Which makes me skeptical. They try to ban books which ask their readers to question authority because &quot;think of the children&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well....as bad as the environmental hazard that the pipeline could/will cause and the obvious police state against citizens going on,and looking like escalation is inevitable with that situation..imo...doesn&#39;t compare to children getting raped and killed by network of people of all ranks within ours and other governments....and when you are the law,above the law, and create the law and control the media, &quot;leaving such an obvious trail&quot; isn&#39;t as big a concern...it has been going on for decades, and hasn&#39;t stopped..it&#39;s not a &quot;re-hash&quot;.....what lacked before was the internet, Wikileaks, Assange, an election that has oozed corruption to the top, and most importantly thousands of amateur detectives and researches across the globe all sharing research in real time with a common goal of exposing this evil against kids...peoples eyes are opening...both situations should warrant all of our attention.</p>
