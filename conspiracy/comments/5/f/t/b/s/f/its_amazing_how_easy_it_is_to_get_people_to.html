    <div class="md"><p>Slippery slopers seem to have taken over the leftist/liberal identity in the past few years. There used to be a real effort, or at least the perception of an effort, to be the &quot;intellectual&quot; position, but recently it seems as if they&#39;ve thrown any thought out the window in an attempt to live by the feels.</p>

<p>This trend is directly responsible for the so called alt right which basically rejects everything the emotional liberal espouses. </p>

<p>I do see a lot of the regressive left though. I am just trying to be honest here. I think the MSM has sensationalized something that really doesn&#39;t exist. At least in the way they are portraying it. Are there white people who are proud of their country? Of course. Does that make them white nationalists? Well I guess...but they are trying brainwash the average person into believing white nationalist = KKK = 4th reich. </p>

<p>It is complete and utter propaganda and brain washing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so sad to see how easily people will jump on bandwagons of hate. So what the subreddit figured out a way to exploit the voting system to reach <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>? You have a &quot;frontpage&quot; option on all platforms to only show subreddits you want to see. I use this, along with visiting <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> maybe every few days just to see what&#39;s up, idk man. I am so confused. It seems like when people are most divided is when they crave for rules to establish stability, they don&#39;t give a shit what freedoms they&#39;re taking away from other people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you guys are talking about the_donald,  the people there and the mods also ban anyone who <em>in any way</em> expresses an opinion or states a fact that they don&#39;t like to see - you&#39;re banned instantly for any questioning - so why is it any different when the site-wide &quot;mods&quot; (admins) do the same thing to them? How is this different? This entire situation is such a great example of why the_donald is being banned from the frontpage, they are like <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a>, only they are centered around shared support for a billionaire Clinton donor and family friend / Bill&#39;s golf buddy, Donald Trump.</p>

<p>treating it as if it&#39;s an attack on &#39;freedom of speech&#39; is just ridic. How is it any different from what the people in the_donald do? If this post was in the_donald, I&#39;d be banned, but I already am banned for asking about the fact trump is a clinton donor and family friend who was set up to &quot;run against&quot; a Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BINGO [] they are young and have just been red-pilled or whatever the fuck kids are calling it these days. Two sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>Trump threw out a lot of truths in his campaign without any history or pretext to explain the entire situation, just like Alex Jones does all the time. You are going to see a lot of people jumping to conclusions and a lot of people getting emotions involved. It&#39;s completely normal and it happened in the conspiracy circuits in the days leading up to, and the days after 9/11. I was 16-17 when 9/11 happened and already heavily into the conspiracy circuit in every aspect of my life. I saw it happen then and I&#39;m seeing it again today. The only tip I have to offer for a situation like this is EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION, and in this day and age everybody must educate themselves. I am 100% serious you MUST educate yourself, trust no one, do your own research, come to your own conclusions. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to get upset about the donald fan club or whatever but you must always remember, you were once like them and back then, you didn&#39;t have an outlet like this sub. Back then you couldn&#39;t even talk about it on the internet without getting put on a no-fly list. Now the no-fly list is so big it&#39;s completely irrelevant, they have moved on and so should we. Push the next big button that moves humanity forward, forget about the history of divisiveness that controls all of us. We are all equals; nobody here chose to be born, so everybody get off your high horse or low horse and start cooperating towards the common good. Only the truth can lead us to common good and a symbiotic relationship with our planet.</p>

<p>This is not directed at the parent commenter just a general statement for truth today. Clarifying in advance.</p>

<p>Another Clarification: I don&#39;t mean young as an age-term. I&#39;ve seen 60+ year old men and women wake up to the truth overnight and have the same issues any human would at any age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did the conspiracy community have an influx of new members on both occasions? I can imagine that it did in the aftermath of 9/11 obviously, just maybe not right away. </p>

<p>I&#39;m asking because I get the impression that there has been a large number of right wing oriented individuals that has caught wind of it recently, especially considering Alex Jones. </p>

<p>I wish people would set aside their political filters temporarily, whichever wing or allegiance, and open up more for seeing what is possibly going on and take it for what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there was a huge influx of people as early as that very night, I remember staying up all night reading about it and just sleeping in school the next day. With that influx came a lot of jumping to conclusions and misconstruing facts. (I was also guilty of this)</p>

<p>I mean just look at the events of that day, you&#39;d be crazy NOT to ask questions because it was painfully obvious they were hiding evidence and the media was flat out lying to us. You are absolutely correct though on the political wing bullshit. Most people researching conspiracies already knew Clinton was trash (Democrat) and everybody knows GW Bush is trash (Republican) so I would say from memory, there was very rarely an argument about which of the 2 parties is better, because they were both so fucking deplorable. Everyone just wanted the truth and the folks responsible to be put behind bars. A crime is a crime no matter what your allegiance is.</p>

<p>The biggest influx came after the 1st edition of Loose Change was released. So many new people looking into all types of conspiracies after that came out. &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; it may have been a different documentary than loose change, I&#39;m pulling this from memory sorry.</p>

<p>I suspect stepping in and parroting a headline from Washington Post / New York Times that is questionable and unsupported, without bringing any additional sources to learn from, is not going to go over well. Most of those engaging in the Donald have been shouted down for months on end when engaging in other political subs. They&#39;re tuned in to the types of approach used to drown out conversation rather than foster it, and resist that.</p>

<p>are you kidding me? dude, that&#39;s <em>exactly</em> what the donald people are doing. That&#39;s the whole point that&#39;s being made here! How are you missing that? They are supporting censorship until it&#39;s them and their garbage that gets censored. <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> shouldn&#39;t be used as a place for individuals in a trump fanclub to promote their e-drama, and they censor everything they don&#39;t like, and they are now unhappy that the same thing is being done to them on a lesser scale.</p>

<p>trump is a clinton donor and family friend and he was set-up to co-opt and manage the &#39;anti establishment&#39; sentiment that has been brewing in the US, he is all the things you think he isn&#39;t, same as obama. You are all free to spam each other about how great your favorite Clinton donor is on your own forum. You suppress freedom of speech there, and now you are upset when the same thing is being done to you by the very people whose posts you delete and ban / suppress for not liking what they say on your forum. This is a completely stupid argument.</p>

<p>&quot;spez is censoring us we can&#39;t stand for this breach of freedom of speech! censorship is wrong!&quot;</p>

<p>maybe if you don&#39;t want people to censor you, don&#39;t do the same thing to everyone else. On top of it they then cry and attempt to concern-troll to everyone else who you all attempt to censor that &quot;you&#39;re being censored omg omfg freedom of speech omg spez omg this is my website omfg this is my safespace spez violated my safespace freedom of speech freedom&quot; while they literally censor and ban every single thing on the_donald that isn&#39;t some suck-up to the  glorious leader   Clinton donor and family friend Trump. Meanwhile they pretend to be on a great freedom of speech crusade while being persecuted by the evil <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a>. </p>

<p>forgive the rest of reddit for not taking it seriously. consider that maybe you are free to control and censor your own circlejerk subreddit, and the owners and admins of reddit are free to censor the rest of reddit for the benefit of their users and shareholders. Seems rational to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>banned most likely for going off topic on a sub like any other sub . Bots would either auto delete your post or an admin would and if you repeat you get banned. You just don&#39;t seem to wrap your head around the fact that /all is \all it means ALL. i can go and talk about the hair on my butthole that keeps poking me in ALL because its an ALL topic front page.  Protest /the_donald by all means just do it on another sub and maybe if you make a point  people will upvote you to the front page.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I&#39;m supporting responsible freedom of speech. Rights that come with responsibilities.</p>

<p>Is that unreasonable? Because that&#39;s what that sub was supposed to be about since it&#39;s a very basic rightist value. And well... it&#39;s so logical that pretty anyone no matter their political POV will agree with.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry my dear, I did not comment about puppies on a car sub.</p>

<p>Maybe the real issue is the mods there are a bit confused since they got 2 main topics, and now one is overshadowing the main mission of that sub. Usually I think people create a new sub for the new trend/topic to avoid that kind of issue. </p>

<p>There&#39;s some dissonance in their banning and that also shows where the priority is. It&#39;s not Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, give most people a target and then make them feel like they are justified in hating that target. Most people will jump at the chance. Why?</p>

<p>Because strong emotions are very seductive. There&#39;s a kind of pleasure that goes along with just letting go and experiencing any emotion full force.</p>

<p>As for censorship? What we&#39;re seeing is censorship being dressed up as making people free from &quot;hate speech&quot; or &quot;fake news&quot; or any other kind of speech that&#39;s inconvenient to TPTB. </p>

<p>They&#39;re offering us censorship and tricking us into thinking it&#39;s freedom. Most people are so fucking stupid they&#39;re actually <em>begging</em> for it.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t seem to mind a little censorship until <em>they&#39;re</em> the ones that get censored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does that work when the anti-censorship people use brutal banning and censorship themselves on the people who don&#39;t agree with them and were there for the main topic of the sub?</p>

<p>How does that work? Should they not be banned or censored? I agree those mods should just grow some balls and let people comment freely or ignore the post if they are preaching about anti-censorship. What do you think?</p>

<p>PS: Personally, as someone who build, manage and participate in public forums, I do find it&#39;s a good deal to be reasonable. When I go on other&#39;s forums, I do think about the extra work the mods get there if people start going nut; a lot of time they are doing this work out of their own generosity and time. So I respect that. But maybe it&#39;s an empathy that isn&#39;t important here and not appreciated, I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have been forced into one subreddit because to show support for Trump anywhere else on Reddit gets banned or gets hundreds of downvotes so of course they are going to protect their only space.  Especially with CTR overrunning the site.  And why do people keep comparing the actions of the admins affecting the entire site with what the rules are in one subreddit.  It&#39;s a false equivalency logical fallacy and no one is being fooled by it so that you can make people think censorship of the only sub on Reddit that supports the president of the United States is fine because their sub has rules to protect itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You did not answer the question. </p>

<p>In fact you add more content to prove how labeling people &quot;ctr&quot; or &quot;shills&quot; by the crowd can be used as an excuse to censor them. It is a witch hunt based on no scientific data, no social study, no evidence, only the instinct of the leading mass or majority. Medieval wisdom and fairness.</p>

<p>The same way people were lined up and shot for being &quot;imperialist spies&quot; in some very though time... yet we learn now they were mostly intellectuals and normal people, and that all this was actually a purge of the free thinkers.</p>

<p>What is your safeguard that this injustice would not happen with your &quot;failproof instinct&quot;?</p>

<p><strong>So I&#39;m asking again:</strong></p>

<p><strong>How does fighting censorship using censorship works? You either censor or you don&#39;t. That means even &quot;shills&quot; and trolls have a right to free speech.</strong> That means, you need to find another way to control shills or trolls than censoring them. </p>

<p><strong>Otherwise you are just as good as the ones who want to censor you.</strong></p>

<p>How would that work in society? What&#39;s the safeguard that prevents people from being sent to the &quot;guantanamo&quot; of Reddit? How do you know for sure, instinct?</p>

<p>There&#39;s no abea corpus here. No trial. Not even discussion about it on that community (obviously.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Do you understand why we have a justice system, trials, democracy and we don&#39;t let people use their &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;instincts&quot; to judge or punish people in most first world countries?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you are right, I got &quot;removed&quot; from that particular team that is always whining because I actually support their Leader but not what the &quot;agents&quot; are doing with their sabotage of the &quot;group&quot;. Amazingly, the fight is against censorship but censorship is also the weapon used by these &quot;protesters&quot; to make sure the ranks look solid.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing how easy it is to hide your own bias, get rid of the dissidents in a gulag, censor any intellectual debate, have no default downvote button on a theme and then cry about censorship and the potato bugs.</p>

<p>When it&#39;s done well (as it is), you will believe that everybody around you agrees with your ideology and that you are all victims fighting the good cause! </p>

<p>The world from the outside will look at you and think &quot;How come they don&#39;t see the dictatorship and fascism going on? How come they don&#39;t see what&#39;s happening to their people and agree to this restriction of their freedom willingly? Don&#39;t they see the self-destruction?&quot; </p>

<p>And then you discover it&#39;s disinfo, subversion, propaganda and manipulation; it wasn&#39;t the fault of these poor people, they didn&#39;t know! They thought they knew better than the whole world and they were following the ones claiming to want their best interest!</p>

<p>And everybody lost (besides the outside world.)</p>

<p>people are celebrating the ABILITY to filter T_D from all, because the fucking sub exists to piss people off (or jerk off over a political figure). </p>

<p>and they fixed a bug that T_D was exploiting to get stuff on the front page. boo fucking hoo. its about time reddit fought fire with fire.</p>

<p>this aint even censorship for fucks sake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not censorship, it&#39;s fixing something that obviously didn&#39;t work well for what reddit is intended to be used for.</p>

<p>I was a T_D (before they banned me for pointing it out) and I never agreed with their daily outrage lately claiming censorship. It wasn&#39;t fair for the other subs to simply be overshadowed because that sub who grew big quick brought new challenges reddit probably never had to deal with before.</p>

<p>My point is, Trump supporters are always very vocally touting the merits of the constitution (more so than anyone else) and yet they seem to be willing to ignore it solely because the people who are burning these flags at the moment happen to be predominantly Left-wing. </p>

<p>Nope, the media has been painting them in an awful light the whole election, and then they broadcast the protests against Trump like they are some kind of godsend. The media is dividing everyone, along with George Soros, not Trump supporters.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example: Billy is white and Johnny is black. Johnny hit Billy in the arm because Billy was bullying him, typical child stuff. So Billy went and told the teacher, and instead of sending Johnny to the office, she decided to make an announcement to the whole class: <strong>&quot;Racism will not be tolerated! Johnny hit Billy because he is white, and I will not settle for this kind of behavior in my class! We are a peaceful class and we are to get along with one another, not hate one another based on the color of our skin!&quot;</strong> Then the teacher decides to get the principle involved, and they run a school-wide campaign about how racism is wrong, and the other teachers start to notice how kids of different colors have a type of animosity towards one another (they don&#39;t, they&#39;re just kids) and see this is <em>obviously</em> a problem! The teachers would bug the kids and tell them to please accept one another, and then eventually the children began to get annoyed with one another based on skin color because every time they were by one another they would get accused of being racist. </p>

<p>The whole situation wasn&#39;t about race to begin with, but it became that way because people in positions of power kept perpetuating the same message over and over again. Then it eventually became a problem. Of course this is a fabrication, but how stories and events are framed are <strong>very powerful</strong> in how others will receive it; you&#39;re being told how to understand the situation. Just because it is a media source does not make it right, they are human just like the rest of us and are susceptible to bias, especially since they&#39;ve been bought out and have close to no journalistic integrity anymore.</p>

<p>But there is good news, there is always a time to bounce back and get re-centered to focus on real problems, and what time is better than now. It starts with us, not any media or authority telling us how we need to understand one another.</p>
