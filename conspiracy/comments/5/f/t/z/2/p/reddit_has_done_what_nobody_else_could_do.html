<p>Fuck censorship</p>

<p>BTW, many of you know this but it&#39;s only the beginning. This censorship thing is going to get a lot worse, and fast. The &#39;fake news&#39; concept that came out of nowhere - consider it a cog in the machine. It is just one of many increasingly aggressive silencing tactics that are prepped up for when the timing is right, or when they are needed. Their computers analyze our data in ways we can&#39;t imagine, monitoring trends and truths and predicting when and how to suppress things. These tactics wait prepared, ready to be activated at the touch of a button.</p>

<p>As their censorship snowballs it itself inspires more people to seek the truth. This is something those in control of the narrative expect. They are not unprepared for this. But they know it will be a tumultuous battle. That is why I say it is going to get worse fast; the machine has been set in motion. We will always have power but the battle will get a whole lot harder if their efforts succeed.</p>

<p>This is independent of &#39;politics&#39; in front of the curtain. This has little to do with Trump or Clinton, and it doesn&#39;t revolve every 4-8 years.</p>

<p>If this is a battle we want to win, we need to grow, maintain energy, and most importantly get creative. We have to be unpredictable. We will continue to be silenced. One by one, they will attempt to take away our outlets, and if it grows then this one is included. Be prepared for this and use them wisely while we can.</p>

<p>Much love to you all, just ranting.. keep fighting back.</p>

TPTB try to divide everyone as much as possible and T_D is a natural honest response to this kind of manipulation... instead of being repelled and driven asunder they have seen through the bullshit and stick together based on what  they feel in their hearts... and not what the media feeds you to make you full of fear and hate. </p>

<p>Make a post... Why did TD lie, and find just one example, see how long you last. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a vile place. </p>

<p>I check three subs for different reasons. When I feel like educated comments, and normal rational thinking from warm humans, I&#39;ll check out r/politics. When I feel like challenging the accepted norms, thinking outside of the box, making connections, finding novelty, I&#39;ll come to r/conspiracy. When I feel like seeing the worst humanity has to offer, blind following, celebrity worship, hive mind mentality to the fucking 975th degree, what the alt-right believes, I&#39;ll check out r/the_donald. </p>

<p>I probably visit all three every day. </p>

<p>Politics sub is all like, &quot;Trump is bad. Told ya he was corrupt, look at who he appointed, he&#39;s a bad person. Ya all gonna get screwed. Sanders is perfect every way. Glad Clinton is out of the picture.&quot; A little one sided, sure. </p>

<p>Conspiracy sub is all like, &quot;PIZZAGATE! Do we like trump or hate him right now? I&#39;m not quite sure. Just as long as this place doesn&#39;t become TD and worship him. Btw, Clinton is bad. This sub has gone to shit, it&#39;s basically TD 2.0. Here&#39;s a whack conspiracy theory easily resolved by 15 minutes of research. Here&#39;s an actually really interesting piece.&quot; You really have to filter what&#39;s here. Especially since TD leaked here.</p>

<p>The_Donald sub is all like, &quot;Praise God emperor Trump that he may save us all, high energy, nothing can ever stop us, we&#39;re immortal and all powerful. The universe trembles before us. If you don&#39;t believe it, you&#39;re a shill, CTR, sheep, cuck, low energy. Spez is bad. Trump is perfect in every way. Let&#39;s pay more attention to Hillary because she&#39;s still... relevant. trump would have had 99% of the popular vote if only Americans voted. Trump is God. Let&#39;s coordinate harassing people that don&#39;t believe what we believe.&quot; Which is really why they are getting shut down. It&#39;s fine to say shit, whatever. This isn&#39;t about censorship. TD should be shut down for witch hunting, harassing mods, creating a bad climate on reddit, abusing voting systems, using paid bots to upvote their posts on TD (every post just about 5000 upvote regardless of time, quality, or anything else, very weird), sticking to get front paged. </p>

<p>Sometimes I can&#39;t stomach the thought of TD. It&#39;s quite sickening. Visit all three though. Check it out. </p>

<p>what are these truths that the_donald is able to spread? I think reddit as a whole leans quite liberal but having a subreddit that is at the front of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> every hour of every day with shitposts and wild claims about political figures shouldn&#39;t be commentable by only those who agree with their agenda. I would have absolutely no problem with the_donald on the front page or <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> all the time if they didn&#39;t ban everyone who disagreed with them. Its hurting the site as a whole to have a subreddit so popular and in the limelight that cannot have proper discussion. </p>
