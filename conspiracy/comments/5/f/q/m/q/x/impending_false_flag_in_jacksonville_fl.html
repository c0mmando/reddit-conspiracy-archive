<p><a href="http://jacksonville.craigslist.org/tlg/5875982574.html">http://jacksonville.craigslist.org/tlg/5875982574.html</a></p>

<p>Posted by Crisis Cast, a British firm with connections to G4S and the Orlando nightclub shooting </p>

<p><a href="http://crisiscast.com">http://crisiscast.com</a></p>

<p><a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2016/06/18/casting-crisis-orlandos-actors-agents-and-casualty-role-players/">http://21stcenturywire.com/2016/06/18/casting-crisis-orlandos-actors-agents-and-casualty-role-players/</a></p>

<p>Note the ad very specifically mentions all actors must sign NDAs. Also the types of crises they stage: terrorist attacks, natural disasters, virus outbreaks. And they&#39;re offering a pretty tidy compensation for the actors... 35 actors x $240 = $8400 a day minimum. Seems like something only large or well funded groups could afford to stage. Jacksonville is a major military hub. I searched many other major cities in FL and across the US but couldn&#39;t find a single ad for crisis actors or by Crisis Cast.</p>

<p>Does anybody have any info on this? Thoughts of what event might be staged? Can anybody in the area with acting credentials try to get involved and blow the lid on this? The ad was posted 16 days ago and says they are trying to move quickly!</p>

<p>If anyone here ever happens to be in the vicinity of one of these shooting drill hoaxes, please stick around and film and record as much as possible.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The problem is once someone has officially been red pilled and is interested in reality I&#39;d say 9 out of 10 times they stick with it. Those people won&#39;t be fooled and distracted for long and if anything we will be investigating these false flags now more than ever. False flags have to be considered pretty risky for them. With that said I still agree with your point.</p>

I was speaking more about people who are on the cusp, which based on comments and posts i&#39;m seeing around the net is increasing in numbers. A big crisis or other distraction is pretty much the only thing that can disrupt the spread of this info, since their attempts to discredit it as &quot;fake news&quot; backfired on them and way more people are curious about it now</p>

They don&#39;t realize how gullible they are and if I ever remark about how a lot of these are staged events they are quick to call me a retard and assert that no Muslim would ever be used as a patsy because it seemingly contradicts the establishment&#39;s pro-immigration narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it certainly does, but it is also a way to enact stricter gun control and martial law. If the end result is a police state it matters not who the fake terrorist is. And using a Muslim terrorist for whom ISIS always seems to take credit the next day is a way to justify more middle east wars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I buy this for sure. False flag or not, still reason enough to limit/be aggressive on immigration.(besides just following the damn law and progressing nationalism)</p>

<p>But it&#39;s totally crossed my mind that some of these events may be activated agents. If not, willingly bringing terrorists and letting them do their thing lets the establishment peddle their narrative all the same.</p>

<p>I think the awakening of the people is helping here too though. Many have been shaken up enough that people now question and pause, they aren&#39;t so keen on the koolaid. Maybe they aren&#39;t completely red-pilled where first thought is &#39;Possibly False-flag?&#39; but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s beyond reason that many could accept it or easily be encouraged to with a little more incentive.</p>

<p>Of course you still have the far-left &#39;libshits&#39; ready to disarm-_-; but I have a naive hope that they will come around one day. Maybe before the military boots start kicking them in the ass and dragging them away.</p>

<p>Anyway, their agenda is blatantly clear. Especially when you have retards like Tim Kaine and the Rothschild turning on the anti-gun prompter moments after the OSU event.</p>

<p>&quot;Senseless gun violence&quot; and &quot;You must get rid of your second amendment, it is 100% the problem!&quot; </p>

<p>People blew them the fuck out though in response. </p>

<p>9/11, San Bernardino, Nice truck &quot;massacre,&quot; Boston Marathon Bombing, Paris Bataclan shooting, the ISIS beheading videos, Pulse nightclub shooting, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m forgetting some too. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t studied the 7/7 Subway bombing but all the people that I trust and respect think it was a false flag as well so I&#39;m inclined to assume it was.</p>

If a craigslist ad was posted for just the average joe to respond and become a crisis actor, wouldn&#39;t they see this on the news the night after they acted in it and say &quot;Hey! I was there and was acting. I&#39;m going to the media to tell that I was a paid actor.&quot; ?</p>

<p>Multiply that by say 20 actors, and you&#39;d have pretty obvious and damning evidence. Where are the &quot;actors&quot; in these staged events and why don&#39;t they ever speak up with their personal account of it and evidence even on alternative media? That pretty much kills it for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the news isn&#39;t going to report that just like they don&#39;t report anything about Sandy Hook, the Boston Marathon bombing, etc. There&#39;s a mountain of evidence in favor of those and other events being hoaxes, so any major media outlet could put together a special program exposing these things and get millions of viewers but they don&#39;t anyway because they&#39;re complicit in covering for government chicanery.</p>

<p>As far as the crisis actors, I believe most of them have to sign non-disclosure agreements and are compensated for their time. So they fear legal trouble or other retribution if they speak out.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that false flags happen, it&#39;d be dumb not to. But these days I feel like the second any large attack happens some people immediately think &quot;How can a I fit the pieces together to support that this is a false flag&quot;, instead of thinking &quot;I&#39;m going to approach this with an open mind and see what conclusion it leads me to, and realize that a lack of data doesn&#39;t mean I should start supplying my own as fact.&quot; </p>

<p>This thread however is okay because it&#39;s collecting information before the fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, when 9/11 happened many readily accepted the official versions from news outlets that were interviewing &quot;experts&quot; who were providing us with the official facts that lead us to the war in Afghanistan and Iraq which still continues today... Two of these people who benefited from 9/11 and the continuing warfare that helped give the official narrative were Bernard Bailey &quot;Bernie&quot; Kerik and L. Paul Bremmer. In all of the chaos and despair of a large attack or false flag it is easy to believe what is provided to you. But as time went on, people looked into this and there was a lot of evidence of 9/11 being a coordinated false flag that we are still living in the consequences of. Now that people are becoming more aware, like myself, they are not willing to let their emotion of an event cloud their judgement and they start collecting evidence. Some evidence is alarming to learn about.

    <div class="md"><p>I know it sounds false because maybe it is, but I&#39;ll send a podcast that lays some facts out, and allows you the citizen to think critically. Some points are the San Bernardino shooting, the wife was supposedly around 100 lbs and some witnesses at the shooting say that 3 big white paramilitary men were the ones shooting. At an attack in Paris, I think one of the places that was hit during Bataclan, a limo pulled up and 3 big white paramilitary men came out and fired bullets. Omar Mateen, has an interesting family and connection to the US. He was the son of a former afghani presidential runner, who has connected to opium and worked with the US Gov&#39;t but then had grievances and spoke out at some time before. Omar Mateen fired 200 bullets and hit 202 people, that is some L337 pwn accuracy right there. Then we also never have much CCTV (camera footage) at a lot of these, somehow they failed and we don&#39;t have a lot of mobile videos or photos. I&#39;m not saying people don&#39;t die at these false flags because they do, but a lot of evidence shows the capability of these so called shooters are amazing and witnesses will claim it is some paramilitary thug, yet the suspects end up dying in the process. A lot of these shooters were connected to the FBI or investigated even before the event. Well a podcast that opened my eyes to this, that lets you think critically and not accept some vague narrative is: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/guns-and-butter-1/recent-false-flags-kevin-barrett-352">https://soundcloud.com/guns-and-butter-1/recent-false-flags-kevin-barrett-352</a></p>

<p>In Jacksonville, and haven&#39;t seen/heard anything about any upcoming drills here-usually, if its a public drill (or at least held in public) there&#39;s some media attention/announcement.</p>

<p>If I had to guess based on the lack of information in the local media, I&#39;d say a mass casualty drill at one of the local bases- NAS Jax, Mayport, maybe Camp Blanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These things happen all the time to train first responders. As for the NDA, if they pulled off a fake terrorist attack and tried to pull the wool over the eyes of the public convincing them that it really happened when it didn&#39;t, they&#39;d need more than a flimsy sheet of paper signed by actors, notoriously unreliable people, to keep the public from knowing the truth, most likely.</p>

<p>I would like to know more facts about Sandy Hook, but they didn&#39;t put an ad out before that. I doubt that the Craigslist post is evidence of anything sinister stirring in Jacksonville.</p>

The first thing I&#39;d do is going to a country that won&#39;t expedite you and start telling all the media. Someone will pick it up and it will snowball. Most grand scale conspiracies fall flat because people are notorious for telling secrets. You think nobody in government would have said anything about this? What about 9/11? Or moon landings?

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t say this is a smoking gun (not that you implied it was) but it&#39;s definitely something to screenshot and watch for. If you live in or around Jacksonville try and stay away from particularly busy public areas/events. Caution is always advised in an expected attack.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is no way for us to know if it&#39;s actually Crisis Cast (CC) who put the ad up. Anyone can post a picture on craigslist, and we also have no verification any emails are being responded to.</p>

<p>There could also be multiple of these ads floating around several cities in the US, if not the entire world. This is significant (if true) because, say something does happen in Jax, and the screenshot of this ad comes to light. A surplus of other ads from around the country that <em>didn&#39;t</em> happen can really discredit the 1 that <em>did</em> happen. </p>

<p>The language seems a bit straight-forward if they are concerned with being discrete about it (assuming it is actually CC posting, and not an outsider pretending to be CC, a point which I&#39;ll get to further down.) If it really was CC and something like this does happen their name is ALL over it. The ad doesn&#39;t leave much up for interpretation. Not the most strategic move if you ask me.</p>

<p>Now if we assume that it&#39;s an outsider pretending to be CC, that completely deflects the attention away from the actual poster. However, a bit of computer forensics would likely be able to trace the post back to OP and now they&#39;re under the microscope. </p>

<p>The computer forensics step, in my opinion, will probably only happen without an admission of guilt on CC&#39;s part. So with that in mind, perhaps CC is in on it, and supposed to be the focal point of the investigation. If someone steps forward and says &quot;Yep, it was us. You got us.&quot; That could be the end of the investigation. This is only likely however if CC gets some deal made to them by whoever is <em>actually</em> behind everything.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve already seen and heard about the &quot;double-blind&quot; tactics used by the DNC this election year thanks to the O&#39;Keefe investigation. I think it&#39;d be ignorant to assume the DNC is the <em>only</em> organization to use this or a similar tactic. If the O&#39;Keefe videos really BTFO the double-blind tactic, I would expect people to be hesitant to use it. But this was a portion of the video that was quickly dismissed and not reported on. I think it&#39;s still a very viable option to redirect attention.</p>

<p>I think the likely scenarios here are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An internet troll looking to spark an outcry</p></li>
<li><p>An internet troll trying to discredit any false flag investigations </p></li>
<li><p>A third-party that isn&#39;t the most tech-savvy actually planning something</p></li>
<li><p>Puppet masters using CC as a puppet for their show</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, didn&#39;t see that until just now. Definitely thought-provoking. At first glace, to me at least, I don&#39;t think this incident is consistent with the ad. The ad painted a pretty tragic scene, saying you should expect to work with fake blood, police officers, SWAT...</p>

<p>However, this could&#39;ve very easily gone that way. I&#39;m not sure how long he had the bank held up but the possibility of an engineered event is 100% there. </p>

<p>How often does a SWAT team get called in? I don&#39;t live in a big city like JAX but I never hear of it happening anywhere close to me. The fact that the ad called for you to work with the SWAT team specifically definitely raises concerns. Perhaps something <em>was</em> supposed to go down today but for whatever reason it got called off last minute?</p>

<p>Maybe there was a lack of communication, whether intentional or not. <a href="http://www.news4jax.com/news/local/jacksonville/shooting-at-northside-credit-union">This article</a> says there was a bit of confusion which gave the SWAT team enough time to move in and take position. Maybe the burglar was an actor and he was waiting on the go ahead, but the go ahead never came?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess Omar Mateen worked for G4S which i guess is one of these crisis acting companies(?), he supposedly even appeared in a movie as a security officer, and then the IMDB profile was wiped. It could be that he was working for them, performed for them several times but was possibly brain washed (such a taboo term) over a period of time, encouraged to do something like that and then eventually went through with it, or was apart of it with others but took the fall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, when 9/11 happened many readily accepted the official versions from news outlets that were interviewing &quot;experts&quot; who were providing us with the official facts that lead us to the war in Afghanistan and Iraq which still continues today... Two of these people who benefited from 9/11 and the continuing warfare that helped give the official narrative were Bernard Bailey &quot;Bernie&quot; Kerik and L. Paul Bremmer. In all of the chaos and despair of a large attack or false flag it is easy to believe what is provided to you. But as time went on, people looked into this and there was a lot of evidence of 9/11 being a coordinated false flag that we are still living in the consequences of. Now that people are becoming more aware, like myself, they are not willing to let their emotion of an event cloud their judgement and they start collecting evidence. Some evidence is alarming to learn about. Anyways I know how you feel, a good podcast to listen to, that you would enjoy about false flags is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/guns-and-butter-1/recent-false-flags-kevin-barrett-352">https://soundcloud.com/guns-and-butter-1/recent-false-flags-kevin-barrett-352</a></p>
