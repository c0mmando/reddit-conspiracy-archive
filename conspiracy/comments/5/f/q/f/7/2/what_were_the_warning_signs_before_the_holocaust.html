<p>The FEMA camps. Why is criticizing FEMA camps a terrorist act?</p>

<p>Yes, but when they do that, it&#39;s also game over for them.  Totalitarianism has no stable point of long term sustainable equilibrium.  I&#39;m not talking about revolution here, either.  They just keep coming up with more and more rules, and more and more excuses to kill people, that eventually everyone dies.  </p>

<p>Revolution or mass murder are the only two ways it can end.  Sure, you can keep tightening the thumb screws and make everyone work 18 hours a day or whatever, but what is the point?  Initially it might be to keep things luxurious for some priveleged class, but over time things get so paranoid, and the rules get so tight, that even the members of the inner Party are declared enemies of the people and purged.  Go and read about what Stalin did in the end.  That is how it ends; not with revolution necessarily.</p>

<p>You end up needing to keep people so heavily sedated in order for them to be able to take it without them flipping out and becoming a problem, that in the end said people are such zombies that they are no use.  Then you get more and more and more paranoid, and so more and more manpower is devoted to watchers, and people watching the watchers, and people watching the watchers of the watchers.  They can use as much AI for surveillance as they like, but ultimately you&#39;re still going to need human oversight somewhere.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also read <em>1984,</em> and I know what O&#39;Brian said about the point of power being power; but the thing to understand is that you&#39;re never going to get more than probably 2% of the population who think that way.  Most people have some kind of incentive other than a pure superiority complex on its&#39; own.  It isn&#39;t necessarily survival.  It might be money, but the thing is that if you want money, you need people to buy what you are selling.  If you want good food, you need a healthy environment that will produce that for you; and likewise for clothes and luxuries of whatever form.  Grinding totalitarianism is not conducive to any of that.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need revolution.  Given enough time, it will grind to a halt on its&#39; own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course you do.  So do most people; and that is precisely the point.  This is why you&#39;ve got people in the CIA for instance, who might well be complete sociopaths, but are getting on board with Steve Pieczenik and his merry band.  It&#39;s because even if they are amoral assholes, they still understand that there aren&#39;t going to be any more strippers and cocaine for them if things are allowed to proceed beyond a certain point.</p>

<p>The more things tighten up, the smaller the percentage of people who are still aboard the gravy train gets.  So if initially you had 10% who are living high on the proverbial hog, and then it shrinks down to 1%, then that other 9% are going to find reasons to join the revolution, because they are going to want that life back.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the reason why all of these whistleblowers and deep throats and white hats are suddenly coming out of the woodwork.  Given optimal conditions for them, they are not nice people either; but they are starting to understand that if the real 1% O&#39;Brian/Senator Palpatine demographic gets its&#39; way, then <strong><em>they</em></strong> are going to be in the camps and on the proverbial reservation with the rest of us.  They don&#39;t want that, so they are starting to fight back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a long time I used to think they were going to open camps in America.  Now I&#39;m honestly not so sure.  As violent and hypocritical as a lot of people have become, I still don&#39;t think the majority are anywhere near being that far gone that they would allow something like that in their midst.  Assuming they tried it openly, they would need to guard the locations constantly with riot police, and I think there are a lot of people in the military who wouldn&#39;t stand for it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m truthfully starting to think that the groups in society who are truly fascist are the intelligence community, the politicians, the leaders of corporations, and the police.  The military themselves are not, for the most part.  There are some damaged veterans who are, but the generals usually aren&#39;t.  We saw the army attacking police during the Egyptian revolution, and now we&#39;re seeing American military veterans going to the protest at Standing Rock.  The people who are attacking protesters and committing abuses at Standing Rock are the police.</p>

<p>So that tells me that in most places, the military are actually on the people&#39;s side, and it is the police who we really need protection from.  If the American government tried to open up camps, it would be the police who they would use to guard said camps, and it would be the military who would end up resisting said camps and attempting to defend the civilian population from them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Night of Broken Glass -Jewish shops targeted and vandalized by Gestapo (I think, or the SS)</p>

<p>Night of Long Knives - High level Nazis killed due to conspiracy to take power, IIRC</p>

<p>I believe there was specific legislation that stripped Jews of citizenship, but not 100% on that. Which kind of makes Trump&#39;s tweet of stripping citizenship kind of scary.</p>

<p>Hitler&#39;s rhetoric of Jews not being true Germans is also a very scary parallel. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; also mimics Hitler&#39;s rhetoric of the need for Germany to expand for &quot;living space&quot; and the idea of the third reich. </p>

<p>Only one of those deals with actual legislation, but those are the parallels that I come up with off the top of my head. I hadn&#39;t really thought about this until now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of the elites who identify with groups previously persecuted in history, see it as &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;. They don&#39;t want peace and prosperity, but rather they want revenge. And it will never be enough.</p>

<p>I swear if people study the psychology behind dysfunctional/abusive families, and how the dysfunction/abuse perpetuates itself (through psychological ramifications) from one generation to the next in a family, then you will know most of what you&#39;ll ever need to know in order to understand how humanity works. These basic psychological functions and dysfunctions don&#39;t magically disappear when you get a bunch of people together in a group (society, nation, government, etc), or when someone or a group has a lot of power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any history? The jews of 1930s germany don&#39;t resemble any group today beside possibly again the jews. They came in in the 20s and bought up much of germanys infrastructure for pennies, controlled almost all the banks and much the same as today held a large amount high level positions and a vastly disproportionate amount of businesses. So until we go tossing out the rich, all we have today is generally increasing state powers against anyone, but mostly the not so rich.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely read:</p>

<p>Naomi Wolf&#39;s End of America : a Letter to a Young Patriot </p>

<p>The Dark Valley: a Panorama of the 1930s</p>

<p>The first one discusses what similarities exist today with Germany leading up to Hitler&#39;s reign. Light reading.</p>

<p>The 2nd book is an EXTENSIVE history of the events leading up to and through Hitler&#39;s reign. Heavy reading.</p>

<p>Get reading, friend. :)</p>
