       I shared a meme which concisely demonstrates that, if it were by popular vote, 319 square miles of the almost 4 million sq miles of the US votes would only count.  And my liberal friends even thought that was fucked up.  Minds can be changed with information.

       Why the fuck do you consider miles to be sentient creatures. PEOPLE determine the election. Why does it matter where they live or in what proximity to each other. Two million people had their vote invalidated and you're worried about some empty cornfield not getting a voice. "319" square miles didn't decide anything, the millions of citizens that happen to live there did.

       Reddit's establishment masters keep the new world order/council on foreign relations propaganda narritive going on the main sites like politics world news, news.etc. I am never allowed to post on news or wold news because what I post disagrees with every aspect of the propaganda narritive. Of course Hillary is/was a main branch of the narritive.

       I made a post about the nature of trust on
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       a week or so ago and it was downvoted. It wasn't even controversial in my mind..
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Trust is a thing that, once broken, cannot be repaired fully. Much like a piece of paper, once creased the crease will always be visible even if the paper is made flat again.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course nobody took the time to explain why I was wrong or deserved to be downvoted, so I'll have to assume the message I was supposed to be hearing is that we should trust the media no matter how many times they break that trust.

       I get down voted relentless on there. I try and have civil, coherent debates and they don't want any of that. They want a nonstop echo chamber. I love discussions and I'm a complete middle of the road moderate who abstained from voting because no candidate spoke to me. I go there to try and break them from their bubble and they want no part of it.

       The sub is not pro-hilary so much as terrified by Trumps' plans, cabinet, lack of presidential decorum, opaque finances, conflicts of interest etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       People are upset because they perceive a false equivalence was drawn between candidates and now that Trump has been elected his predictably unpresidential conduct, unpreparedness, and the right-wing allegiance are manifestly evident.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't by the popular vote argument, Hilary won by a huge margin - true, the electoral college is likely an undemocratic insitution - true, but they were playing a different game and Trump won according to the rules of the contest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, all this fantasy about recounts, electoral college overriding the vote, and impeachment on day 1 are fanciful liberal coping strategies. Also, if any of things happen it would be terrifying... like riots and violence terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       But overall, people are concerned that Trump is showing no restraint on Twitter, surrounding himself with a very right wing cast of characters, and showing now understanding of what a blind trust is, conflicts of interest, and emoluments.

       I do not think ctr was ever as prevalent as advertised. Reddit is full of young, upper middle class young professionals with a liberal alignment... most of them are vehemently anti trump and after Bernie lost they saw an opportunity to push Hilary... who many young professionals, finance people etc back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I think there were pro trump shills, that if not paid for by the trump campaign were paid for by pacs or even working out of Russian funded operations.

       Calling anyone with a different perspective than yours a shill suggests a closed mindedness against the spirit of the sub. It also suggests you have not truly considered others positions. How can you win anyone over if you do not understand their fears, interests, positions? Moreover, how can you be awake or a free thinker without being able to consider the other side? Do you need a safe space and echo chamber? If that's what you want then you are just another sheep, just with a different allegiance than most,  but just as blind and limited.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sub was about intellectual growth, argument, discussion, evidence then maybe people would take the conspiracy theorists more seriously. Until then you are just a contrarian sheep...
      </p>
      <p>
       I come from the perspective where many I know are still in shock and disbelief about trumps win and are genuinely concerned for the future. Many being well off will weather this ok most likely but they are worried that things they care for will be destroyed. Researchers who need grants, doctors who work with patient with a wide swath socio exonomic back grounds, teachers in the public schools systems etc... and then people who care about advancing knowledge, science or care about civil liberties.

       First off I was laughing when I wrote the "you sound like a shill" and still am. I have alot of time to read, and I read alot. I seen the downfall of r/politics and knew the whole sub was being fucked with, so I made a note to myself to check out the front of r/politics if Trump was going to win. I had a feeling he would win and he did, so the next day I went to r/politics and it was a completely different sub. So from the time Trump won to the next morning something happend. 
Now I'm not the only one who notice this, many other people  noticed this. Maybe just by chance all the Hillary posters and mods spent the first two days crying, maybe they all unplugged for those few days, or maybe the whole sub was bought and no one was being payed anymore. I don't know what happened but something happend and I'm not the only one that notice the comments, topics, and links all changed all of a sudden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are their Hillary supporters in r/politics? of course, I'm not saying that. I'm saying the sub changed in a huge way that can only be described as the money went dry as soon as she lost.

       I'm sure there are some genuine people in r/politics who are oblivious or dismissive of the CTR presence. But during the election, the blatant manipulation was simply so obvious, especially the day after the election. As u/newdisease mentions, it was clear they had taken the day off. Posts and comments you hadn't been allowed to see in months suddenly appeared. In the comments, people were openly saying, "WTF? So I guess we're allowed to have a discussion now. This place had become a shit-hole." Then a day or two later, they clamped right back down. The discussion there is kept within tight parameters. If your own real opinion happens to fit, then of course it will pass unfiltered, but only a fool will not realize he's in an echo-chamber.

       It was a huge WTF! You read about CTR, your told about CTR, but to fucking see it with your own eyes kind of hurts. You knew it was true but kind of denied it to yourself but then to be awaken by it changes you, makes you feel just how dirty this world is.

       what evidence is there that trump is a liberal... he is probably best described as self-serving, but the people who are going to be doing the actual work in his administration are going to rip through every program liberals hold dear and expand the military industrial comlex.

       This sub went for trump so hard, but just wait until he destroys net neutrality, encourages torture, allies with the military industrial complex, deregulates large business (like Monsanto), authorizes spying on US citizens, deregulates banks, limits the first amendment, and maybe starts a war... all things this sub is against? Or is pizzagate the only conspiracy of note ever? Even Wikileaks and assange are fallen by the wayside...

       You know what, you're right, I thought he was historically liberal, but he's not. Sorry about that, I was wrong and am better educated now. Dunno why you had to take it personal but yes, you were right. He's also maintained a very consistent stance. I don't think he'll be able to change much lest he get's Kennedy cursed, I think that he's trying to pretend to rock the boat, but not rock it too much because there's too many special interests controlling Washington.

       I like how your post just assumes that
       <em>
        of course
       </em>
       r/politics is the liberal sub.  "Why would they suddenly support him?" That's the whole point of the OP: it is deliberately manipulated to make it so. The question isn't why 'they' would suddenly support him, but rather why, after the election is done, is the sub still being so tightly controlled to eliminate alternative points of view.

       r/The_Donald users are currently suspecting we have been completely removed from r/All and are in panic mode.

       Not everyone who supported hillary is a shill. Some people, mainly lgbtq people, are legitimately horrified by Trump's extremely homophobic cabinet. Others are also concerned with the fact that his AG pick may go after Medical or recreational cannabis. Others are concerned with Trump's many conflicts of interest and the fact that he hasn't done anything about his assests.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real question is why are people still supporting Trump when he's already gone back on his promises and the things he's campaigned on? Why are people supporting him when he's gone back on his promises of "draining the swamp"  and hired basically all Washington insiders?

       TPP is already dead. He's kept one major campaign promise before assuming office. I've never been more than hopeful that he'd do more than that(sovereignity was what I cared about most there), keeping gun rights, and not starting a new cold war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, that's not a lot, but as LGBT issues are not a voting issue for me, and my gf is rabidly pro-life, Hillary didn't really offer anything but minimum wage increases, which my state did via ballot initiative anyway. If he gives us the 30K EIC that'll mean he was better for the working class in my state than the Dem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I thrilled with him? No, of course not. Is he still looking like he might be the better alternative from where I'm sitting? Yeah, definitely.

       The point is CTR has taken over all mod positions in r/politics to stifle dissent. That sub, in theory, should be a place where various political perspectives are discussed, but that's not the case. And it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       manipulated. I'll quote from my comment to another user above:
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are some genuine people in r/politics who are oblivious or dismissive of the CTR presence. But during the election, the blatant manipulation was simply so obvious, especially the day after the election. As u/newdisease mentions, it was clear they had taken the day off. Posts and comments you hadn't been allowed to see in months suddenly appeared. In the comments, people were openly saying, "WTF? So I guess we're allowed to have a discussion now. This place had become a shit-hole." Then a day or two later, they clamped right back down. The discussion there is kept within tight parameters. If your own real opinion happens to fit, then of course it will pass unfiltered, but only a fool will not realize he's in an echo-chamber.

       Hillary's tactic is and always has been control of the narrative via echochambering, in both mainstream and social media.

       You thought they'd just disappear. Deluded people aren't simply cured when things don't occur the way they believe they should. People are stubborn and will hold on as tight as they can. It's either that or admit they are wrong and people don't like doing that.

       Possibly wasn't just about Hillary, and so why stop a process that is still being funded to achieve a non-specific, long term goal? She was their failed play, but they're not going to stop playing the game. They can keep trying to push their agenda.

       First they tried to start the phony riots to justify bribing the Electoral College, then they had Stein as a proxy to get recounts.  Next I'll expect they'll try to poison the well for Trump so he can be ignored and sidelined.  They'll keep doubling down one failure after another.

       A lot of people had very serious cognitive dissonance this election because it wasn't even really clear who the lesser evil was. In order to compensate for it a lot of them fell back into partisan politics. Yes, there are retarded numbers of shills, but a lot of it is just people who don't realize how thoroughly they lost.

       Well, if you believe the popular vote identity politics won and the left isn't going to give up on it....they will just call everything Trump does racist, and use that to repackage and resell it.

       TPP is already dead. He's kept one major campaign promise before assuming office. I've never been more than hopeful that he'd do more than that(sovereignity was what I cared about most there), keeping gun rights, and not starting a new cold war.

       Yeah, that's not a lot, but as LGBT issues are not a voting issue for me, and my gf is rabidly pro-life, Hillary didn't really offer anything but minimum wage increases, which my state did via ballot initiative anyway. If he gives us the 30K EIC that'll mean he was better for the working class in my state than the Dem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I thrilled with him? No, of course not. Is he still looking like he might be the better alternative from where I'm sitting? Yeah, definitely.
