<p>Trust is a thing that, once broken, cannot be repaired fully. Much like a piece of paper, once creased the crease will always be visible even if the paper is made flat again.</p>

<p>Of course nobody took the time to explain why I was wrong or deserved to be downvoted, so I&#39;ll have to assume the message I was supposed to be hearing is that we should trust the media no matter how many times they break that trust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sub is not pro-hilary so much as terrified by Trumps&#39; plans, cabinet, lack of presidential decorum, opaque finances, conflicts of interest etc...</p>

<p>People are upset because they perceive a false equivalence was drawn between candidates and now that Trump has been elected his predictably unpresidential conduct, unpreparedness, and the right-wing allegiance are manifestly evident. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t by the popular vote argument, Hilary won by a huge margin - true, the electoral college is likely an undemocratic insitution - true, but they were playing a different game and Trump won according to the rules of the contest. </p>

<p>Also, all this fantasy about recounts, electoral college overriding the vote, and impeachment on day 1 are fanciful liberal coping strategies. Also, if any of things happen it would be terrifying... like riots and violence terrifying. </p>

<p>But overall, people are concerned that Trump is showing no restraint on Twitter, surrounding himself with a very right wing cast of characters, and showing now understanding of what a blind trust is, conflicts of interest, and emoluments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling anyone with a different perspective than yours a shill suggests a closed mindedness against the spirit of the sub. It also suggests you have not truly considered others positions. How can you win anyone over if you do not understand their fears, interests, positions? Moreover, how can you be awake or a free thinker without being able to consider the other side? Do you need a safe space and echo chamber? If that&#39;s what you want then you are just another sheep, just with a different allegiance than most,  but just as blind and limited. </p>

<p>If this sub was about intellectual growth, argument, discussion, evidence then maybe people would take the conspiracy theorists more seriously. Until then you are just a contrarian sheep...</p>

<p>I come from the perspective where many I know are still in shock and disbelief about trumps win and are genuinely concerned for the future. Many being well off will weather this ok most likely but they are worried that things they care for will be destroyed. Researchers who need grants, doctors who work with patient with a wide swath socio exonomic back grounds, teachers in the public schools systems etc... and then people who care about advancing knowledge, science or care about civil liberties. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off I was laughing when I wrote the &quot;you sound like a shill&quot; and still am. I have alot of time to read, and I read alot. I seen the downfall of r/politics and knew the whole sub was being fucked with, so I made a note to myself to check out the front of r/politics if Trump was going to win. I had a feeling he would win and he did, so the next day I went to r/politics and it was a completely different sub. So from the time Trump won to the next morning something happend. 
Now I&#39;m not the only one who notice this, many other people  noticed this. Maybe just by chance all the Hillary posters and mods spent the first two days crying, maybe they all unplugged for those few days, or maybe the whole sub was bought and no one was being payed anymore. I don&#39;t know what happened but something happend and I&#39;m not the only one that notice the comments, topics, and links all changed all of a sudden. </p>

<p>Are their Hillary supporters in r/politics? of course, I&#39;m not saying that. I&#39;m saying the sub changed in a huge way that can only be described as the money went dry as soon as she lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure there are some genuine people in r/politics who are oblivious or dismissive of the CTR presence. But during the election, the blatant manipulation was simply so obvious, especially the day after the election. As u/newdisease mentions, it was clear they had taken the day off. Posts and comments you hadn&#39;t been allowed to see in months suddenly appeared. In the comments, people were openly saying, &quot;WTF? So I guess we&#39;re allowed to have a discussion now. This place had become a shit-hole.&quot; Then a day or two later, they clamped right back down. The discussion there is kept within tight parameters. If your own real opinion happens to fit, then of course it will pass unfiltered, but only a fool will not realize he&#39;s in an echo-chamber.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what evidence is there that trump is a liberal... he is probably best described as self-serving, but the people who are going to be doing the actual work in his administration are going to rip through every program liberals hold dear and expand the military industrial comlex. </p>

<p><strong>His brain trust is republican insiders, conservative billionaires and the military.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pence, VP, head transition team: Very right wing on social and economic issues</li>
<li>Munchin, sec treasury: Banker, ties to wall street and hollywood</li>
<li>Sessions, AG: Right wing republican senator</li>
<li>Tom Price, HHS: Right wing senator, wants to repeal ACA</li>
<li>Elaine Chao, transportation: Wife of mitch mconnel, sec transporation under bush</li>
<li>Betsy Davos, education: Pro school vouchers, anti public school, faih based philanthropy, ? vouchers for religous schools</li>
<li>Priebus, chief of staff: head of RNC, right wing establishment</li>
<li>Candidates for Sec def, nsc, sec state: Mathis, Flynn, Patreus... not exactly going to be reigning in defence spending.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nikki Haley is an exception but she is still right wing. </p>

<p><strong>The republicans are getting ready to:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Repeal ACA</li>
<li>Privatize medicare</li>
<li>Cut taxes on the rich, raise taxes on middle class</li>
<li>Gut public schools</li>
<li>Stop funding climate research at NASA</li>
<li>Go after Marijuana on a federal level</li>
<li>End net neutrality</li>
</ul>

<p>Under anti muslim sentiment get ready for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Patriot Act return</li>
<li>Torture</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, conservative on the supreme court will mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go after Roe V Wade</li>
<li>No chance to repeal Citizens United</li>
</ul>

<p>How is this going to be liberal???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everyone who supported hillary is a shill. Some people, mainly lgbtq people, are legitimately horrified by Trump&#39;s extremely homophobic cabinet. Others are also concerned with the fact that his AG pick may go after Medical or recreational cannabis. Others are concerned with Trump&#39;s many conflicts of interest and the fact that he hasn&#39;t done anything about his assests.</p>

<p>The real question is why are people still supporting Trump when he&#39;s already gone back on his promises and the things he&#39;s campaigned on? Why are people supporting him when he&#39;s gone back on his promises of &quot;draining the swamp&quot;  and hired basically all Washington insiders?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is CTR has taken over all mod positions in r/politics to stifle dissent. That sub, in theory, should be a place where various political perspectives are discussed, but that&#39;s not the case. And it <em>is</em> manipulated. I&#39;ll quote from my comment to another user above:</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are some genuine people in r/politics who are oblivious or dismissive of the CTR presence. But during the election, the blatant manipulation was simply so obvious, especially the day after the election. As u/newdisease mentions, it was clear they had taken the day off. Posts and comments you hadn&#39;t been allowed to see in months suddenly appeared. In the comments, people were openly saying, &quot;WTF? So I guess we&#39;re allowed to have a discussion now. This place had become a shit-hole.&quot; Then a day or two later, they clamped right back down. The discussion there is kept within tight parameters. If your own real opinion happens to fit, then of course it will pass unfiltered, but only a fool will not realize he&#39;s in an echo-chamber.</p>
