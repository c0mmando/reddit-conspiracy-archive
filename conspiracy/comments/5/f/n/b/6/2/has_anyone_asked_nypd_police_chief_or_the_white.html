        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There was that report weeks ago that NYPD police chief was certain that they had uncovered major crimes committed by Hillary and that if the FBI didnt come clean with it, NYPD would.  Nothing came out.  Then you had republican senators coming out and saying they had all 650,000 of the Weiner emails.  And that if no one released it, they would.  Those 650k haven&#39;t been released.  </p>

<p>Then Kim Dot Com said the WH had the 30k deleted yoga emails from hillary.  And that all we needed to do was ask the WH about it.  </p>

<p>The fact none of these came out.  None of these 3 came out with info on it.  The WH didnt.  NYPD didnt.  Police chief didnt.  Kim Dot Com seemed to hint he had the stuff.  He didnt or hasnt yet.  </p>

<p>Whats going on here?  Why has none of them leaked it?  </p>

<p>The police chief is a public figure.  NYPD police chief especially.  he has an office I would assume in NYC.  And is reachable by appointment too.  </p>

<p>Why hasnt he been called and talked to by everyone here and asked basic questions on pizzagate?   If he has the info the least we can do is call him or visit NYPD and ask why they didnt release any info on it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been wondering this as well. He said he was so sickened by what they found he would hold a press conference if the FBI did not take care of things, yet nothing has come to light. </p>

<p>I hope this is all part of a tactic by the FBI to avoid pardons from Obama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, but Kim Dot Com really did tweet out that the WH had the 30k emails.  </p>

<p>And Michael Flynn tweeted the info about NYPD.  </p>

<p>Erik Prince of Blackwater also confirmed these statements</p>

<p>The Iowa Representative Steve King said republican congresspeople had all 600k of the weiner emails and would release them publicly if the FBI did not.  This was said publicly at a rally.</p>
