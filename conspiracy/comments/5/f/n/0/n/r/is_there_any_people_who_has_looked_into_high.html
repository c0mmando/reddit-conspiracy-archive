<p>If you&#39;re already sharing this with others then please do! I&#39;m planning to share it with others some more either next or when another Question Session pops up. </p>

<p>Yeah, that quote was a somewhat hard concept to swallow(no pun intended). It made me realize that there is more to the world than it appears even behind the curtains. Was there anything else that caught your attention? </p>

<p>Please, tell me more about how it made you felt. How did it feel going through the posts and then afterwards digesting and recycling what was said in the answers?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the plan. I paste [4chan &quot;high level insider&quot;] into Google and search by &#39;Past 24 hours&#39; and &#39;Past Week&#39; to find any posts by him. He comes randomly though, so if you&#39;re not to keen on waiting to participate in a Question Session and just want to check the answers, then just check either weekly or monthly. I&#39;m certain he will make around two Question Sessions around Christmas week. If you have any questions you want to submit, I can hold them for you and when I get into a Question Session, I can submit your question(s). I participated in the 11/22 and 11/26 sessions.</p>

<p>The high level insider cites James Madison as an American patriot, Alexander Hamilton as a British agent, Thomas Jefferson as a conscientious traitor, Andrew Jackson as a British agent recruited by Aaron Burr, Abraham Lincoln as largely independent and opposed to the British Empire, etc. This is a fairly intriguing way to look at American history, but it&#39;s also pretty goddamn insane.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t he opposed to the first bank? Weren&#39;t banks the epicenters of British influence in the early USA? What were the primary geopolitical struggles of the United States during the 19th century? Why did Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton sabotage each other if their political interests aligned? </p>

<p>If the Second National Bank of the United States was insulated from British influence, then did Andrew Jackson&#39;s role require him to destroy the national bank so British-controlled state banks could restore influence over the country&#39;s economy, protect Southern raw materials, and hamper the competing American industry?</p>

<p>I have my doubts because his opinion on Donald Trump. I don&#39;t care if he doesn&#39;t support him or see him as a messiah. He just seems ignorant about the insider-outsider power struggles being waged within the Republican Party, how the 2016 primary was rigged against outsiders, and how Donald Trump maneuvered around establishment and pseudo-anti-establishment agents to dominate the field. And that makes gives me doubts. Donald Trump could be his own self-interested faction, but I highly doubt he&#39;s crafted out of the same material.</p>

<p>Then again, that&#39;s probably too lowbrow, given the scope of the questions that he tries to answer and the problems that he tries to solve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am fascinated by these threads and have made it through 5-6 of them. The fresh perspective towards the world and the powers that be, the various factions and the possibility that there are some powerful people working towards a better world and against the elitists who would keep every luxury for themselves.... 
if what is being said here is true this is mind boggling. As a Christian, his assertions about Jesus and the Bible are intriguing and troubling, yet honestly change nothing for me. I see Jesus as someone who broke the mold per se with what humans are capable of, and this aligns fine with the ideas he suggests, if true.</p>

<p>Well first off obviously everything here needs to be taken with a grain of salt. There&#39;s also no way to verify any of these claims in a concrete sense.</p>

<p>Yeah, I said to be skeptical but remain open minded when reading it. You&#39;ll have to look into what he says. He didn&#39;t bullshit on 9/11 which is a good sign for me. Usually people try to dodge/avoid or use disinfo to a degree. </p>

<p>So I&#39;d like to believe that this means either this guy is legit, or he&#39;s a very dedicated LARPer possible disinfo agent who has done research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The guy has 26+1 threads so far, and a few other threads he commented on in /cfg/ threads but they were lost except 1. You&#39;ll have to think as you said that this anon might be legit or a dedicated LARPer. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as the rest of his claims go there&#39;s still a lot of holes and unexplained things. But they could be chalked up to the rarity of the circumstances for example the wikileaks twitter acting abnormally </p>
</blockquote>

<p>An interesting thing he talked on was the &#39;Red pill and Blue pill&#39; analogy, to which he said that Red pill we perceive is actually a redder blue pill. Don&#39;t know where exactly he said since it&#39;s 27 links in that dump haha</p>

<p>From what he talked about, it&#39;s one of the secret societies. Similar to the Freemasons probably.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t recall him saying that he is connected to Wikileaks. He only said a few things from what people have asked of him which some include Assange being a CIA worker and Wikileaks is a limited-hangout among other things. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I certainly do have a lot of questions to ask. Some of his claims and answers can be verified and do make sense. He also didn&#39;t bullshit when talking about 9/11 like other people and groups usually do. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Depends on what you mean. Reddit is compromised too yet we are still using it right? It isn&#39;t hard to imagine that the agencies and various groups have a level of activity in spaces with knowledge and speech being discussed. </p>

<p>I understand what you&#39;re saying. Are you planning to read the threads? I have a dump of them, 27 threads. Supposedly there is more threads where HLI was posting in, which was the /cfg/ threads. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t find any of them besides the 7/10 one. </p>

<p>Some quotes:</p>

<p>-&quot;[..] [Q]uestioning everything especially our own assumptions. Most importantly, the assumptions you&#39;ve made and don&#39;t even realize.&quot;</p>

<p>-&quot;If all you are doing is presenting uncomfortable truth, you will engender as much opposition as you can recruit. You need explanations for why bad things are done, not just proof of bad things. You also need alternatives.&quot;</p>

<p>-&quot;You need to deemphasize exposing the current system to some degree, more specifically put it in the context of offering a better alternative and expose what people are missing out on by going along with the current system. If you can do better, you can show people they are being cheated. If you can&#39;t offer a better alternative, they will wonder why should they care.&quot;</p>

You can tell he understands what he&#39;s talking about when he explains these groups and their agendas.. although I do question the things he shared about Trump. </p>

<p>I suspect he&#39;s an NSA analyst with good intentions.</p>

<p>We know the government documents everything, he&#39;d have access to files with all this information researched and sorted at his fingertips.
If you&#39;ve seen the new Edward Snowden movie, you can easily see how this guy could be similar.</p>

<p>Other than trolling, I didn&#39;t see any agenda other than maybe an attempt to mentor..
Unless, he hasn&#39;t revealed his motive yet.</p>

<p>Idk, he could be a legit player.. but I do know it has to be coming from somewhere, it&#39;s not coming from somebody just being well read and a big imagination.
You know that mystery or conspiracy theory that was so close, but there was something about it that just didn&#39;t sit right.
He seems to be making sense of them and everything fits together without the time to research/prepare a response.</p>

<p>Your thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a couple thoughts.... I think I saw him say somewhere that he is a high level political operative in the media, but I might be mistaken. Also, I agree that he seems to make lots of sense and be legit but the Trump comments are concerning. I hope the group is able to affect Trump and bring him in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he said that I think it was disinfo. People in our intelligence agencies are compartmentalized, and only given info that is pertinent to their role. He has an understanding of things that is not confined to a certain focus. Unless his group &quot;three&quot; is a real thing and he&#39;s a political operative by day. He did say that writing, investing, and poker were his means of income.</p>

<p>Trump is putting forth an effort to do what&#39;s in our best interest, so far. I think him &quot;being on the job already&quot; further proves an upcoming financial crisis, as he&#39;s trying get a head start. I work in oil and gas so I&#39;m ready for a détente with Russia and China/Saudi being marginalized.</p>

<p>My mind has been blown for sure. The little things like GWB not knowing about 911 but Sr did. That just makes sense. The British using Communism and Hitler to stop the two big threats that were intrigued by the American experiment. Hitler co-opting nationalist/anti-masonic movement. Communism demoralizing a once powerful empire and long time rival.</p>

<p>The relationship of consciousness and enlightenment to modern religions and the shift to monotheism. I always had a feeling it was something like that but didn&#39;t understand it fully. </p>

<p>Do you have some questions for the next AMA?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t, well, not exactly...</p>

<p>Perhaps we could ask him about this: One thing I just realized, &quot;three&quot; might refer to the trilateral commission. Though it makes no sense that it was ran by David Rockefeller for a long time, they use &quot;tri&quot; frequently, like on this page <a href="http://trilateral.org/page/3/about-trilateral">http://trilateral.org/page/3/about-trilateral</a></p>

<p>Also, invite only. <a href="http://trilateral.org/page/7/membership">http://trilateral.org/page/7/membership</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, it may not add up but certainly some similarities here. </p>

<p>I need to finish reading through all the threads, I think I was able to get through 4-5 of them so far.</p>

<p>I am intrigued by the consciousness ideas he presents, very interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t read all of them?! Read them ASAP! Start at the beginning</p>

<p>Somebody already asked about trilateral and he said no.. Three has something to do with the father, the son and the Holy Spirit.. not Christianity tho, Christianity is the product and symbolism of something deeper... and/or consciousness, (a loss of consciousness) rebirth of consciousness, and awakening/enlightenment. </p>

<p>Ive read through them all and share the ideas with people that have a more malleable mind thats able to see more than one narrative. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re already sharing this with others then please do! I&#39;m planning to share it with others some more either next or when another Question Session pops up. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>My favorite quote was when he refers to what we call red pill is actually blue pill, it took me a couple days to understand this and he&#39;s right</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, that quote was a somewhat hard concept to swallow(no pun intended). It made me realize that there is more to the world than it appears even behind the curtains. Was there anything else that caught your attention? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found myself going through stages of grief (same as when i first became &quot;red pill&quot;) after researching stuff like the clinton foundation/pizza gate/ the old world order etc. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, tell me more about how it made you felt. How did it feel going through the posts and then afterwards digesting and recycling what was said in the answers?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you plan on keeping your other thread updated when he posts, Im not to familiar with how 4chan works other than reading and not sure how to search for them when he posts them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the plan. I paste [4chan &quot;high level insider&quot;] into Google and search by &#39;Past 24 hours&#39; and &#39;Past Week&#39; to find any posts by him. He comes randomly though, so if you&#39;re not to keen on waiting to participate in a Question Session and just want to check the answers, then just check either weekly or monthly. I&#39;m certain he will make around two Question Sessions around Christmas week. If you have any questions you want to submit, I can hold them for you and when I get into a Question Session, I can submit your question(s). I participated in the 11/22 and 11/26 sessions.</p>
