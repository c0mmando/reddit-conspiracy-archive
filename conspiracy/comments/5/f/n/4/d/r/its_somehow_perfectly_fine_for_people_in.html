       It's a damn shame that we can no longer have discussions with different opinions without being labeled. I find absolutely nothing wrong with your post and I think anyone would be hard pressed to find anything uncivil about it. But then again, I'm pretty sure r/politics is bought &amp; paid for at this point. I left that sub a long time ago and will never return.

       has been absolute garbage for a few years now at least. I think I unsubbed before the last election, and that's before I ever heard of Breitbart, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the MSM now, I find sources like Breitbart to be more reliable. The thing is, closest to a political viewpoint I get is true Marxist. I believe militantly in individual freedoms, especially autonomy. I've always lived by "don't make up anyone elses mind for them" and it doesn't matter if I'm actively trying to sell someone on me doing work for them, or on me changing lanes when driving.
      </p>
      <p>
       When were talking about things like pizzagate and pedos. They violate so many fundamental human freedoms that I don't see the perpetrators as human. They're not. How can they be? You're human if you have empathy.

       Arbitrary subjective nonsense. Join us at voat.co if you want a place with actual free speech. It's pretty nice because /v/news and /v/politics have  basically become /v/conspiracy with all the recent corruption and scandals being exposed. I like this sub but even its rules are mostly infringements on free speech.

        It's almost cute you believe Trump will back any sort of climate science. And by cute I mean sad. I'll remind you in a year about this conversation. If you don;t think Trump is going to go absolute 180 from where we are now, you are delusional

       They're Liberals, you can't argue with them in any way, as once you state something they can't simply deny they turn into foul mouthed anti reality lemmings. I've found that the exact opposite proves to be true with them every time.

       But I guess the headline:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Trump has his own personal opinions that doubt many aspects of climate change but he'll have an open mind and listen to people."
      </p>
      <p>
       doesn't fit the clickbait narrative that pulls all of the anti-Trump people out of the woodwork.
      </p>
      <p>
       And once again, your failure to understand this because you are brainwashed by party politics does not change reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wanna know how brainwashed I am? For the record:
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck Hillary Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       See how that works? I don't care about either of them. But I do care about blatant media manipulation that is targeted at people like you who eat it up and then ask for more. The decisions that people like you make are going to affect the whole country. You are not special, you are part of the herd. The opinions you throw out are not unique, they are being parroted every single day. They have been spoon-fed to you by sensationalist headlines like this one. You shouldn't be proud of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are part of a large group that are all being played for suckers, not by Trump, not by Clinton, but by the media

       That was the comment I made. I thought it was clear but maybe not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I woke up this morning and that was the first comment I made. You can even click on my name and check my history. You will see that comment at (currently) 3 hours old and the next comment at 14 hours old.
      </p>
      <p>
       I received the message that I was banned for "civility" within 5 minutes of making that comment.

       Things I think could be considered uncivil: doesn't fit click bait narrative, out of the woodwork, brainwashed by party politics, you are not special you're part of the herd, your ideas are not unique and being parroted...,
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what their definition of civility is, but I don't think what you wrote could be considered civil by any definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what the headline said and Priebus said are essentially the same. You'd be hard pressed to prove the two comments are significantly different and was malicious in its portrayal. Please remember that journalists have to change what's exactly said to avoid plagiarism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would not have banned you and I agree with your sentiment, but I can understand why you were banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another difference that I think is closer to why you were banned compared to common statements made there is, you attacked the individual person you were having a dialogue with while other attacks are against public people and not PvP style.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I could insult Trump or Clinton there and call them all kinds of things. That's fine.  But I cannot insult you directly. I think it's a big difference.

       The Donald is the only place I've been permanently banned for commenting. That sub is a cesspool, when they find out he's just as corrupt as the rest, I hope they use that energy to turn on the machine instead of turn around and take it in their asses.

       Big deal, you got banned from a sub you should never be at and support anyway. I think of it as they did you a favour.
