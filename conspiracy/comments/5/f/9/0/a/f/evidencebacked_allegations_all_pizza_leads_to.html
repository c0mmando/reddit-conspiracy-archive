        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1299</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-11-28 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/911bodysnatchers322.html">911bodysnatchers322</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>While using google image search to find out the above, before I asked this sub, I stumbled upon this one blog:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://shaunynews.com/tag/satanic-ritual-sacrifices-of-newborn-children/">https://shaunynews.com/tag/satanic-ritual-sacrifices-of-newborn-children/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I found the allegations against the Pope, frankly, preposterous.  He&#39;s the Pope.  He&#39;s a nice old man.  Right?  There goes my operant conditioning of disbelief again.   Well wait...I mean he <em>is</em> a Jesuit.</p>

<p>So I decided to dig into this, and found the examiner.com article with the so-called evidence.  This is really messing me up.  It turns out there <em>is</em> credible evidence.  Sigh.  Pizzagate goes all the way to the top.  I mean it&#39;s starting to make sense they&#39;d use Italian food pizza/pasta as code.  My Italian half wonders if I missed the boat on wanting to rape kids, run a nightclub, racketeering a shady trash biz, deal drugs, fix plumbing, jump on turtles, cry &#39;but Mah&#39;, and then hear someone&#39;s confession--&#39;oh bless you my son&#39;.  I&#39;m sick and angry about all this.  Our country is run by criminal gangsters of the worst kind.  And yes combining the US Gov and the Jesuits was intentional because Obama is steered by Jesuits and Trump will be no different.  Do your research, you&#39;ll verify for yourself.</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s the thing. I&#39;m much more willing to believe the Pope is involved, simply because I know--from doing homework (research via globalresearch.ca)--that Francis participated in right-wing terrorism in Argentina.  Also, the film Spotlight.  Also, I&#39;ve been alive for 40 yrs and have heard this before.  But it&#39;s never been this bad.  The media has convinced us its a few bad apples in boston or philedelphia and then we get about our lives.</p>

<p>But then I read about the so-called &quot;Argentina Dirty War&quot; and the years of lead there, to manufacture--through society abuse--consent for the military junta and regime change towards Fascism (the Jesuit&#39;s most favorite thing in the world, second only--apparently--to child rape).  The idea that they are terrible people who are using terror to control the world suddenly became a very real idea.</p>

<p>So ....back to the pedo stuff (sorry).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had to use the waybackmachine to find some of these articles.  Obviously.  The links in the first link won&#39;t work, so for your convenience I&#39;ve adjusted them and re-fed them into the waybackmachine.  To the best of my understanding, it turns out, there was a common law tribunal in canada that held the catholic and anglican churches (pope and queen) guilty of child genocide on 2/21/13; Pope Benedict Resigned a week later; and then on 3/13/13 Pope Francis became pope.  </p>

<p>Judge for yourself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Vatican is not only the biggest <a href="https://usahitman.com/vbmsipb/">international arms dealer</a>, they&#39;re also the largest child sex slave dealer and always have been. For some reason no one ever finds it weird that the Vatican allows their pedophile priests to keep on priesting long after they&#39;ve been outed as pedophiles. The Vatican actively does everything it can to silence accusers by killing them, paying them, making them disappear, you name it. </p>

<p>James Achilles (Rome) Alefantis. The Jesuit Podesta brothers (search Podesta WikiLeaks for &quot;Malta&quot; and &quot;Jesuit&quot;). The <em>hundreds</em> of child trafficking &quot;preventative&quot; organizations run by <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=jesuit+human+trafficking&amp;amp;form=APIPH1&amp;amp;PC=APPL">the jesuits/knights of Malta/hospitallers</a> giving them extremely easy access to victims and infinite cover up potential. </p>

<p>Yeah, the shit is fucked and the list goes on and on but I firmly believe the Clinton Foundation is a front company for the Vatican&#39;s children/arms dealing and The Black Pope + Francis are directly in the center of it.</p>

<p>To add more to this: the jesuits/knights of Malta/hospitallers have some &quot;anti-child trafficking&quot; operations in Haiti and they were in Haiti at the same time the Clinton Foundation was there. Willing to bet all my vital organs the kids were abducted and sold through the CF and the laundered money was split through the Jesuit/catholic charities in Haiti with all proceeds going to The World Bank, AKA the Vatican.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adventists consider themselves a movement that continues the protestant reformation. Mainstream evangelicals and other branches of Christianity rarely, if ever, teach that the pope/papacy is the antichrist anymore. That belief was popular throughout most of the reformation. It&#39;s rarely preached anymore, but Adventists still preach it. You can find a bunch of studies on it online. <a href="http://amazingdiscoveries.org/prophecy">Here&#39;s one site that pretty much covers the majority of the prophecies in depth.</a></p>

That explains why Old Testament God is obsessed with worshiping him, setting strict rules and regulations on human pleasure, and ultimately limiting true spiritual growth through his regressive practices of false worship. </p>

You&#39;ll see that right after Jesus&#39; death they still kept the sabbath. Did you know the sabbath is the 4th commandment written by the finger of God according to Exodus? I don&#39;t think it was meant to be changed. Jesus even kept the Sabbath and called himself &quot;Lord of the sabbath&quot;. In a way, Jesus &quot;rested&quot; on the sabbath in his death and then resurrected on Sunday. </p>

Which considering if the Pope, Queen of England, and Canadian PM were actually issued international arrest warrants immediately raises red flags. Beyond that, I can&#39;t find anything at all verifying the ITCCS is in anyway connected to an actual court, particularly an international one based in Brussels. What I am seeing though is that the ITCCS isn&#39;t even based in Brussels. That its written in Canada by a man named Kevin D. Annett, a supposed defrocked United Church of Canada priest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>speaking of Knights of Malta, Seymour Hersh said:</p>

<p>According to an account of the speech in Foreign Policy magazine, Hersh alleged that Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the retired head of the Pentagon&#39;s Joint Special Operations Command and briefly the top commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, was among several senior officers who are members or supporters of exclusive Roman Catholic organizations such as Opus Dei and the Knights of Malta. </p>

<p>Neoconservative advisers to President George W. Bush took the attitude that &quot; &#39;we&#39;re gonna change mosques into cathedrals,&#39; &quot; Hersh, a writer for the New Yorker magazine, said in the speech. &quot;That&#39;s an attitude that pervades, I&#39;m here to say, a large percentage of the Joint Special Operations Command.&quot; The command is the part of the military focused on targeted missions to kill enemy leaders, primarily in Afghanistan and Iraq. Its operations are almost always secret. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve started out from an absurd position, you&#39;re assuming that i know nothing about anything and thet you know everything about everything -- yet you&#39;re unwilling to use your knowledge to refute my arguments and are instead hiding behind a jumbled mega-document which i can be almost 100% contains barely any genuine sources and a million tons of subjective waffle taken as fact... and if i was to open it and point to one poor argument you&#39;d say &#39;no it&#39;s the other arguments&#39; and i&#39;ll point to another and you&#39;ll say &#39;no the other ones...&#39; or you&#39;ll pull out an even bigger tome and say &#39;read that it&#39;s all in that for sure...&#39; and then you&#39;ll have another and another and another... </p>

<p>it&#39;s an old and fraudulent argumentation style.  </p>

<p>I mean what really get&#39;s me is it&#39;s always the same attitude every time, &#39;you must know nothing read this basic introduction full of bullshit&#39; did it even occur to you that i might know lots about this subject and still have other opinions? that i&#39;ve actually studied both groups history in depth, and their actual history supported by verifiable facts rather than suppositions from buzzword linking crackpot attention seekers.  </p>

<p>The last person that tried to tell me some nonsense about the Jesuits didn&#39;t even know who Ignatius was! He&#39;d never even heard o the Relations let alone seen a copy - here he was telling me that i should just believe what he has to say because he&#39;s totally sure he&#39;s got the inside scoop from a couple of youtube videos and a website with ten million adverts on it (and which also claims lizard jews from space rule the world, and sinister shadow people, and anyone else that&#39;ll get them clicks....)</p>

<p>LISTEN THOUGH</p>

<p>It&#39;s very important that we stick to facts, and we don&#39;t stigmatize an entire culture, because that will turn into a he-said/she-said morass of bullshit. </p>

<p>We need to stay CALM.  We need to reference GOOD SOURCES.  We need to ensure that we stay unemotional, because that is the way that evidence and interrogation becomes derailed: if you make it personal and emotional. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very easy to be emotional in the face of the atrocities that we are discovering.  It&#39;s much harder to stay tough, to stay neutral, and to present facts in as much of an unbiased way as we can. </p>

<p>This is probably one of the most important issues of the 21st century and it&#39;s getting no coverage at all.  WE are the journalists.  And a journalist&#39;s prerogative has to be presenting facts in a manner that is defensible and strong.  Emotional outbursts do nothing but hurt us. </p>

<p>I absolutely see what people are talking about.  And that&#39;s why I made this post.  It is a tough decision to remain calm in the storm.  But that is our only option.  One emotional outburst will invalidate the research and truth of someone else. </p>

<p>It is extremely important, at this PARTICULAR point in HISTORY, to be both vigilant and RATIONAL.  There&#39;s never been an internet before.  We are at an inflection point.  If we allow ourselves to become overly emotional, it will completely deflate the facts and research that so many of us have worked on.  </p>

<p>I love all you guys.  I know I&#39;m just a talker among many talkers.  But this is really important shit that we are dealing with.  Like I said, this is an inflection point the likes of which we have never seen, because we can all communicate with relative freedom.  It&#39;s very possible that if we cannot convert on that freedom, we might never see it again.  </p>

<p>I love all you guys. </p>

<p>EDIT: I want to make it very clear that I&#39;m not attacking anyone in this forum with this post.  In general, I think you guys are pretty fucking on top of it, including OP and the person I replied to</p>

<p>But we are at a turning point, and each one of you are way more important than many think you are, possibly including yourselves.  We need to have a major obligation to humanity to do the right things, right now.  </p>

<p>And before I get a ton of questions, yeah, I&#39;m talking about Rome, and I&#39;m talking about Pizza, and I&#39;m talking about the very likely scenario that we have worked out, which makes an awful lot of sense in light of recent history.  That is the key to everything: trapping someone powerful in a perverted web, and then using that as a brute-force blackmail technique to exert control.   </p>

<p>EDIT 2: I reposted this as an original post.  Please reply there rather than in this thread. </p>

<p>It&#39;s simple, really. Since the Vatican II council, numbers of vocations have collapsed, and they can&#39;t afford to lose priests. That&#39;s why they keep on getting a free pass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vatican funds both the Jews and the Muslims. Some would argue they created both religions. They have artificially manufactured a religious divide in the Middle East because they profit immensely off both sides and no matter who wins, the Vatican ultimately wins. Everything always ends with &quot;democracy&quot; AKA the world bank being installed in the loser&#39;s country. The Vatican <em>is the world bank.</em> </p>

<p>Soros is a hack and doesn&#39;t have any true power over anything. You&#39;d be better off forgetting that name. No one with as much power as the_donald thinks Soros has would ever be as public as that man is. When your boogeyman is giving interviews on 60 Minutes, you fell for it. You got duped. Soros is a distraction from the people that really rule the world.</p>

<p>Also if I was told this 3 years ago... I would have immediately dismissed all of these things... God damn, were I ignorant of this. But shit like the 8 goddesses in South Korea and SpiritCooking have made me believe, that there is much much more behind these things.</p>

<li>They practice <em>ritual cannibalism</em> every week! Some say it&#39;s just <em>symbolic</em> cannibalism—as if that&#39;s okay—but officially it&#39;s <em>real</em>! They use occult black magic to change the wine and wafers into blood and human flesh! Right out in the open! With children not only present, but participating!<br/></li>
<li>They are so powerful that, in most places, there&#39;s an exemption <em>written into the law</em> to allow them to serve alcohol to minors.<br/></li>
<li>The totem of their religion is a guy being slowly tortured to death! Even though they claim to be a family-friendly place, they have statues of the execution up on their walls in full view of any children. Followers of the religion very often carry miniature copies of the torture device with them!<br/></li>
<li>One of the most holy figures in their religion is a guy who heard a voice telling him to kill his own child and he was ready to do it—until the voice said &quot;just kidding!&quot; Haha! So funny! Sick bastards.<br/></li>
<li>A favorite story they tell children is when their &quot;god&quot; killed <em>everybody on the fucking planet</em> except for one family and some animals they had on a boat. It&#39;s a children&#39;s story because—get this—it has animals! Whoa, man, some animals survived, hurray! Fortunately, they usually don&#39;t tell the children about the later part of the story where the boat guy&#39;s daughters got him drunk and raped him! That&#39;s in their holy book!<br/></li>
<li>One of the things that&#39;s <em>required</em> in their religion is telling their ministers all the bad things you did. And they promise not to tell the police! Blackmail, anyone?<br/></li>
<li>They only allow men to become ministers! And only <em>single</em> men. Why is that? They don&#39;t want any men who have normal feelings about women and children! If you don&#39;t have children of your own to protect and you&#39;re sex-starved, what&#39;s the next obvious step? And why do they study in <em>seminaries</em>? That&#39;s from the same root as <em>semen</em>!<br/></li>

<p>Shakespeare wasn&#39;t 1 man. It was in fact multiple aristocrats producing works under one pseudonym for the expressed purpose of disseminating free thought. I don&#39;t know why that&#39;s such a tricky one for people to get their head around but it is indeed the most plausible explanation.</p>

<p>You are forgetting that the opinion of some nobody fishmonger isn&#39;t going to impact our understanding at all today. Historians lament the fact that we have very little by the way of first hand accounts from people who were not of the upper echelons of society for the vast majority of our recent history.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you fully understand autocracy. Dictators will do some pretty fucked up shit to hide the truth. I would be interested in seeing any primary documents you have showing the use of roman numeral dispelling this once and for all. I couldn&#39;t find anything supporting the claim that they were primarily used. I also couldn&#39;t find any primary legal documents but please share of you find some.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re forgetting again the importance the British aristocracy had in interpreting the so called Chinese and especially indian history for an english and ultimately global audience. It&#39;s not like the British cared to ask the sick and the starving what they remember about their past.</p>

<p>On top of that the true story of the mongols is very much not how you think it was. The story of the mongols is in fact just a branch of what was once the largest empire at the time but is now largely forgotten. Look on any old maps form before 1700 and you will find a vast swath of land labeled as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1i6ftv/tartaria_3817_x_3201/">Grand Tartaria</a> stretching from Germany to japan and in some cases north america. </p>

<p>It&#39;s no secret that the earliest depictions of the Genghis Khan (which by the way simply translates to great or universal ruler) they describe him as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2pxkrr/what_did_genghis_khan_look_like/">tall and pale with red hair and green eyes</a> </p>

<p>oh now you&#39;re just being stupid, this proves you know nothing about Shakespeare, it&#39;s just an load of old nonsense invented by snooty academics who didn&#39;t like the fact a commoner was better than them, and actually the real truth is a lot of his greatest turns of phrase weren&#39;t his at all but well established saying known to the lower classes, for example &#39;Every dog shall have his day&#39; was actually said first by the then more now less famous Will of the Elizabethan stage Will Kemp in his nine dayies wonder, it&#39;s not aristocrats is&#39;s the language of it&#39;s age - hence why Shakespeare talks of and describes ,many things that Bacon, Spenser, and etc didn&#39;t know... honestly if you can&#39;t tell the style and frame of Bacon from Shakespeare then you really are quite mad.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are forgetting that the opinion of some nobody fishmonger isn&#39;t going to impact our understanding at all today.   </p>

<p>but we were talking about why they accepted it then, why is there no point when people suddenly start to be confused which century they&#39;re in? i mean i know you probably haven&#39;t seen any of it but the histories of the last 2000 years are really quiet extensive especially era around Henry and Liz, we have pronominal amounts of archival evidence of everyday life in that period and absolutely none of it even once comes close to suggesting that they&#39;ve invented a thousand years .  </p>

<p>you must i presume be an American, come to Europe not only do we have roman and latin numerals carved into stone all over the place but the British Library has an extensive collection of manuscripts covering pretty much the whole range of years... </p>

<p>wai- you actually had to look up if roman numerals are commonly used in old documents and things? do you really know so little about the world? have you never even noticed them on films? that&#39;s a tradition which goes all the way back to before the printing press was a thing - i mean honestly, i just linked you to a repository of old books, try and find some Elizabethan manuscripts that don&#39;t have the publishing date in roman, you might be shocked how hard it is...  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>no i mean, like before we got there - when Marco Polo turned up he didn&#39;t say &#39;oh by the way, gotta wind your clock forward a bit, we&#39;re skipping a thousand years, no don&#39;t ask why it&#39;s silly really...&#39;  </p>

<p>you have no idea what i think the history of the mongols was, stop trying to do that stupid &#39;you&#39;d agree if only you knew as much as me&#39; thing it&#39;s silly because you clearly don&#39;t really know anything about this, you didn&#39;t even know that roman numerals are common in old books and statues - it&#39;s like you&#39;ve never even been in a single museum - but you&#39;re speaking as if you and only you know the truth that everyone else has missed?! surely you can see how absurd that is?  </p>

<p>i mean seriously you&#39;re telling me than Khan means great ruler as if it&#39;s a revelation, ffs i&#39;ve read the accounts of Polo&#39;s travels and know the stories of his meeting with the great Khans - that alone is enough to disprove all the absurd and nonsensical thing you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>honestly why would you try and push this conspiracy? what do you get out of it? does someone pay you? is an an internet game? an ironic art movement? i don&#39;t get it? why are you so keen to push absolute nonsense? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha thanks, but yeah it&#39;s odd isn&#39;t it - i mean what is the impulse to create such a totally absurd theory? the person who invented it obviously knew a bit about history to be able to tie all the nonsense together but is overlooking the fact that in most of the world you can see a clear development of technology, literature and etc which has a smooth gradient of development and at no point goes 0-500ad Romans build a wall then fuck off and everyone loiters around for a thousand years before 1500 where Shakespeare suddenly goes &#39;hey let&#39;s start progress again...&#39;  </p>

<p>I mean if you add 1 onto all years after the switch to the Gregorian calendar and claim that thousand years isn&#39;t real then you&#39;ve just edited out everything from St. Augustine to Henry the VIII - heh i mean i know whitewash comes from them literally whitewashing over catholic artwork so yeah a lot of the evidence was destroyed but they didn&#39;t <em>literally</em> dissolve the monasteries, <a href="http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/1102/production/_86845340_ladtchapel.jpg">i mean the plotters went to quite some effort to invent a thousand years of Catholicism to fill in the gap</a> and there are bloody loads of those things dotted around this fair isle. </p>

<p>oh now you&#39;re just being stupid, this proves you know nothing about Shakespeare, it&#39;s just an load of old nonsense invented by snooty academics who didn&#39;t like the fact a commoner was better than them, and actually the real truth is a lot of his greatest turns of phrase weren&#39;t his at all but well established saying known to the lower classes, for example &#39;Every dog shall have his day&#39; was actually said first by the then more now less famous Will of the Elizabethan stage Will Kemp in his nine dayies wonder, it&#39;s not aristocrats is&#39;s the language of it&#39;s age - hence why Shakespeare talks of and describes ,many things that Bacon, Spenser, and etc didn&#39;t know... honestly if you can&#39;t tell the style and frame of Bacon from Shakespeare then you really are quite mad.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>your so stupid!</strong>&quot; how is this an argument? Snooty academics? You mean the ones most educated and qualified to make the call?

<p>which is just as absurd, i mean honestly you&#39;ve obviously got no idea how much we actually know about his life and times - why are they faking this? what possible reason would a collection of aristocrats (though apparently not bacon?) have for setting up a low-grade playhouse on the south side of the river and performing bawdy dramas which most people doubt would survive a single run let alone enter into history as such significant works.  this theory makes no sense, if you can then defend it using actual arguments and sensible sounding reasoning...  </p>

<p>in the eighteenth century when this theory was mildly popular, you wont find a single serious historian or literary academic who believes anything other than there was a man called William Shaxspere who wrote a load of plays, some sonnets, songs, and ballads (mostly lost to the grace of history) - id you want to go with academic opinion then academic opinion is absolutely certain that shakes was the real deal.  </p>

<p>it doesn&#39;t require someone to know every single aspect of history to know there&#39;s a coherent timeline of events which would make absolutely no sense if you skip a thousand years in the middle of it - i mean honestly, do you not know anything about the era 500-1500ad, i mean that&#39;s like the entire age of faith right to the reformation, i mean really, you think all of that&#39;s made up?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Manuscripts written by jesuit monks who&#39;s motto literally means &quot;the ends justify the means&quot;.  </p>

<p>yes i&#39;ve read Ignatius, the founder of the Society of Jesus better known as the Jesuit order, it was founded in response to the reformation - think about that for a second, in response to the reformation.... think about that. but yeah, skipping the obvious, you&#39;re telling me that old holey&#39;shoes wrote the entire history of pre-reformation Catholicism as part of a sinister trick to insert a thousand years into the timeline for no discernible reason?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you so confident you are reading marco polos original words?  </p>

<p>do you know what source cohesion is? it&#39;s like how police know if a witness is telling lies, are there things in this book which shouldn&#39;t be there? are there not things which should? this is one of the many ways that people use to ascertain the veracity of texts, another useful one is when are the earliest references to this text and quotes from it -- people don&#39;t quote books before they&#39;re written, i mean have you any idea how hard that&#39;d be to organise for pool ol&#39; ig?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>well if you believe it was anything like the popular netflix show you are sorely mistaken  </p>

<p>i have literally no idea what you&#39;re talking about but find it hilarious you imagine the only source of knowledge is popular culture, that might well explain why you know basically nothing about history or how history works?  </p>

<p>oh baby learned a buzzword!  do you see a sign which says &#39;this place is where idots say anything they like and no one is allowed to question them&#39;? no? then fuck off back to godlike if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after - this is a place for people who are interested in finding the truth and trying to solve some of the complex problems of the world. </p>

<p>&quot;the Catholic Church and its charities are so ingrained in the U.S. government’s welfare system, it’s hard to reform and better it. For example, in 1996 Catholic Charities lobbied heavily against welfare-reform law and met with then-President Clinton to help derail it.&quot;

All of which was rather similar design to these: <a href="http://imgarcade.com/1/german-iron-cross-flag">http://imgarcade.com/1/german-iron-cross-flag</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5bew6a/maltese_cross_symbol_means_vinegar_the_vinegar/">Maltese cross symbol means Vinegar, The Vinegar Sponge of Jesus, and some Google spy shit</a></p>

<p>Now I know why it was downvoted to 0.  The title I made makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  ugh.  I need to repost it.  Basically the post says, &quot;Isn&#39;t it curious that the Catholic church has an angel-saint holding a spear with a sponge on it, exalting the roman soldier that fed Jesus vinegar when he begged for water, the final, cruel insult to Jesus?  Popes wear a maltese cross to remember this insult, as the symbol historically means vinegar&quot;</p>

<p>that&#39;s an odd theory which isn&#39;t backed by any historical documents i&#39;ve ever seen, and it&#39;s going against much more reasonable and well sourced opinions; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the 15th century, the eight points of the four arms of the later called Maltese Cross represented the eight lands of origin, or Langues of the Knights Hospitaller: Auvergne, Provence, France, Aragon, Castille and Portugal, Italy, Germany, and England (with Scotland and Ireland).[5]</p>

<p>The eight points also symbolize the eight obligations or aspirations of the knights:[5]</p>

<ul>
<li>to live in truth<br/></li>
<li>to have faith<br/></li>
<li>to repent one&#39;s sins<br/></li>
<li>to give proof of humility </li>
<li>to love justice<br/></li>
<li>to be merciful<br/></li>
<li>to be sincere and wholehearted<br/></li>
<li>to endure persecution<br/></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Both the Order of Saint John (in German, the Johanniterorden) and the Venerable Order of St John teach that the eight points of the cross represent the eight Beatitudes. The Venerable Order&#39;s main service organisation, St John Ambulance, has applied secular meanings to the points as representing the traits of a good first aider:[6]  </p>

<li>Resourceful (&quot;That he may use to the best advantage whatever is at hand to prevent further damage, and to assist Nature’s efforts to repair the mischief already done&quot;)<br/></li>

<li>Sympathetic (&quot;that he may give real comfort and encouragement to the suffering&quot;)<br/></li>

<p>The <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/75/37/c5/7537c5d6cbe58d590bfb20124769576d.jpg">alchemy symbol for vinegar</a> is not a Maltese Cross it&#39;s not even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_patt%C3%A9e">cross pattée</a> it&#39;s a cross with flat ends - but even if so, so what? that means absolutely nothing. There are millions of things need symbols and only so many possible symbols - they get repeated all the time, one thing looking a little bit like the other isn&#39;t proof the pope is a pizza eating pedo or whatever this over-reaching attempt at a a conspiracy theory is.  </p>

<p>and yes the symbolism of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arma_Christi">Arma Christi</a> is complex and confusing, most of history is - i mean you live in a christian country, i presume you&#39;re an atheist but you&#39;re at least aware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Lance">the spear of destiny</a> it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Sponge">the sponge of destiny</a> either...  </p>

<p>as for the wine being an insult, maybe not so much... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Posca was a popular drink in ancient Rome and Greece, made by mixing sour wine or vinegar with water and flavouring herbs. It originated in Greece as a medicinal mixture but became an everyday drink for the Roman army and the lower classes from around the 2nd century BC, continuing to be used throughout Roman history and into the Byzantine period.   </p>

<p>Finally, when I went to google translate and put in acctum, it translated from Latin to English as ACCT. All caps. Of course, I wouldn&#39;t have known acctum was vinegar from google translate, because it gives me some cryptic &quot;ACCT&quot; translation. Which to my mind means &quot;Account&quot;, because I&#39;m used to looking at HR related nonsense, as I&#39;m sure ALL of you are used to doing as well. In fact, in today&#39;s world, ACCT always means account.
It&#39;s almost like they are whistleblowing on themselves as some kind of arcane mountain nazis in some remote swiss castle server waiting to turn on the blue beams come election day. You know, so the Catholic church can roll us back to a new dark age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hallmark of a pseudoskeptic is that they start off with adhoms and the false introduction that what I gave was not sourced with historical documents, when it was.</p>

<p>Also, give me a reason why google translates to ACCT </p>

<p>I can&#39;t come up with one, other than it&#39;s bad software / bad data </p>

<p>All i did was report this and write something funny about what I thought of it.  If you took that as scholarly, then it&#39;s you that is the dipshit not me.  </p>

<p>Regarding the maltese symbol, I cross referenced 3 alchemical texts whch i believe i provided so basically I&#39;m not changing my position on it being vinegar.</p>

<p>I have no comment on the psychohistory of whatever romans &#39;were thinking&#39; when giving jesus vinegar--I consider that to be story / bullshit catholic dogma and not fact.  The fact is (if it even is a fact) they gave him vinegar when he asked for water.  If i were thirsty, I would not want to drink vinegar</p>

<p>your copypasta of order of st john doesn&#39;t sway me sorry, you are modifying the context and therefore you&#39;re being fallacious and disingenuous. I was talking about alchemy, not about catholic dogma</p>

<p>Also, why don&#39;t both of you try something really new: create your own material, instead of trying your level (and very discourteous) best to discredit everyone around you for a change.  You&#39;ve battled with several pepole on this thread alone, which says a lot about you. It doens&#39;t make you smart nor does it make you right.  It makes you an egoist.</p>

<p>no it&#39;s not, i already explained this to you - it doesn&#39;t mean vinegar as the same thing you think of when you think of vinegar, that&#39;s a poor translation, like what happened in your search for ACCT, the biblical scholars who write the KJV knew basically nothing about the middle east, let alone the middle east during antiquity however now we&#39;re almost half a century in the future and have science and academic history on our side we&#39;ve spotted their mistake and corrected it, though for people still studying bibles from the reformation often still get confused...  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>you were literally talking about why the pope wears a certain symbol, he wears it because of the long and detailed catholic dogma that surrounds it, not because it looks a bit like a commonly used symbol. </p>

<p>ah but i do, and when i do people someone point out that i&#39;ve made errors and i&#39;m grateful for it because i&#39;m interested in discovering the truth not in trying to look special.  </p>

<p>heh no those things came about because of education, study and a desire for truth.  </p>

<p>Sorry but no you can&#39;t just invent a stupid story and try and find people credulous enough to believe you, i mean what&#39;s your end game with the false story you&#39;ve cooked up? do you want peoples money? want them to respect you? want them to invite you to do speaking tours and all that business?  sorry, you actually have to earn that sort of thing by actually being right, the world doesn&#39;t owe you anything - if you bring your half baked rubbish here then of course people are going to laugh at it, are going to point out the flaws and deceptions in your arguments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO Papa Ratzinger (Pope Benedict) did indeed oversee a coverup of all sexual abuse committed within the Church by priests;</p>

<p>This was done by overturning Canon 904B (which, until 1962, mandated that all violations of the sacrement of penance (raping a parioshner) had to be reported to local civil authorities), and replacing it with updated language pursuant to the doctrine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimen_sollicitationis">Crimen sollicitationis</a>.</p>

<p>That updated doctrine mandated that all reports of priests raping their parishioners be forwarded <em>only</em> to the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, which was run by &quot;Pope Benedict&quot; for over 20 years before he ascended to the papacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really connect random rapes from priests with this systematic and organized pedophile and satanist activities from the pizzag8te?</p>

<p>I can remember from Benedict&#39;s time that he made some noise about the 2008 bank crash and how it was handled and that he had some serious &quot;problems&quot; inside the Vatican with strange leaks.</p>

<p>The guy was a conservative intellectual which had at least a philosophical educational background if not more.</p>

<p>How he stepped down always looked wrong and I would not be surprised if this was organized to force him out.</p>

<p>About the Podesta brothers being jesuit trained. I&#39;ve always wondered how Tony Podesta got to this camp nose in Japan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>doing a little research, I am suspecting it was a word that meant children before it meant the food.</p>

<p>The origin of the word pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa]) is uncertain. The term &quot;pizza&quot; first appeared in a Latin text from the southern Italy town of Gaeta in 997 AD, which states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta duodecim pizze (&quot;twelve pizzas&quot;) every Christmas Day, and another twelve every Easter Sunday&quot;.[1][7]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a heads up and not to discredit or take away from it in any way but &#39;rationalwiki&#39; (for what its&#39; worth--and that may be not much) says this is &#39;pseudolegal&#39;, they put it in the section of citizen justice being illegitimate.  </p>

<p>I think common law tribunals wherein you have mass numbers of people bringing forth mountains of evidence is better-than-legal because it reflects the will-of-the-people even more than a regular corrupt legal system would.  So anyone claiming &#39;pseudolegal&#39; would be hypocritical in saying for example that they support democracy but they don&#39;t also support this &#39;so-called-pseudolegal&#39; citizens tribunal: It would be an immediate red flag contradiction. </p>

<p>Overall my point is that to judge &#39;legitimacy&#39; then look to the US constitution and bill of rights as a guide.  On which basis do they have legitimacy?  A better way of putting it is: what gives them authority?</p>

<p>The best answer I can find is &quot;popular sovereignty&quot;, which means &quot;will of the people&quot;.  Basically, it&#39;s public will and the art of the social contract between all citizens to recognize and uphold the law.  Therefore, I can only conclude that if the basis of popular sovereignty is the basis of our own legal systems, then it must hold the same for citizen tribunals and thus they are not pseudolegal but actually legal and therefore I think they are a good idea in the case of pizzagate as well.  </p>

<p>TO add to their legitimacy, one could create a way suggest that their actions interfere with international commerce; that they are a violation of international commerce and thus have violated maritime admiralty law in some way.  Because then you make this whole court an intenrational court and you are trying them for international sea-wise crime, which means you are then entitled if you find them guilty to snatch them from any jurisdiction anywhere lest it become enforceable by any number of external governments that are willing to oversee and enforce the case, most specifically INTERPOL is who you&#39;d want to prove it to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t implicate the catholic faith.  It implicates politicians within the Church.  When you stop seeing people as exalted holy people (that they totally aren&#39;t), then you see them as people.  And people sometimes rape kids.  When they do, we should knock their stupid hats off, trade their cassocks for orange jumpsuits when we put them in jail.</p>

<p>Just because someone wears a funny fish hat somewhere in italy doesn&#39;t make them the king of opinion to the rest of us who aren&#39;t catholic, but to catholics it does.  Nor does it entitle them to &#39;do as they wilt&quot; without consequence.  Yet they totally do. That&#39;s the problem right there.  </p>

<p>You need to see things as they are, not as you want them to be.  The popes shouldn&#39;t be--much like Obama or Hillary--exempt from Justice, if it&#39;s due.  I think the idea that we can&#39;t put the pope on trial because he&#39;s the pope...there is something wrong with that idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m talking about doesn&#39;t exist yet.  It&#39;s an idea, a concept upon which our now-broken system is originally based.  So yes, at some point, we are going to have to make our own court system because the one we have now doesn&#39;t do anything for justice.  It&#39;s broken.  And yes it will be legitimate because it will be populist.  Our system now uses a jury &quot;of peers&quot;...that means that populism is primary.</p>

<p>Also, &#39;cheap youtube videos and bullshit&#39;?  I&#39;m talking about <em>people</em> giving testimonies.  Why do you care if it&#39;s in 1080p with high production value?  If anything, that lends itself to <em>less legitimacy, not more</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about a people-centric, testimony and witness based evidence.  If that&#39;s not good enough for the court, nothing is and any court that would use other evidence is actually fraudulent--because it&#39;s setting the foxes among the chickens---and that is how we got to where we are now, this post-cog-non-justice/lawless modality of governance</p>

<p>Laws of physics is good evidence.    Finding stolen property in someones possession is good evidence of theft.   Witness testimony is also useful,  but requires testing for various criteria of validity.    Your complaint is more likely based on the corruption and criminality that have seized control of US institutions.    The prybar that opens this up is not a new standard,  but using the rule of law and not compromising on the principles of real investigating,   differentiating between a hunch and real evidence for example.   Its worth studying the rules of evidence.    But,  as long as the institutions are corrupt,  nothing can really happen.   Yet,  that is not an excuse for the return of witch hunts,  we still need to have some discipline to our investigation.   Which means pizzagate needs a lot more credible witnesses who witnessed real crimes,  not just stuff that was creepy.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the most salient comment.  It&#39;s that we have enough witness and circumstantial evidence to have &quot;probable cause&quot; and an actional context for investigation.  So, when that doesn&#39;t happen, it means shits all fucked and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it.  I&quot;m not sure what&#39;s is up with the witch hunt narrative. I&quot;m not trying to start a witch hunt. That narrative itself, that an open source investigation is a witch hunt is itself a witch hunt; it&#39;s like false victimhood, it&#39;s garbage.  Throw it away and don&#39;t be afraid to face facts or repeat them to others.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t, then you end up with the nearly universally pakistani sex gangs in england that the police were afraid to police and &#39;racial profile&#39; out of fear of being labeled &#39;racist&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a common sense line of balance that investigators sometimes miss.    On the one  hand,   a lack of will to look in a particular direction,   on the other a sensationalistic and lurid desire to turn something into a spectacle when the data has to be over twisted to get you there,  and no better data is forthcoming.    So on the one hand,  you get the Pakistani ring,  and on the other hand you get Kern County of the 80&#39;s or the infatuation of amateurs with Pizzagate.    Those same amateurs,  by the way,  who didn&#39;t care about Hastert,  or didn&#39;t even know about Savile.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t seen the Kern county pedophilia witch hunt video,  you should:   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0C2aQprdIM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0C2aQprdIM</a> full movie:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DR3e44PR3E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DR3e44PR3E</a></p>

<p>I have no doubt that people capable of 9/11 are capable of anything.    This pizzagate angle is unfortunate in that it is going to set back the conspiracy community because its too easy for the establishment to control the narrative,  in fact, it looks like a psy op for that reason.    There will be no forthcoming corroboration in pizzagate.     When you are the underdog,  you have to make each grip count,  or your opponent wins.   Pick your battles,  or you won&#39;t be there to win on another day.</p>

<p>but also, see a lack of law against something as heinous as child abuse, make it against the law, why? popular sovereignty, now maybe I&#39;m wrong but I feel most are against it, the rich aren&#39;t apparently but that&#39;s not supposed to what goes in a democracy, which we&#39;re not, so let&#39;s make it one.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you.  Bad laws are illegitimate if they go against the will of the majority.  It&#39;s basically committing people to do something that they find immoral.  That&#39;s not how things are supposed to work.</p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t be so easy for them to pass those laws, nor should it be so difficult to remove them. But that&#39;s actually how it is though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to feel really dirty having attended Jesuit-run higher education…</p>

<p>Still trying to tie these worldwide cases together into a cohesive narrative. From my own research on the Middle East I get the impression that organized religion has largely been subverted and overtaken by crypto-pagan cabals or worse, with the heresies perpetuated in these circles coming to be accepted over established religion. IIRC this was the case with the Babylonian Jews and their prioritizing the Talmud over the Torah. </p>

<p>I think the occult/religious aspect is very understudied and probably holds the key to a large part of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;ve misrepresented themselves to a lot of very well-intentioned people.  And once you get to a certain point, they demoralize and transmute you into something you never wanted and use blackmail leverage to control you.  It&#39;s the same with the masons.  Exactly the same.  </p>

<p>They are mafias that do bad things at high levels, do good things at low levels to insulate themsleves from scrutiny (collecting money for kids hospitals and such).     THey also coordinate and cooperate with each other, against--specifically--burgeoning and legitimate democracies,which america is NOT and has not ever been (republic / oligarchic)</p>

<p>Say if you were a drug dealer who gave 90% to the community through various orgs, and you bought up a bunch of people in the chamber of commerce, the court system, etc, then when you ran for office, many would know you&#39;re a terrible mafia dude and they&#39;d still support you because you&#39;ve designed the system around you to insulate you from Justice. That&#39;s basically a description of the entire Clinton apparatus.  Or to a larger extent, the CIA</p>

<p>Or to an even larger extent, the knights of malta and other jesuitical orders.  They run the worlds drug cartels, they move guns and run assassination campaigns.  I think freemasons and various criminal mafias (ukranian, russian, khazarian) mainly deal with the human trafficking, <del>and Jesuits don&#39;t (that I know of)</del> (someone posted src), but they are all involved in criminality of some sort, and Jesuit Pope Francis is implicated in both running a fascist junta and right wing terror in argentica and by several witness testimonies claiming child rape.  Now I believe the latter because what kind of demon would accuse the pope of something like this...that&#39;s like taking the express elevator to hell, if you&#39;re lying.</p>

<p>Anyway I&#39;m glad you&#39;re waking up to this.  I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve gotten involved with them.  Hopefully you can get out safely.  You have the opportunity to let people know what&#39;s going on.  If you need some sources on this stuff mayb ethis map will help you to a degree.  It&#39;s a work in progress</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s actually no such thing as an &quot;International Common Law Court of Criminal Justice.&quot;  or whatever that guy calls it.  It&#39;s completely made up, and the product of some nut on the internet.  A lot of these &quot;verdicts&quot; are entirely made-up, having never had any trial anywhere, much less simultaneously in multiple nations.  If there were some sort of magical international criminal court, it would have to come from treaties signed by every nation involved, and we wouldn&#39;t have the need to extradite people to stand trial for their crimes.  The UK and its former colonies are the only places that subscribe to &quot;Common Law,&quot; with all of continental Europe and all of South America using what is known as &quot;Civil Code.&quot;  Russia and China have their own bizarre quasi-civil-code with a socialist law tradition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya know, actually, that&#39;s exactly right.  Sovereignty is exactly the reason why that court doesn&#39;t exist.  The USA would never submit its own citizens to trial in a criminal court outside the USA, unless they violated the sovereignty and the laws of another sovereign state, with whom we had formal treaty negotiations.  This guy Kevin what&#39;s his face, with all the alphabet soup organizations-- he certainly isn&#39;t going to somehow be allowed to indict someone.  That would subject them to the adjudication of an unelected sovereign&#39;s capricious and absurd claims to have power over them. Our nation believes to a large extent that the common law follows the American citizen, and that the American citizen is best tried in an American or state court. </p>

<p>Yay America for protecting our rights and our sovereignty.  But, much to your chagrin, if ever you get indicted by a US Attorney and a federal grand jury for a federal crime, yelling nonsense about your personal sovereignty and your submission only to your local sheriff-- that&#39;ll get you less than nowhere.  And at the heart of it, any sovereign&#39;s inherent right over you comes from its ability to make you submit.  Consider the state your personal leviathan.</p>

<p>Moreover, my fellow citizens deserve to be able to seek damages from me in court if I have wronged them.  I, in turn, have the rights guaranteed to me as a citizen under the bill of rights and the 14th amendment.  Trust me, you don&#39;t want to be ruled as having given up your claims to those protections in a US court.  By engaging with a society, you submit to its sovereignty in at least a limited sense for the common good.  So these sovcitizen nutbars need to start paying their tickets, and stop claiming that the statutory age of consent around their particular trailer home is twelve.  As Walter said, dude, We live in a society.  There are rules.</p>

<p>The &#39;Black Pope&#39; and Accused Child Killer Adolfo Nicolas Pachon Will Resign From Office</p>

<p>Amidst rumours that Pope Francis, Jorge Bergoglio, may step down from his office because of his public prosecution for child trafficking and murder, one of his fellow defendants has just done so.</p>

<p>Jesuit Superior General Adolfo Nicolas Pachon, [also known as the Black Pope], announced suddenly this week that he will resign from his office at the next General Congress of the Jesuits.</p>

<p>Along with Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, Bergoglio and Pachon are primary defendants in an historic criminal lawsuit being conducted by the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels that commenced on April 7, 2014.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes far, far back into the past, though you won&#39;t learn much about it in the &quot;history&quot; or the various &quot;religions&quot; as largely invented by the Vatican. The facade is starting to crack in this institution named for the grandson of Genghis Khan or Presbyter John, the great &quot;Megalian&quot; leader shown by modern science to be an ancestor of much of the planet&#39;s population. People are slowly awakening to the reality that major modern religions all began as a Roman psy-op. Abraham &gt; Ab Rome &gt; From Rome. I understand this is all a little too much to swallow in this era of Pepe and pepperoni, but I think we&#39;ll be there soon. r/newchronology</p>

<p>You guys are acting like the Vatican is the topdawg when Jewish blood libel has been a thing since like... forever. I hate this pansy ass jesuit pope and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised but this goes up way higher then the Vatican.

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s look at it this way: the Rothschilds are jesuits. Ok?</p>

<p>The &quot;Jews&quot; have been a country since the 1940s--before that they were an ethnicity spread out everywhere, effectively making them untethered gypsies--before that only a few had real power in England and had to beg the prime minister to help them set up israel, which they gladly did, because pagan satanist freemasons found Jews to be really annoying also. After all it was the sabbateans that had anything worth stealing (kabbalism), to the aristocratic monsters that decided to create israel via the balfour declaration and it was a way to fasttrack the jewish poeple out of england as much as it was a way to have an ally in a market england would develop.  To be their jewish eyes and ears.</p>

<p>So Israel as a country has been around for like 75 ish years now...so they&#39;ve been making equivalent money lets say as the crown....for 75 yrs. And certainly that&#39;s not even possible since England has been running the global (opiates) drug empire for ... ever.</p>

<p>Which is bigger, 1000 yrs or 75?  (comparing william the conquerer / norman invasion to now)</p>

<p>Bonus: which is bigger 2000 yrs or 75 yrs?  (comparing vatican to israel).</p>

<p>Power = money x time</p>

<p>Vatican wins.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind Vatican controlled England from 0-Norman invasion, then it was french king controlled until jesuits reinfiltrated and now it&#39;s again vatican controlled, being as how EIIR (queen eliz 2) is a knights of malta jesuit.</p>

<p>ALL PIZZA, even the queen&#39;s pizza, LEADS TO <del>WRONG</del>Rome</p>

<p>(i feel like maybe this is a mic drop moment)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right,.  Honestly, I don&#39;t care if they worship satan or some kind of stupid owl god.  America is supposed to protect their right to do that.</p>

<p>However, the kids stuff cannot stand.  And neither can the exertion of their &#39;magickal will&#39; on the populace through mind control as some kind of statist programme of propaganda social kontrol.  That&#39;s the problem I really have with &quot;satanic stuff&quot; it&#39;s not about them going into a corner with a bell book and candle and fucking around with their own heads---it&#39;s about pushing and peddling their garbage onto people through the news, film, symbols and music videos in order to pervert people&#39;s understanding of the world around them and abuse them with tropes that confound, disturb, derange, disenfranchise and dissociate people from reality.  Or more succinctly, mental slavery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;ve misrepresented themselves to a lot of very well-intentioned people.  And once you get to a certain point, they demoralize and transmute you into something you never wanted and use blackmail leverage to control you.  It&#39;s the same with the masons.  Exactly the same.  </p>

<p>They are mafias that do bad things at high levels, do good things at low levels to insulate themsleves from scrutiny (collecting money for kids hospitals and such).     THey also coordinate and cooperate with each other, against--specifically--burgeoning and legitimate democracies,which america is NOT and has not ever been (republic / oligarchic)</p>

<p>Say if you were a drug dealer who gave 90% to the community through various orgs, and you bought up a bunch of people in the chamber of commerce, the court system, etc, then when you ran for office, many would know you&#39;re a terrible mafia dude and they&#39;d still support you because you&#39;ve designed the system around you to insulate you from Justice. That&#39;s basically a description of the entire Clinton apparatus.  Or to a larger extent, the CIA</p>

<p>Or to an even larger extent, the knights of malta and other jesuitical orders.  They run the worlds drug cartels, they move guns and run assassination campaigns.  I think freemasons and various criminal mafias (ukranian, russian, khazarian) mainly deal with the human trafficking, <del>and Jesuits don&#39;t (that I know of)</del> (someone posted src), but they are all involved in criminality of some sort, and Jesuit Pope Francis is implicated in both running a fascist junta and right wing terror in argentica and by several witness testimonies claiming child rape.  Now I believe the latter because what kind of demon would accuse the pope of something like this...that&#39;s like taking the express elevator to hell, if you&#39;re lying.</p>

<p>Anyway I&#39;m glad you&#39;re waking up to this.  I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve gotten involved with them.  Hopefully you can get out safely.  You have the opportunity to let people know what&#39;s going on.  If you need some sources on this stuff mayb ethis map will help you to a degree.  It&#39;s a work in progress</p>

<p>how about you, is this a holy quest for you? some battle to ensure the faith you were born into wins over all others? or are you more devout that that, are you like me a true believer in the wonder of the universe and simply want to do your duty as a thinking being to try and understand the reality which has been presented of us? </p>

<p>I never said it was Bacon I said it was a large group of collaborators.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is just as absurd, i mean honestly you&#39;ve obviously got no idea how much we actually know about his life and times - why are they faking this? what possible reason would a collection of aristocrats (though apparently not bacon?) have for setting up a low-grade playhouse on the south side of the river and performing bawdy dramas which most people doubt would survive a single run let alone enter into history as such significant works.  this theory makes no sense, if you can then defend it using actual arguments and sensible sounding reasoning...  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Snooty academics? You mean the ones most educated and qualified to make the call?   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>in the eighteenth century when this theory was mildly popular, you wont find a single serious historian or literary academic who believes anything other than there was a man called William Shaxspere who wrote a load of plays, some sonnets, songs, and ballads (mostly lost to the grace of history) - id you want to go with academic opinion then academic opinion is absolutely certain that shakes was the real deal.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Im glad you&#39;ve vetted it all for us then. pack it in boys!  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>it doesn&#39;t require someone to know every single aspect of history to know there&#39;s a coherent timeline of events which would make absolutely no sense if you skip a thousand years in the middle of it - i mean honestly, do you not know anything about the era 500-1500ad, i mean that&#39;s like the entire age of faith right to the reformation, i mean really, you think all of that&#39;s made up?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Manuscripts written by jesuit monks who&#39;s motto literally means &quot;the ends justify the means&quot;.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes i&#39;ve read Ignatius, the founder of the Society of Jesus better known as the Jesuit order, it was founded in response to the reformation - think about that for a second, in response to the reformation.... think about that. but yeah, skipping the obvious, you&#39;re telling me that old holey&#39;shoes wrote the entire history of pre-reformation Catholicism as part of a sinister trick to insert a thousand years into the timeline for no discernible reason?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you so confident you are reading marco polos original words?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>do you know what source cohesion is? it&#39;s like how police know if a witness is telling lies, are there things in this book which shouldn&#39;t be there? are there not things which should? this is one of the many ways that people use to ascertain the veracity of texts, another useful one is when are the earliest references to this text and quotes from it -- people don&#39;t quote books before they&#39;re written, i mean have you any idea how hard that&#39;d be to organise for pool ol&#39; ig?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>well if you believe it was anything like the popular netflix show you are sorely mistaken  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>i have literally no idea what you&#39;re talking about but find it hilarious you imagine the only source of knowledge is popular culture, that might well explain why you know basically nothing about history or how history works?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would people discuss conspiracy in a conspiracy form? Get out of here concern troll.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>oh baby learned a buzzword!  do you see a sign which says &#39;this place is where idots say anything they like and no one is allowed to question them&#39;? no? then fuck off back to godlike if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after - this is a place for people who are interested in finding the truth and trying to solve some of the complex problems of the world. </p>
