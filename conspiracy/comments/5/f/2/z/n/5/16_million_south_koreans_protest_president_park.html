<p>To get a background on what occurred about 5 weeks ago, read this thread</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59z1le/breaking_korean_shadow_government_uncovered/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59z1le/breaking_korean_shadow_government_uncovered/</a></p>

<p>or this article</p>

<p>m.koreatimes.co.kr/pad/news/view.jsp?req_newsidx=217297</p>

<p>These protests are following the reveal that President Park operated through a cult leader who pulled the strings of SK state affairs, wrote Park&#39;s her speeches, designed Park&#39;s policy, and appointed members of the government on her behalf.</p>

<p>Samsung (which contributes to over 20% of SK&#39;s GDP (<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/whoa-samsung-is-responsible-for-20-of-south-koreas-economy/260552/">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/whoa-samsung-is-responsible-for-20-of-south-koreas-economy/260552/</a>) , and other huge corporations within SK bought policy and favors through the cult leader through her &quot;charitable foundation.&quot; The protests are halting SK&#39;s economy, and the same government, most of which the cult leader appointed, is moving for her impeachment (<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/south-korean-opposition-moves-impeach-park-161121081011832.html">http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/south-korean-opposition-moves-impeach-park-161121081011832.html</a>).</p>

<p>The odd thing about this whole thing though is that the father of Choi Soon-sil, Choi Tae-min, was the &quot;mentor and associate&quot; of Park&#39;s father Park Chung-hee when he was president. Park the senior was assassinated by the director of the Korean CIA due to Park senior&#39;s &quot;failure to prevent Choi Tae-min’s corrupt activities and keep him away from his daughter.&quot; Choi senior initially met Park soon after her mother Yuk Young-soo was assassinated in 1974 and she assumed the duties of first lady at age 22 for her father. This influence continued well into her Presidency and his daughter took over the job following his death, even though the KCIA fully knew about the issue.</p>

<p>In 2007, a diplomatic cable made public through WikiLeaks, the American Embassy in Seoul reported rumors that Mr. Choi, a &#39;Korean Rasputin&#39;, “had complete control over Park’s body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result.</p>

<p>While this may just seem like a Korean house of cards gone wrong, Choi Soon-sil has connections to Lockheed Martin, one of the top military contractors for the US. President Park also met with Lockheed&#39;s president numerous times during her office, and considering nothing major happened without Choi&#39;s approval/guidance it can be assumed it was Choi&#39;s doing.</p>

<p>&quot;Lockheed was awarded some 80 billion won ($68 million) in contracts covering from 2010 to 2015, but contracts the company secured to cover from 2015 to 2021 are worth more than 12 trillion won,&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/11/116_218938.html">https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/11/116_218938.html</a></p>

<p>Park&#39;s father also gained power due to the May 16 coup (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_16_coup#United_States_response">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_16_coup#United_States_response</a>) where Kennedy responded 3 days later by &quot;dispatch[ing] a message to the SCNR confirming the friendship between the two countries&quot; despite martial law being declared by SK at the time. This occurred 7 years following the Korean War where the US and the UN fought for SK against a NK invasion.</p>

<p>UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is the favorite for reelection once Park leaves office. </p>

<p>Choi is currently still in Hessen, Germany (home to Frankfurt where she sought refuge over 5 weeks ago and denies all claims. Angela Merkel hasn&#39;t commented on the South Korean situation based off my research.</p>

<p>The news media outside of SK are not presenting the full situation and the protests are growing by hundreds of thousands daily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good run-down, but Choi Soon-sil is NOT in Germany--she returned to Korea five (Four?) weeks ago and is in custody. She&#39;s gonna be prosecuted. To add, she bribed her daughter&#39;s way through high school and into a prestigious university: the investigation into this and the faux-sports companies she allegedly used to extort the chaebol (mega-corporations) blew the lid off of this whole scandal, a scandal the entire government seems to have known about and/or been in on for years and had allowed to continue unabated. The corruption is endemic and widespread, thus the 2 million-person protest yesterday with 1.5 million in Seoul alone. The biggest protest in the country&#39;s history. Park refuses to stand down or even answer prosecutors&#39; questions. It looks like she may be impeached on Friday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oops, didn&#39;t check how the situation on Choi had evolved. Good to know she&#39;s in custody. And how do you feel about how the situation being allowed to continue even with KCIA knowledge; is it more proof transnational corps/chaebol control the government? Or was it a lone case of a shadow government led by Choi and her father?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question and I have no idea. The thing&#39;s so incredibly bizarre with so many weird distractions (New things every day--you read about the Viagra thing?!) that I don&#39;t know what may constitute the truth. Hell, that story about how the Sewol sinking was actually a ceremony to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Choi Tae-min’s death and to bring him back to life through the sacrifice of hundreds of kids...when <em>that</em> makes about as much sense as anything in the so-called surface news, what am I supposed to think?</p>

<p>I can say with certainty though that chaebol=government and government=chaebol in South Korea. Everyone knew about this stuff going on for a long time, not only the NIS (National Intelligence Service). Gotta remember the NIS got caught manipulating online forums in Park&#39;s favor prior to her getting elected, so they&#39;re but an extension of the power. Also, I&#39;ve read that the reason Park didn&#39;t indict the previous president, Lee Myung-bak, for his crimes was because of all the dirt he had on <em>her</em>, i.e., the current scandal, which makes perfect sense. It&#39;s all so...<em>sigh</em>, nepotism is the norm. How very ironic that recently the Kim Young-ran Act has come into effect with the goal of eliminating graft and corruption. So far the only changes I&#39;ve seen is that children can no longer give chocolate to their teachers or the teachers have to pay a fine, and restaurants are complaining that their business is tanking because of no more fancy work dinners.</p>

<p>As you typed up very well above, this has been a long time coming. I&#39;ve never been prouder of the Korean people: they&#39;re not taking this sitting down. I do, however, hope that they realize this is not just about Choi and Park but rather the entire corrupt national or even transnational government as you insinuate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ferry incident is bizarre. Apparently Park didn&#39;t respond for around 7 hours after the incident happened because Choi was in Germany at the time and was sleeping so Park had no guidance on what to do. The biggest thing for me is that American/European media has this story was a low-level sideshow. It isn&#39;t big on any news broadcasts, web pages, etc, which leads me to believe that special interests are pulling the strings of Time Warner and other big media corps to downplay the story. It&#39;s actually surprisingly rare that anyone I know has heard about this story and the people who have only think Choi wrote speeches for Park. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting that this ties back to the occult. I&#39;m not too well versed in Korean Shamanism but from what I understand it&#39;s similar to what Westerners would think of Voodoo.</p>

<p>Interesting that high level officials are interested in child sacrifice, and we have evidence via podesta leaks that high level government officials in the US are at the very least involved in child trafficking and maintain relations with people who are interested in occult rituals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post with lots of info to digest.</p>

<p>I&#39;m getting the feeling we are getting a rare glimpse into the power control system. Cult worship provides for a much greater way to control people than simple levers of money, sex and career ruin. Elites have been into Cult type activities for a very long time, centuries, one only has to look at the list of names to the Bohemian Grove to see the latest example of that. Skull and Bones being an intro for future power players to Cult rules.  In the US the media doesn&#39;t go near the subject but it&#39;s still there.</p>

<p>No surprise elites will throw up all sorts of distractions now to obscure the real story. They&#39;ll also string the scandal along until they have prepared a plan to transition power to another controlled figure. Ban Ki-moon it sounds like.</p>

<p>This cult stuff is a much more effective and tighter control system than simply &#39;corruption&#39;. As investigators we should probably be focusing more attention on societies and their members and activities.</p>
