       Just throwing this out there for comment.  It seems too widespread and documentation  of such acts could be used to blackmail or force other office-holders to comply as needed by the powers that be.

       Seems plausible.

       As the masses wake gradually more and more, learn the secrets, we become desensitized in a similar manner.

       I don't think we will ever become desensitized to the point where pedophilia is condoned and accepted.   At least, I hope not.

       But when reading about Boystown,  and all involved in the Franklin cover-up, those children seemed to travel to D.C. a lot.  Now, reading about the Podesta's, and other powerful politicians, as well as Epstein,  they all seem to be part of a "club" of people who are beyond the law.  And this is not a republican/democrat thing, because names on both sides of that line have been mentioned in connection with Epstein.

       You might be amazed at what can happen to culture over hundreds of years of desensitization and indoctrination.  You would think that things we believe to be horrors would be inherently built into our psyche forever as such, but looking at the human race, it's not looking so good.

       I agree.  The Roman and Greek histories are filled with stories of horrendous things that must have happened towards the end of those civilizations that made me hesitate to post my previous response, but I can hope.

       Good question.   I believe that we are at this point because murder,rape,and other lesser crimes have become last weeks news.  This really only leaves the abominations like child-rape and bestiality.  In hearing some of these silver-tongued politicians speak, I think they could probably explain away bestiality.   "It was a frat prank...  I had to do it"

       Anything you wouldn't want your kids to know about,  your wife,  parents,  or voters,  would be sufficient.     For example,  so far,  sex with animals is still frowned upon,  or being videotaped smoking crack from a crack pipe.    But yeah,  they have got to have something on you before they are going to fund you and funnel you to the top with all kinds of red carpet,  handling of the media,  silencing the judicial process,  etc.  etc.

       I think you are dead on.  Maybe they are forced into it at first and then once they do it, it's not such a big deal and they get to be with the in crowd.  Kinda like doing drugs in high school. And def not trying to compare pedos to taking drugs in high school, just a poor example to make a point.

       Yes, they call it blackmail leverage.  It's how all mafias work.  In order to progress upwards in the organization  (and hence learn more 'secrets') you have to become a 'made man' by committing worse and worse crimes.
      </p>

       Since the government has shown itself to behave identically to a mafia (human trafficking, murder, rape (physical / mental==MKULTRA), drugging,  kidnapping, drug dealing, drug trafficking, gang warfare (ie: "warfare"), theft, extortion and conspiracy), it's not much of a jump to think they might be using some kind of extremely repugnant form of blackmail leverage to be able to get into the inner circles of the 'above top secret' and ultra / beyond clearances
