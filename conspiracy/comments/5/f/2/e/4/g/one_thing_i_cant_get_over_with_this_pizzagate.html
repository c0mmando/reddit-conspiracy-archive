       Imagine if you had something you could not openly discuss, but you needed to discuss it with others all over the country, and even all over the world. There was a known language you could use that could still theoretically protect you, and because you cannot come up with a new language without putting into words to explain exactly what would otherwise get you in trouble saying, you have all the incentive to stay with the old coded language despite it being decoded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under those circumstances, people do exactly what we see in the creepy pizzagate emails. The code alone is not quite enough to get them in trouble. We know they are using code, we know what they are very likely talking about, BUT technically reasonable doubt is still present. Technically, they did not admit to any crimes in those emails.

       Your right. I propose a final solution. Public executions for everyone involved or even seemingly involved. I know that goes against every freedom and right that i believe in but this? This is beyond my scale of thought. I am literally incapable of wrapping my mind entirely around what the hell is going on. So simplify it. Publicly hang the members we know for sure are involved and then watch people start running. When they run we catch them and interrogate them for the truth by whatever means necessary. The laws were obviously written in favor of these people and other criminals. Which therefore means the law has been tainted at its base core. Making it essentially a law for law abiding people. I hate when people try to worm their way out of things like this and nothing happens. Im surprised there hasnt been a mass kidnapping and execution video. This country needs to rise up. We are discovering the people in charge are doing some really fucked up stuff. I mean fucking kids? Killing kids? Kids are literally innocence personified. The symbolism there is literally unholy. BRING BACK THE CRUSADES

       Well the illuminati/ freemason  conspiracy theorists would say that that this is par for the course because "hidden in plain sight" is the modus operandi for elite occultists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think they have just gotten used to operating with impunity. They are protected by powerful people at all levels and fell victim to hubris. Plus they do want to spread the word to the right people so they can continue to make money.

       Because fuck us. They can do what ever they want and get away with it. Or did I miss where anybody got in trouble? They've been telling us for decades. Victims have been telling us for decades. Investigators have been telling us for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have all the power. They are telling us on purpose. They want us to revolt, but we are too big of pussies to even to that. They are going to have to physically show us what they do before anyone does shit.

       For the same reasons biker gangs use colors, and street gangs tag buildings, and the Masons have secret handshakes, it's a form of communication, so they can identify each other and their hang outs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure they would change their symbols, but the cult is so big now that it's almost nearly impossible for them to all learn and accept the new images. Plus, they were too egotistic and arrogant to think they'd be caught, so they didn't prepare to be found out.

       Look how many people, including myself who didnt realise its symbolism, And to be fair to the untamed eye it looks like a tasty pizza icon. If what they say about their acts being satanic are true, Hiding objects in plain sight with mathematical symbolism is something their well known for doing.

       not that well known to the general public.  And some of the designs are aesthetically pleasing graphics that can be worked into other stuff.  The Comet Pizza logo w/the pedo ref on the pizza was a good example of that.  It can be explained away as a graphic design choice; just trying to make a logo "punch" out.

       I question that as well, but at the same time the number of symbols in such a close vicinity could be more than a chance occurrence. I definitely was not aware of any of the symbols before reading about pizzagate, so I'm not sure exactly how well known they are. So many strange connections to pizzagate...
