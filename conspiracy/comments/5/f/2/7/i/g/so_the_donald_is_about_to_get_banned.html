       And it's because of the same reasons that pizzagate got banned. And, they are also one of the only subreddits that are openly discussing the pizza gate scandal.

       I hope it doesn't happen... they are a very effective hivemind... With numbers to get things to the frontpage of all even if it does disappear soon after.

       I think a lot of people are transitioning from #pizzagate to #pedofiles... which is a change I approve of.

       Yeah I just think it's ridiculous that people are all for the censorship of free speech. We have real problems in this world. What someone says on the internet isn't one of them.

       But what people say on the internet is a problem for the people causing the problems in the world... that's why I think T_D might actually get axed... the only reason it hasn't been yet is because the userbase is so large they'd be afraid of them just splintering to every corner of reddit and getting all up in other subs. At least corralled together they are easier to control.

       I have no control over what happens there and I honestly don't frequent it. I still don't think it should be banned. Take your arguments up with someone over there.

       There's no such thing as taking up and argument over there. It's a circlejerk, and anyone caught not jerking is immediately banned.

       Do you have anything to add? I shouldn't have to do everything for you. Reddit is very easy to search. There was a post that had a lot of traffic and a lot of people calling for the banning of the_donald sub. That's all truth. The posters were claiming the same things that got the pizzagate subreddit banned.

       I agree with everything since I know about it already. But not everyone knows so it's beneficial we present our points objectively to people who might be newer to what's currently unfolding. Just saying it could've have been presented with more thought.

       Well, the good thing is that the donald was compromised and inherited an agenda that was creating Trump fanatics and allowed no critical thinking. The bad thing is that Reddit is taking it too far and its losing even more credibility.

       Yes it does seem suspicious, and I suggest checking out voat.co.

       4chan is going to have a lot more people, but voat has the same format as reddit which is an advantage. I expect voat to have a lot more users over the next few months.

       I've seen way more pizza posts here lately than in the donald.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spez said in the "leaked chat" that he did not want to ban the donald, he wanted to figure a way to calm them down. The whole drama could have been from a pizzagate gang who moves from sub to sub now as mods probably enforced the rules. I don't think they'll ban the donald if they see that's what's going on. That would punish 300k members because of a smaller group. The mods seems to simply enforce the rules and it seems to work well. It's the doxxing that was starting to be out of control (and still is imo).

       yes there was some forms of doxxing, and libel too.

       I've seen subs who were way more disciplined in their research. It's not because people are emotional about the pizza that the methodology (that works so well for other subs) shouldn't apply.

       My friends, I am a senior and perhaps that alllows me to see changes over time that younger people cannot see. There is something called Social Engineering, that slowly changes the traditions, beliefs and values of a culture, a people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soros and other wealthy people have been Social Engineering over past generations toward preparing the world to suit their plans to control us-- i.e. a One World Government. If Hillary had been elected, she would have completed their plans. Donald will not bow to them. He's a maverick who believes in America and genuinely wants to make improvements, if given the chance by our support..
      </p>
      <p>
       The recount should not be allowed. Donald needs to stop it for a good reason-- if the election is overturned so Hillary wins, there will no doubt be mass riots by the people (Trump followers are gun owners). It could even lead to civil war with much bloodshed. If Donald stops the recount that would stop the riots and bloodshed.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can do more than talk about this. We can Tweet and Facebook post on Donald's sites!! Let us tell him to STOP THE RECOUNT, and while he's at it, ARREST HILLARY AND THE WHOLE WHITE HOUSE GANG!!
      </p>
      <p>
       It is our right as citizens to speak out, so let us tell him!!

       Yeah I disagree completely. The recount should be allowed to happen if they raised the money and can prove it in court that it needs to happen. That's what makes this country great. You speak like we need a authoritarian figure. Maybe that comes with your old age. Trump isn't a maverick either. He's been entrenched in hollywood and is a billionaire who is surrounding himself with scary individuals.

       But what people say on the internet is a problem for the people causing the problems in the world... that's why I think T_D might actually get axed... the only reason it hasn't been yet is because the userbase is so large they'd be afraid of them just splintering to every corner of reddit and getting all up in other subs. At least corralled together they are easier to control.
