       So, what if I like my teeth? I use toothpaste and mouthwash with fluoride. I don't agree that it should be in water, as it makes no sense to drink it, but, I'm sure it's absorbed from my mouth as well.

       it only weakens with long exposure. Like, a little works like nanotech to strengthen enamel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, there is another material called novamin that also does this, and may be a viable alternative. The toothpaste I like to use has both in it and is commonly sold in Europe or the UK.

       Dental student here, please read the entirity, this is my objective assesment of the fluoride discussion. To start it out, I am not pro water fluoridation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I consider myself fairly aware of the shit that is going on in the world. I also don't believe everything because the conspiracies can't all be right or all be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       My parents are both dentists. Because of how motivated and enthousiastic they are about their job I want to become one too. My parents have always had fluoride mouthwash on our sinks. They gave it to their children... My brother, my sister, themselves and myself. Of course they must think that there is no problem with fluoride or they would not do this!
My parents have always supported the use of fluoride in dentistry, because it is scientifically proven it helps lowering the amount of cavities.
Of course if there are big downsides to fluoride this doesn't matter anymore, it is not neccesary to prevent cavities.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a dental student, we get taught that fluoride is not a dangerous material in low doses. We are also aware of the toxicity in high concentrations (this is not disputed by anyone in the field).
      </p>
      <p>
       On the topic of long exposure the professional opinion is also that it is not unhealthy. This does not mean we must put it in tap water, if you dont want to be treated that is fine, we must accept that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not sure about the adverse effects of fluoride. I've always expected my teachers to know what they are saying. They have read studies. If you search inside the medical databases, you won't find large studies that prove the bad effects exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is however a chance that studies that find otherwise are not published for reasons I am not sure of (scared to start mass panic for something that is wrong, or even being silenced). I don't say this is the case though, but I could imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       So just recently my interest in the study spiked. I want to adress this in a medically supported way. Just watching video's like in the link isn't enough, I need to read the scientific studies directly. I am going to do this and hopefully find out the truth. (I hope that there is no problem with fluoride because that would be nasty, but I am objective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to wrap it up. Dentists are medically schooled, and the studies that are stating fluoride is toxic in the way it is stated here are not present in our literature. It does for certain help lower cavities, which is why dentists recommend it. If they would find out it has such dramatic negative effects they will stop using it, because no good dentist is willing to poison his patients. I will do my best to find something about it. Maybe you guys have something I can start with laying around as well, if you could link that it would be awesome.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also open for dialogue so don't hesitate to start a friendly discussion. I am not willing to discuss the part about dentist being aware of this though, given the personal and professional reasons I already stated. I consider this a waste of time regarding the subject and it also polutes the discussion about it. I know dentists and doctors are not part of the bad side here because I belong to these people, I trust these people and I know they would never harm anyone if they had the slightest idea there is something bad going on. Also a final question, how many of you believe this to be true, or consider it a possibility?

       Would you inject Neosporin intravenously? Would you drink Neosporin in a beverage?
OF COURSE NOT! Show me ONE study about the effect on bones, blood, skin, GI tract, etc.! FLUORIDE, like Neosporin, is a TOPICAL MEDICINE.

       It seems you have a slight advantage seeing how you are following in your family's footsteps in the field of Dentistry. What turned me on to the whole fluoridation subject is when I learned that there are ONLY 8 countries in the world that fluoridate their water supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       The type of fluoride used for teeth when it comes to oral care is much different then what is added to the municipal water supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've learned that most education has become mass indoctrination. Especially that of public school. We are mainly taught left brain activities such as Math &amp; other subjects but we are never taught about anything concerning the right brain. For example that of consciousness elevating, meditation &amp; evolving through our spiritual journey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoride has been shown to calcify the pineal gland. When consumed in large amounts helps to create a more docile individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course do your own research and form your own opinions. I hope that you will completely wake to the madness and strive to rise against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to bring the masses together to win the battle for our soul. Because that's what is at stake.
      </p>

       I probably sound pretty crazy lol. I'm going to be releasing a video pretty soon addressing many different topics. I'd love to be joined!

       fluoride helps against cavity,s this is true.
       <br/>
       There are down side,s to it as well.
       <br/>
       .
       <br/>
       Fluorides are present in the environment. Excessive systemic exposure to fluorides can lead to disturbances of bone homeostasis (skeletal fluorosis) and enamel development (dental/enamel fluorosis). The severity of dental fluorosis is also dependent upon fluoride dose and the timing and duration of fluoride exposure. Fluoride’s actions on bone cells predominate as anabolic effects both in vitro and in vivo. More recently, fluoride has been shown to induce osteoclastogenesis in mice. Fluorides appear to mediate their actions through the MAPK signaling pathway and can lead to changes in gene expression, cell stress, and cell death. Different strains of inbred mice demonstrate differential physiological responses to ingested fluoride. Genetic studies in mice are capable of identifying and characterizing fluoride-responsive genetic variations. Ultimately, this can lead to the identification of at-risk human populations who are susceptible to the unwanted or potentially adverse effects of fluoride action and to the elucidation of fundamental mechanisms by which fluoride affects biomineralization.

       It's too bad when your local lakes have naturally high fluoridation levels. I looked my area up and it says they stopped adding extra fluoride in the 60s. I shudder to think what level it was at when it was natural AND extra fluoride...
