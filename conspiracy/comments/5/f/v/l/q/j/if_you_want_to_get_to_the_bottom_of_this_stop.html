       I have bad news for you then, because this is all deepend. If you can't handle it leave it to us. Stop parroting information and do real research. Find source documents, find debunking proof. Something unverified is not necessarily fake and much of our staple material on Pizzagate was formerly unverified. Don't discount it.

       Literally nothing on pizzagate is verified, that's its entire problem. There's lots of extremely weird mainly surrounding podesta and alefantes.. But nothing close to damning.

       a few weeks ago. You can research the ridiculous claims yourself in the

       It was 2 guys that had the most popular thread on
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       for 2 days. They started cracking when being pressured by the community for real evidence, kept postponing proof, talked about sharing 2gb of encrypted files that they supposedly stole from inside some pizza shop they claimed was being used for child trafficking. Constantly changed their story and backtracked, avoiding answering any real questions. Then they said the cloned the pizza shops hard drives and were going to share the torrent of the encrypted hard drive. Over the course of two days they led the community on a wild goose chase, then apparently posted real CP. I'm not saying you have to believe it's fake, but everyone, including the the most prominent investigators/researchers came to the logical conclusion that they were either shills trying to get the subreddit shut down, or larpers just leading everyone on. Feel free to find the post here in the pizzagate archives and come to your own conclusions. But I watched it all unfold over two days, and personally believe it was fake as well.

       larpers, I buy, but trying to get the sub shutdown? How exactly? All I have been saying is don't simply dismiss somebody coming to you with unverified evidence. I didn't say it was real either. But an operator takes all 911 calls seriously

       Talking about pizzagate without listening to Ted Gunderson first? Amature hour... or else you'd realize 9/11 is part of the pizzagate conspiracy.

       The fake tag will remain until someone can provide ACTUAL evidence that the Podestas knew Sir Clement Freud, or that the Podestas were staying in his villa in Praia da Luz, or that they were (5000 kilometres from home) in Southern Portugal when Madeleine McCann was declared missing. Put your researching boots on and get to work.
