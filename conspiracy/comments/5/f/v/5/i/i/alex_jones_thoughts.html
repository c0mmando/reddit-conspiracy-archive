I used to follow him religiously like an idiot because he introduced me to the rabbit hole called conspiracies. He really opened my eyes with the whole exposing Bohemian Grove, but I feel like he has to be on payroll, whether for the government, CIA, etc. Anyone have any theories? Besides him actually being Bill Hicks...lol</p>

<p>On the eve of his twentieth anniversary as school principal, Seymour Skinner is lured by his mother to Springfield Elementary School for a surprise party. The celebration goes well until a strange man arrives, claiming to be the real Seymour Skinner. Principal Skinner admits that he is an impostor, and that his real name is Armin Tamzarian. Armin then tells the story of the events that led him to steal Seymour Skinner&#39;s identity.</p>

<p>Best case scenario - New FBI had evidence JA was gonna be offed and extracted him for his own safety in return for him not dropping the most disgusting evidence he had against the world governments. &quot;Let us handle this... they are all going down... we just don&#39;t want the general public to lose their lunch when they see Phase 3.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kinda... if they use these kinds of acts to maintain control over people via blackmailing... then the higher up the chain you go... the more blackmail material they&#39;d have to manage.

    <div class="md"><p>Jones and Hicks were not the same person. They were seen numerous times together at the same events, since they were friends. If there was no Alex Jones the NWO would already have been totally completed. You would very likely now be in a reeducation camp. Do you need to agree with everything he says? No, you do not.  But no person does more to expose the Elite Globalists than Alex Jones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, don&#39;t get me wrong. His program is terrific entertainment! I give him credit for taking conspiracy to the mainstream, but then that&#39;s kind of the issue. He&#39;s...well...mainstream.</p>

<p>Edit: If he were a genuine &quot;good guy,&quot; there&#39;s no freaking way he wouldn&#39;t be locked up or dead. Worse things have happened to people with way less influence than he has.</p>

<p>Also, I realize that Alex Jones is NOT Bill Hicks. That was a joke. I believe Bill Hicks was the real deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s gathering as much followers as he can. The media is promoting him on CNN, MSNBC, and others. His followers will think he&#39;s the true alternative media dude since the corrupt media is targeting him. This is a major psyop to radicalize Americans through controlled opposition media. Trump actually appeared on Alex Jones&#39;s show to give him more credibility.</p>

<p>He says all the right things, he gathers all the people, and then he steers them into a honey trap. Just pay attention to his talking points and what he&#39;s promoting. <a href="https://youtu.be/g-I0iPDM7PM?t=14m45s">He&#39;s promoting civil war rhetoric/talking points.</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not too familiar with the Zionist aspect of it but it is odd he goes hard on most things including bankers and the federal reserve but just comes shy of exposing (((who))) they are.</p>
