       So what's the deal with Mr. Jones. I used to follow him religiously like an idiot because he introduced me to the rabbit hole called conspiracies. He really opened my eyes with the whole exposing Bohemian Grove, but I feel like he has to be on payroll, whether for the government, CIA, etc. Anyone have any theories? Besides him actually being Bill Hicks...lol

       Most likely. I feel like some Anonymous material is also controlled opposition. I know there are some legitimate Anon shit out there, but I feel like the movement is being used in suspicious ways...

       If the newest Wikileaks are legit they pretty much outright say a guy invented doxxing software so powerful he figured out the IRL names and locations of 80% of Anonymous back in 2011 and then went into a meeting with the FBI right after.

       Yeah, they talk about that in the documentary about Anonymous.
Most of the guys who were really hacking have long since been arrested. The FBI got one of the founders to flip.

       I've never really paid much attention to Anonymous... they weren't really a cohesive unit that I could get behind... kinda all over the place... Glad what you saw kinda matches up with my take on the wikileaks. I'm still holding out hope that there might be some good guys in government intelligence masquerading behind Anonymous to do some real cleanup work on the corruption.

       I'm hoping that they are cracking thru Tor for all the right reasons... I'm really hoping Comey knows more than I do about what most of encryption is used for... and that he has the people's best interests at heart when he speaks out against it... cause everything he says leads me to belive he is a straight shooter and on the side of justice for America.

       you're joking right? Have you not seen the news? On Dec 1st. anyone obfuscating their IP is considered a threat...and will be further investigated by FBI. Checkout "rule 41" -- that means using Tor to visit reddit (like I do) or using a VPN you will now be put on a short list for further investigation.

       I think they overmedicated them and didn't get the desired effect of all these "riots"... just ended up being a bunch of mindless zombies staring at their phones and walking up the street in the most disconnected and unconcerned manner possible.

       On the eve of his twentieth anniversary as school principal, Seymour Skinner is lured by his mother to Springfield Elementary School for a surprise party. The celebration goes well until a strange man arrives, claiming to be the real Seymour Skinner. Principal Skinner admits that he is an impostor, and that his real name is Armin Tamzarian. Armin then tells the story of the events that led him to steal Seymour Skinner's identity.

       Kinda... if they use these kinds of acts to maintain control over people via blackmailing... then the higher up the chain you go... the more blackmail material they'd have to manage. I think maybe Huma was in charge of managing those files... and Weiner decided he'd use them for his own jollies.

       I stopped listening to him because his annoying commercials and when he first heard about Bitcoin he started talking about how it was created by the illuminati to enslave us....which really was the opposite motivation behind it...was meant to free us from the banks. but he was too stupid to even research it.

       Jones and Hicks were not the same person. They were seen numerous times together at the same events, since they were friends. If there was no Alex Jones the NWO would already have been totally completed. You would very likely now be in a reeducation camp. Do you need to agree with everything he says? No, you do not.  But no person does more to expose the Elite Globalists than Alex Jones.

       Oh, don't get me wrong. His program is terrific entertainment! I give him credit for taking conspiracy to the mainstream, but then that's kind of the issue. He's...well...mainstream.

       Edit: If he were a genuine "good guy," there's no freaking way he wouldn't be locked up or dead. Worse things have happened to people with way less influence than he has.

       Also, I realize that Alex Jones is NOT Bill Hicks. That was a joke. I believe Bill Hicks was the real deal.

       He's gathering as much followers as he can. The media is promoting him on CNN, MSNBC, and others. His followers will think he's the true alternative media dude since the corrupt media is targeting him. This is a major psyop to radicalize Americans through controlled opposition media. Trump actually appeared on Alex Jones's show to give him more credibility.

       He says all the right things, he gathers all the people, and then he steers them into a honey trap. Just pay attention to his talking points and what he's promoting.

        He's promoting civil war rhetoric/talking points.

       I feel like he's a little looney who throws anything at the wall hoping it sticks. He knows his personality attracts viewers and his message is something many "conspiracy theorists" can get behind. So his viewers excuse the wackiness.

       I'm not too familiar with the Zionist aspect of it but it is odd he goes hard on most things including bankers and the federal reserve but just comes shy of exposing (((who))) they are.

       I stopped listening to him because his annoying commercials and when he first heard about Bitcoin he started talking about how it was created by the illuminati to enslave us....which really was the opposite motivation behind it...was meant to free us from the banks. but he was too stupid to even research it.

       Yup... part of a detailed decades long disinformation campaign to conceal the fact that Principal Skinner isn't really Principal Skinner... his identity was co-opted by an ex military psyop agent.
