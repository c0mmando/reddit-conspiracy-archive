       I give this persuasive speech Friday. The first point I have is that jet fuel doesn't burn hot enough to melt steel. I need a couple more points to include, but not sure what is considered the most damning. Thanks.

       Wrong name for presentation.    Yes, it was an inside job,  but no,  Bush didn't do it.    The planning was started during the Clinton admin and even before that.    Bush Jr.  was a drunk and was included as a spokesman partly because of how little he knew,  how he made the government look incompetent and not effective enough to have carried out the planning and execution of the event including media complicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most damning evidence in my view was the air defense stand down and the evidence that the 19 so called hijackers were patsies.    Its also interesting that no other steel framed buildings have collapsed like those three buildings did unless intentionally demolished with large amounts of strategically placed explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would recommend credible experts be quoted like Kevin Ryan,   David Griffin,   Jon Cole,  David Chandler and others,   and avoid sketchy nuts that want to put out points they cannot prove.    The main thing is that why was there a cover up instead of a real  investigation?    Only because there were insiders to protect.

       To lessen which blow?    The psychological blow to anyone who is listening to the presentation and didn't yet realize that the official version was not true?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not easy to think that a presentation is going to convince anyone of anything.    People have very complex reasons to have taken a side already and usually are not listening if they believe the official version,   they are reminding themselves of their loyalty to the reference group they belong to.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example,  if you like Amy Goodman and Democracy Now,  or you like Noam Chomsky,  or lord forbid,  your local newspapers,  someone who is saying something different is not going to get a hearing.    They will just look at you like a cow,  imagining that you are crazy.    They are going to remember 9/11 as if it was obvious from the start that everything had unfolded just the way they were told.    Its the Good German phenomenon on steroids.   A deep brainwashing job.      Its going to take something else to crack their reality open than a talk on 9/11.    Like when the system exposes itself in a way that destroys their own life,  where they realize its been rigged against all of us,  in almost every way.

       Donald Rumsfeld announcing 2.3 trillion missing right before 9/11 seems like a great starting point. Also the accounting offices that dealt with that were destroyed in the pentagon attack. Coincidence? Yea fucking right.

       Go for the science. Most of the circumstantial evidence is valid but I've found very difficult in persuasion. Physics does not lie. Two planes CANNOT bring down 3 steel structures. Impossible. End of story. And these other people are correct, Bush Jr. did not do it, tho daddy was a big part. For the full conspiracy explanation:

       Research Richard Gage and Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth. Gage points out that if the NIST report was right they would have to rewrite the building code for skyscrapers - which they didn't. Lots of good material on the website.

       Here are ways to cover up Dr. Wood's research:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) Create and promote unscientific alternate forms of destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Promote her research and then find fault with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) Make personal attacks against her character.
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) Marginalize her research and call it "voodoo science".
      </p>
      <p>
       5.) Promote her research but misquote her and run it into the ditch.
      </p>
      <p>
       6.) Ignore her research and evidence then call it a "theory".
      </p>
      <p>
       7.) Say that you have read her book and find fault with it when you never did read her book.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.) Create other faux groups like the "Sandy Hook Hoaxers" to keep people from asking the right questions and looking at the evidence Dr. Wood presents. This also creates distrust in our government and people that ask questions. If our government was responsible for 9/11, our government is the only way to reverse the damage it has caused. This is why Dr. Wood filed her Federal Qui-Tam lawsuit. Too bad the Truthers didn't support it. The phrase, “use it or or lose it” comes to mind. If the system is broken, then fix it. Otherwise, you are condoning the broken state that it's in. (The “we are change” characters, the “loose change” characters, and Richard Gage &amp; Co. going to the AIA office with ambush video interview attempts are good examples.)  Ambush journalism does not solve problems; it covers them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the “thousands of engineers” that Mr. Gage brags about had stood behind Dr. Wood's Federal Qui-Tam lawsuit, it would have been a lot harder for them to dismiss it... especially if they stood in and outside of the courtroom during the 8-minute “hearing” by the Court of Appeals.  After all, the written decision from that hearing did not refute Dr. Wood's collection of evidence and her conclusions from that evidence. The court actually acknowledge the law applied to Dr. Wood's case but admitted they were ignoring the law to dismiss the case!  Why were the Truthers satisfied with that outcome? Anarchy is not the answer and fixes nothing.

       Popular theories about what destroyed the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001 are:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 Fires from jet fuel and office materials weakened steel in the upper floors and the buildings collapsed
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Conventional controlled demolition blew out supports at the base and the buildings collapsed
      </p>
      <p>
       3 Thermite cut steel columns on virtually every floor and the buildings collapsed
      </p>
      <p>
       4 Conventional explosives blew the buildings up
      </p>
      <p>
       5 Mini-nukes blew the buildings up
      </p>
      <p>
       Theories 1, 2 and 3 rely on gravity to bring the buildings down while the last two blow them up. Popular theories, yes, and dead wrong. Five facts scientifically documented in Ph.D. engineer Judy Wood’s comprehensive textbook (Where Did The Towers Go?) prove the popular theories false beyond any doubt whatsoever. Yes, I know it’s amazing. Who’d a thunk it’d be this easy?
      </p>
      <p>
       THE FACTS:
      </p>
      <pre><code>DEBRIS: What debris? There was so little debris from each 110-story building that there was no “pile” or “stack.” Rubble totaled less than a story. It was a football field as a survivor who emerged from Stairwell B, North Tower, exclaimed. No computers, toilets, and only one small piece from one Steelcase file cabinet were found. Some steel and mostly dust remained. Lack of debris on the ground from quarter-mile-high twin towers whispers “no collapse.” See Chapter 9.

BATHTUB: A bathtub or slurry wall surrounded 70 feet of WTC subbasements to prevent the Hudson River from flooding the WTC and downtown. If each 500,000-ton tower had slammed into the bathtub in 10 seconds or less, the protective wall would collapse. Did not happen. Upshot? Collapses did not happen. See Chapter 5.

SEISMIC IMPACT: “Had the towers collapsed, foundation bedrock would have experienced tremendous force hammering on it throughout the ‘collapse,’” writes Dr. Wood. Seismic instruments registered disturbances far too short in duration and far too small to record tower collapses. This was true of both the twin towers and 47-story WTC7. Again, no evidence of collapses. See Chapter 6.

SOUND: There were no loud explosions, as established by videos, witnesses, and the official report of NIST. Nor were there loud screeches and screams from massive metal falling, colliding, scraping and collapsing on metal. See Chapter 6.

DUST: Photos, videos and witness testimony show the towers turned to powder in mid-air. Tim McGinn, NYPD, said, “I was standing there for a couple of seconds thinking where the f**k is the tower? I simply couldn’t comprehend it.” The dust rollout was so enormous and thick it blocked out sunlight and left an inch or more of dust covering downtown. Much of it wafted into the upper atmosphere. The volume was incredible. Particles from dust samples were smaller than red blood cells and about the size of DNA. As for toxicity, researchers said the dust “recorded the highest levels we have ever seen in over 7,000 measurements we have made of very fine air pollution throughout the world, including Kuwait and China.” See Chapters 8, 9, 14-16.

       Judy Wood is not to be overlooked. One of the best explanations I've heard is that so many things were done that it's impossible to sort out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main thing to stress is that, whatever happened, what NIST says DID happen did not.

       I disagree about the explosions. The first responder testimony AND the recordings were not planted.

       I agree about her being maligned and don't understand that.

       I still don't think any single group has it 100% right.

       Here's a quote from a refutation of Wood that underlines the bottom line import of reopening the investigation:
      </p>
      <p>
       "While Wood and AE911truth agree that the official story of an “inevitable” collapse by gravity alone is impossible because it conflicts with laws of physics, we completely differ on the mechanism of the destruction. Crucially, once there is proof and consensus that the official story violates elementary laws of physics, our major scientific task has been accomplished. The remaining task is the political challenge of mobilizing support for a legitimate investigation."

       Did you even bother to read the report I posted written on her work? She has NOT done a complete forensics investigation. Her theory explains some findings but not others, and the report is clear that she's left off significant findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists agree to move forward on "scientific consensus" and they argue until it's reached. One of the hallmarks of the 9-11 event is the gross lack of scientific consensus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Picking one scientist's view over multiple others without reopening the investigation makes no sense.  You just want this poor bloke to get a bad grade on his presentation, you spoiler, you.

       Stick to the facts. Stay away from speculation. The towers falling at free fall speeds, how it was built to withstand a 747 hitting it, how the steal beams are twice as think as tank armor, how the hole in the pentagon looks nothing like a plane, how there was still hot molten steel at ground zero for weeks after, Cheney's 'plan' for president, BBC reporting the towers falling before they did, the slow-mo video of the dust blowing out the sides of the building,
