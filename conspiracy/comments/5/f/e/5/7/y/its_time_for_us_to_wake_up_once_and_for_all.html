<p>These extremely wealthy and international Babylonian/Zionist cults go wayyyy deeper - and have been practicing this for THOUSANDS of years.
We need to collectively wake up, do our research, and realize that we live in a vastly strange and interdimensional universe - and that our pathetically limited realm of visible light only allows us to physically experience to the smallest tip of the iceberg.
Buckle up. Humanity is about to head off the deep end. Demons are real. Aliens are real.
Interdimensional reptilian humanoids are posessing these sick freaks and kidnapping children worldwide to sacrifice them to suck up their life force.
Sound crazy? We live in crazy times.
If you swallow the red pill and do your research, I promise you&#39;ll thank me later.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s pretty clear by now that the human species is being interfered with by....something. We are not in harmony with the laws of the Universe (the law of One) here on earth at all. Who are they? Inter-dimensional beings? Demons? That I don&#39;t know, but we need to start battling them on a different playing field. The solution is most certainly <strong>metaphysical</strong>.</p>

<p>I am exhausting all research on the science of &quot;white magik&quot; and our ancient history for the spiritual battle ahead/now. Once I get through the mounds of material I&#39;m reading, I will post a summary here and have some solutions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going down without a fight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now I&#39;m delving into a lot of writings by Charles W Leadbeater. He&#39;s supposedly &quot;the guy&quot; on the occult - writings are from the 1920&#39;s I believe. I&#39;m currently reading &quot;Thought-Forms&quot; and &quot;The Science of the Sacrament.&quot; (I&#39;m ruling nothing out.) Tons of his books are FREE on amazon kindle app. He has written books on Atlantis and ancient history, too.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m reading &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, &quot;Secret Places of the Lion&quot; and a bunch of other Buddhist teachings. </p>

<p>I hope to have a holistic view of what&#39;s going on when I&#39;m done. This is going to take me months....<em>sigh</em>. If you wanna help out, that would be great. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can do a tremendous amount of work on the subtle planes. You&#39;ve found some of the best recipe books, so good on you. For a more contemporary approach check out the Ra Material (original Law of One) work and anything on YouTube from Abraham Hicks. Both of those have a lot of instruction about getting your personal craft aligned and functioning, and without that work done first - the spiritual purification equivalent required to wield the powers discussed - all the &quot;spells&quot; in the books you&#39;re reading are much less useful, and may even backfire as events try to correct your path. ( ie karma)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the tips. I haven&#39;t started &quot;practicing&quot; any of this yet, because I know I need to hone my craft first and I&#39;m not nearly ready yet.

    <div class="md"><p>Nice, so glad to see Charles Leadbeaters name here. His writings are amazing. Thought forms is an amazing book. His one about man and auras is pretty cool too. He eventually lead (:)) me too Helena Blavatsky. Her book the Secret Doctrine is the greatest occult textbook but way to difficult for me to read right now. That then brought me to Rudolf Steiner who I believe is the man who had it all figured out. Check out his lecture on Lucifer and Ahriman. Amazing!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting to me that like I,you have come to the conclusion that to combat the perceived interference in humanity we should be looking for solutions in &quot;white magic&quot; and occultist knowledge.</p>

<p>This seems to be part of the course for many &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and alt thinkers.</p>

<p>I think a conversation could be had on why is this?</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t we look for answers within the traditional abrahamic religions?</p>

<p>Do we discredit these all together?</p>

<p>Jewish mysticism and khabalism seem to have something to it and i bet there&#39;s alls sorts of knowledge stashed away in the Vatican library.The jinn from Islamic culture seemmto discribe this hidden hand in detail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, we must fight using etheric weaponry. But I must warn you, if you try to fight them, you will be faced with a reality that few people can even imagine is possible. There are battles you simply can&#39;t win. It doesn&#39;t mean they are invincible though. But fighting these beings in the etheric Immediately &quot;flags&quot; you on levels you can&#39;t even perceive, and you will be tracked constantly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you fail to realize is that as soon as Hillary LOST the election, that was the end of the cabal&#39;s control.  The paradigm changed the night Trump was elected.  Everything is playing out exactly the way it should now.  We have NOTHING to worry about.</p>

<p>Go and watch the video where trump meets with Obama and praises the &quot;great things that have been achieved&quot; during Obamas term. Then ask yourself if that fits the narrative trump has portrayed when criticizing Obama constantly. What great things were achieved? The dead giveaway is the double 666 he flashes when he says that. It&#39;s subliminal code speak for &quot;the great things achieved for the NWO&quot;. In other words all has gone according to THEIR plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand my statement.  Trump doesn&#39;t even matter.  The main point is that Hillary losing was the end off he cabal&#39;s control.  Pizzagate is going bring down the entire world government.  It&#39;s much bigger than what you physically can see.  All you need to do is remain calm in the chaos and get your karma right.  Stay positive.  Everything is playing out as it should.</p>

<p>Or of course, you can spend time worrying, which will only stress you and give them exactly what they want, which is your attention to their negativity.  There are literally millions of members of the Family of Light making sure things go according to plan and things are on schedule.  Love yourself and others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary losing is not the end of their control. If they wanted her in office they would have rigged the election the same way Bush got into office. Clearly their plan was to elect Trump.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is also part of their agenda. What you fail to realize is that this has all been preordained many many years ago. </p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that Trump entering presidency and pizzagate were orchestrated from the very beginning. They are even forecast by the &#39;Illuminati card game&#39;: <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AG-_8Mvkcnc/maxresdefault.jpg">Trump</a> <a href="http://i1.wp.com/celebrityriver.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/1480570992_hqdefault.jpg?resize=480%2C360">Pizza</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a stacked deck. You can&#39;t win their game (unless you stop being so passive and retrieve your power). Action is the only way, not passivity as you profess. Staying positive has nothing to do with anything. Even if it did, you do not have the personal power to effect change with your thoughts. You need to take action and develop yourself to have an effect of that caliber using thoughts alone. It takes many years of hard work to attain this, and preaching about positive thinking on the interwebz will not get you there.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;Family of Light&quot; but most likely it is a reference to new agers and SJWs/liberals/hippies. Which is ironic because according to them it&#39;s Hillary that represented the change they wanted for a better world. So really, it is you yourself who do not understand your own statements. If you truly want to &quot;love yourself and others&quot;, then take <em>action</em>, and learn to <em>fight</em>.</p>

<p>The multiverse theory certainly supports the idea that there are infinite universes each one a branch of another. The idea then that &quot;spirits&quot; maybe able to pass through these in ways the physical body can&#39;t seems plausible. Ever wonder why dreams seem so familiar yet somehow different?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. Since we are in a multiverse, demons, ghouls, poltergeists, could be beings from alternate universes spilling into our own reality. This is more plausible to me than the concept of a sentient consciousness existing without a brain or physical body of some kind.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s surreal and encouraging to see people embracing these ideas. The Pizzagate scandal has dredged up a lot of things that I had put aside, because it&#39;s quite difficult to delve into these horrifying topics and also take the incessant ridicule from the debunkers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted a bit about my experiences (which are suspected to have been covered up by the FBI) and made a blog for documenting my memories. I have been accused of being a &quot;good writer&quot; with the insinuation that this may be fiction. I attest that none of this is fabricated, and that I only wrote of the experiences that are burned into me.</p>

<p>I have read about mind control, but the recent events have caused me to look back into it. Much about my encounters smacks of MK ULTRA, and it makes me wonder if that wasn&#39;t a part of it. </p>

<p>If you have time, <a href="https://bugmonsters.wordpress.com">read my story</a> and share your thoughts.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve since learned to protect myself from most of the unwelcome visitors and had posted a thread in Pizzagate about how to shield one&#39;s self from demonic attacks. In short, you must visualize a reflective bubble around yourself and meditate/radiate genuine love out into the Universe. It has a healing effect and repels the evil.</p>

<p>Best hopes and love to all of us in this battle!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is definitely an &#39;evil&#39; force that is acting on humanity, I think we can all see and feel that. We&#39;re being consumed as much as we ourselves are consuming every last droplet of life and resources left on this rapidly deteriorating planet.</p>

<p>In the midst of all these hectic, anxiety-inducing times, I had a an epiphany. There is always a balance in this universe. If there are &#39;evil&#39; aliens that are taking advantage of primitive humans, there probably also exists &#39;good&#39; interdimensional beings that are witnessing what is happening and wants to help. And when I was thinking of this, I just had this very strong gut feeling that I was being...observed? Connected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your sentiment about humans living in an illusion and that we are here to develop our consciousness. 
But what about those who control the power structure?</p>

<p>What is the true purpose of those in power? Are they playing the game like us? Are they actually &quot;helping&quot; us further our evolutionary standards by uniting us when times are bleak (kinda like right now with racism, class war, etc.)? Are they truly &quot;right&quot; when they do these nefarious acts of terror? To me it seems that reality is just a matter of perspective, but how far do you draw the line when something is downright wrong or inhumane? Does karma come to play? How does it all come back and bite them in the ass?</p>

<p>I dont know, I guess my rambling got the better of me. If you could post a couple of articles regarding the subject, I would greatly appreciacte it as im trying to understand my place in the universe as a student in the game.</p>

<p>No deity is postulated as the theory.

<p>The very definition of metaphysical means concerned with <strong>abstract</strong> thought or subjects, as existence, causality, or truth.</p>

<p>Or if you wanna go archaic, it means imaginary or fanciful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is actually a group within the government called &quot;The Collins Elite&quot; that believes this theory. (Read Nick Redfern&#39;s book on it, entitled &quot;Final Events&quot;.) According to  this unit inside the CIA, humans are <em>not</em> the dominant species on the planet. We&#39;re being farmed, harvested. Evidently, we produce a particular type of energy that interdimensional entities use like a drug. To foster the production, they manipulate us into certain behaviors that are conducive to its generation: violence, negativity, perverted sexuality, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not making this up: VERY powerful people actually believe this. Read the book; you can see some of the documents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a quick thought.</p>

<p>If these entities exist and feed of negative human energy this is why shit like pizzagate happens.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying everyone involved is doing so to summon evil entities ,most people are probably unaware,most of them are just good old fashioned Pedo scum.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at is that at the very highest legal of our society,the top of the pryimid,these people know what&#39;s going on and they allow it to happen,cause it to happen to serve the religious rituals.</p>

<p>If massive Pedo rings exist then it becomes easier to get children for sacrificial purposes.</p>

<p>This extends to other aspects of society.Illumanti type entertainment figures encourage promiscuity and broken homes ,forigen policy fosters war all by design to feed these entities.</p>

<p>Another thought.</p>

<p>If these entities exist and feed of negative energies then it stands to reason that other entities exist and can feed of positive energies.</p>

<p>These are the ones we should be summoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Is Tested in the Wilderness</p>

<p>&quot;Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 2 where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry.</p>

<p>3 The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.”</p>

<p>4 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.”</p>

<p>5 The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. 6 And he said to him, “I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. 7 If you worship me, it will all be yours.”</p>

<p>8 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.’”</p>

<p>9 The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down from here. 10 For it is written:</p>

<p>“‘He will command his angels concerning you
    to guard you carefully;
11 they will lift you up in their hands,
    so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.”
12 Jesus answered, “It is said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”</p>

<p>13 When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.</p>

<p>Jesus Rejected at Nazareth</p>

<p>14 Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. 15 He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.</p>

<p>16 He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, 17 and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:</p>

<p>18 “The Spirit of the Lord is on me,
    because he has anointed me
    to proclaim good news to the poor.
He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners
    and recovery of sight for the blind,
to set the oppressed free,
19     to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”</p>

<p>20 Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. 21 He began by saying to them, “Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”</p>

<p>22 All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” they asked.</p>

<p>23 Jesus said to them, “Surely you will quote this proverb to me: ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ And you will tell me, ‘Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.’”</p>

<p>24 “Truly I tell you,” he continued, “no prophet is accepted in his hometown. 25 I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land. 26 Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon. 27 And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian.”</p>

<p>28 All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. 29 They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. 30 But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.</p>

<p>Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit</p>

<p>31 Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people. 32 They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority.</p>

<p>33 In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, 34 “Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”</p>

<p>35 “Be quiet!” Jesus said sternly. “Come out of him!” Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.</p>

<p>36 All the people were amazed and said to each other, “What words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!” 37 And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.</p>

<p>Jesus Heals Many</p>

<p>38 Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. 39 So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.</p>

<p>40 At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them. 41 Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah.</p>

<p>42 At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them. 43 But he said, “I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.” 44 And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.</p>

<p>Luke 4</p>

<p>Notice how Jesus uses Scirpture to deny the devil.</p>

<p>Remember:</p>

<p>&quot;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.&quot;</p>

<p>Ephesians 6</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a guy named Corey Goode that allegedly worked for a &quot;secret space program&quot; and the stuff he talks about is all interrelated to this topic. I recommend checking out some of his interviews.</p>

<p>Also as an aside:</p>

<p>Mockery has likely been programmed deliberately into our culture to react to anyone that brings up these topics because A. an educated peasant is a dangerous peasant, and B. even if people weren&#39;t already predisposed to mocking these concepts, they might do so anyway to avoid the fear/ensuing existential crisis they typically provoke.</p>

<p>Just bear that in mind while moving forward. You will likely encounter considerable resistance to these ideas from both the people around you, as well as from your own programmed-subconscious.</p>

<p>It seems the page was deleted sometime in February of this year, as every other way back entry is &quot;page not found&quot;.</p>

<p>I have reached out to the website and asked why this page was removed and if there is somewhere on the site i can currently find it, I will update when/if i receive a reply.</p>

<p>edit: i realized i got ahead of myself and didnt even search their website to see if there was an updated article and all i found was this: <a href="https://www.davidicke.com/article/168584/headlines/57499-david-icke-they-dare-not-speak-its-name--rothschild-zionism-">https://www.davidicke.com/article/168584/headlines/57499-david-icke-they-dare-not-speak-its-name--rothschild-zionism-</a></p>

<p>this page, for me at least, on several different connections, failed to load at all, not even a 404 page.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, finally a post with some sense.</p>

<p>It&#39;s crazier than anyone can imagine. I have been a target of these beings since before I was even born. They are not reptilians, or greys, or demons though they can take these forms to scare people and mislead them. They are completely invisible even with astral sight. They are pure evil, and very powerful on an energetic level- but not powerful enough to &quot;remote kill&quot; or etherically murder. This doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t seriously harm you energetically and ruin your life in incomprehendible ways. I&#39;m talking past life and timeline manipulation, possessing people around you to attack you, creating accidents and financial crisis, sabotaging dreams and opportunities, and most especially undermining your spiritual awareness and power.</p>

<p>Not just earth but what we call &quot;the universe&quot; is run by this interdimensional crime syndicate. They enslave the human race even after death, with soul recycling a.k.a. Reincarnation. What they want you to believe of as &quot;heaven&quot; after death is nothing more than a deception to trick souls into recycling back on earth. </p>

<p>Knowledge is what we can use to fight them. Awareness. But more importantly, retrieving our power as a species and destroying them in the realm which they exist.</p>

<p>We ARE powerful beings, we just need to remember it.</p>

In light of all these lies you now know to be lies. The Bible has everything in it you need to know,  from the spirits of the air influencing decisions,  the spiritual battlefield, the afterlife,  and how to obtain salvation from the consequence of the evils of sin. The biggest conspiracy of all time is the existence of God. Well I&#39;m here to tell you now that He is for 100% fact the God who created this universe and holds it in His hands. If God is real,  that means the Bible is true and Hell is real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting to me that like I,you have come to the conclusion that to combat the perceived interference in humanity we should be looking for solutions in &quot;white magic&quot; and occultist knowledge.</p>

<p>This seems to be part of the course for many &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and alt thinkers.</p>

<p>I think a conversation could be had on why is this?</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t we look for answers within the traditional abrahamic religions?</p>

<p>Do we discredit these all together?</p>

<p>Jewish mysticism and khabalism seem to have something to it and i bet there&#39;s alls sorts of knowledge stashed away in the Vatican library.The jinn from Islamic culture seemmto discribe this hidden hand in detail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, we must fight using etheric weaponry. But I must warn you, if you try to fight them, you will be faced with a reality that few people can even imagine is possible. There are battles you simply can&#39;t win. It doesn&#39;t mean they are invincible though. But fighting these beings in the etheric Immediately &quot;flags&quot; you on levels you can&#39;t even perceive, and you will be tracked constantly. </p>

<p>Then shit becomes very real and you understand why the collective human consciousness would rather watch television than face their oppressors.</p>
