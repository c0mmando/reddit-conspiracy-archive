<p>Podesta has no tweets since November 7th, 2016...</p>

<p>We can see they are doing their usual tactics of misinformation (blaming Russia)... and of course censoring the best they can... but the leak continues to grow and tie in more and more people.</p>

<p>I wonder what his (and everyone else involved) next move will be?</p>

<p>His next move, like much of the Democratic Party, is to labor behind-the-scene rebranding and raising money for 2020. There will be fights for party control. Money to be raised. At minimum a Congressional investigation to deal with, possibly (if deserved then hopefully) worse. </p>

<p>If the horrifying allegations about him, or those close to him, are true - and they&#39;re not until proven true - then what happens going forward is hard to predict:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If adversarial foreign powers are in possession of proof of misconduct the incoming administration has three options: (1) Disclose and prosecute; (2) Do not disclose and cut a deal with the foreign power(s) to prevent disclosure and coercion; (3) Use similar leverage against the foreign power to prevent disclosure. </p></li>
<li><p>If adversarial foreign powers are <em>not</em> in possession of proof of misconduct the incoming administration has three options: (1) Disclose and prosecute; (2) Do not disclose and co-opt the perpetrators to their benefit, sparing the Country much trauma; (3) Do not disclose because the perpetrators have similar mud to sling.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless, I would expect major changes to the primary election system - particularly in the Republican Party, who may adopt a super delegate system similar to the Democrats. It may be a 3rd party emerges around Trump. It may also be the Democratic Party fractures in two. Democrats time spent criticizing Trump and mourning HRC is wasted given the massive amount of work they must do in reconnecting with the millions of dislocated Americans who rose up this election. I don&#39;t see Podesta playing a role in that process. He&#39;s not very good at politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is this comment always made?. In the UK, where I am, I can&#39;t think of where this ever happens.  In fact, by arresting (not charging them necessarily) someone and announcing it, it often allows further victims or witnesses to come forward.  Why wouldn&#39;t any law enforcement agency not want more witnesses or evidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is some serious shit going down... they don&#39;t need anyone to come forward... The FBI has had the foundations NWO playbook since prolly about Benghazi. The more they keep the evil in the dark about what is happening the safer everyone is. If they announced on election night that Podesta and HRC were under arrest... the whole country would be filled with overseas flights and buildings exploding to cover up evidence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The FBI is aware of media reporting on cyber intrusions involving multiple political entities, and is working to determine the accuracy, nature and scope of these matters,&quot; an FBI spokesperson said. &quot;The cyber threat environment continues to evolve as cyber actors target all sectors and their data. The FBI takes seriously any allegations of intrusions, and we will continue to hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace.&quot;</p>

<p>The FBI statement came after Podesta told reporters that he talked with the FBI Sunday, which told him an investigation is underway. Messages hacked from Podesta&#39;s Gmail account began appearing on the WikiLeaks website Friday, with more emails dumped out this week.</p>

<p>&quot;I was in touch with the FBI on Sunday. They confirmed that they are investigating the criminal hack of my email, and we are of course, fully cooperating in that investigation,&quot; Podesta told reporters on Clinton&#39;s campaign plane Tuesday night. &quot;We also learned today from law enforcement authorities that that investigation is part of the ongoing investigation of hacking into democratic organizations by Russian intelligence.&quot;</p>
