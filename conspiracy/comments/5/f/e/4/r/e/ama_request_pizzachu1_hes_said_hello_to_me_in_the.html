<p>Do you recognize the pedo-symbols from the FBI files? </p>

<p>What about the pizza/pasta/cheese/etc code? Any insight?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never seen any of that stuff outside of the FBI files.  Like I said I don&#39;t go to websites for criminals, the pedophiles I&#39;ve interacted with are usually either weeaboos or depressed.  </p>

<p>Cheese Pizza is a really old joke way of referring to child pornography.  In the old days of /b/ people would abbreviate child porn as CP, which of course are also the initials for Cheese Pizza.  I&#39;m sure a lot of the people posting child porn on /b/ weren&#39;t even actually pedophiles, they just liked posting it because it was the only thing not allowed and it makes some people really freak out.  It&#39;s probably older than 4chan, but /b/ is the first place I heard it. </p>

<p>I sort of doubt that a cabal of child molesting elite politicians would use the same terminology as a bunch of weirdos on 4chan, but who knows.  </p>

I think most probably don&#39;t even look at illegal pictures, they just look at drawings and those Asian non-nude models.  I don&#39;t know of any code words, but I don&#39;t go anywhere that&#39;s underground.  Outside of Reddit, I just interact with weeaboos who like to talk about how much they love lolis.</p>

<p>I imagine most of the pedophiles who actually fuck kids talk to each other on the darkweb on forums with child porn, so it&#39;d actually be illegal to look at them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came up with this username when I was 10-years-old (on another website).  I didn&#39;t even know what porn was back then, I just needed a username so I came up with a Pokemon pun.  Maybe I&#39;m a victim of tachyonic meme magic, I don&#39;t know.  </p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve heard chemical castration doesn&#39;t even get rid of your feelings or attractions, it just makes it impossible to get an erection.  But even if it did remove all sexual desires and didn&#39;t have any side effects, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to do it.  I can still enjoy my feelings without doing anything illegal.  I don&#39;t really want to remove my ability to enjoy some of my favorite thoughts.  </p>

<p>And don&#39;t worry I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to offend me.  </p>

Now I spend a bunch of time on internet forums for pedophiles because it&#39;s something I think about a lot and you&#39;re not really allowed to talk about it anywhere else.  </p>

<p>Not that the kid is really old enough to understand what&#39;s happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s wrong to rape anyone.  I think it&#39;s silly to say that children can&#39;t give consent, obviously you can ask them if they want something and they can say yes or no.  I don&#39;t think children are necessarily traumatized by sex either.  There was a kid in my middle school who got a girl pregnant when he was like 13, and he never really seemed traumatized.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really approve of kids having sex, but I think people like to say things like &quot;kids cannot give consent&quot; and &quot;sex is traumatic to kids&quot; just so it&#39;s easier for them to hate people they think are gross.  </p>

<p>I think I like girls the best around 7-9, when they&#39;ve lost their baby fat but haven&#39;t quite started puberty yet.  I guess the main range I like is 5-12.  I like adults too, but not nearly as much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t do anything about it but I wish this thread would cease. You may have your fantasies about pedophilia  but keep it to yourself. Do not involve children or other adults. Thoughts are our own but actions belong to everyone. 
To normalize and legitimize pedophilia is on many levels wrong, even though you may not see it that way. We have laws that state that a person under the age of 18 cannot give consent, this includes sexual. Acting upon your desires constitutes statutory rape. Opening up about your fantasies in this thread manner is similar in that it encourages openness and a positive conversation of the subject but for all you know also might encourage someone else to  seek out the similar desire but act on it because it is on some level socially understood and accepted. 
I understand that I&#39;m the one going to get hate for this message. You&#39;re willing to open up about you&#39;re sexual desires even though the controversy over it. You give people a chance to probe your mind but why? People never be alright with someone who opens up about their desire to physically abuses a child why should we do that with someone who wishes they could sexually abuse a child?</p>

<p>Children cannot give consent of that kind to an adult -- you have to consider the full context. An adult that knows exactly what he&#39;s doing can manipulate a child that has no idea what is going on into giving &quot;consent&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>People say things like &quot;kids cannot give consent&quot; because they are talking about adults trying to have sex with children, and they say &quot;sex is traumatic to kids&quot; because they are talking about adults taking advantage of children and raping them, which is definitely traumatic. And it&#39;s very easy to hate people that manipulate children and rape them, so there&#39;s no need to play mental games to make it easier.</p>

<p>Just making sure that you understand -- when you invoke the full context of a situation, you arrive at the same conclusions as normal people who are disgusted by pedophiles who rape kids.</p>

Forever. Then they don&#39;t even know they&#39;ve been perved on and you get to maintain your ideology of &quot;this is fine.&quot;. Or would that make you too tempted to touch one of &#39;em?</p>
