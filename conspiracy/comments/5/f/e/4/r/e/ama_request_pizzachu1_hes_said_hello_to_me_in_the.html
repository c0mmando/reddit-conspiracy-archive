       I've never seen any of that stuff outside of the FBI files.  Like I said I don't go to websites for criminals, the pedophiles I've interacted with are usually either weeaboos or depressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheese Pizza is a really old joke way of referring to child pornography.  In the old days of /b/ people would abbreviate child porn as CP, which of course are also the initials for Cheese Pizza.  I'm sure a lot of the people posting child porn on /b/ weren't even actually pedophiles, they just liked posting it because it was the only thing not allowed and it makes some people really freak out.  It's probably older than 4chan, but /b/ is the first place I heard it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sort of doubt that a cabal of child molesting elite politicians would use the same terminology as a bunch of weirdos on 4chan, but who knows.

       I don't think I've ever talked to a pedophile who said they've actually had sex with a kid while they were an adult.  I think most probably don't even look at illegal pictures, they just look at drawings and those Asian non-nude models.  I don't know of any code words, but I don't go anywhere that's underground.  Outside of Reddit, I just interact with weeaboos who like to talk about how much they love lolis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine most of the pedophiles who actually fuck kids talk to each other on the darkweb on forums with child porn, so it'd actually be illegal to look at them.

       If you looked up the legal definition of child porn you'd know that's not true.  Anything featuring a minor in sexually explicit conduct is child porn, and that includes minors above the age of "consent".  Sexually explicit conduct can mean masturbation or just plain nudity.

       Also, I'm not a totalitarian who thinks people should go to prison for looking at pictures of bad things.  ISIS uploads videos of them torturing people to fucking Youtube and no one seems to care.

       So you say that you have not viewed cp, yet pizza is in your username? Why would you be promoting this if you do not support it like you have said?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever considered chemical castration since you can't legally have sex with anyone you would ever want to, yet probably have urges to do so? An androgynous life could possibly be more fulfilling. Sorry if I offended.

       I came up with this username when I was 10-years-old (on another website).  I didn't even know what porn was back then, I just needed a username so I came up with a Pokemon pun.  Maybe I'm a victim of tachyonic meme magic, I don't know.

       From what I've heard chemical castration doesn't even get rid of your feelings or attractions, it just makes it impossible to get an erection.  But even if it did remove all sexual desires and didn't have any side effects, I don't think I'd want to do it.  I can still enjoy my feelings without doing anything illegal.  I don't really want to remove my ability to enjoy some of my favorite thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't worry I don't think it's possible to offend me.

       Nightmares are one thing. Passing thoughts are one thing. Consideration of a topic is one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But maintaining those thoughts, reveling in them, exploring them, and allowing them to continue... especially when it comes to fucking the innocence out of youth, however you want to do it... that's a whole 'nother thing. A not okay thing.

      <p>
       There should be pedophile hotlines like there are suicide hotlines as there should be homicide hotlines as there are addiction hotlines.

      <p>
       It is not an okay thing to actively let swirl around in your head, no matter how passively you try to convince yourself you're doing it.

       I agree. If the thoughts become dangerous, you should seek professional help.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the right thing to do. The people who choose not to seek help and act on the thoughts should be jailed. It's still up to the individual to choose on what path to take.

       Well I didn't become a pedophile on purpose.  When I was a little boy I liked little girls, and now that I'm an adult I still like little girls.  Now I spend a bunch of time on internet forums for pedophiles because it's something I think about a lot and you're not really allowed to talk about it anywhere else.

       I think it's wrong to rape anyone.  I think it's silly to say that children can't give consent, obviously you can ask them if they want something and they can say yes or no.  I don't think children are necessarily traumatized by sex either.  There was a kid in my middle school who got a girl pregnant when he was like 13, and he never really seemed traumatized.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really approve of kids having sex, but I think people like to say things like "kids cannot give consent" and "sex is traumatic to kids" just so it's easier for them to hate people they think are gross.

       They're not traumatized by it at the time. It's when it hits them when they're older/"get it" that's the issue.

       I think what usually happens is they're taught that they should be traumatized by it, so they become traumatized it.  If you want a real pedophile conspiracy theory, try reading about

       I think I like girls the best around 7-9, when they've lost their baby fat but haven't quite started puberty yet.  I guess the main range I like is 5-12.  I like adults too, but not nearly as much.

       I can't do anything about it but I wish this thread would cease. You may have your fantasies about pedophilia  but keep it to yourself. Do not involve children or other adults. Thoughts are our own but actions belong to everyone. 
To normalize and legitimize pedophilia is on many levels wrong, even though you may not see it that way. We have laws that state that a person under the age of 18 cannot give consent, this includes sexual. Acting upon your desires constitutes statutory rape. Opening up about your fantasies in this thread manner is similar in that it encourages openness and a positive conversation of the subject but for all you know also might encourage someone else to  seek out the similar desire but act on it because it is on some level socially understood and accepted. 
I understand that I'm the one going to get hate for this message. You're willing to open up about you're sexual desires even though the controversy over it. You give people a chance to probe your mind but why? People never be alright with someone who opens up about their desire to physically abuses a child why should we do that with someone who wishes they could sexually abuse a child?

       I was waiting for someone to bring up the idea of "normalizing pedophilia". That's been popping up lately... hasn't it? Sure, NAMBLA's been at it for ages, but since the leaks came out.... I can't be the only who's seen multiple posts about it happening. Even before the leaks. Normalize everything, no matter what! Shaming is bad in ALL forms! Etc, etc.

      <p>
       Edit: Also, I'd be shocked if you got any hate for that. Reeeeeeeally doubt anyone's gonna get onto you. I got your back if they do.

       Children cannot give consent of that kind to an adult -- you have to consider the full context. An adult that knows exactly what he's doing can manipulate a child that has no idea what is going on into giving "consent".

        I think people like to say things like "kids cannot give consent" and "sex is traumatic to kids" just so it's easier for them to hate people they think are gross.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       People say things like "kids cannot give consent" because they are talking about adults trying to have sex with children, and they say "sex is traumatic to kids" because they are talking about adults taking advantage of children and raping them, which is definitely traumatic. And it's very easy to hate people that manipulate children and rape them, so there's no need to play mental games to make it easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just making sure that you understand -- when you invoke the full context of a situation, you arrive at the same conclusions as normal people who are disgusted by pedophiles who rape kids.

       I feel like this is the wet dream of Minority Report... to stop things before they happen instead waiting for a child's future to be ruined so someone too many steps removed from the situation can feel good about all of it.

       The pedophiles on Reddit aren't the ones you need to worry about.  Most of the ones on
       <a href="/r/pedofriends">
        /r/pedofriends

       hate themselves more than you hate them.  The pedophiles who are willing and able to break the law and have sex with a minor probably have better things to do than post on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't feel guilty since I haven't done anything wrong.  I'm really not even that gross in the grand scheme of things.  I'm sure it would be nice to feel about adult women the way I feel about little girls, but it doesn't really eat me up in side.  The thing that really bothers me is being hated by everyone so much that I'm simultaneously used as a scapegoat by both the government and conspiracy theorists.

       There be tech savvy pedophiles anonymously chatting with each other on the inter webs?! Golly!

       You keep stressing sex with a minor. You don't work with kids, do you? There's no opportunity for pedo-touching? It's more than just railing a kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever tried getting with a woman who's the opposite like... race? An exotic. What about like.... a much older woman. Then you can still have the age gap and not fantasize about diddling kiddies.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if you just did it the creepy european way and moved to a beach where nudity does not equal sexuality, get a nice high up apt, some binoculars, and just back and watch. From a distance. Forever. Then they don't even know they've been perved on and you get to maintain your ideology of "this is fine.". Or would that make you too tempted to touch one of 'em?

       If you looked up the legal definition of child porn you'd know that's not true.  Anything featuring a minor in sexually explicit conduct is child porn, and that includes minors above the age of "consent".  Sexually explicit conduct can mean masturbation or just plain nudity.

       Also, I'm not a totalitarian who thinks people should go to prison for looking at pictures of bad things.  ISIS uploads videos of them torturing people to fucking Youtube and no one seems to care.
