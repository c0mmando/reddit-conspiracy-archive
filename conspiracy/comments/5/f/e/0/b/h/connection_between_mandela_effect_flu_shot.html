        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I posed 2 questions in a Mandela Effect related sub. Are you experiencing the Mandela Effect and do you get the flu vaccine? </p>

<p>Of the 28 people who said they are experiencing the Mandela Effect, 27 do not regularly get the flu vaccine. Most hadn&#39;t received any vaccines since reaching adulthood.</p>

<p>It could be that the kind of person who would refuse the vaccine is the same kind of person who would trust their own memories in the face of so much contradictory evidence.</p>

<p>Or it could be that vaccinations have something to do with the Mandela Effect. Could what is in the vaccines affect memory? Make people more susceptible to a type of hypnosis? Make people less likely to question authority? </p>

<p>Are you experiencing the Mandela Effect? Do you get adult vaccinations? </p>

<p>Note: The linked post was heavily downvoted, which makes me even more curious. <a href="https://m.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5a6yd3/flu_shots/">https://m.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5a6yd3/flu_shots/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell if I know.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s why it&#39;s dumb.</p>

<p>Imagine you could go back to the creation of crows and change them from black to white. Would humans today say &quot;Wait, don&#39;t you guys remember crows being black?&quot;</p>

<p>No. Since you&#39;ve affected an event in time, everything that relates to it is changed. We would know crows are white and always have been, black would never cross our mind as a possibility.</p>

<p>Also, going backwards in time is impossible as far as we know, unless someone here is holding out on us on reversing gravity. And has solved the grandfather paradox. And many other things.</p>

<p>The south Park episodes Go! God, Go! exemplify what I&#39;m saying pretty well.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right that there&#39;s nothing wrong with saying &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; but you must either commit to that or not. You cannot say &quot;I don&#39;t know but it sounds cool and I can&#39;t remember things the way they actually are so I must be right&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, this just happened. We&#39;re trying to figure out the cause but we also have to deal with those who aren&#39;t experiencing it and, therefore, can&#39;t understand it.

<p>Second, we do not know the process of any of the examples I gave. But, really, it&#39;s a moot point. </p>

<p>I can show you proof (watch the Secret Service reenactment of the JFK assassination or check out the replica at the museum) of a different reality, I can show you hundreds of reality differences, I can show you thousands of people experiencing it, I can show you physicists talking about the possibility of parallel universes, but none of that is good enough if you aren&#39;t experiencing it yourself.</p>

<p>The closest I get is a clear memory of the Branch Davidian massacre happening in 91.  I remember asking one of the teachers at the christian private school I was attending &quot;what if he really was Jesus and we just messed up?&quot;.  By 93 I was in public school, so the memory doesn&#39;t work correctly given the historical consensus.</p>

<p>But I didn&#39;t start getting flue shots till &#39;01, so probably not relevant.</p>

<p>In response to your query, no, no flu shots ever, and no vaccinations since public school with no more than a half dozen all together from the time I was born. I actually had chicken pox, measles and mumps, none of which were anything more than briefly uncomfortable with the added bonus of getting to stay home from school for ten days to two weeks with each of them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now in my late 60&#39;s and wouldn&#39;t advise anyone, particularly elderly people, to take a flu shot that&#39;s laced with aluminum, mercury and formaldehyde, unless they want to join the living dead with Alzheimer&#39;s or dementia well ahead of schedule. There are better ways to live and better ways to die as far as I&#39;m concerned. </p>

<p>I can also add that I stopped watching television or going to movies about a decade ago. Initially, I stopped watching as three month experiment after which I discovered I could no longer suspend my sense of disbelief nor bear the artificiality, contrivances, card-board-cut-out characters and stilted dialog that passes for entertainment then or now. </p>

<p>I also found that most of the newscasts struck me in the very same way, artificial and contrived with insufficient facts to justify the way they were being presented. You stay away from it for a reasonable amount of time and when you return it&#39;s a deliberate &quot;look-see&quot;and you are suddenly aware of the faulty logic and inconsistencies that most the so-called facts come wrapped in. The more important the stories are and the more they affect and impose on your everyday life the worse those tend to get. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing this. I agree with so much of what you&#39;ve said. Especially about TV. I put mine in the closet almost 6 months ago and can&#39;t imagine ever pulling it out again. The real world is so much more interesting. Especially right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this is an old thread, but I wanted to comment as well. I do not get flu shots, and I experience the Mandela Effect. The one that is blowing me away right now, and the reason I am researching this phenomena, is the Sinbad movie Shazaam where he plays a genie that apparently never existed. If I was an artist of any kind, I would draw what his character wore to see if it matched anybody else&#39;s memory of the movie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>im from the pre mandelic reality i have not been to the doctors in over 8 years no shots of any kind for over 10 years, while i have not boxed up my mind and started assuming my bias jumps to conclusion could even be in the same ballpark of what if anything is really causing what we call the mandela effect. if you ask someone about an alleged mandela effect event if they can actually remember that event taking place in there timeline and reality then its 100% they will remember it whats wrong now. But if they were alive but a baby and not really have a memory of that event happening they will then they wont remember which way it happened, especially compared to the degree that they will be 100% sure they remember pre mandelic events now seeming to be wrong. the power of true statistics shown to people in a way that they can make conclusions and decisions is too big of a thing to ignore when huge numbers of people are all agreeing things are not what they remember. exploring this mandela effect is probably the biggest statistical mystery we have right now either way the rabbit hole leads for real truth its already mind blowing statistically either way</p>
