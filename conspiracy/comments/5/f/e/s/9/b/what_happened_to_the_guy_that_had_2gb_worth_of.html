       He posted it on r/pizzagate and people confirmed it was actual kiddyporn but he provided no proof of actually obtaining it from the wethepizza site which was the alleged source that he hacked into to find it. People were saying it was a honeypot to get people to download cp and later prosecute them.

       Really and truly, it could have been. I have no clue. He could have kept his trail of evidence a secret to protect his identity. But at the same time, I'm not touching cp with a ten foot pole regardless of where anon says it comes from. Gonna listen to the hivemind on this one.

       There was an article that interviewed someone claiming to be him. I'll see if I can find it. Basically, they said they were trolling and anyone will believe anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it was a troll being a troll or trying to get us banned. I'd like to know why and where he got the CP. He also posted the same thing on Voat.

       Edit: Here it is. I'll be honest, I didn't read it all:

       I read the whole article. While long, it was a great read and well-written.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: some actual 'fake news' articles were, in fact, elaborate experiments that sometimes took-on a life of their own. OP shares his experience, describes feeling at times exhilarated, other times remorse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to see which fake news articles this person made that I had read. The 'buckets of losers' one I read about - spectacular fake. Good on you for teaching us to have a healthy dose of skepticism about the information we come across on the Internets.
