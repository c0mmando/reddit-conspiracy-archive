But at the same time, I&#39;m not touching cp with a ten foot pole regardless of where anon says it comes from. Gonna listen to the hivemind on this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was an article that interviewed someone claiming to be him. I&#39;ll see if I can find it. Basically, they said they were trolling and anyone will believe anything.</p>

<p>I think it was a troll being a troll or trying to get us banned. I&#39;d like to know why and where he got the CP. He also posted the same thing on Voat.</p>

<p>Edit: Here it is. I&#39;ll be honest, I didn&#39;t read it all: <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/21/i-ve-been-making-viral-fake-news-for-the-last-six-months-it-s-way-too-easy-to-dupe-the-right-on-the-internet.html">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/21/i-ve-been-making-viral-fake-news-for-the-last-six-months-it-s-way-too-easy-to-dupe-the-right-on-the-internet.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read the whole article. While long, it was a great read and well-written. </p>

<p>TL;DR: some actual &#39;fake news&#39; articles were, in fact, elaborate experiments that sometimes took-on a life of their own. OP shares his experience, describes feeling at times exhilarated, other times remorse. </p>

<p>I wanted to see which fake news articles this person made that I had read. The &#39;buckets of losers&#39; one I read about - spectacular fake. Good on you for teaching us to have a healthy dose of skepticism about the information we come across on the Internets. </p>
