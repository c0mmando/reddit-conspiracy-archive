<p>With all due respect, fuck off. Wikileaks may be the single most significant source of truth in our time, and whether or not there&#39;s something fucky going on with them, it strikes me as wildly irresponsible to go around telling people to ignore anything they publish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With all due respect, prior to the Ecuadorian embassy shutting off his internet. He has not made any effort to reach the outside world. Except I guess Pamela Anderson visited him and didnt take a picture of him. As far as him speaking over phone with a horrible connection.</p>

<p>I want you to <a href="https://www.audio4fun.com/voice-changer.htm">see this</a>. They market it saying it can change your voice to mimic a celebrity. This is being sold to the public. </p>

<p>I used to play on soundboards all the time in 2004, faking a phone conversation is easy.</p>

<p>But, shit.... look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk&amp;amp;amp;app=desktop">this</a>.
Anyway I am a full blown supporter of wikileaks which is why when some agents came out on 4chan begging people not to publish info thru wikileaks because they are prosecuting whistleblowers, and assange has not made a window appearance and the gitmo express plane was in London when the raid at the embassy happened.  </p>

<p>I need more proof wikileaks isn&#39;t compromised, right now with the way it is. It seems totally compromised </p>

Forging a phone call is one thing, but forging 500k files in excruciating detail is near impossible, at least within the operating budgets of gov&#39;t intelligence agencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said don&#39;t read it. 
Simply want to tell whistleblowers that word on the street is you will be prosecuted trying to publish leaks to wikileaks. 
You don&#39;t find it the least bit ironic at the most pivotal moment for wether wikileaks is alive and well or obviously compromised we are given a behemoth load of old government files?!? 
Shit sounds to me like they kicked this out just like they do with FOIA requests, just to keep us happy long enough while they torture assange and figure out where all his operatives are and to make sure his deadman switch was denied</p>

<p>Edit: and I just read over the leaks again. There is nothing new or damning in them. Unless I am missing something big, I will continue to read these myself. But it reads as a common and accepted understanding of history by the US </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the comment i originally replied to did say to ignore them. nothing new or damning for us tinfoil hat people, maybe, because we&#39;ve speculated on this stuff for years. </p>

<p>but having it in black and white, in writing, is both new and significant. foreign governments will be able to act on it now, major corporations...</p>

<p>you don&#39;t find it funny that right as WL starts the presses back up, we&#39;re inundated with distractions and concern trolls telling us to ignore what they&#39;re printing? to me, the hour-long interview was sufficient to at least make me put aside my concerns about Assange&#39;s safety and WL&#39;s integrity long enough to at least pay attention to this massive dump.</p>

<p>don&#39;t tell people not to pay attention. i don&#39;t mind having to sort through disinfo if it means that real information is more readily available. 1979 was a major year. the world as we know it was born in 79.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I want people to pay attention to wikileaks, I never said anything of the sort to not read it and you just stated yourself this entire &#39;bombshell&#39; of evidence is absolutely nothing new and there is nothing that will come of it. Again I am currently reading more of the files dumped but all this is ancient history and that is why I don&#39;t find there to be any &#39;distraction and concern trolls&#39; telling us to ignore it. But again.</p>

<p>WHISTLEBLOWERS ARE BEING ADVISED NOT TO SUBMIT LEAKED INFO TO WIKILEAKS. </p>

<p>In other words, please keep reading the files published. Shit. Tell your whole family to read this. But until then. </p>

<p>For people on the front lines need to know this is no longer a safe place for publishing leaked info.  That&#39;s all I am saying and that&#39;s all I see people on here saying. As far as censoring or not believing the info, bull shit. We&#39;re saying this is old and sounds like a part of the foia info we&#39;re about to get on the Kennedy killing and CIA coverup.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where it started but the govt has crazy files about JFK they are about to publish next year</p>

<p>Edit <a href="http://whowhatwhy.org/2016/02/04/breaking-news-list-of-withheld-jfk-assassination-documents/">ahh next year oct 2017</a> they will be releasing the JFK files. 
Anyway, all in all the recent dump of files is great. I just wish the news and mass sheeple gave a shit about it. But I also want sincere proof assange is alive, because honestly it does not look like he is in London anymore. I&#39;m betting the next mainstream news we hear about assange will be him &#39;being detained&#39; or extradited </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I think it should be discussed. There is nothing new in these leaks. Nothing damning. And nothing happening.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you got hurt someone told you to ignore it.</p>

<p>Point being, these emails seem like a very easy way for us to be &#39;re-educated&#39; using this massive leak.  The files explain almost point for point what is very obvious while looking at history. In a sense these leaks provide nothing but the cover of keeping people believing wikileaks is fine. </p>

<p>So get over it. You posted this, and people are telling you it&#39;s compromised. And you get upset because someone said to ignore it. 
Well don&#39;t ignore it if you don&#39;t want to. 
But what the fuck good is it going to do to know for a fact America trained terrorists in Afghanistan when we have known that for years? 
Get what I&#39;m saying yet?! Read these leaks, there&#39;s nothing new here. This is a state sponsored release. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No as I&#39;ve said every reply I am still reading thru them. 
But so far the overview of the documents really don&#39;t provide any new material. And as I find more time the documents in going thru are pretty much affirming what people already know.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t say it hurt you, but your obviously upset and continually saying &#39;the original post said to ignore it!&#39;</p>

<p>And I&#39;m telling you get over it. Quit defending this, have you even read the leaks? What&#39;s so surprising?</p>

<p>If you were that adamant on the leaks provided, what&#39;s in them that&#39;s actually shock worthy? CIA/taliban connections were public knowledge for years, all this is just a comprehensive leak affirming what people already knew. That&#39;s why it is so obvious this is not wikileaks anymore. Buts that my opinion if you would like to share with me some information you find please do.  But you don&#39;t have any info to share about the leaks do you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you fail to see the forest for the trees. either you&#39;re an overzealous but underinformed citizen, or a medium-skill troll, but since we&#39;re so deep into the nested bit of this comment that no one will ever see it, i&#39;ll take the time to elaborate:</p>

<p>1979 was not like other years. the US ran out of oil (for all intents) by the late 60s or so (we were the first to develop serious petroleum technology and exported a good chunk of our share). 1973, came the petrodollar, but it was an uneasy balance... 1979 seems to be the year that we said &quot;fuck it, hegemony time&quot; and just used force to start accruing foreign energy reserves.</p>

<p>Admittedly I might be quick to dismiss, but only time will tell. Or we&#39;ll never find out. But I&#39;m going to keep digging into this dump and we&#39;ll see if more is published thru wikileaks and ever comes out.  Or if assange will randomly be reported as being detained or extradited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With all due respect, prior to the Ecuadorian embassy shutting off his internet. He has not made any effort to reach the outside world. Except I guess Pamela Anderson visited him and didnt take a picture of him. As far as him speaking over phone with a horrible connection.</p>

<p>I want you to <a href="https://www.audio4fun.com/voice-changer.htm">see this</a>. They market it saying it can change your voice to mimic a celebrity. This is being sold to the public. </p>

<p>I used to play on soundboards all the time in 2004, faking a phone conversation is easy.</p>

<p>But, shit.... look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNk&amp;amp;amp;app=desktop">this</a>.
Anyway I am a full blown supporter of wikileaks which is why when some agents came out on 4chan begging people not to publish info thru wikileaks because they are prosecuting whistleblowers, and assange has not made a window appearance and the gitmo express plane was in London when the raid at the embassy happened.  </p>

<p>I need more proof wikileaks isn&#39;t compromised, right now with the way it is. It seems totally compromised </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said don&#39;t read it. 
Simply want to tell whistleblowers that word on the street is you will be prosecuted trying to publish leaks to wikileaks. 
You don&#39;t find it the least bit ironic at the most pivotal moment for wether wikileaks is alive and well or obviously compromised we are given a behemoth load of old government files?!? 
Shit sounds to me like they kicked this out just like they do with FOIA requests, just to keep us happy long enough while they torture assange and figure out where all his operatives are and to make sure his deadman switch was denied</p>

<p>Edit: and I just read over the leaks again. There is nothing new or damning in them. Unless I am missing something big, I will continue to read these myself. But it reads as a common and accepted understanding of history by the US </p>
