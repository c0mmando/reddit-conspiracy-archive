       Note their crossposts with r/WhereIsAssange, making fun of their own users who want to organize a protest - a strategy to get media attention and push for answers.

       The creator of WikileaksCircleJerk
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/vjOPu">
        hangs out with moderators from r/WhereIsAssange
       </a>
       . (The TomPain account is also a prolific WhereIsAssange shill, every thread a useless or discouraging comment, etc., see below too).
      </p>
      <p>
       If that wasn't enough, another WhereIsAssange moderator, DirectTheCheckered, proved in multiple threads that
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/JoK3c">
        she is new to Reddit
       </a>
       (and
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5fhpry/shillception_the_recently_appointed/">
        here is the conspiracy thread about her
       </a>
       , showing not just the two threads where she showed her newness, but also her heavy handed moderation proposals as well as banning of users who call out shill accounts; the regular bunch attempts to rescue her). She is more than likely a PR industry lady added as a moderator just last week, and unfortunately posts about her get removed on WhereIsAssange, including one that was in the top #1 spot in the hour before mods arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another slightly humorous connection with WikileaksCircleJerk, TomPain, and DirectTheCheckered:
      </p>
      <p>
       After WhereIsAssange posted a bunch of threads about their moderator - most removed, she
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/s7gzs">
        had a nice Jeb Bush moment
       </a>
       where she posted the Wikipedia article on "Bullshit", which just confused everyone, and of course the same TomPain account chimes in to explain what it's referencing.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT -
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazing, struck a nerve. Some of the moderators themselves and the usual bunch are here to the rescue. Great work encouraging confidence in your users. (Just checking, the top stickied post right now is a bunch of heavy handed moderation rules)
      </p>
      <p>
       You've gone full r/wikileaks. Not too surprising though.

       This is really dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start with your title: "Moderators of r/WhereIsAssange created r/WikileaksCircleJerk to try to discredit part of their own userbase"
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally false. I am the creator of
       <a href="/r/whereisassange">
        /r/whereisassange
       </a>
       . There are three other mods there as well. You will note that not a single one is a mod of r/WikileaksCircleJerk, nor did any of us create it. You start your post with a total lie. Not a great way to begin, champ.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's a screenshot of my public PGP key, requested by multiple users. I posted it in a sub that someone created for posting PGP keys. It looks like the same person that created the
       <a href="/r/GodSaveTheWhiteWizard">
        /r/GodSaveTheWhiteWizard
       </a>
       sub created
       <a href="/r/Wikileakscirclejerk">
        /r/Wikileakscirclejerk
       </a>
       , though you will note I posted my PGP in the first sub before the second was ever created.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of your post isn't even about the same thing, but rather a bolted on fake controversy on top of another fake controversy that you created, so I'm not even going to respond to it (especially since it has been addressed in other places). You are either making things up or are very confused. Either way, get your shit together.

       Yes, the thread where you refuse to acknowledge the first part of your post is a complete lie, and where you now respond to everything that I say with, "k". I'm not sure why you'd want to direct people to a thread in which you act like a petulant teenager.

      <p>
       No, you are redirecting. I actually didn't talk about DTC at all and said several times that it was addressed elsewhere. I am specifically talking about your claims that we are linked to the circlejerk sub. The false claims. If that wasn't clear, this is me clarifying it.

       <p>
        Your patterns of arguing (the logic, the repitition, style etc.) are convincing me even more and more that you are actually a shill and not just a moderator that got mixed up with other moderator shills. You guys probably share accounts?

       I have been very clear all along that this was addressed elsewhere. But to answer this... AGAIN... several of us are new to modding on reddit. This is my first sub of any reasonable size. I didn't know you couldn't edit post titles for a solid year after I started using reddit. Anyway, the proof you offer is tenuous at best. And the conversations we've had around making rules/content policies are just that... conversations. We are trying to elicit user feedback. I'm not sure why you have such a problem with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Now that I answered your question, will you acknowledge that the
        <em>
         first
        </em>
        part of your post, the part
        <em>
         above
        </em>
        what you just quoted, is wrong?
       </strong>
       Your title is "Moderators of r/WhereIsAssange created r/WikileaksCircleJerk to try to discredit part of their own userbase". That's simply not true. We didn't create it. None of us even post there. You can go look yourself. Anyone reading this can go look themselves (please do). Next, your assertion that I "hang" with them because of ONE POST where I post my
       <em>
        PUBLIC PGP KEY
       </em>
       in an
       <em>
        unrelated subreddit
       </em>
       is... really a stretch, man. I just want you to admit that the very first part of your post is BS. You can even just say you're wrong, you don't have to admit to lying. But it
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       wrong.

      <p>
       Yeah, freakin' unilateral conversations. You don't take user feedback about conditions for removing posts (many have said get rid of it), and it's so pointlessly heavy handed in the first place, why do we even have to defend ourselves against your 1 way imposition of rules? Nobody fucking wants it except the trove of shills you let flourish on that subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, why don't pass a policy to ban shills? You only ban people who criticize shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah I know it's an unrelated sub, obviously, the point is it's a tiny sub and you and other known shills hang out with that guy. It's a direct association.
      </p>
      <p>
       You didn't answer much, but you're really great at working that narrative and skipping over details.

       danger, your sub was great and went to shit when you added directthecheckered.   fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       no shills banned, heavy handed modding enacted, which you had said at the outset you wouldnt do.  I migrated from
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks

       just because of this behavior there.  The same team of

        whomever
       </strong>
       keeps playing whackamole with these subs as they gain traction.  If you cant see this you are blind, and it is a shame because the whole point is to have a rational
       <strong>
        and critical
       </strong>
       discourse that might help lead to truth discovery.  That is not what is happening now.

       Sorry, I just despise you for letting WhereIsAssange be taken over by shills, including at least a few of your moderators. You never had the decency to ban a single one for the sake of all the normal users. You're pushing heavy handed moderations just like r/Wikileaks, you aren't banning a single shill, so guess what? You're getting the same reputation as r/wikileaks, and you deserve it.

       Not a fabrication, sorry. Your DirectTheChekcered moderator is obviously new to Reddit and a shill. You hang out in tiny, intimate subreddits with TomPain (a shill) and the creator of WikiLeaksCircleJerk which lampoons your own users. You are pushing heavy handed moderation to control the narrative just like r/Wikileaks.

       So... just to be clear... the evidence that I "hang out" with the creator of the circlejerk sub is that I made
       <em>
        one post
       </em>
       in another sub that person created for the purpose of posting PGP keys. I just want to make sure I understand. Because if so, you're a special kind of stupid.

       Yes, I can publicly see how you have not banned any shill accounts. I can publicly see how you are pushing heavy handed moderation to control the narrative, like r/wikileaks. I can publicly see how DirectTheCheckered is new to Reddit.
      </p>

       Just because you have public mod logs doesn't mean you don't have an agenda running your subreddit.

       I agree! It is taken over by shills and a lot of them came to this thread to stick up for theirselves. THEY downvote any important evidence so it's buried at the bottom. And they swarm your post making your post not important. I was BANNED for posting pictures of surveillance camera takin Julian from the embassy. That's pretty good evidence right? Well they told me it was a construction truck with a convey of cleaning lady vans behind them. Like wtf. It's a police van escorting 2 SERCO prison vans. 
So I complained on a post that talked about "mod behavior" and the mod saw my post and he banned me immediately for complaining on him. 
That board is not creditable!! They have a timeline of events the shills posted that is completely wrong. 
They send out disinformation to confuse everyone on the board. It's unbelievable and not good for business

       This is directed to OP only, if you spread false information (see Danger's post for proof) and people argue with you, it doesn't mean that you "struck a nerve".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also PEOPLE, for the love of god anyone who argues with you is not necessarily a "shill". Yea, it's possible there are a few "shills" out there but the stupid or ignorant or just trolls vastly outnumber the aforementioned.

       I know that personally, I didnt post any "false information".  What I posted was actually called false information and "shitty evidence", which is bizarre to me.  I posted a literal CCTV still of a white van convoy at 1AM on a Monday morning leaving the Embassy on the
       <strong>
        day
       </strong>
       JA was reported to have his Internet cut, and many other chaotic events happened that very day.  Exactly how could this be "false"? Were they not vans? were they not white vans?  was it not a convoy (4 visible in the photo)? were they not leaving (or at least passing) the Ecuadorian embassy at 1AM (this data is on the timestamped still and the building and streets/location are known and visible).  All of these are indisputable facts! So how does  that make this "false" or "shitty" evidence? Please explain.  Now maybe my conclusion as to the meaning and value are different and in dispute, but why would the photo itself or its status as evidence be attacked?  Attack my conclusion if you must but dont attack and try to bury the actual photo (which is what happened).  Doing so exposes that you would have an ulterior motive for doing that. It isnt rocket science.

       In that conspiracy thread, she comes out sounding reasonable.  And was up woth OP of that thread? They behaved like a childish troll, unable to back up their bogus claims, instead only offering lols and memes in response.

       The connections between WhereIsJulian moderators and the anti-WhereIsJulian WikileaksCircleJerk.

       mod here. I'm the one who backs things up. I'm also the one who backed up pizzagate just in time before they were banned. Not a community member there, just don't like seeing information disappear. I facilitated the modmail being made public. I watch the modqueue and /new but have only occasionally made comments unless it pertains to moderator topics. I've been in the discord for a while. I talk with all the mods daily.

       Im pretty new to reddit. I dont even understand crossposts so bear with me.  I joined the_donald to help read through wikileaks releases prior to the US election. Julian's internet being cut lead me here. I have been at r/whereisassange since danger was the only mod and have been impressed with architecture created for the sub. I hope posts like these don't discourage the mods of whereisassange too much because it really is a great set up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereisassange had some user that got offended after their posts were not well received. Then they started spamming those same posts. Sorry your butthurt, but move on.

       That was a really interesting article, thanks for sharing! Somehow i doubt the internet age would look any different if Thomas Pain hadn't let his copyright go, but i can see why they would choose him as a figure to look at considering his influence on a revolution.  thanks for posting man

       yes, this is absolutely spot on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was one of the banned accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       What was my huge crime?
      </p>
      <p>
       I complained because the picture I posted of the white van convoy leaving the embassy at 1 AM on the morning JA went missing just before Internet cut by Ecuador (all of which are indisputable facts) was shouted down by a literal army of downvoters, for no reason, all in a flurry after the post had gained some gradual upvoting.  And accompanied by nearly a full page of "stop posting this, it is shitty evidence" posts.   Sounds insane, but its true.  I mean, seriously, how is that bad evidence?   It was a timestamped photographic evidence of a very odd circumstance that according to the timeline and facts seemed to be very relevant!  Now, maybe as a theory it isnt any more or less solid than any other theory (which I would dispute, I think it is exactly correct that JA was abducted in those vans), but why the massive initiative to silence it?
      </p>
      <p>
       So when the initial blog link topic I posted was silenced, I reposted, this time the image only. Not several times,
       <strong>
        once
       </strong>
       .   And was instantly attacked
       <strong>
        again
       </strong>
       , and accused of spamming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, almost not believing my eyes, but realizing the sub had gone the way of
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       before it, I posted a topic saying exactly that - and I was then attacked by other users. I didnt call those users shills, I called them Federal Agents, which I believe they are.   I was told I couldnt "by-step" the no-shill-callout rule by saying "Agents".  After I was warned not to do that, I realized the sub was a lost cause (the moderators are clearly in on the takeover, except for the original mod, who had even said at the outset of the sub that he would NOT be heavy-handed modding like that) - and I did not attack anyone or the sub.  Regardless, and without any further reason, several hours later I was banned.  The sub is 100% compromised and is a ghost town now. There are posts and activity, but it is obviously heavily monitored and scrutinized.  Any topics or comments that to
       <strong>
        me
       </strong>
       relate to anything of substance or value are instantly downvoted to oblivion partnered with nasty comments (which are miraculously upvoted by its compadres).

        IOW its a full

       THIS is EXACTLY how "they" control the opposition.  Ask yourself why these same shills who ran
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard

       are so interested in pushing lies about Asange.  Also note that magically Israel has had NOTHING of significance leaked by Wikileaks.  The exact same magic that has kept ISIS/ISIL from attacking Israel.  Magic!

       I wish I was getting paid for this. Instead I am talking to your dumb ass for free. What fun! Still not going to even try to come up with an excuse for why the very first sentence of your post is a lie? Pathetic.

       So... just to be clear... the evidence that I "hang out" with the creator of the circlejerk sub is that I made
       <em>
        one post
       </em>
       in another sub that person created for the purpose of posting PGP keys. I just want to make sure I understand. Because if so, you're a special kind of stupid.
