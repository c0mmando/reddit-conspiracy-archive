        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post should be at the last link you see below. The question was asked: Are we ruffling any feathers with Pizzagate?</p>

<p>Answer: Yes, 80% of the politicians of the US and EU are under pedo insurance. They have videos of each other having pedo sex and group orgies both gay and straight. This is what is holding the OLD ORDER together. It acts like glue that holds together the psychopaths at the top. </p>

<p>He also said that the elite feel the noose around their necks. Nobody has cracked yet, but if one person cracks, then the whole thing can go down with all the rating out that will happen. Also, if people don&#39;t buy pedo insurance, they will be unable to climb to the higher ranks of government. This means, they are forced to have sex with children just to lead. </p>

<p>If they are feeling the noose around their necks, then we are on the right track. I don&#39;t see the elite surviving this to be honest which is good news for us. Let&#39;s keep pushing folks!</p>

<p>Some other interesting things I read from these posts.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The real Osama Bin Ladin is Barrack Obama. Before Obama came into the spotlight, he was a CIA agent that went undercover as Osama Bin Ladin and ran operations in the region. The guy on TV is just a plant. I know this sounds crazy but it came from the same ANON. </p></li>
<li><p>Soros is planning to bump the economy while Obama is in office so it looks like Obama fixed it. Then, once Trump makes a few good policies, he wants to tank the economy so the people think Trump is a moron. This is to manipulate us into voting a pro-establishment President in 4 years from now. This, to me, is the biggest terror attack in history if its true. </p></li>
<li><p>The Bible and religious text have been toyed with severely by the elite over time which has brought this world into a massive spiritual confusion. Half the stuff in the Bible is BS. </p></li>
<li><p>The Clintons brought down JFK Jr&#39;s plan and killed him. </p></li>
<li><p>Wikileaks is taking a break until Trump gets into office and then they will continue with phase 3. They just don&#39;t know what to do right now because they can&#39;t predict Trumps movements. They will resume after Jan 20. Assange is alive. </p></li>
<li><p>The levels of deception of the CIA are so intense that nobody can figure out which side the CIA is on. Pro-establishment or anti-establishment?</p></li>
<li><p>There are old school secret societies of light that have used power to offset the destructive behavior of some of the elite. This anon belongs to such a group called &quot;Three&quot; and the oldest member is Plato. He claims his group wants to raise our consciousness level worldwide as we are in a state of total dimness which the &quot;Old Order&quot; wanted all along. They want the &quot;Old Order&quot; to fall apart and they are working on it but they admit that they need our help with stuff like red-pilling and raising our own awareness and other facets of mind like creativity. </p></li>
<li><p>The Anon confirms a large scale spiritual awakening of sorts can happen within a few years. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I only read the final 2 links from the list below. There&#39;s a lot more in there if anyone wants to dig around. </p>

<p>EDIT: HAHA - I told my wife who is an artist that we might be onto something new and Osama Bin Ladin has a secret identity. She immediately said Barrack Obama. I was in shock and she says she can see clearly because she is an artist and they look very similar. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m sure it was a lucky guess but damn. She guessed Obama. </p>

<p>One of the things HLI mentioned was that during the times Osama Bin Laden appeared, Barack Obama disappeared. So he had a somewhat active role playing as Osama Bin Laden. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>interesting.</p>

<p>although gotta ask, was that the best black guy they could find in the whole of the CIA?</p>

<p>surely they must have had loads working for them (fighting communism in Africa etc).</p>

<p>Although a more interesting question is, how did CIA end up installing a wannabe commie dictator who might not even be potentially American?</p>

<p>unless you just look at them as a globalist organization rather than a american intel one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Unless you just look at them as a global organisation rather than an a American intel one&quot;
That&#39;s exactly it - well said as well.
Most people, myself included before reading HLI, didn&#39;t know the CIA was originally the OSS- Office of Strategic Services- a British -US creation in 1942.
The British intelligence Mi6 were instrumental in training and supplying equipment for the fledgling agency. 
Once you dig down the rabbit hole, understanding that the CIA is a globalist organisation, you&#39;ll begin to notice trends in CIA involvement and indirect British benefit. (I&#39;m a Brit btw)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably the former. I&#39;m a Londoner and haven&#39;t experienced any kind of financial or material impact in the quality of my life over these couple of financial crisis. It&#39;s like all of the toxic spillover caused in large part by The City and the financial cowboys that operate within it, fails utterly to have any adverse affect on London. When it comes though, I imagine it will come thick and fast and all at once- like it does when the rich go broke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol same again. </p>

<p>not sure how long to stay here for before bugging out. shame we cant be &quot;preppers&quot; here as much as we can in USA.</p>

<p>i think we will def feel the impact when we have another set of riots again. </p>

<p>or when they will start cracking down on dessent / anti sharia etc.</p>

<p>on one hand im praying for Brexit (to escape the EU federal nightmare) but on the other hand i realize it will probably give UK the ability to become mini dictatorship faster...like with that Snoopers charter.</p>

<p>need to read into it but i doubt it would have been passed in EU so fast (mostly cos more countries = more chance of unbiased journalists somewhere blowing the lid).</p>

<p>not that they wouldnt do it eventually themselves.</p>

The appetite for revolution and change isn&#39;t as strong here so I feel the same as you, that it&#39;ll be difficult to start/ride the wave once it begins in earnest.. 
The snoopers charter is worrying and has seemingly
Gone under the radar of most people ... but it didn&#39;t tell me anything new about the state of affairs here - head into central London, and try and find a square inch not under CCTV observation - it&#39;s been that way forever. That&#39;s not a coincidence.
I see the decisions to leave EU being a tactical one - allows the U.K. to forge closer links to China (London will be new vehicle for Yuan post Brexit), whilst escaping the forthcoming and ongoing drama plaguing the Eurozone. 
Edit- if you&#39;re interested, doing some research around the Square Mile and the undue influence it still wields in the world even after Britains role diminished globally, will give you some insight into how much control Britain still maintains and exercise on geopolitics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% - in U.K., US &amp; other western states, the introduction of masses of uneducated, dependent immigrants is intended to not only quell the growth of a middle class who would challenge the elites (low wager wages, dependent on government aid etc), it also causes divisions which can be exploited by government. My point was it&#39;s important to remember who Trump is- for anyone to expect him to conduct himself any differently during office as he has to this point is going to be disappointed. He needs to be held to account the same as anyone else - I&#39;m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt till I see what a Trump Presidency looks like, but it&#39;s not with any kind of optimism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i read an interesting &quot;anon&quot; on one of the chans that all this muslim invasion is being done on purpose so that they TPTB can then start some war to kick them all out of Europe and enforce dictatorship through that.</p>

<p>who knows. id agree that might be a forseeable plan if they had like a 10 year timeline.</p>

<p>20-30 year timeline and its easier to just let time take its place. by then we will have &quot;home grown&quot;  &quot;leaders&quot; proposing and getting elected on Sharia law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>besides, is it really a rabbit hole at all? GHWB was director of CIA. 
who cares if Obama used to be an operative? atleast it would be better exp than &quot;community organizer&quot;.</p>

<p>ive always seen him as a pawn more like. the only usefulness of this story is that it could prove the birther movement i think</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your concern is justified. You can&#39;t without some faith I guess. If it means anything, I unequivocally believe it to be genuine. My education is history and literature based to an MA level in addition I&#39;m a keen amateur historian and writer. From writing style, and his literary voice, im more than 95% it&#39;s the same guy.
If it&#39;s another guy or multiple actors, they have a comprehensive script they all work  off. The range of HLIs knowledge is wide and deep. He makes several predictions around Erdogans coup, correct poll numbers back in July, that lead me to believe he has insider information.
, or a comprehensive enough understanding of multiple fields that bestowed him with seemingly clairvoyant powers.
The most telling example of his credibility to me is the fact he doesn&#39;t demand trust or require allegiance -he asks for his policies and idea to be scrutinised and researched before one should trust him. The action required after reading his words is more towards self action. He isn&#39;t trying to get you to vote or foster opinions- more, &quot;here&#39;s the facts, do the research to ensure they&#39;re so, then let&#39;s talk again&quot;. Over the course of the thread the perfectly justified  accusatory, cynical  questions lessen as independent research proves him to be legit.
There are those of us on r/conspiracy and 4chan who think he&#39;s the real deal- that number is rising as more are exposed to no . I&#39;ve personally introduced multiple people on this sub to him after u/darkomantis put me on- and I&#39;ll continue to do so.
They mean us to be become the 100th Monkey, I think. The wave of consciousness that makes their revolution possible.. to do that we&#39;ll need everyone with an enquiring and cynical mind - people like you. If you&#39;re able to dedicate the time to read one, in confident it&#39;ll at least spur you to read another. If not, I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my justification.
Peace bro </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read every single one of these and every single answer from this guy - i feel like my life is changing.  It feels like even if he is lying, his message is symbolic regarding human consciousness.  But i dont think he is lying.  When I smoke weed, I feel like I break that consciousness barrier that he is talking about, and i understand the telepathy bit, where it feels like i have the striking ability to all of a sudden put myself in &quot;somebody elses shoes&quot; and feel what theyre feeling.  I am very curious about the &quot;eat once a day thing&quot; he said.  Seems like a dangerous thing to recommend, based on our modern knowledge of health and nutrition; but i am curious.</p>

<p>Please post more if they come!  I am trying to think of the questions that he really wants us to ask - maybe we should have a thread where we can work together to try to figure out the correct pertinent questions that we need to ask him before he returns again</p>
