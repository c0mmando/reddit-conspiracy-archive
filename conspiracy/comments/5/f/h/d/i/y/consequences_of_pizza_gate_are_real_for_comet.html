        Alefantis Addressing Allegations Against Comet Ping Pong
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis says he’s even received intimidating direct messages on Facebook and so have others associated with the restaurant, including its purveyors. He calls the attackers"conspiracy theorist, white nationalists made up largely of racists, homophobic individuals who loosely tie together theories and do not attempt to find the truth, and when they do find truth that dispels their theories, they ignore it.“
"Conspiracy theorists” - This is accurate
“Racists” - None of this has anything to do with race and most of the people theorized to be involved in this are middle aged white people. Also we’re apparently “white nationalists” despite the fact that they’re the ones presumed to be taking advantage of kids from third world orphanages in Haiti.
“Homophobic” - We don’t like Alefantis, who is gay, so therefore we don’t like all gays. Okay…
The most sickening part of this vicious attack has been the stealing of Instagram images, Facebook images of children, minors, aged 5, 7, and 8 years old that are then slapped across their chat boards as nothing but pawns,
That’s a threat. Everyone should be aware of this. He is subtly suggesting that we are the ones violating children’s rights and he is connected to people that can make life miserable for people attempting to gather information.
Anyway, it’s ridiculous he would bring that up but then not elaborate on the dynamic of his relationship to said minors, especially considering he has no children of his own. There are genuine questions and concerns about his connections to these kids and we want them answered. If there is nothing wrong then that is absolutely what everyone wants, but we do want our legitimate questions answered.
And how are we the ones who are sick for citing pictures of minors from his fucking Instagram??? Seriously he’s basically saying “yeah I posted those photos, but you used them as evidence you sick fucks”. What kind of logic is that?
Kids in the restaurant are completely safe, none of these people are going there, they’re cowards
Like many other points in this article, he only attacks us and doesn’t defend himself. Can he explain the creepy pics on his Instagram account? And he acts like he is more worried about how ‘dangerous’ and 'filthy’ we are as opposed to what this is doing for his business. Who calls someone accusing another of pedophilia the filthy one? We are concerned about the safety of children and he calls us filthy?
Seriously, this just makes him even more suspicious. This is not the reaction of someone who is innocent. This is a classic guilty reaction. Being accused of pedophilia is basically the worst thing anyone could ever accuse you of, like ever. Any sane person would be scrambling to clear their name from any association with the word. And yet he’s too busy insulting those who are bringing very serious and substantiated allegations to the table and somehow.. forgets to address this part at all? His response seals it for me.
Can he explain why his 'children friendly’ establishment has connections to so many sexualized performances and social media accounts? Why the password protected page on his website? Why does he have so many pictures of Caris on his instagram when he’s not even related to her, and why was she taped to a fucking table in the backroom of his business? Honestly if he can answer just those last two questions I would be willing to drop this.
Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m all for innocent until proven guilty, and if this is in fact nothing I’m terribly, terribly sorry any of this even happened, but Alefantis still should be defending himself instead of shifting blame and making us out to be bad guys. The fact that he’s not and that he hasn’t even denied any such accusation seems to be quite suspicious.

       The comments are so "real" too. I know there were tons of shillary bots on reddit posting three sentence comments. These are paragraphs from different accounts with different writing styles at varying times of day. I'm really afraid that if the Trump administration doesn't "drain the swamp", we will have a new day and age of the salem witch trials. Someone is going to go to that pizza shop and burn it down, if the FBI doesnt atleast pretend to investigate.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This wouldn’t at all be like the salem witch trials, so you shouldn’t liken what would happen today to that at all because back then, citizens were burning people simply because the person didn’t comport themselves like everyone else, didn’t go to Catholic or Mormon or whatever kind of church like all the other “god fearing citizens” (psh), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, these are people who in point of fact are not only in the highest positions of political power and influence, are not only people that the citizens voted into public office as a result of believing their patented lies, but they’re people that, along with being crooks and liars to the citizenry, are actually raping and killing
       <em>
        children
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       That is about as FAAAR from accusing an innocent citizen of being a “witch” and subsequently burning them as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of these facts, I’d say that “draining of the swamp” is absolutely nothing that you or anyone else should be afraid of.
      </p>
      <p>
       If “draining the swamp” means getting out all the child abuse and criminality from this world, then God dammit I’m 100% all for it.  Sign me the fuck up.  It is, in fact, something that we should all fully
       <em>
        embrace
       </em>
       .  It’s a
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       thing.  That’s not a “witch hunt” at all.
      </p>

      <p>
       Na.  As has been amply indicated by the investigations going on in this very sub alone, the inquiries and in depth citizen journalism that have been taking place have been a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       more civil and intelligent than anything otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are stepping up to the plate and are for the most part being very intelligent about getting to the bottom of what’s really going on - and they’re not doing it so that everyone can then go on some “salem witch hunt”.  No.  It’s so that the proper criminals can be brought to justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if certain people
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       get proven to be criminals and they
       <em>
        don’t
       </em>
       get brought to justice? then I would say that stringing them up and publicly executing them would absolutely NOT be anything like the salem witch trials because in this case, the public executions would actually be entirely warranted and called for.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s not a salem witch hunt.  That’s culling evil and criminality from a society - which is what you
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to do in order to improve the world you live in.

       Out of curiosity I refreshed one of my comments over and over for about 10 minutes recently, and each time the votes went up or down by 1-2 points, every second with each page refresh. Then I'd rapidly open the page in other tabs, and the vote count was changed in each tab. Possibly a lot of traffic from people who view but don't participate, I guess. Although I admit I find it humorous to imagine a couple people who keep clicking between up and down and going OMG I CANT DECIDE.

       Another thing that really chaps my fuckin khakis is the fact that, yeah, this could all be labeled as a "conspiracy theory" but since that has such a negative connotation, people are throwing us in the looney bin instead of actually hearing this shit out.
