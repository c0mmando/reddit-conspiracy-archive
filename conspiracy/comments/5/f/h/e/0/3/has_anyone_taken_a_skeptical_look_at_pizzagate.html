    <div class="md"><p>This is probably the best summary in favor of taking pizzagate seriously from a skeptical POV: <a href="http://archive.is/MrsGu">http://archive.is/MrsGu</a></p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen a really good &#39;takedown&#39; of the theory. Check out the NYT or Snopes articles on the subject. They barely even scratch the surface and deliberately represent the case for pizzagate in an exaggerated or distorted way. The original pizzagate sub had an excellent post dissecting the NYT piece bit-by-bit--I think it can still be found on the voat sub.</p>

<p>Edit: Keep in mind, as a &#39;crowd-sourced&#39; investigation, there is bound to be contributions of various quality. Some of the connections that have been proposed are not really plausible, but other contributors usually call out the weak links for what they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be operating with a different view of what constitutes &#39;skeptical&#39;. It does not necessarily mean &#39;firmly against&#39; a proposition, but rather examining it carefully and not accepting it without evidence. The summary I posted is very cautious about not drawing too firm a conclusion from the mostly circumstantial, inconclusive, and yet provocative evidence, but because it doesn&#39;t draw a firm conclusion, yes, I would say it qualifies as what I said it is &quot;taking pizzagate seriously from a skeptical POV&quot;. I did provide links that <em>are</em> against as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I don&#39;t buy most of the pasta stuff. Podesta is food snob and chef, so he is bound to talk about food, especially Italian food a lot (excluding pizza, which isn&#39;t actually Italian).</p>

<p>People get all bent out of shape over three month old pasta, but really... dried pasta keeps really well. I don&#39;t see what the issue is with gifting pasta for Christmas and eating it a few months later.</p>

<p>Now the pool party and a lot of pizza talk really does seem &quot;odd&quot; at best. Once you add all the creepy images, videos, and social media comments, it go way beyond &quot;odd&quot;. At this stage, I&#39;m totally convinced they are part of a child sacrificing pedo cult. If only because the investigation has already flushed out not one, but two actual pedo hives from social media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, you&#39;re a paleo person.  LOL.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that the &quot;dominos on cheese or on pasta&quot; is satanic, pedophilic, or connected to a Pizzeria.  That&#39;s your strawman argument.</p>

<p>I am saying, and I believe an intelligent person would agree, that &quot;pasta&quot; and &quot;cheese&quot; are definitely codewords for something.  Personally, I think they are codewords for drugs, not sex acts -- although &quot;dominos&quot; could more likely be a codeword for a sex act or scenario.</p>

<p>As for people thinking there is such a thing as carb addiction, there is, but not in the way that paleo believers represent it.  To believe that an ancient diet was low in carbs is really dumb.  Carbs are cheap and meat is expensive.</p>

<p>The diets humans evolved in vary based on location, but what they have in common is no refined sugar.  There is plenty of carb to be found in potatos, carrots, random fruits, the things people actually ate.  Don&#39;t forget milk, which is also full of carbs, some even in the form simple sugars.  (disaccharaide lactose)</p>

<p>That said, the concept of returning to an ancient, and therefore impoverished, diet is stupid.  The modern fad of pretending the ancient diet was a ketosis-inducing Atkins-like diet is just ten times worse.  It combines the stupid motivation of eating an ancient impoverished diet with a misrepresentation of what that diet would be, generating:  Ketosis addiction.  The whole purpose of the pretense paleo diet is to create Ketosis and Ketosis-clouded thinking, which is good for selling books, because the Ketosis addicts go on and fucking on about their supposedly awesome paleo diet.</p>

<p>Rather than Paleo people avoiding &quot;carb addiction&quot; what&#39;s really happening is they are giving themselves Ketosis addiction, then rabidly talk about how great it is like any addict, and blithely suffer the negative health consequences of constant Ketosis.  (Liver failure and early death.)</p>

<p>If you are actually interested in why people are connecting this whole scandal with satanic pedophilic rituals, you will have to connect a lot more than just one dot.</p>

<p>By the way, if there&#39;s one thing dumber than Ketosis as a diet, it&#39;s Rhabdo for exercise.  The people who go in for this stuff are not people to ask for advice on anything scientific, health-related, or even just common sense or basic intelligence.  These are the kind of people who read a sentence that asks whether it&#39;s better to &quot;play dominos on cheese, or on pizza,&quot; and suppose that could possibly be a normal thing that a normal person would say.</p>

<p>So, I grant you your original point, that one sentence out of context could be written by someone who follows these dumb ideas.  In the context of all the other talk about eating pasta and risotto, it definitely should not be interpreted as having anything to do with paleo, or any other dumb thing.  If there&#39;s one thing those people are clearly not interested in, it would be paleo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stopped reading after &quot;Oh, you&#39;re a paleo person. LOL. I&#39;m not saying that the &quot;dominos on cheese or on pasta&quot; is satanic, pedophilic, or connected to a Pizzeria. That&#39;s your strawman argument.&quot;</p>

<p>Starts with fallacy, ends with fallacy.</p>

<p>Your words --&gt; &quot;Did you see the email to Podesta asking whether dominos is better played &quot;on cheese&quot; or &quot;on pasta?&quot; That makes no sense if you take the words literally. I wouldn&#39;t say it makes no sense read literally as I&#39;ve heard food talked about that way before in 100% innocent contexts. But what stands out to me is the &quot;cheese&quot; reference. <strong>Who eats just cheese?</strong>&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Yeah who eats just cheese?</strong> That&#39;s rational to ask! Maybe on some sub /food or something.</p>

<p>Maybe if you read the other previous emails, you&#39;d figure out there was imported cheese given as a gift to that dude. All the topics make sense, there&#39;s no &#39;weird&#39; code unless you want to convince yourself it&#39;s one. Those things can be a red flag if you want, but they are no proofs, no evidences. Even the codewords are no proofs.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;m not here to be converted to a SPW and that&#39;s not how intellectually honest research work. The more you&#39;ll debunk stuff about that pizza hysteria, the more you&#39;ll get to the truth without being distracted by all the liars, larpers, morons, spammers, narcissists, etc.</p>

<p>I brought you another perspective, but you seem too much in denial to simply go check on paelo forums and see for yourself how these guys talk... and that maybe it&#39;s a possibility. <strong>Why are you debating about the value of a diet now? We don&#39;t care. It&#39;s irrelevant!</strong> ...phew.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well at least you admit you stopped reading.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one who brought up Satanism and pedophilia as if this one quote is the smoking gun for everything.</p>

<p>Yes, people eat cheese by itself.  Playing dominos takes about six square feet.  People do not eat enough cheese to cover six square feet.  They might eat a cheese slice, or a cheese stick or three, but they do not eat pounds and pounds of cheese in one sitting.</p>

<p>In reference to what I originally commented, people do not eat just cheese, unless they are having a snack, or a cheese party.  The choice presented in the email is &quot;on pasta or on cheese.&quot;  Pasta is a meal, not usually a snack.  That puts the cheese-eating in this example in a context (i.e. a meal) where people do not, in fact, eat just cheese.</p>

<p>Regardless don&#39;t avoid what&#39;s weirdest about that email.  Not that people play dominos.  Not that people eat cheese, or pasta.  What&#39;s strange is that people do not play dominos &quot;on&quot; cheese or &quot;on&quot; pasta.  The dominos would get all dirty.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is, people had figured out that pizza was some sort of codeword prior to noticing the &quot;on pasta&quot; and &quot;on cheese&quot; sentence.  That email really proves that they are a code of some sort.</p>

<p>What do people use codewords for and say they do things &quot;on?&quot;  Drugs.  </p>

<p>The sentence could mean, &quot;Is it better to hack the internet on weed or on coke?&quot;  It could mean any mad lib of &quot;Is it better to &lt;activity&gt; on &lt;drug.1&gt; or on &lt;drug.2&gt;?&quot;</p>

<p>What it cannot be construed as is a sentence about playing dominos on cheese.  That&#39;s a little silly.  By the way, it&#39;s not irrelevant that the word &quot;on&quot; appears twice and makes no sense either time.  Once could be a typo.</p>

<p>As for pizzagate, my personal opinion is that it&#39;s probably a stovepipe operation planned around that code.  Comet pizza is so weird and full of pedophilia references that I could imagine people like Podesta designing a code that would likely lead to that as a dead end.</p>

<p>On pasta = on drug for some paleo peeps, that&#39;s something they would say. You keep defending your point without honestly having checked yourself.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s supposed the guy really meant &quot;playing domino on a little boy/girl&quot;. </p>

<p>Does that make any more sense? How do you play domino on a boy or a girl? Now domino must mean something else right? </p>

<p>Do you see how the whole domino-pasta-cheese is very weak? You could distort pretty much anything and make it &quot;pedo-talk&quot; with that reasoning. </p>

<p>You need at least 2-3 unreliable code references posted by annon people for that theory to work. If you accept &#39;pasta&#39; is a code for pedo, you need to also accept it can be a code for something else or it&#39;s just pasta. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter what you think of vegan or paleo or carrot diets. Those guys exist and have their code words too like pretty much any group or even little BFF in high school, just saying.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t see me as an enemy. I&#39;m not saying your theory is entirely wrong or false, I&#39;m saying you are intellectually dishonest if you can&#39;t even go verify the debunk objectively. A real theorist looks at both sides, especially the debunks (because the debunks can be debunked too).</p>

<p>PS: <strong>I don&#39;t think your constant &quot;attacks&quot; on me respect the rules of this sub.</strong> I have never promoted the diet here or even said I was following it; all I said is to look at the possibility the Sandler is talking like a paleo person.  </p>

<p>You are trying to attack me personally because you are upset your claims don&#39;t make any sense and you don&#39;t get validated. I understand. You wrote more against a diet in this post than your freaking point about pizzag8. That says a lot.</p>

<p><strong>So you go on using ad hominem and pretending to know everything about nutrition/biology and how keto is a conspiracy you can &quot;save&quot; ignorant people from... right after pushing the most freaking dumb pizza conspiracy of the century.</strong> All this on the conspiracy sub -- thumbs up --</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My other reply to you grew way too long, over 10k characters I spent on you, so here&#39;s some more, person who is trying to be my enemy, but doesn&#39;t have to be:</p>

<p>How long have you been following this?</p>

<p>Are you aware of the claims Steve Pieczenik made in his 2:44 video regarding the contents of Anthony Weiner&#39;s laptop?  Has Steve Pieczenik retracted those statements?  What is his history?</p>

<p>Did Eric Prince of Academi really make the same claims about the contents of the laptop?</p>

<p>Those are the statements that got people looking for pedophilia in the Podesta emails.  What they found was a system of codewords, and some apparent misuses of code protocol.  They came there with the intent to find pedophilia, and they have spent too much time on forums where &quot;cheese pizza&quot; means &quot;child porn&quot;, so they assumed pizza refers to something pedophilic in the Podesta emails.  Something led them to Comet Pizza, which had a pedophile logo in its business logo, and they assumed it was the owner&#39;s intent to communicate a pedophilic message, etc.</p>

<p>My contention is that there was something going on with the use of codewords, and that is what we should spend more time on than Comet Pizza.  I also note that Wikileaks only gave positive feedback on one avenue of research that happened here on reddit, and people seem to have totally forgotten about that avenue: the Haiti incident.  There haven&#39;t been any pro-pizzagate comments from wikileaks.  Those people are great cryptologists (many former cypherpunks and co-developers of rubber-hose cryptography), and I am personally confident that some of them are surely experienced drugs users, so I would assume they feel the same way about the codewords that I do: in no way are they clearly related to pedophilia.  At most, some of the codewords probably describe activities, that is, they represent a verb of some sort.  There are so many verbs that it could be anything.</p>

<p>I confess I haven&#39;t looked into this much at all.  I&#39;ve looked up corroborating emails to make sure I am not being stovepiped on primary sources like the Podesta email.  But, as an example, I have not looked into all the uses of &quot;playing dominos&quot; in the context of an activity it would describe that goes well with drugs.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t really care because that sort of analysis is good for providing leads and corroborating information, but useless for confirming any facts.</p>

<p>At this point, I don&#39;t really need convincing of the worldwide elite pedophile network, I think I stopped needing convincing of that when I read how the DoJ settled Epstein&#39;s criminal case, in which they granted bizarrely extensive immunity that is probably illegal because it extends to acts unknown at the time the immunity was granted, and I read about that years ago.</p>

<p>So, nobody needs to convince me there is some sort of pedophile thing happening in government, we can surmise that from many years of history involving people who are convicted pedophiles and their interactions with governments and former government officials.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t need pizzagate to know there is this other, better thing people could gather facts on.  And I also don&#39;t care if some random scrubs that run a pizza place are doing anything.  I care about getting to the truth on lots of things that governments are doing, and the elite pedophile ring is centrally important.</p>

<p>The reason the CIA ran whorehouses out of the Presidio command was because they had so much success blackmailing people with it.  In a not directly-connected example, the break-ins at watergate were about sexual blackmail over prostitute usage.  The USG, and especially the political parties which comprise a portion of it, have been all about sexual blackmail for decades, and there are plenty of documented occasions  where it has temporarily come to light.</p>

<p>Obviously an elite pedophile network, if it exists, could be used to blackmail everybody involved, and such a network might be created specifically for that purpose.  We know for a fact that the CIA dispatched prostitutes to have sex with guys in front of hidden cameras so they could be blackmailed later.  It&#39;s no stretch to imagine that some agency took a page from the CIA and is doing the same thing with pedophilia.</p>

<p>There are a lot of plausible explanations (beyond the above) for how such a network would form and survive, and there is a lot of evidence that some of those explanations must be in play to explain the goings-on.  But there&#39;s no proof available, just the occasional limited revelation and weird things that are hard to explain like the Franklin incident, some other well-known incidents, Epstein and his island and jets and mastery of extrajurisdictional estates and statuses, and the way the people who are accused of being involved in this (not the pizza place) seem to be users of techniques from the intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>But what is most interesting about it is the possibility that a system that blackmails the elites explains a lot of things that otherwise seem difficult to explain, and this network would certainly serve that purpose well.  Also, this exact thing (that, in some cases, the pedophilia happens in front of cameras, for the purposes of blackmail) has been alleged by some of the more believable people who claim to have been victims.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s not suppose anything obviously stupid like that.  Let&#39;s suppose that pasta and cheese are codewords for drugs, and dominos might be a codeword for a sexual activity.</p>

<p>The obvious connections to pedophilia are (a) all their convicted pedophile friends.  With regard to Comet Pizza, there was (b) their pedophile signal logo, (c) the pedophile artwork they hang, (d) and the pedophile jokes they tell on film.  A connection with John Podesta would be that (e) he also has pedophile artwork in his place.  The connections in terms of Podesta knowing the Comet Pizza are totally established by the fact that Comet Pizza held fund raisers and John Podesta has emails about them.  They definitely know each other at least in the political realm.</p>

<p>Is it all proof of pedophilia?  No, it&#39;s not proof.  Is the Spirit Cooking video itself provably Satanic?  Yes, it is provably Satanic, whether you believe Satan is real or not.  Is John Podesta into Satanism?  Well, he actually didn&#39;t take Abramovich up on the invitation, so the most that can be said is that Satanists invite him over for Satanic rituals and he doesn&#39;t go but apparently his brother does.  What&#39;s more, it is not clear that the people involved even realize that what they are doing is Satanic.  It&#39;s possible they actually think it&#39;s performance art, even the &quot;performer.&quot;</p>

<p>I agree with you that the Pizzagate investigators have so far proven nothing, but I disagree with you in that I think they&#39;ve produced so much circumstantial evidence that their theory should be taken seriously.  In particular, the way they keep running into corroborating information means one of two things: (1) they&#39;re correct, (2) this is a stovepipe PsyOp that they fell into, and it&#39;s designed to keep confirming their hunches as they go down that rabithole.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any reasonable doubt that convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein is a pedophile.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any doubt whatsoever that Bill Clinton flew on the Lolita Express, see exhibit MM in the California civil case against Epstein.  It&#39;s certainly worth considering that exhibit MM (pilot&#39;s flight logs of Lolita Express) corroborate the claims made in the civil case that Bill Clinton participated in illicit activities while on the Lolita Express.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there&#39;s no proof of anything.  These people hang out with (convicted) pedophiles, are accused of pedophilia and the stories later corroborated by independent memorializations, have friends whose businesses have pedophilic logos and pedophilic artwork, and are invited to attend Satanic rituals.  It&#39;s all rather incriminating.</p>

<p>As for the pizza/pasta/cheese codewords, I would say I think it&#39;s very convincing that they are codewords for something.  Obviously, there is no proof that codewords are codewords unless someone tells you the code.  However, my experience in life makes me think this codeword style is typical of the type used by drug dealers and customers.  Considering the &quot;on pasta&quot; vs. &quot;on cheese&quot; sentence only strengthens that belief for me.  In particular, in my opinion, pasta is pretty obviously cocaine.  I base that on the enthusiasm and frequency with which people are talking about pasta.  As is kind of usual when trying to decode unknown transmissions, you have to look for the mistakes people made in protocol.  &quot;On pasta&quot; is a deviation from the code.  Talking about a &quot;pizza-related handkerchief&quot; is the type of non sequitor that is supposed to be avoided.</p>

<p>I do have some experience in various codes: general codes, the codes used by drug dealers, codes used by law enforcement, and codes used by intelligence operators.  Personally, I have used more than one of those types of codes, and I have broken codes from all those catagories.   I wouldn&#39;t say I have broken the Podesta code, I only have my theory.  To break a code, you have to go further and get some independent confirmations.  I would say that I am certain those words are code words.  &quot;Pizza-related handkerchief&quot; and &quot;on pasta or on cheese&quot; are not a lot of slip-ups, but they are too many for the code to stay completely hidden.</p>

<p>Speaking of not treating me as your enemy, same to you.  You treat me like a person who thinks &quot;dominos on pasta or on cheese&quot; can -- in and of itself -- connect this with Satanism and pedophilia.  I don&#39;t think that at all, and actually think the code is mostly about drugs and possibly about sex acts (dominos).  I do think there&#39;s a connection to Satanism, but the evidence for that has nothing to do with codewords.  The evidence for that is a blatantly Satanic ritual that has literal historical roots in black magic.  However, it&#39;s not clear how strong this connection is with either the codewords or the pedophilia, other than Abramovich&#39;s &quot;art&quot; in which children are depicted in strange ways being a very weak connection to pedophilic interests.</p>

<p>Comet Pizza, on the other hand, possibly had nothing to do with the Podesta emails.  It&#39;s possible they were completely set up for this.  It&#39;s even possible that they didn&#39;t design their own pedophile-sign business logo, but someone from the CIA infiltrated them and planted that so they would make a good stovepipe operation for a time like this, when the domino code is starting to come out.  But they certainly did have a well-known pedophile logo in their business logo when this news came out.  What&#39;s not certain is whether it was intentional, and, if so, whether it was the business owners&#39; intention or some outside party&#39;s.</p>

<p>As for the rest, I really could give a shit.  If you&#39;re a paleo person, you probably do feel attacked by what I wrote about paleo dorks.  I didn&#39;t write anything about you, but I certainly wrote that paleo followers are idiots who don&#39;t examine their own reasoning to see if its either factual (is paleo an ancient diet) or scientific (is Ketosis healthy).  If you consider that an attack on you, that&#39;s on you.  If you are wondering why I would want to antagonize you with regard to the stupid paleo, perhaps I think you are antagonizing with regard to your approach to both me and the pizzagate researchers, who I respectfully disagree with on many things.  I say &quot;respectfully&quot; and mean it in boldface because these people have done a lot of work and made a lot of connections.  If this is a stove pipe operation, it still shows me the ability of people to crowd-source connected information, but I am not so sure about the critical thinking here.</p>

<p>If nothing else, because this might be a stovepipe operation, they should be a lot more careful.  It&#39;s possible to pull the rug out from under their feet by turning this into provably &quot;false news&quot; at just the right time.  If that happens, further investigation into the Podesta code, in which pizza probably means a drug or might even mean actual pizza, will be discredited because Comet Pizza turned out not to be a bunch of pedophiles, just weirdos who unconsciously display pedophilic artwork in their business.  </p>

<p>The Podesta code should also be a lot more interesting to people than spirit cooking or comet pizza.  Podesta, Clinton, Epstein and that crowd are the people we should be examining very carefully, not random civilians who nobody has ever heard of.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t think the codewords in Podestas emails mean the same thing that the pizzagate followers typically think, so I would say: less interesting that I didn&#39;t listen to your enlightenment than you not listening to mine.  You&#39;re arguing against positions I don&#39;t hold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>know everything about nutrition/biology and how keto is a conspiracy you can &quot;save&quot; ignorant people from... right after pushing the most freaking dumb pizza conspiracy of the century.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think I feel like I know more about nutrition, biology, and human history than any paleo follower, you&#39;re right, I certainly feel that this would have to be the case.  If the paleo followers knew what I knew, they would stop subscribing to keto addiction.</p>

<p>As for pushing the most dumb pizza conspiracy of the century, I didn&#39;t.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s dumb, but I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s correct and I think it&#39;s possibly a dangerous stovepipe PsyOp to obscure the real activities of interest.  So I can&#39;t imagine I pushed that theory, considering I don&#39;t really agree that the codeword pizza is about pedophilia, and I am concerned that the Comet Pizza rabit hole is a trap.</p>

<p>As for not being open-minded or thinking clearly, I am so open-minded I considered the Flat Earth Theory and Eric Dubay&#39;s &quot;200 proofs&quot; video.  I admit it took me a couple of hours to remind myself that the horizon is supposed to appear level, that curve wraps around the observer.  But I did consider it.</p>

<p>As for not being a &quot;critical thinker&quot; because I don&#39;t reject the notions that (a) Podesta and his correspondents wrote in a code that involves the words &quot;pasta&quot; and &quot;cheese,&quot; (b) Comet Pizza is involved in all this somehow, (c) Spirit Cooking is Satanic, (d) John Podesta consciously enjoys Satanic ritual/black magic, (e) Anthony Weiner is a pedophile, I would have to answer as follows:</p>

<p>(a) A critical thinker would have to reject the null hypothesis here.
(b) There&#39;s no proof they&#39;re anything but weirdos with bad taste.
(c) A critical thinker would look into the fact that Abramovich did not create Spirit Cooking, that it has an origin, and what that origin is.
(d) He didn&#39;t go to the dinner, nor even really answer those emails in any way.
(e) We all know that.</p>

<p>But there hasn&#39;t been one single piece of evidence strong enough to lay charges and prosecute anyone with anything. Zip, zero, nada.</p>

<p>Yes, there are pedos out there. Plenty of evidence in the UK and we know what the Catholic Church has been up to. So it only makes sense that there&#39;s quite a few of them in other places too.</p>

<p>But, imo, Pizzagate is a house of cards. Let&#39;s say the words in the emails were referring to legal age prostitutes instead of kids. The whole theory collapses just like that. My argument also has probability on it&#39;s side. For every single pedo in politics there&#39;s probably fifty guys who like seeing prostitutes on a regular basis.</p>

<p>If you want to convince me, show me some evidence like the ones that show Clinton, Dershowitz and Prince Andrew on the flight logs of Epstein&#39;s plane. Show me testimony from a witness that says how they were abused and names some names.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I think people are just posting whatever because it&#39;s a way to get easy upvotes.</p>
