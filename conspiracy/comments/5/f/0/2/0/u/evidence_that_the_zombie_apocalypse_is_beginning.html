       Considering everything that has been revealed through the diligent researchers of Pizzagate, my brain is making connections of a different sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an older article from Anti-Media: "The Government Actually has a Zombie Apocalypse Plan — and It’s Just Been Declassified"
       <a href="http://theantimedia.org/the-government-actually-has-a-zombie-apocalypse-plan-and-its-just-been-declassified/">
        http://theantimedia.org/the-government-actually-has-a-zombie-apocalypse-plan-and-its-just-been-declassified/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the above article, it is stated that the response plan is called CONPLAN888. 
We know the elite love to code things using numerology, so what is the meaning of '888'? 
"The universal intelligence is stronger and flowing more quickly through you during the 888 power. It may be easier to manifest and create in the physical world right now. The number 888 energy is like a river connected to the universal, continuous energy, so if you allow yourself to understand it and are in a balanced state, you’ll be riding that wave to success in whatever you do."
       <a href="http://blog.spiritualparadigm.org/numerology/meaning-number-888/">
        http://blog.spiritualparadigm.org/numerology/meaning-number-888/
       </a>
       From this description, it appears that the elite are using '888' as a magical incantation in order to gain assistance from the universe as a means of ensuring they succeed in their plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 8 forms of zombies the government is preparing to do battle against, so let's discuss a few of these.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the Executive Order Obama recently signed about space weather events causing havoc in the near future, the Radiation Zombie fits this scenario.
       <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">
        https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not you want to believe that the elites practice cannibalism, a prion disease such as Kuru would cause the sufferer to become a Symbiant-Induced Zombie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not forget that a satellite recently came back online after 50 years. According to CONPLAN888, this is considered a Space Zombie.
       <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2244633/abandoned-us-satellite-starts-transmitting-after-50-years/">
        https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2244633/abandoned-us-satellite-starts-transmitting-after-50-years/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an article that calls the military zombie training operations CONOP8888
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2629064/The-Pentagons-guide-surviving-zombie-apocalypse-US-military-outlines-plans-deal-undead-chickens-space-invaders-VEGETARIANS.html">
        http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2629064/The-Pentagons-guide-surviving-zombie-apocalypse-US-military-outlines-plans-deal-undead-chickens-space-invaders-VEGETARIANS.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a little bit more about the number 8 as it also appears in another of my threads where I mention that Famous Amadeus Pizza has two locations that are both on 8th avenues.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Number 8 is the number of power and strength and symbolizes the principles of domination, control and achievement.  Number 8 is the number of 'karma', and carries within it the Universal Law of Truth that is 'cause and effect' -  'as you reap, so shall you sow.'"
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding 8888, this definition seems very self serving and, at least to me, appears to parallel Crowley's "Do as thou wilt" philosophy. 
"The 8888 number sequence may indicate that there is light at the end of the tunnel and in addition it is a message for you not to procrastinate when making your move or enjoying the fruits of your labour.  Make the choices that please you.  That is your reward."
       <a href="http://sacredscribesangelnumbers.blogspot.com/2010/08/angel-numbers-number-sequences_3111.html">
        http://sacredscribesangelnumbers.blogspot.com/2010/08/angel-numbers-number-sequences_3111.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As we're learning more and more about Pizzagate, it's been proven that the elites are involved in occult practices. What are the odds that they are trying to create an Evil Magic Zombie? Let's not forget that Jeffrey Dahmer was attempting to create such a being.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was also a thread recently on Reddit created specifically to discuss the possibility that child trafficking could be for the purpose of using the children for medical and scientific experiments and, according to CONPLAN888, the elite could be using trafficking victims to create Pathogenic Zombies, Evil Magic Zombies, Weaponized Zombies, Symbiant-Induced Zombies, or even Vegetarian Zombies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know how far-fetched all of this sounds, but those who understand predictive programming know that the shows and movies about zombies that have permeated entertainment for quite some time now could be preparing us for an event the elite have been planning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, let's delve deeper, and darker...
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a video I included in one of my threads about cannibalism. For brevity, I won't go into the people she's speaking about or the symbolism involved, but feel free to inquire about this in the comments if you're wanting to know more. 
While watching the video, please keep in mind how tunnel systems have been a recurring topic with Pizzagate research and speculation.
As far as I'm aware, this poor traumatized girl has never been seen or heard from again.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJqidKLncg&amp;t=3s">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJqidKLncg&amp;t=3s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering what the girl in the video talks about, let's remember the numerous instances of growling, cannibalistic people who have attacked and chewed/eaten their victims' faces off, yet no psychotropic drugs have been found in any of their systems. 
This was one of the first cases, and please note that the attacker was immune to pain just as it's described in CONPLAN888:
       <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article95896387.html">
        http://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article95896387.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering all of the above and what we're learning about now, what are the chances that our elite are creating zombies and keeping them in underground areas until they're ready to release them upon society? If this is indeed happening, what if we're seeing instances where one has escaped, or has been purposefully released to see how officers and the public react?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in strange times and it is seems to be even more plausible now than ever that a zombie apocalypse might just be a real thing.

       That's what they said initially, then the post mortem tests came back showing negative. If you've seen evidence that he was, you'll have to post it. I've been keeping up on the majority of these cases and I have yet to see any of the people test positive for bath salts, PCP, or anything stronger than marijuana. Even the one attack that happened most recently was reported that he didn't have any psychotropic drugs in his system.

       A handful spread out over several years. Face only bitten in one of the cases. None of the victims turned into a zombie.

       It was inconclusive, not false.

      <blockquote>

        Inconclusive investigation[edit]
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the autopsy revealed no human flesh in Eugene's stomach, a number of undigested pills were discovered that have not been identified.[20] Although police sources had speculated that the street drug "bath salts" might have been involved, preliminary toxicology reports were positive only for the presence of cannabis.[5][21] Authorities have not necessarily found the negative results conclusive; Broward Sheriff Al Lamberti has expressed a belief that some new drug not yet tested for played a role; nationally noted toxicologist Barry Logan said Eugene's behavior was consistent with "bath salts" and that toxicologists "are not testing for everything that may be out there"; and the director of toxicology at the University of Florida, Dr. Bruce Goldberger, said, "We are not incompetent...We have the tools, we have the sophistication and know-how. But the field is evolving so rapidly it is hard for us to keep track. It's almost as if it is a race we can never win."[22]

       Thanks for posting that. They always blame bath salts even though there's never any trace of it. I'm wondering if maybe these attacks are related to Scopolamine.

       You're welcome and I'm glad you appreciated it. Although, the way it's getting down voted, you'd think it was about Pizzagate. Considering the amount of info I put into it, I wouldn't think it would be getting attacked so badly, so I can only assume that this sub is getting trolled hard. On an even more frightening note, maybe it's getting down voted because I'm not so far off base...

       This is one of many apocalypses in store if it's real.
      </p>
      <p>
       First there are the delta moonkids which are a pretty scary army (look up on them),
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are the general moonkids which are still pretty scary, and many.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then i heard about a giant storage of war robots made with the black budget being kept in some underground facility.

       General and Delta moonkids? I know not what you speak of and I'm fascinated! I'll be sure to look them up. 
I am well aware of killer robots and all the research projects DARPA is involved in, which are frightening in and of themselves. Do you have a link to the info about the underground storage facility? I'd love to read about that. 
Thanks for contributing and all we can do at this point is wait and practice our double taps in the meantime!

       Meh i just supposed it is underground, i mean there's not much other way to be safe on such a black budget project.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the deltas this is the book i read on the moonkids
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/mindcontrol/mindcontrol_index.htm">

      <p>
       But i warn you it will destabilize you mentally for a while, so find solutions to cope. I used to meditate before and after and only read 10-15 pages at a time else my mind would take a hit for a couple days. The book itself seems to play the tricks it talks about on you on some level. Not for "the youngest".
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic idea of delta moonkids is a program which can be started by keyword (as all illuminati mk programs) and build an incredible amount of rage. Then the rage and bad feelings are basically convoluted into another person body and shatter his mind or organs. It's very hard to conceive even for an open minded person.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have ever withstood a very angry gaze, and felt not good, think of it like 1000x that sensation. At some level i think the "soft energies" involved just break and your mind/body start failing.
In the book it says it can be done remotely. I think they dug up oriental meditation schools to prepare this as it's the only place i found some study upon said dynamics, but wouldn't know. They probably came a lot further.

       Thanks for the link and I can certainly see this happening as we've already been introduced to this with the books &amp; movies Firestarter and Carrie, and most recently with the Netflix series Stranger Things. It appears that fiction is becoming truth faster than most will be able to process. I don't doubt for a second that the Military Industrial Complex has been experimenting for years on how to weaponize telekinesis.

       It's not gonna happen. Even if it were true zombies would only walk around for a day or two and wouldn't be able to run. Also they would only last a few hours in colder climates with snow and rain. Scientifically nothing from zombie movies ever makes sense. No way in fucking hell can people walk around with their skin rotting off along with their brain turned off for the most part. If anything we'll get a plague like disease in which a large part of the population dies, but we won't be eating each other en mass anytime soon, unless we legit run out of all of the worlds supply of food

       They can run in the begining mayyyybe, worst case is that they could run for a few hours maximum, but let's be real, you aren't going to be running at half capacity if your brain is practically dead, maybe a fast limp if anything. Also those face eaters you seen on youtube aren't zombies. They are either really fucked in the head or on bath salts/gnarly spice/some other shit. Those face eaters you're refering too don't transmit any virus's which is the whole point of zombies. They aren't dead either, which is the defining characteristic of a zombie. So if they aren't dead, and they don't infect others then they are simply fucked in the head or on some crazy shit. People have done much more fucked up shit than eating someone's face while on certain substances, doesn't qualify them as being zombies though

       While you're partially correct, the government gives zombies several descriptions as outlined in the article I linked to, and the dictionary also provides a few definitions.

       There is just a larger variety of zombies than the typical Hollywood examples. If they weaponized rabies, these victims would fit the definition as they would be unable to control themselves and not have free will.

       I believe they've already succeeded at this. As the typical Hollywood zombies just want to consume, so do the materialistic humans who are only concerned with themselves. All one has to do is look at the violence and bloodshed that happens during Black Friday. Maybe this zombie training exercise is just code for controlling and eradicating regular Americans.

       From the above article, this is each type of zombie explained in detail:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pathogenic zombies — Zombie life forms created after infection by a viral or bacterial contagion.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Radiation zombies — Zombie life forms created after infection from electromagnetic or particle radiation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Evil Magic Zombies — Zombie life forms created by occult experimentation, or “evil magic.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Space Zombies — Zombies that come from space or are created by extraterrestrial toxins (this also includes Zombie Satellites that could pose a threat to SATCOM services like DirecTV)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Weaponized Zombies — Zombie life forms engineered through bio-mechanical technology for the purposes of attacking another nation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Symbiant-Induced Zombies — Zombie life forms created after the “introduction of a symbiant life form into an otherwise healthy host.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Vegetarian Zombies — Zombie life forms that cause no threat to humans because they only eat plant life (could nevertheless “cause massive de-forestation or elimination of basic food crops essential to humans [rice, corn, soybeans])”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Chicken Zombies (yes, this is real)— Zombies that are essentially old hens that can no longer lay eggs. Farmers euthanize them with carbon monoxide and stack them in piles; however, some of the hens are still alive and crawl out. Though they ultimately die of organ failure, chicken zombies are “simply terrifying to behold” and are likely only to make people become vegetarians in protest of animal cruelty.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       From the same article: 
"Because zombies pose a threat to all ‘non-zombie’ human life (hereafter referred to as ‘humans’), USSTRATCOM will be prepared to preserve the sanctity of human life and conduct operations in support of any human population-including traditional adversaries.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        including traditional adversaries
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder who these would be. Would it depend on borders? Nationality? Skin color? Religion? Wealth? Sexual preference? Mode of thinking?
I also wonder how this consideration played out in the training.
