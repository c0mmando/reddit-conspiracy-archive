       My admittedly un-PC comment. (The Article CNN wrote was about PC culture)
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161126064858/http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/25/opinions/new-pc-should-include-white-people-mcwhorter/index.html">
        Article that the comment was written on
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The comment in question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The comment section is open on CNN?  I applaud you.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're still beating around the bush.  It is highly important to what is behind this PC culture.  It saddens me to say this but I have been a liberal for 30 years of my life.  I watched Jon Stewart and Colbert religiously.  But they weren't fully truthful.  They had topics they would literally never bring up.  That's how the left lies, by omission.  "Problem?  What problem, it doesn't exist!"  But I have recently joined the Trump train because I saw what the left has done to this country.  They say we do not want to give others equal treatment.  No, that is not correct.  We have given them equal treatment.  It has proven to be not enough apparently.  Here are some arguments you get from leftists, but we are never allowed to voice our concerns back.  Let's take the hot button issue of black criminality &amp; single motherhood.
       </p>
       <p>
        Close to 1/3rd of black men will go to prison at some point in their life time.  No, most of the criminal charges are not for possession or non-violent drug crimes.  There are a tonne of children and juveniles who have stolen cars, committed violent acts and have 35 arrests alone from the age of 14-16 and still are out on the streets.
       </p>
       <p>
        72% of black women who are mothers are single mothers.  This may happen for various reasons but what it does show is an immaturity to enter a high trust society.  Black men are always accusing their women of being cheating hos and black women throw the same insult back at them.
       </p>
       <p>
        So let's say a leftist will say, "blacks have crappy schools that's why they're doing so poorly!"  Great, well there's multiple financial experiments where we've thrown money at their schools and the grades didn't really improve a whole lot.  You can just google: The Kansas City School Experiment for one.  "White flight happens because of racism."  No, it happens because of violence.  When your store is robbed more often, your citizens beaten and harassed and threatened it's a no brainer that investment leaves.  Teachers, store clerks, business owners, everyone leaves because of black violence and a thug culture.  Thug is inappropriate to say these days so we lower our heads and use nicer words like 'youths' or 'teens'.  And nothing has changed.  Howard Stern did an interview of his growing up in a black neighbourhood, he said he got beat up all the time and his mother refused to listen to his concerns about it.  You could feel his resentment towards his mother.
       </p>
       <p>
        Right now leftists are saying mass incarceration is a problem.  Ok what's the other solution to massive violent crime waves?  What do you propose instead?  Just let criminals kill people?  You do know why that crime bill was passed in the first place, correct?  It's one of the good things Bill Clinton did in his time in office.  Chicago in the 1990's had over 4 times the violence of  2016 and this is on an upward trend for Chicago violence this year.  Bill and Hillary had to put that crime bill in because whether you like it or not her comment of super predators was real.   People were getting killed over coats and Jordan sneakers.  These young kids out protesting in the streets are the work of marxist professors who have convinced them that they are "on the right side of history."  These social science classes have went off the deep end and have irreparably harmed our society because they are pumping out kids who only see the world through the lens of race and gender.  So now, they are running platforms of "social justice."  Do you know what social justice is?  Well first there's an oppression olympics, where white CIS men are the demonized class.  After they tear them down, it will go to white women.  After they tear them down, it will be Asian men and women because they are the least 'oppressed.'  It's circular argument that goes forever, identity politics knows no end.  So what social justice says is that in order to create a more equal society, we must give special privileges to those we deem oppressed.  As if affirmative action - welfare - Section 8 Housing - EBT - and many other policies aren't already in place.
       </p>
       <p>
        This does not happen with the Asian minorities, nor the Indian (Hindu) Americans, nor other minorities.  But two minorities generally stand out and we all know which two we're talking about.  And we know which one is the big one.  So we take into account history, culture, among other factors and make excuses.  There's countless books and articles about it, but there is very little improvement, and actual regression in many places.  In one city in the USA, they are literally paying black criminals $1000 a month to not commit crime.  Just google that, it'll come up.  This is a gross perversion of our society to even begin to do that under the guise of empathy or good people.  That's not empathy, that's enslaving hard working men to pay for those who do not want to enter society.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was a deluded lefty at one point.  I laughed along with every Jon Stewart / Colbert report and thought Fox News is the devil.  Fox has literally been the best reporting for a long time now I realize.  The Rape of Cologne woke me up.  You've gone too far with your insanity and we are not allowed to criticize it.  The crime rate of Germany increased 40% this year.  It actually increased way more than that, that's the number they are saying.  But we who have followed all this mass migration nonsense have known about police suppressing the crime numbers and doing 'catch and release.'  But nothing will erase the fact that 2000+ Arab men sexually assaulted 2000+ women that night across Europe.  2000 men, in one night.  How many men had come to Europe at that point?  600,000 total?  2000 in a SINGLE NIGHT out of 600,000 is massive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Screw you PC culture for not allowing me to voice my anger at this.  Screw you for banning me and shadowbanning me every single time I've been outraged at injustices happening to my neighbours and myself.  Screw you for forcing the good men of this country to work harder and pay for the bad men of this country.  Screw you for attempting to pervert the constitution and the values of western civilization.  I do not forgive you, and I will never forget.  To Jon Stewart and Colbert my idols of the past, get lost.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even in this article CNN still alludes to the problem that they have helped create.  You're still pushing a false narrative CNN.  We know the truth.  We can't go back to unknowing it.

       There's a guy named Colin Flaherty who documents it.  When is the last time you heard a news story about 10, 20, 50, 100, 200+ teens running through town destroying it and beating people on the front page of CNN or NBC or MSNBC or even FOX?
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now police officers - 911 operators - and communities voices are being suppressed on this issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guys youtube channel has been deleted twice now.  Colin Flaherty.  For exposing the media and how they selectively edit or outright lie about a story.
       <br/>
       What black mob violence sounds like.  I'm not sure if he's allowed to show it anymore because his channel keeps getting pulled.  There was one particularly damning video of a group of about 12-15 men stomping on a white guy on the ground for about 5 minutes.. just taking turns stomping on him until his GF ran out of the house.

      <p>
       So we're living in a society where we can't complain about things that are happening that are really wrong?  We can no longer voice our frustrations at the challenges of multiculturalism?

       There are flaws in your logic.  You take a statistic, and apply your reasoning to it, such as
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Close to 1/3rd of black men will go to prison at some point in their life time...
There are a tonne of children and juveniles who have stolen cars, committed violent acts and have 35 arrests alone from the age of 14-16 and still are out on the streets.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Where do you get these numbers?  The bigger issue that I see throughout your statements is that much of your conclusions are based on pigeonholing an entire group of people into an easily classifiable stereotype.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is affecting your entire view of people in general.  There are good and bad among us all...some may be a genetic predisposition, which can be overridden by environmental factors in either direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even as an old 30 year 'liberal', didn't you hate being classified with the group mentality?  Did every one of your views align with the general consensus of a 'liberal'?
      </p>
      <p>
       News on the 'left' or the 'right' will always be biased when viewed from a new viewpoint.  It are these biases and pigeonholing that help create divides between people, by creating a sense of fear and mistrust of the 'others', when 'all men are created equal' and are subject to the same fears and mistrusts.  Grasping on to this fear-based mentality will only further divide us as a people.

       It depends what number you go by.  Hillary / Bernie put the number at 28-31% or so.  I'm going to throw a lot of numbers at you but the point is that in every single country in the world there is an, "African youth crime concern."  And the censorship that goes along with it where you can no longer bring "disturbing facts" to light is slowly creating a 1984 society.  News corporations removing comments sections, countries no longer showing crime by race etc.  Bans - shadowbans - algorithm changes on websites like facebook so that you see different things depending on your bubble etc.  I don't have proof of this at the moment but I swear there has been at least 4 times where I'm on two different facebook accounts, and I saw entirely different comments sections for the same story on CNN etc.  I'm sure someone else has noticed this before.

       Black crime statistics are being hid and suppressed across countries to lessen racism across the west.  Places like France no longer take crime statistics by race, however a study of their prisons will show things like 70% of their prisoners are Muslim.  And a large % of those are coloured etc.

       So it's not fear of the other.  There is a perpetuation of welfare - crime - single motherhood that goes along with the black communities in every country they are in.  Which is why Merkels migrant crisis has me so miffed.

       There is, as I see it, an inherent problem with statistics such as these.  If a population sees a particular people as committing more crimes, it affects policies and policing (such as stop and frisk policy in NYC), which will increase the rates that particular groups of people are registered under such statistics.

       I'm not saying there is not a problem with the african-american community, but I am saying it is largely environmental.  With media representation of 'Thug' life as being opulent in both movies and music, this can influence poor youth who typically watch/listen to this type of media and can influence their decision-making from a young age.  Compiled with the fact that once incarcerated, a person is subsequently treated less than human, and may have part of their freedoms removed after incarceration, leave people to feel disenfranchised and desperate, which creates the vicious cycle of repeat incarceration, exacerbated by the three strikes ruling.

       JFC, I just realized that shows such as Criminal Minds intentionally portray all the serial killers in their storylines exclusively as white, and that's yet another form of brainwashing. I watched a bunch of these procedural shows and I can't remember a single black or non-white killer. Fucking hell...

       Talk about censorship, if one tries to go against the new popular narrative you've presented here, they get downvoted into oblivion.  This is how it starts.

       You see this line of reasoning time and time again and the story never changes. People love to massage and manipulate statistics to support their bias and in this case fear-monger.
