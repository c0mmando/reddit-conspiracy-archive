One of the mods of conspiracy (<a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a>) was part of that takeover.  Have a look at the <a href="https://ceddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/about/log">modlogs</a> - they are quite busy shadowbanning people - seemingly only those who keep pushing for proof of life.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand some people don&#39;t like the way the wikileaks sub is being mod&#39;d.  There are lots of ways to discuss that in many places.  Do you think r/conspiracy is the right place?  Has this person you named done some activities that upset you in r/conspiracy...the sub you posted this in?  Are you simply going to imply the named user is part of a conspiracy and provide no evidence whatsoever?</p>

<p>I say put some effort in before you call people out. Have some proof and provide it, don&#39;t say dig through all the modlogs. That&#39;s not providing a damn thing.  If you insult others and fail to prove it then people likely will remember you and treat your opinions differently, engage in discussions with you differently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> or Wikileaks or Assange, or anything to do with them is compromised, there needs to be a place to discuss the leaks themselves. The situation over there is out of control with speculation about this stuff. There are already plenty of subreddits to discuss conspiracies/speculation about this. Think of it as some sort of game theory. If it&#39;s all compromised, the worst case scenario is that everyone looks like fools for digging into fake info. If it&#39;s not compromised then we have much more to lose by ignoring the info and instead spend time speculating. Also consider the pour-over of the_donald people who buy into any theory that suits their purpose. They use/lose Wikileaks depending on if it helps them. At the end of the day, <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> needs to be a place to discuss the leaks themselves, and so much counterproductive speculation is going on that the mods have little choice but to take drastic measures to clear the path for leak digging. </p>

<p>Except you weren&#39;t/aren&#39;t allowed to ask questions or voice concerns (without being called a concern troll or having your comment deleted). They claimed CTR was infiltrating the sub (in order to discredit anyone with legitimate questions/concerns) without proof. But you&#39;d better have proof he&#39;s dead if you want to even question anything about the situation. First they said you aren&#39;t allowed to make threads about Julian (even though the subreddit rules said the sub is about questions and news related to Wikileaks AND Julian), and now they are saying you can&#39;t comment about his whereabouts unless you have proof. Asking questions gets you banned and silenced. They don&#39;t have to prove he&#39;s alive to push a narrative, but you have to prove he&#39;s dead to even question their actions.</p>

<p>When it first started there wasn&#39;t a thread, and threads are not allowed to be made. Mods are making threads that are unrelated to the subs rules, while removing users comments and posts for following them. The subreddit&#39;s rules have been &quot;questions and news about Wikileaks AND it&#39;s founder Julian Assange&quot;. &quot;Bringing something new to the table&quot; has nothing to do with this. Questioning mod&#39;s actions, proof of life, and events related to Wikileaks isn&#39;t something you quarantine to a single thread. They aren&#39;t quarantining discussing of specific leaks to single threads. There&#39;s an agenda being pushed, and it&#39;s: don&#39;t ask questions unless you have proof he&#39;s dead. It&#39;s a fucking ridiculous position to take because it leaves no room for discussion or speculation. That&#39;s now their excuse for removing discussion or questions. You&#39;re just repeating the same exact thing they are. There&#39;s no evidence he&#39;s dead, so stop asking questions. That&#39;s not how you handle a potentially serious situation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But i saw nothing wrong with what the mods did over there because I saw first hand what they were dealing with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I saw first hand what they were dealing with, and how they dealt with it. They accused anyone with questions and concerns of being CTR, and therefore felt justified in removing the conversation altogether. It&#39;s a well-known tactic: reclassify the opposition (alt-right, white supremacist, racist) so that nobody takes them seriously or allows them to voice opinions.</p>

<p>They did not dismiss anyone who was concerned or had questions off that way, even tho it was clear there was a coordinated effort to &quot;concern troll&quot;, but the mods didn&#39;t dismiss whole swathes off people like that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They did though. I watched it happen. I watched them make threads dedicated to dismissing any concern as &quot;concern-trolling&#39;. I watched them make threads telling the sub that the people asking questions and raising concerns are CTR without giving proof. </p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/58vthk/rip_rwikileaks/d93negq/?context=3&amp;amp;st=iw09x9hx&amp;amp;sh=1cf46f65">read my posts</a> in threads where one of the mods was doing this. But you&#39;ve already dismissed me and decided not to take me seriously, something I&#39;m accusing the mods of doing. It&#39;s a feedback loop where you don&#39;t have to put effort into understanding other people and possibly finding out you&#39;re mistaken.</p>

<p>This is the mod who banned me for asking why they were posting threads unrelated to Wikileaks/Julian. They themselves weren&#39;t following the sub rules, but banned me for doing so. In PM&#39;s they claimed they warned me multiple times and that I spammed stickies (neither were true). When I asked for proof, they shortened my ban and muted me from messaging mods for 72 hours.</p>

<p>EDIT: 
<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/58vgho/lets_clear_up_some_rumors/?st=iw0awco0&amp;amp;sh=d375dcdb">This</a> is the thread that claimed the questions and concerns about Julian were a CTR narrative. The original post is removed, but using uneddit you can see user comments quoting parts of it. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/58vgho/lets_clear_up_some_rumors/d93iewi/?st=iw0b1u3c&amp;amp;sh=82133276">Such as:</a> &quot;How is the Assange concern a CTR narrative?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but the mods never straight up called anyone who had questions or concerns a CTR shill</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that if there&#39;s no proof someone is CTR, you can accuse anyone and just ban them immediately. They might not have accused individuals directly, but they re-framed the situation as &quot;CTR/Concern trolls trying to muddy the waters&quot;. They lump everyone together under the banner of CTR/Concern troll and therefore you don&#39;t have to take them seriously.
