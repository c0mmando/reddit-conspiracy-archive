       We are in a full blown MindWar. While I open myself up to Shillfire by pointing to a document written by a Satanist (Michael Aquino), I do so to point out their modus operandi.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/mindwar-michael-aquino.pdf">
        https://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/mindwar-michael-aquino.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        MindWar is the deliberate, aggressive convincing of all participants in a war that we will win this war
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Presently, THEY control the levers of media within a highly concentrated media ownership market. Odds are, some high level members of the media are implicated in the broader scandal. Market concentration allows for a concerted effort by the mainstream media to present a unified front within the Pizza MindWar theater.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this environment, no sane journalist who wants to keep their job will come out and say "you know what, there might be something to this". Instead, they will do so tongue in cheek, or write a hit piece that is neutral-negative in tone, as in "this is probably wrong, but for this one fact".
      </p>
      <p>
       The shills are out in full force, and it helps to have the right mental framework as we battle these cognitive infiltrators with a counterinsurgency.
      </p>
      <p>
       To that end, I present some executable mental scripts as a force multiplier on the psychological battlefield. I present it fully knowing that THEY will also use these methods, and probably have more advanced tools than we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is asymmetric information warfare that has escalated into a full blown MindWar.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Counter Insurgency Scripts
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       What are scripts? Basically, it's a bunch of words that execute a logical framework sequence to accomplish a goal. In this case, the goal is to neutralize a shill, or better yet, win them over to your way of thinking. Remember: THEY want infighting, not awakening.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1. You Could Be Right. But. (Schrodinger's Cat).
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Situation: Shill presents a decent counter argument to the claims asserted. Keep in mind that the OP may be LARPing and this "Shill" is actually providing a decent sniff test for the data at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Response: You could be right. But. . . .
      </p>
      <p>
       How this works: Stating that the person could be right will disarm them. But you want to provide a seed of doubt to keep the arguement in limbo (Schroedinger's cat). Keeping arguments in a state of true/false/neither limbo also provides you with plausible deniability later on.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2. Feel Felt Found (FFF)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Situation: Shill is foaming at the mouth and attacking the proposition without providing any counter argument of their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Response: " I know how you
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       . I once
       <em>
        felt
       </em>
       the same way, I know it's crazy. But as I spent time with the data and doing my own digging, I
       <em>
        found
       </em>
       that my opinion changed from flat out against this to entertaining the possibility. Then I recalled that quote by Aristotle:
       <em>
        It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       How it Works: By generating empathy with the target, you disarm him or her. It also appeals to people who see themselves as educated and intelligent.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        3. Countering Proofers
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       A shill is demanding a very high burden of proof, otherwise your argument is invalid, and they win. These people have been conditioned by the PSYOP known as OJ's Glove (If the Glove Don't Fit, You Must Acquit!). They expect you to go all CSI on this and get DNA samples from handkerchiefs and take some finger prints off the pizza boxes, then report back here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Response: When we post evidence, we get accused of doxxing, which is one of the reasons r/pizzagate was shut down. Linking to CP will also get this subreddit shut down. If interested, data exists in now-deleted (but archived) 4chan threads, on Imgur and Pastebin. Furthermore, proof often involves images of children being raped. The way the laws are written, simply viewing them would make one a criminal. Why are you so horny to see jizzrags and cp? While your smoking gun would be nice, it would be a hot potato. Instead, we are looking at an overall pattern of improbable relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
       How This Works: Proofer Shills may be attempting to get you to link to sketchy things with the sole purpose of reporting the content. Call them out on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        4. Conspirinomics: Conspiracy as a Legitimate Branch of Economics and Law
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Situation: Shill cites Smoking Gun argument, says all evidence is circumstantial and therefore falsifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Response: Point to the branch of Economics and Law known as Antitrust and Industrial Organization, which deals with Monopolies, Collusion and actual conspiracy law. In this framework, lawyers rely on economists to spot patterns of pricing and behavioral data to gather prosecutable evidence in the absence of smoking guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       How This Works: Economics is an ontology or way of looking at the world to spot patterns based on assumptions around incentives and human behavior, and is therefore an appropriate angle for beginning to understand Conspiracy, Collusion and other issues of market power. Cheese Pizza is a commodity, and by understanding the behaviors of buyers and sellers, we examine whether or not the data support the theory.(Congratulations, you just reclaimed cognitive territory from Bigfoot and Aliens to bring this subject back into a real world mental framework).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        5. The OSINT Angle
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Situation: Shill is Info-shaming you for posting potentially personal information, such as Instagram Accounts, Facebook Profiles or property ownership records.
      </p>
      <p>
       Response: 99% of this information is available on the web, and if you know the right google search operators, anyone can find them. Using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), this is what we are able to find. If this is what we are able to find using publicly available tools, imagine what the Intel agencies have collected on all of us. If a person doesn't want the data out there, why are they posting it? If you want to see what kind of tools are available to you, check these sites out:

      </ol>
      <p>
       How this works: You are trying to pivot the concern trolling by triggering some introspection. The shill probably wouldn't want the same thing to happen to them. Give them some tools on how anyone can find anything (what I've posted), and maybe point to some resources that will allow them to tighten up their own privacy. Remember: this isn't about "winning" the argument, but waking people up to something much bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        6. Fire and Smoke
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Situation: A Shill is basically saying "All you guys have found is a bunch of circumstantial evidence with no Smoking Gun. These are innocent people. Blah Blah Blah"
      </p>
      <p>
       Response: If there's no fire, why oh why, is there so much smoke? Correlation doesn't prove causation, but it's a big hint.
      </p>
      <p>
       How this works: By jumping on the correlation/causation argument early, you can disarm this grenade. A type of Schrodinger's Cat strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        8. The Bayesian Argument
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Situation: A shill is caught in a binary true/false mental framework and they are copy/pasting each element of your argument and responding with snarky non-sequiturs of their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Response: Say that the shill is 99% right. But this is r/conspiracy, where we deal with the remaining 1% of what
       <em>
        could be
       </em>
       right. This is not about falisifiability, but degree of belief. In the Bayesian framework, we approach data with prior assumptions, and update our beliefs based on the data. Then, hit them with the Bayesian Red Pill:
       <em>
        "probability is orderly opinion, and that inference from data is nothing other than the revision of such opinion in the light of relevant new information."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       How this works: You are trying to get people to think stochastically, in terms of probability and improbability, rather than binary true/false thinking. You can only present the Bayesian Red Pill to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        9. Slamming the Overton Window
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Situation: A subreddit is being infiltrated by pedo shills who view this as an opportunity to "minister" to the normies by bringing you around to their way of thinking. They will claim that it's a mental illness, that nothing is wrong with artistic representations and will differentiate themselves from child abusers. They are trying to use their cognitive butcher knives to separate the meat of pedophilia from the bone of child abuse. Attempting the Slippery Slope argument will get you into trouble, because the population has been conditioned to view this as "progress". Instead, slam the Overton Window.
      </p>
      <p>
       Response: Cite the Overton Window and state that you feel the broader society's sensibilities dictate we have strict controls around this subject because children lack the ability for full consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       How this works: The Overton Window is a redpill for people who have been conditioned to view the slippery slope as progress. We The People do not view child abuse, torture, blackmail, cannibalism, human trafficking, money laundering and other illicit activities as acceptable. (If they fire back, do not engage - do not feed your energy to them).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        10. Elders and Heroes
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Situation: Not everyone is a shill. Lots of people are normies seeking more information, and they are citing half-baked arguments out of sheer cognitive dissonance. In order to reconcile this dissonance, they need to believe something  because if the opposite is true, their entire mental framework needs to be re-structured, and that's not an easy thing to do. (Don't want to wake up).
      </p>
      <p>
       Response: A lot of us are further down the rabbit hole than most. In this sense we are the Elders who have been redpilled. We can do our part by showing others step by step guides on how they can discover information on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's not forget the Heroes. Remember the fallen. Think of Phan_sye, eclipse_OW and 0Hour on twitter, as well as dozens of redditors and Anons on the chans who have fallen casualty in this war. We have seen the abyss, and there be dragons.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the typical Hero's Journey, and we are on it together.
      </p>

       </a>
       wrote a chapter about Michael Aquino with the basics:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         One of the names raised at the Bonacci trial was that of Michael Aquino.
         <strong>
          Aquino is the ‘High Priest’ and chief executive of the Temple of Set, an overtly satanic cult that split off from the Church of Satan in 1975.
         </strong>
         Besides tending to those duties, Aquino also has occupied his time serving as (according to an official biography once circulated by the Temple) a “Lieutenant Colonel, Military Intelligence, U.S. Army.”
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Aquino was accused in court
         </strong>
         by the mother of a victim as being a key player in The Franklin Scandal, a nationwide elite pedophile ring.
         <strong>
          Paul Bonacci himself has also positively identified Aquino
         </strong>
         as an associate of King, known to the children only as 'the Colonel.'
         <strong>
          King's personal photographer has identified Aquino
         </strong>
         as the man to whom he saw King hand over a suitcase full of cash and bonds.
        </p>
        <p>
         The photographer, Rusty Nelson, also has said that King told him that
         <strong>
          Aquino was part of the Contra guns and cocaine trafficking operation run by George Bush
         </strong>
         and another notorious Lt. Col., Oliver North.
         <strong>
          Aquino has also been linked to Offutt Air Force Base, a Strategic Air Command post near Omaha that was implicated in the investigation by the Franklin Committee.
         </strong>
         He was also claimed to have ordered the abduction of a Des Moines, Iowa paperboy.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          This was certainly not the first time that Aquino had been implicated as a key figure in large scale pedophile/child pornography rings.
         </strong>
         In July of 1988, not long before the King and Spence cases broke, the San Jose Mercury News ran a lengthy exposé on the Presidio Child Development Center run by the U.S. Army in San Francisco.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is little doubt that literally dozens of children were in fact severely abused at the center. There was irrefutable medical evidence to document that fact. Five of the children had contracted chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease; many others showed clear signs of anal and genital trauma consistent with violent penetration, which authorities chose to ignore. One mother complained to the San Francisco Chronicle that the FBI never interviewed her or her son, even after doctors had confirmed the boy’s abuse.
        </p>
        <p>
         ...
         <strong>
          One child positively identified Michael Aquino, along with his wife Lilith
         </strong>
         , known to the kids as 'Mikey' and 'Shamby,' and was also
         <strong>
          able to positively identify the Aquino's home and to describe with uncanny accuracy the distinctively satanic interior of the house.
         </strong>
         The young witness also claimed to have been photographed at the Aquinos' home.
        </p>
        <p>
         On August 14 of 1987, a search warrant was served on the Aquino house. Confiscated in the raid were numerous videotapes, photographs, photo albums, photographic negatives, cassette tapes, and name and address books. Also observed was what appeared to be a soundproof room.
         <strong>
          Neither Aquino nor his wife were charged with any crimes, nor have they been to this day – a fact that Aquino claims proves his innocence.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         In January of 1988, Aquino filed suit against the Army to have it cleared from his record that he had been investigated as a suspected pedophile. According to court records, he also had the gall to charge “Captain Adams-Thompson [the father of a victim] with conduct unbecoming an officer because the Captain reported the allegations of child abuse to the San Francisco police.”
        </p>
        <p>
         In denying Aquino's motion,
         <strong>
          the court concluded that “there was probable cause to title Aquino with offenses of indecent acts with a child, sodomy, conspiracy, kidnapping, and false swearing,” despite the fact that “the San Francisco police department (SFPD) closed its investigation and filed no charges against the plaintiff or anyone else.”
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Aquino and various of his defenders have consistently claimed that no one was ever prosecuted in the case due to a lack of evidence – proof that the entire affair was no more than a ‘witch hunt.’ Of course, the failure to prosecute the federal charges could also be due to the fact that, at the time, the U.S. Attorney in San Francisco handling the case was Joseph Russoniello.
        </p>
        <p>
         Russoniello would later be identified by reporter Gary Webb of the San Jose Mercury News as a player in the Contra cocaine smuggling operation led by Lt. Col. Oliver North and company, just as witnesses would later identify Lt. Col. Michael Aquino as an operative in the very same sordid affair. It always helps when your legal ‘adversaries’ are actually on your side.
        </p>
        <p>
         In May of 1989, Aquino was
         <strong>
          again
         </strong>
         questioned in connection with child abuse investigations;
         <strong>
          this time at least five children in three cities were making the accusations.
         </strong>
         The children had seen Aquino in newspaper and television coverage of the Presidio case and immediately recognized him as one of their abusers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Three of the children lived in Ukiah - former home of the People’s Temple - where Police Chief Fred Keplinger was overseeing the investigation of the allegations. The Mercury News
         <strong>
          quoted the police chief as saying that “the children are believable. I have no doubt in my mind that something has occurred.” Aquino was also identified by children in Santa Rosa and Fort Bragg.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         In the Fort Bragg case, “allegations of ritual abuse erupted ... in 1985 when several children at the Jubilation Day Care Center said they were sexually abused by a number of people at the day care center and at several locations away from the center, including at least two churches.” Aquino was identified as having been at one of those churches.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Mercury News also reported that there was clear evidence of satanic cult activity on the grounds of the Presidio base, including an abundance of satanic graffiti, a satanic altar, and numerous artifacts of satanic rituals. A former MP at the base is quoted as saying: “We were sitting there, we've got a cult on the Presidio of San Francisco and nobody cares about it ... We were told by the provost marshal to just forget about it.”
        </p>
        <p>
         As a final note on the Presidio case, a report in the Marin Independent Journal revealed that
         <strong>
          Aquino owned a building in Marin County ... that had been jointly leased to the Marin County Child Abuse Council and Project Care for Children.
         </strong>
         The stated purpose of Project Care was, interestingly enough, to assist parents in locating day care for their children.

       Is Aquino here, magnetically drawn to the Pizzagate topic?

       Or is Aquino a part of the staging of disinfo fed to the Pizzagaters?

      <p>
       "MindWar" is Aquino's concept, and you affirm Aquino's concepts &amp; vocabulary.  Couldn't do better if you were Aquino himself.  Not to mention your tiny disclaimer says "at the risk of Shillfire" to anyone who disagrees or calls you out on it.  Divide &amp; conquer = anyone who disagrees, you call a "Shill."

       None of those concepts presented belong to Aquino.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concepts are based on what I see as their strategy, which we all have to respond to.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, they are using Schrodinger's Cat with Assange. If he's alive, he's a threat. If he's dead he's a martyr. So their solution is to keep him in limbo and watch people argue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overton Window belongs to Overton. Schrodinger's cat belongs to Schrodinger. Conspiracy law is an existing body of literature in economics. Again, none of this was ever presented by Aquino.
      </p>

       I never called you a shill, but you self identified as one. You are pretty good at false association. Keep up the great work, and have a nice night.

       Guys this is not how any of the pizzagate argument goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can give you the outline but I'm sure you've already seen it:
       <br/>
       X: This is suspicious about pizzagate
       <br/>
       Y: Yes but have you seen it in this context which makes it not suspicious?
       <br/>
       X: You are a shill 100%
      </p>
      <p>
       You see person Y was a shill because person X didn't have a response to Ys argument, so Y must've been a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would be very interesting is in what way could anyone ever possibly present a counter argument without being accused or suspected of being a shill or a troll? I'm asking for my employer...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying really hard here to open up the community to the idea that it isn't always right but you guys don't really like being asked questions about your beliefs. It makes it so hard for me to do my job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can someone please at least once write something to the effect of "you are right I change my mind about this", I got kids to feed.
