    <div class="md"><p>At some point weren&#39;t all stickies banned from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> but then unbanned since sports fans/shows/etc use them for &quot;Episode X Discussion Thread&quot;? I can&#39;t remember but it sounds familiar.</p>

<p>But like... if there are too many posts from a particular subreddit on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, isn&#39;t that a problem? If reddit changed the <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> algorithm to only allow 3 posts per subreddit per day to hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, would that be censorship? This is an oversimplified example just to try and show exactly what core concept I&#39;m talking about, but overall I feel that the upvote system is being abused by T_D and banning stickies is a simple (but not ideal) band aid for that. You aren&#39;t supposed to upvote <em>everything</em> the same way you aren&#39;t supposed to downvote things you disagree with.</p>

<p>By all means, I haven&#39;t had much time to think about these things so if I&#39;m missing important details or something I&#39;d love to get more perspective and hope I don&#39;t come off as dismissve-- these are basically my first thoughts on the matter and I&#39;d love to learn more.</p>

<p>I would say overall that Spez has been very open about it and I think it&#39;s best to discover this comment editing potential on something as stupid as a prank born from frustration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give T_D a chance, yes alot of it is cheerleading, but at the same time you may realize there it isnt a hive of racism and bigotry people would be led to believe. Its actually the opposite, but most people just believe the hype and lies. </p>

<p>People think this last election was about the Dems vs GOP. It was more a fight against globalism and corruption. People can shit on Trump all they want, but he isn&#39;t the one constantly wrong.. I am seeing that from the media though. </p>

<p>This issue with spaz, is just more of exactly what we are fighting against. Since when does the US or companies based therein advocate repressing the opinions and conversation due to politics? Its even worse when its the president-elect, this is just more media schism to divide the country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can I see an example? I don&#39;t believe any form of this works.</p>

<p>If they wanted to, they could just edit out the signature and post something plain with that username. You&#39;d have to have people know that you sign all your comments and know your key ahead of time for that to work - then they could see an unsigned comment by you and discard it (no idea whether you posted it or admin did, but you sign your comments so not worth associating with you).</p>

<p>There&#39;s absolutely nothing you can do if the only thing people know about you is through reddit (no outside gpg key), and reddit is 100% owned and administered by a &quot;malicious&quot; party. If no one knows you or doesn&#39;t know your true gpg key, then a signature is worthless. If the only way people knew your gpg key was through reddit, then reddit admins could update all your comments and sign it with an arbitrary gpg key and post that.</p>

<p>I could see it working if you tweeted your public key, then tweeted a link to your reddit comment with the associated signature and inside the reddit comment was text with the associated signature. Then you have an outside source mirroring your activity. That <em>could</em> work, but you have to be really careful how you sign your comment (sign more than just the content of the message, like the timestamp and the parent comment text or something), and it&#39;s worth nothing if people don&#39;t actually verify the sig. And they won&#39;t be.</p>

<p>Giving out your public key isn&#39;t as big of deal a you are making it. People don&#39;t need your key the majority of the time. The majority of the time they ignore the signature. You only need the key to go back and verify.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Except that tools exist to check the signature for emails, and they are usually between private parties that know each other and would have exchanged keys before hand.</p>

<p>Until people start using tools in the form of a browser extension which sign the hash of (timestamp + submission id + username of parent + content of parent + username of commenter + content of comment) and automatically generate the blob at the bottom of comments and also look up the username&#39;s key against a third party service and validate the signature, there&#39;s not much point. It needs to be more than just signing the content of the comment. Everyone will be using their own scheme unless a program handles this, and people will screw it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah his whole post seemed less like an apology and more of him blaming r/the_donald for his own actions. He admits to doing everything and expects us to just trust him again? If you admit to shadow editing and banning, telling us does nothing but confirm our fears. And the worst part is that all the top comments said they forgave him, saying everyone is human. Seems shady to me, but guess we can only wait and see       </p>

<p>Rather than discussion, these users were interested in making people listen to them.  Tactics like stickying posts to get them to the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> are just more evidence of not being interested in having fair discussion, but rather of a more mob-like mentality that is goal-oriented but that goal does not align with the purpose of reddit, which is here for discussion and analysis.

    <div class="md"><p>yup.  some of the subreddits are here for discussion.  Like this one used to be, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not here for propaganda.  But some people don&#39;t know the difference between trying to have a discussion and regurgitating propaganda or plotting responses to perceived enemy propaganda.  I mean please.  This has just been an absolute joke of a subreddit since <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> showed up.  3 fucking pages of did you see what CTR said?  No but I sure know WTF <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> thinks about it.  How could I possibly fucking miss it?</p>

Never seen something done in such a massive scale <em>Worldwide mind u</em><br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not think Fox was pro Hillary.  I would say it was fairly clear they were not for the most part, despite some Republican dissent.  As for the media conspiracy.  I&#39;m pretty sure it was just clever use of reverse psychology.  You go out and say ridiculous things that are easily dismissed by your supporters but you know the left will go nuts over them, then when the media cannot accept or promote some of the comments ( regardless of whether or not he really means all of them), they predictably all go against him.  Then he turns the tables on them and says it&#39;s a media conspiracy.  Luckily he had his own media outlet (Bannon) to help him spread his message through social media.  Just like he had the bit of political theatre there with Cruz there at the end of the primary.  His spat with Cruz gave him credibility as an outsider.  His campaign chair had been running Cruz&#39;s campaign up until that point.  Again, he&#39;s a renegade, a truth seeker, a hero, he will go against the conspiracy of the media.  And it works because people have been running for office and not accomplishing anything because the parties are obstructionist to each other.  They have also not gotten anything done when one party controls everything either so I have very little optimism that we are about to see anything but the same old shit.  This was one of the more clever campaigns I have ever seen, but I worry about the damage in it&#39;s wake.</p>

But in Germany the Netherlands Spain , Sweden under others it was all pro Hillary ( and joke,s about pussy grabbing mostly )<br/>
But i can see what u mean whit being afraid its the same old shit might be might not be ( who knows ) whit Hillary u knew what u where getting from the start.<br/>
But the amount of pro Hillary every where was insane and ( as we know now ) way out of proportion it all seemed bought off / controlled instead of open and fair.<br/>
Like every one ( mostly every one ) was pushing a narrative.<br/>
Most the pro trump things came from ( less credential news site,s )  and not MSM * exception being fox ) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>nope but on general most topics ( especially controversial one,s ) those that u like to block.<br/>
Have no clear definitive outcome ( els it would not have such a big opposition )<br/>
So wen u block a whole sub u do not agree whit your effectively blocking half the population that has a different stand point.<br/>
Now if the subject has more then 2 view points and no clear outcome ( say religion )<br/>
U will end up blocking close to 75% of humanity  ( or 99% in case of Scientology )<br/>
.<br/>
If you have so much problems whit the opposition .<br/>
Then you have serious doubt in your own point of view<br/>
Better block it and keep the status quo then to be forced to think critical </p>
