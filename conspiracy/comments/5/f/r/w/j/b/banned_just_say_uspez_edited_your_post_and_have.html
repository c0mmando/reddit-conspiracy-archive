       or you could look into what happened.  He's a developer - he edited the freaking code to do a rewrite of content.  You and everyone that uses the web sites are at the mercy of developers.  They are smart enough to write the code and normally there isn't anyone smarter auditing it.  This situation exists on every single web site you have ever used.  He even stated he undid his edit.  You should either take him at his word or just quit reddit because he wrote the code that does everything.  He could specifically write a clause in the code that finds people with posts that state he should be banned and put a flag on the acct that hides their posts from everyone.  And you'd never fucking know.  So either have some faith in humanity that he's not lying and they put better controls in or just jerk yourself off believing that any web developer could be out to get you.  Either way at least now you know that web code isn't some sacred thing protecting you from censorship, that's the web developers.  I'd show them a little more respect if I were you.

       sorry but I call them like I see them.  This is one that everyone should have a lot more on their mind these days.  The very last line of defense for censorship really is these web developers.  That they do what they do without having edited a whole lot has been a very good thing.  It's possible that ANY site could be doing content editing.  That
       <a href="/u/spez">
        /u/spez

       was so forthcoming about it was probably a result of the fact that from his perspective he figured people would realize he'd done something and because people were trolling him he felt like a cool admin trolling them back in a godly way.  Yeah that's not a good thing to do ever.  And if you make a mistake you better realize it and own up.  The way some people are treating this is like you could sit there and bait him saying fuck him forever and he can only get mad and slip up once and then they are all over his ass.  You could bait anyone that way.  I just don't buy the outrage and think we should have more respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way.  If you let people juggle fire at your bar and it burns down, you took the risk.  He and all admins have a cost, benefit analysis to run.  It's just a matter of how much time they want to spend fending off situations like this.
