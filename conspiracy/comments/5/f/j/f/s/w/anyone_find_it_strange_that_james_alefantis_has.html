       He's had multiple interviews and confrontations... Not a word about how horrible of an act it is to trafic children for sex, or how the attacks on him belittle the real victims of these haneous acts. I dont know, if I was innocent I would certainly include how Satanic Peodophila is disgusting, and I'm ashamed, and disheartened that people want to smear my name with something so sinister. Anyone else thinking its odd that he only defends himself, and doesn't speak out on the issue?

       If I owned a public facing business and came under accusations such as these, my only thoughts would be how to shut down the allegations ASAP, with as little publicity as possible. I would also be looking to sue whoever was responsible for propagating the accusations and would likely avoid saying anything at all without running it past my lawyer.

       I believe that in these kind of situations - doesn't matter if accusations are right or wrong - addressing the crime would show somewhat of acknowledgment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic tactic that seems to be in play right now is to rather discredit the whole story, and the story, as they show it, is "harassment of some pizza joint employees based on fake news".
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've read till now, they mainly complain about threats to employees and not pedo accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It feels to me that once the pizza thing will catch fire, they will have to address it - once enough people will get exposed to the story, no reference to said accusations will become silently admitting to them.

       It's a classic strategy to avoid being cornered. It's called staying low and attempting to let the story burn up its own fuel.

       Not sure if I should do a separate post or if someone has already brought this up but was he even born with that as his real name or did he actually change it legally just so those in the know know and those that don't wouldn't have a clue of what his name actually means?

       I'm sorry but Alefantis is DAMN cordial, and unbelievably accommodating. I know people could say that pedo's are like that, but I do feel like he is being witchhunted with absolutely no concrete evidence. I think there is a massive pedophilia coverup in the government, but comet pizza is taking ALL of the heat, and quite honestly...people's evidence are that there are slightly weird instagram photos of kids and entirely innappropriate bands that pklay there..idk
