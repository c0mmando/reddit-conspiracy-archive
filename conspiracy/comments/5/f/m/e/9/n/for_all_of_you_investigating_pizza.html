       Look at this info FFS:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Routinely the kids are naked the whole time. The vans are often naked inside too, with easy to hose out features. Slavers used to use U-Haul and Ryder vans, but those companies got wind of it and basically managed to get out of it by tightening their rules on recording the driver’s licenses and credit card numbers of the renters. That was all it took, forcing their own workers to follow their policies, to force the slavers to buy their own vehicles.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         That means that their own vehicle license plate numbers are a weak point for them.
        </strong>
        If the buyers are front organizations for the bosses and the CIA, then those license plates may be “unregistered” — fakes that do not link up to a real name anywhere in the world. But the numbers still help one track the trade, just like the numbers on the rendition planes.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the van owners are free lance brothel owners — then
        <strong>
         those vehicle numbers may go to a person who the police might be willing to prosecute in the sex slave business.
        </strong>
        Like in the drug trade, the police will prosecute the free-lancers to make it look like they are doing their jobs.

       LOOK AT THIS, all verifiable information!!!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The free lancers are often fairly obvious — they are less rich and more varied in appearance both personally and in their vehicles. The rich often buy a vehicle, use it for a few months and then turn around and sell it for another purpose. The VIN numbers could be a problem for them even though the plates are false.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, almost all of the vehicles that the rich use to transport the sex slaves on land in the US are made at one plant in the US. That plant in in Atlanta, I believe. It is the only plant that make vans with holes in the bottom of an enamel type of floor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cattle do not have to be hidden in transport, so
        <strong>
         this combination of having to be hidden and having to be hosed down and needing some ventilation but good sound-proofing is almost unique in the automotive industry.

        Over 80 percent of those vehicles are bought for the slave trade originally. They are bought in lots of 100 or more by the bosses. Putting pressure on that auto manufacturer not to produce those vehicles would slow down the sex slave trade. I believe that it is
        <strong>
         Chevrolet
        </strong>
        that makes those vehicles.

       Interesting bit about "secret" code used in the industry, in that they just use a simple phrase..
      </p>
      <p>
       If one wants goods shipped off the record it goes "by the way." That is code slang for "off the record."
      </p>
      <p>
       One throws it into the shipping conversation. Suppose I at the CIA want to ship a load of goods to Iraq for “reconstruction” purposes. I call up almost any shipper in the world and say for instance, 'I want to send 17 “boxes” of construction goods, and “by the way” two bodies to look after them. Make sure they arrive safely, you know.'
      </p>
      <p>
       The shipper then knows that there will be not two people, but two box containers, each containing many girls and boys. But the usual instruction to the shipper is more like “be sure they arrive in not too bad condition” because they want a high spoilage rate, but for some of them to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way I have heard this phrased is, “deliver it ripe but not spoiled” as if one was talking about bananas. The shippers know what the bosses want — they are paid big bribes to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conversation is like an insider’s language. You have to know it and not slip up on it to place the order to move them. But it is all done plain text, not in encrypted format.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much of it is done on cell phones and is not secure at all, anyone could listen in. As soon as I send this to you it may be changed. The point is that an investigator could listen to shipping conversations for awhile and quickly figure out the system.
      </p>

       This is a harrowing account, but it is compromised by this woman's claims to be a "remote viewer". There has never been any proof that that this sort of psychic ability is possible, and it defies the laws of physics. So differentiating truth from fiction in her narrative is a very difficult task.

       One day, I was going on about my regular mundane (but perfect) life when I decided I would challenge everything I've ever believed in order to test for Truth.  Don't ask me where this idea came from, because I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I do know is that in the past two years, it has led me on an amazing exploration of consciousness.  About a year into that journey of learning about the power of the Mind, understanding what is meant by the phrase that it is all Mental, and coming to understand the true power of dreaming (awake and asleep) I woke up.  And I looked around the world and it brought me here, to this board, and I am finally starting to see behind the curtain.  And it is depressing and terrifying.  However, I am strong, stable, and I am doing what I can to fight with the Light.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this journey, I was introduced to the Monroe Institute - which is a small center in Virginia that has, for lack of a better term, become a school for remote viewing and exploring other planes of reality.  I have followed their instructions and I have done remote viewing myself.  I am not very good at it - and I didn't like what I saw.  So it isn't something I'll spend my time on, but I'll note that it is real and if you spend the next 3-6 months on it, I am sure that you will also gain the skill.  It is accessible to every human with a brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I bet if you dig into the Monroe Institute you'll see that it likely has CIA ties and who knows what else.  It was started by a former-Media mogul and I know one of the original developers of the remote viewing program is a leader at NASA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  I forgot you mentioned that it defies the law of physics.  It absolutely does not.  Quantum physics proves that the Truths are vibration, polarity, and the power of intent (see measurement of light particles).  Remote viewing takes advantage of these laws and is entirely consistent with physics.

       I'm not a believer in remote viewing or similar things, but they don't defy the laws of quantum mechanics, which I would imagine is the realm this kind of thing exists in, if it exists at all. But do you think if someone figured out how to do it that they'd tell anyone? Would the mk ultra kind of scientist publish a paper on it if it was discovered?

       They are out there telling people - but it does require dedication and effort, two things that a lot of people have been lacking for years.  This is a great book about "the secrets" (aka the methods) for remove viewing and you can own it for under $15.  Buy Joseph McMoneagle's book "Remote Viewing Secrets:  A Handbook." and/or spend some time on google exploring the "Monroe Institute".

       Under our current understanding of physics, I would agree. However, there are some interesting properties of quantum mechanics that can allow some information to be in two places at once. Since our conscience is driven by the quantum world, that could be used to explain remote viewing. Until someone tries to see if that's true, then we will never know

       Proof ? well no, Thats a grey area . Research Ingo Swan and the cia then ask your self why the government would employ him fulltime for over a year straight as a remote viewer, as well as multiple times afterwards, and had him train agents.

       My summary:  In the Podesta emails there were some odd emails talking about "Pizza" including one talking about pizza and a handkerchief.  This led the internet to discover that "pizza" is a code word for sex trade for children.  Based on my quick research, the internet does not appear to be wrong on this front.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy portion:  Podesta wasn't really talking about Pizza, but it turns out he is involved in a massive child sex slave ring, as are a lot of other high-ranking politicians and world leaders (some voluntarily, some through blackmail).  The Clinton Foundation was a funnel for this type of operation, and was instrumental in "finding" the children for the sex slave pipeline -- including in Haiti and other war-torn countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extra conspiracy:  There are the run of the mill child sex slaves that you can buy on the black market and/or use for a couple of hours, but in addition there was/is a program that does more with some of these children (sometimes called the MK Ultra program).  For the special children, they are not sold into basements in NYC, but instead are brainwashed and made into manchurian-type candidates from a very young age.  These programmed children (which includes children from the US) are then agents for the CIA.  If you go down this rabbit hole you'll be lost among various types of mind control theories and it will fuck with your sense of reality.  Are you watching WestWorld?  It is like when Bernard realizes who he really is.
