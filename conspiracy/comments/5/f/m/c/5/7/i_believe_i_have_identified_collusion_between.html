        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For the last few days I’ve been reviewing the events that lead up to the banning of r/pizzagate and noticed a few things that I thought should be shared to generate discussion and critical feedback. </p>

<h1>I. The uproar and censorship caused by the revelation of Twittergate was related to the shutdown of the Pizzagate subreddit</h1>

<p>After constructing a timeline and taking several factors into consideration, the information we know about the censorship of anti-child trafficking efforts on both Twitter and Reddit suggests possible collusion between the two corporations. We moderators at r/pizzagate received word that the admins were receiving outside pressure to close us down, and now we know who at least one of those outside sources was: Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>A. Nov 21st</strong></p>

<p>Many people on the_donald are already familiar with the timeline of “Twittergate,” which began on November 21 when Twitter user @0hour began to post the Twitter handles of thousands of accounts sharing child pornography, seeming to be comprised of individuals across the globe. News of the discovery quickly spread to /pol/ and r/pizzagate where users were investigating similar claims.  Rather than dismantle the network though, Twitter banned @0hour and left the outed accounts up:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.northcrane.com/2016/11/21/anonymous-twitter-allows-pedophile-accounts-posting-child-pornography-but-deletes-conservative-accounts/">http://www.northcrane.com/2016/11/21/anonymous-twitter-allows-pedophile-accounts-posting-child-pornography-but-deletes-conservative-accounts/</a> </p>

<p>Other users had picked up the story however, and soon there were hundreds of individuals looking into the discovery. Many of the accounts openly promoted sex with minors, using hashtags such as #legalize14:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/564070/Twittergate-massive-child-porn-ring-emerge-following-gamer-discovery-twitter">http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/564070/Twittergate-massive-child-porn-ring-emerge-following-gamer-discovery-twitter</a></p>

<p><strong>B. Nov 22nd Dorsey’s Twitter goes down amid claims of hacking</strong></p>

<p>Predictably, Twitter’s reaction of banning citizen investigators only served to throw fuel on the fire. A plethora of abuse was directed at Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and a Director at the Walt Disney Company:</p>

<p><a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/leaders/jack-dorsey/">https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/leaders/jack-dorsey/</a></p>

<p>After this abuse had gone on all night and the next day, Dorsey’s Twitter handle @jack suddenly went offline the next day. Users began to speculate about his motives for banning whistleblower accounts, digging up tweets they claimed alluded to dark subjects like spirit cooking such as this one:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/2K8yZ">http://archive.is/2K8yZ</a></p>

<p>Immediately, several news sources issued reports on the suspension, speculating that <strong>Dorsey’s Twitter had been hacked</strong>. </p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/jTDnL">http://archive.is/jTDnL</a></p>

<p><strong>C. Correlation between @jack suspension and banning of r/pizzagate</strong></p>

<p>The same day of the Jack Dorsey account closure, Reddit admins shut down the r/pizzagate subreddit where news of the unfolding “Twittergate” had been posted and spread to other parts of both Reddit and the web at large. Interestingly enough, there was a massive spam campaign of threads talking about Richard Spencer on /pol/ which knocked the major pizzagate threads there offline as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/jjHXdr.png">https://i.sli.mg/jjHXdr.png</a></p>

<p>The reason for the closure was that “personally identifiably information” was being “continually” released even though the admins refused to give specific examples of the supposed infractions.  </p>

<p>What was interesting about the pizzagate closure was the rhetoric about “doxxing” and “harassment” being used to justify the censorship on Reddit very closely mirrored early reports of “hacking” and harassment that were thrown about in relation to the @jack suspension.  In fact, if you look at the leaked chat log between Reddit CEO Steve Huffman and top mods from Reddit, you can see them using these arguments as an excuse to shut down r/the_donald: </p>

<p>False claims of doxxing then refusing to back them up:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/rOBMzw.png">https://i.sli.mg/rOBMzw.png</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/jfIRFk.png">https://i.sli.mg/jfIRFk.png</a></p>

<p>False claims of real life harassment from the same mod who refused to back up her “doxxing” claims:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/86rhDi.png">https://i.sli.mg/86rhDi.png</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/7z3Xug.png">https://i.sli.mg/7z3Xug.png</a></p>

<p>Additional claims of hate spamming, <strong>notice how in the second screenshot they mention Twitter</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/OYX8vq.png">https://i.sli.mg/OYX8vq.png</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/mYgoW3.png">https://i.sli.mg/mYgoW3.png</a></p>

<p>Some demanded that our godly mods be replaced with others more “responsible,” Huffman promised to chat this week about it and revealed a plan is in the works:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/DsMzWf.png">https://i.sli.mg/DsMzWf.png</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/VfgTHg.png">https://i.sli.mg/VfgTHg.png</a></p>

<p>A key part of this “plan” is obviously to compile a list of fake “harassment” to justify a ban. Notice how Huffman asks people to start reporting “leaking.” We’ve seen this in the real world this week when Soros justified dumping more money into stopping Trump by mentioning “hate crimes” which his affiliated groups are actually responsible for:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/xFgLWl.png">https://i.sli.mg/xFgLWl.png</a></p>

<p>The false claims of harassment have also appeared hit pieces on pizzagate run by the “reputable” press:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/23/fearing-yet-another-witch-hunt-reddit-bans-pizzagate/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/23/fearing-yet-another-witch-hunt-reddit-bans-pizzagate/</a></p>

<p>It is very significant that the admins mention that they are cataloguing examples of our “hateful harassment” because this week we discovered that Huffman/spez can edit the posts of others, showing how easy it would be to create a narrative of false “hate” harassment:</p>

<p>The infamous post showing Huffman edited comments on the_donald:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/mTrKg">http://archive.is/mTrKg</a></p>

<p>And proof that he was doing it as many as seven years ago:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090916235829/http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9ikfb/reddit_has_some_shiny_new_interface_changes_but">https://web.archive.org/web/20090916235829/http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9ikfb/reddit_has_some_shiny_new_interface_changes_but</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/rszRy">http://archive.is/rszRy</a></p>

<p>We also discovered muted usernames on r/pizzagate had been unmuted early to allow them to continue acting as agent provocateurs by releasing PII:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/MBjBSq.png">https://i.sli.mg/MBjBSq.png</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/qTnvgn.png">https://i.sli.mg/qTnvgn.png</a></p>

<p>That same evening, Dorsey’s Twitter came back online <strong>around the same time that the mod chat log leaked</strong> with a massively reduced follower count. It is not clear whether or not any tweets were removed from the account during the time it was offline:</p>

<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-suspended-on-twitter-1789289820">http://gizmodo.com/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-suspended-on-twitter-1789289820</a></p>

<p>Twitter responded to queries about the closure with the claim that Dorsey’s Twitter was suspended by accident. Despite the fact that the suspension occurred in the middle of an online frenzy caused by the revelation of pro-pedophile accounts and the banning of whistleblowers who alerted the public. <strong>Notice how they brought @jack’s Twitter back online and gave the excuse of an accident after the mod chat log leaked here</strong>. Did that leak inadvertently prevent a false flag effort?</p>

<p>The reason that the chat logs have been censored so heavily on Reddit now seems clear: they not only revealed an active plan to either ban the_donald or replace our moderators, they also showed clear parallels between the language being used to justify their actions against us and the rhetoric that was being used to justify shutting down the_donald. With the leak of the chat logs these plans were ruined as we had seen their playbook. Now they’re making efforts to clean the whole thing up in the hopes that no one would put two and two together.</p>

<p>II. Personal incentive Reddit and Twitter corporate figures have to censor Pizzagate</p>

<p>It seems that members of the Reddit and Twitter corporate team have some personal incentive to derail movements getting people interested in topics like pizzagate, spirit cooking and other similar stories which have been growing in popularity since election day.</p>

<p><strong>A. Steve Huffman</strong></p>

<p>Over at Reddit, our beloved spez has been involved with some very odd stuff in addition to allowing certain forums to exist which some might find questionable. First of all, spez is the only moderator at r/cannibals:</p>

<p><a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.reddit.com/r/cannibals">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.reddit.com/r/cannibals</a></p>

<p>He also mentioned it in his introductory AMA when he took over as CEO:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/gvQ6Z">http://archive.is/gvQ6Z</a></p>

<p>r/cannibals has been set to private so it’s impossible to know what it contains. What is this subreddit, and why is Huffman the sole moderator?</p>

<p>In an additional discovery, users noticed that the r/cannibals subreddit was created by Reddit user u/FuzzyNavel. There is speculation that this account is used by Huffman as an alternate:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/3cy87i/notice_our_new_ceo_is_a_cannibal/">https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/3cy87i/notice_our_new_ceo_is_a_cannibal/</a></p>

<p>Early investigations of the sub noted that FuzzyNavel had made a post alluding to consuming human flesh:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/pTV32R.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/pTV32R.jpg</a></p>

<p>Now that r/cannibals is set to private, it is impossible to verify this however.</p>

<p>Additionally, the fact that Reddit banned a subreddit dedicated to investigation of child sex trafficking is odd considering that they allow a disturbing number of pedo related groups to exist here. r/pedofriends, r/pedo101, a private sub <a href="/r/pedochat">/r/pedochat</a>, (not to be confused with r/pedtalk/ which is open) <a href="/r/pedohelp/">/r/pedohelp/</a> and r/pedophilia/ are allowed to exist and it is impossible to verify what goes on in some of them. Though a mod from r/pedofriends has reached out to me and insisted that he runs the sub as a resource for those who are inclined but do not act on their urges, he still mentioned that some of the users on that page do not agree with his philosophy and advocate approaching children:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/IBiAU">http://archive.is/IBiAU</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/GvYzw">http://archive.is/GvYzw</a></p>

<p>I am skeptical about the existence of these subreddits. The public subs are easy to examine to see what is being posted there, but we have no idea what goes on in the private ones.  Additionally, I came across this very odd comment from Huffman’s AMA as well:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/rY8eC">http://archive.is/rY8eC</a></p>

<p>Remember the odd emails from Wikileaks discussing hotdogs? Perhaps there is nothing to this but it was still very strange:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231</a></p>

<p><strong>B. Twitter’s founding investor, Mark Pincus</strong></p>

<p>First of all, let me note that Twittergate is not Twitter’s first failure to properly handle pedophilia on their website. They have a history of failing to deal wit this kind of thing:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/13/twitter-failure-child-pornography">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/13/twitter-failure-child-pornography</a></p>

<p>Investigating Twitter’s corporate members led me to far more disturbing discoveries than anything I found on Reddit. During my research I came across Mark Pincus, a founding investor in Twitter (and other sites such as Facebook) who is most notable for his tenure as CEO of Zynga, the online gaming company who’s products include Farmville. Pincus was listed one of the major Silicon Valley backers of Hillary Clinton:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/9ar43">http://archive.is/9ar43</a></p>

<p>Among other startups, Pincus founded the website tribe.net, an early prototype social network similar to Reddit:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pincus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pincus</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/ajNs6">http://archive.is/ajNs6</a></p>

<p>Tribe.net has for some years been the host to a number of incredibly disturbing and deranged communities of pedophiles, sadist-cannibals and occultists/pagans.  Why on earth this is allowed on the clearnet is beyond me. How a founding investor of Twitter who has run major corporations tolerates this on one of his startups is even more mind-boggling.</p>

<p>Here’s a few links to the type of stuff tolerated on this site (I had to omit a few links because I was concerned that users were sharing what looked like possible child porn):</p>

<h1>WARNING NSFL: GRAPHIC AND OBSCENE LANGUAGE/ADULT MALE NUDITY</h1>

<p>There were a number of people looking to meet with others to engage in BDSM and cannibalism, here is one of the more tame listings I found:</p>

<p>Some were far more explicit, asking directly to be eaten:</p>

<p>There are many, many forums like this on tribe.net and some of them involve child abuse:</p>

<p>A user claiming his daughter is pregnant as a result of his abusing her, asking others to join in abusing the baby:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160421100119/http://tribes.tribe.net/nolimitstwistedmen/thread/cdce3424-61c8-4a00-b14f-d820d2880891">https://web.archive.org/web/20160421100119/http://tribes.tribe.net/nolimitstwistedmen/thread/cdce3424-61c8-4a00-b14f-d820d2880891</a></p>

<p>The revelation that tribe.net is being used for illegal and disturbing purposes like child abuse and sadomasochistic cannibalism is very alarming given that Mark Pincus is not only the CEO of Zynga and a founding investor of groups like Twitter and Facebook. It also appears that tribe.net isn’t profitable and doesn’t make him money.  Apparently the site had to make changes to its content policy in order to comply with the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act but as you can see this did nothing to prevent violations from continuing:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/btFUJ">http://archive.is/btFUJ</a></p>

<p>Another interesting fact is that the website does not seem to be profitable for Pincus. Not only has he apparently taken money out of it to fund other ventures but I also found a blog where the author claimed to have received an email from him where he stated that tribe.net was <strong>not</strong> a business and <strong>not</strong> a profitable entity:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/9G4XH">http://archive.is/9G4XH</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/6y5VC">http://archive.is/6y5VC</a></p>

<p>If it isn’t profitable, why has tribe.net not been shut down? Why is a person who has been a founding investor in most of our popular social media involved with this kind of thing? Might this have been a reason for Twitter and Reddit’s crackdown on groups who have been investigating this kind of stuff?</p>

<p>The corporate branches of both Twitter and Reddit have questions to answer about their actions in regards to dealing with instances of child abuse and other illegal activities given their censorship of online activist efforts. Even if the CEOs do not participate in this kind of thing themselves, it is highly inappropriate that they would allow forums like the ones listed in this thread or associate with people who allowed them to exist. Are these inappropriate associations the reason for the crackdown on Twitter and Reddit? Or is it merely another coincidence in a long string of coincidentally suspicious discoveries made in relation to Pizzagate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing research and connections! </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how else or where else to share this. I tried making a post but got no traction. There was a YouTube link posted by someone here that showed a David Icke documentary and had some links to his website. The links were dead, and I found that odd seeing as it&#39;s his official website. So I used the web archive and found that it was removed some time in February this year. I cannot find it anywhere else on the website and I think it does a great job of tying all of this together. I would greatly appreciate some thoughts on this article:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219224243/http://www.davidicke.com/headlines/42734-they-dare-not-speak-its-name-rothschild-zionism/">https://web.archive.org/web/20160219224243/http://www.davidicke.com/headlines/42734-they-dare-not-speak-its-name-rothschild-zionism/</a></p>

<p>Edit: for a TL;DR, he explains how government infiltration started hundreds of years ago, and the article is current enough to directly explain how Obama&#39;s cabinet orchestrated the 2008 collapse and what the world wide setup is leading up to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem I have with people like David Icke is that he does an incredibly poor job of explaining the various groups behind globalism. </p>

<p>The Rothschilds are a big group, but by no means the only one out there. Similarly, Zionist globalists are a thing but they account for maybe 5-10% of groups worldwide. Calling all globalism &quot;Rothschild Zionism&quot; is incredibly disingenuous in my opinion. The same goes for people who think all globalists are illuminati or masons as well.</p>

<p>When people focus on certain groups though, they miss tons of other things going on in the background. No one seems to have caught on that people and organizations using the owl or spider as their symbols are two distinct and different groups (which don&#39;t like each other, think about how the Bohemian Grove&#39;s motto is &quot;weaving spiders come not here&quot;), for example.</p>

<p>And also, might I ask where you get the 5-10% estimation? Any helpful links you can throw my way to get me started that discuss the multiple globalist groups?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just ballparking that number, it may be even smaller if you consider the portion of the global population represented by Jewish people as u/BiglyMAGA pointed out.</p>

<p>Think of the world as a global chessboard, then realize there are tons of different groups from various cultures and ethnicities all pursuing different objectives of theirs. Then factor in time and remember that groups ascend to power and then slowly fade away.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep you in mind and try to find a couple of links you can read. Here&#39;s short list of various groups from the West you can be thinking about though:</p>

<p>Rothschilds</p>

<p>Soros&#39; Open Society Foundation</p>

<p>British Royal Family and other royal families of Europe (in decline, less and less relevant each year)</p>

<p>Vatican (in decline and mostly irrelevant)</p>

<p>Bilderberg Group (confederation of various globalist interests)</p>

<p>Bill Gates and his foundation</p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg</p>

<p>Google</p>

<p>A group I&#39;ve heard termed &quot;The Bulls&quot; who have a large presence on Wall Street. Look at companies like Merrill Lynch for example</p>

<p>Groups are generally lumped into two categories: &quot;Old World Order&quot; and &quot;New World Order&quot; groups. OWO groups crafted the modern world and generally put emphasis on control. They usually support stuff like UN Agenda 21. The NWO is the new school of globalists who put more emphasis on stuff like technological advancements that will both help humanity and them (by making them rich, powerful etc.). They are much more likely to be &quot;good&quot; then older groups because they aren&#39;t so concerned with pure control. Not everyone is out to dominate the world.</p>

<p>Recently the OWO has been trying to rebrand itself as the NWO which is really amusing to actual NWO groups (remember Bush Sr. talking about a &quot;new world order?&quot; Attempt to rebrand).</p>

<p>Start looking at the world through that lens and see how it changes your perspective on things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Making the world into chess does make the most sense; if you&#39;re at the highest level you can be, what else is there to do other than impose your will I suppose. I absolutely appreciate every word of your post and hopefully it&#39;ll lead to me being much more active on this sub. </p>

<p>Out of much curiosity, I must ask, does any of this tie in with magic or &quot;magik&quot; of any kind? The first I&#39;ve read of it is here and there on this sub, but I didn&#39;t want to dive deeper unless it had something to do with pizzagate, but now I&#39;m curious about its possible existence in these other globalist groups. </p>

<p>Furthermore, with pizza gate seemingly so expansive and involving many different governments over a vast amount of time, if there are so many globalist groups, why does the one in relation to pizzagate seem to have the most control? These are the questions I&#39;ll personally be trying to answer, so any more insight would be amazing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or another way to put it: if you&#39;re at the highest level, the extremist of extreme lengths you&#39;ll go to maintain your seat on the throne. Absolute power absolutely corrupts...if someone has &quot;everything&quot; (except humanity, and an intact soul heh heh) you think there&#39;s anything they wouldn&#39;t do to maintain their position? If they literally control everything in the world, they also control the means to maintain their control. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why the idea that human trafficking, child abuse and pornography, human sacrifice, cannibalism and so on, as methods actually being used by those in positions of absolute power...well, it&#39;s conceivable to me. Logical, even. </p>

<p>The worst of the worst sins man can commit against man, committed by the only people in the world who have everything to lose. Because everything is already theirs, they lack nothing for which to strive for. To work for, to attain. They&#39;re so far gone into the &quot;evil&quot; side they can&#39;t comprehend the one thing they actually don&#39;t have at all: love. </p>

<p>Love is the thing that they will never have even the tiniest glimpse, nor the faintest glimmer of, because of the lengths to which they must go (horrible, soul-destroying acts of inhumanity) to avoid losing that which they&#39;ve never gone without (material possessions, power, complete and relentless ego fulfillment)...it&#39;s inconceivable. </p>

<p>Hell, they probably have no idea they&#39;re even missing it, probably think we are all the crazy ones because we are so preoccupied with things that don&#39;t factor at all to them. And the way a non-elite person thinks, how our brains process ️information and how we relate to other people in the world, probably also completely alien and seemingly nonsensical to them as well. </p>

<p>What kind of humans do people devoid of humanity make? Well, the kind of people who would do the kinds of horrible shit theorized in this investigation. If love is completely removed as an obstacle to one&#39;s continued domination of the planet and the people in it, to what lengths <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> a person go?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much yes to this comment. My thought is that there is a tremendous disconnect between people and how they perceive the world with love factored out of the equation. Completely different existence. If you&#39;ve never experienced life with and without empathy, this may be impossible to fully comprehend since we can really only understand things through the lens of our personal experience.</p>

<p>And this is quite convenient. For people who dedicate a large portion of their lives to appearing a certain way in front of a camera, the objective is to be as relatable as possible. Some may think this would be too difficult of a task to maintain. Is it all worth it? They get off on it, much like an everyday narcissist gets off on controlling people through inauthenticity. The fact that it&#39;s often on the world&#39;s stage only adds to the narcissistic supply.</p>

<p>Another thing is that all of these atrocities (pedophilia, etc) accomplish a number of things. For one, ordinary people don&#39;t want to believe our world is controlled by people completely different from ourselves, and having different intentions. Cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias are at an all time high. So those in power bank on this perceived impossiblity. The bigger the claim, the harder it would be to believe (satanism). Even if globalists don&#39;t have a genuine connection to the occult, it would be an incredibly effective front for other activity. And when you control the flow of information (media), all of this turns out to not be too difficult. Just think about the public perception of the word &quot;Illuminati&quot;. It&#39;s more of a meme to most people than anything. Not to mention you will be ostracized by half your friends by saying you buy into any of this. If you just say the words, &quot;satanism&quot; or &quot;conspiracy&quot;, it is immediate dismissal and reputation loss.</p>

<p>In my mind, the existence of these atrocities additionally acts as a means of control through blackmail and/or mutually assured destruction. In addition, it is quite conceivable to me that someone devoid of love would pursue pleasure by other means (sadism, etc).</p>

<p>It really seems like the internet and art are the only things keeping the chance of revealing truth afloat, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they become more and more of a target as time goes on... My personal thought is that the nature/timing of the Kanye thing is WAY too suspicious to be written off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t really delved into the realm of the magic stuff. But it does seem like certain groups may be into things like demon worship (stuff like spirit cooking which came up during the last days of the election for example). No idea how widespread it is globally.</p>

<p>In regards to the pizza stuff, I wouldn&#39;t say there&#39;s one particular group in control there. The international human trafficking scene means by default that a lot of groups will be involved. Even the scene in the US is not just one group, it&#39;s split between the East and West Coasts (Hollywood-DC/NY). I&#39;d imagine they all try to hold as much blackmail on each other as possible to make sure no one rocks the boat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading this, some of your archives, made me feel really sick. That one.. with the guy bragging about drugging kids and raping them.. and then all the other guys telling their sad fucked up stories but they are so ... broken ... that they say they liked it.. that they got raped from their fathers and uncles on their birthdays and they think that was the best that ever happened to them... I mean what the actual fuck is going on there? I can&#39;t even.. begin to comprehend this.. are they so indoctrinated that they actually belive what they are saying? I never knew anybody personally that was molested as a child so I haven&#39;t given that much thought other that inherently knowing that this shit is wrong and fucked up but reading this explains a lot why ppl who where raped when they where young do sometimes do the same when they grow up to others.. this is so fucked up.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>when the DOJ goes after social media, they generally go after reddit and twitter together.  i believe both companies have a few lawsuits currently against the DOJ wanting access to user data and not allowing the sites to tell their users.  I suspect the FBI/ DOJ asked reddit and twitter to shut down the communities that were actively pursuing &quot;pizzagate&quot;, and probably wanted access to a broad swath of user data.</p>

<p>I&#39;d suspect the &quot;cannibals&quot; thing is an inside joke about how reddit takes over dead account and subs, in addition to how it profits from the content of others.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a load of shit and you know it. The only story which had any merit to it was the one about the fact that Epstein would frequent Trump&#39;s clubs.  Here is a Vice article admitting Trump banned Epstein from his Mar A Lago club for hitting on a teenage girl:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason for the closure was that “personally identifiably information” was being “continually” released even though the admins refused to give specific examples of the supposed infractions.</p>

<p>What was interesting about the pizzagate closure was the rhetoric about “doxxing” and “harassment” being used to justify the censorship on Reddit very closely mirrored early reports of “hacking” and harassment that were thrown about in relation to the @jack suspension. In fact, if you look at the leaked chat log between Reddit CEO Steve Huffman and top mods from Reddit, you can see them using these arguments as an excuse to shut down r/the_donald:</p>

<p>Pizzagate was literally harassing tons of people not involved in any way. It got out of hand, you got shut down. Its not some massive conspiracy to silence the truth, its that reddit can&#39;t have people launching crusades against random businesses. </p>

<p>You also have to make yourself available (a target) if you ever want others to be able to reach out to you with skepticism. This means the trolls and shills will easily find you, but so will those that really need to hear what you are stating.</p>

<p>So spez is possibly cannibal, and a guy at Twitter runs an unpopular reddit knockoff. That has nothing to do with pizzagates sub getting shut down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. It&#39;s not a helpful or accurate characterization.</p>

<p>Would be nice if we could put time in at some point and map out various groups for people so they could see the big picture more clearly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just ballparking that number, it may be even smaller if you consider the portion of the global population represented by Jewish people as u/BiglyMAGA pointed out.</p>

<p>Think of the world as a global chessboard, then realize there are tons of different groups from various cultures and ethnicities all pursuing different objectives of theirs. Then factor in time and remember that groups ascend to power and then slowly fade away.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep you in mind and try to find a couple of links you can read. Here&#39;s short list of various groups from the West you can be thinking about though:</p>

<p>Rothschilds</p>

<p>Soros&#39; Open Society Foundation</p>

<p>British Royal Family and other royal families of Europe (in decline, less and less relevant each year)</p>

<p>Vatican (in decline and mostly irrelevant)</p>

<p>Bilderberg Group (confederation of various globalist interests)</p>

<p>Bill Gates and his foundation</p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg</p>

<p>Google</p>

<p>A group I&#39;ve heard termed &quot;The Bulls&quot; who have a large presence on Wall Street. Look at companies like Merrill Lynch for example</p>

<p>Groups are generally lumped into two categories: &quot;Old World Order&quot; and &quot;New World Order&quot; groups. OWO groups crafted the modern world and generally put emphasis on control. They usually support stuff like UN Agenda 21. The NWO is the new school of globalists who put more emphasis on stuff like technological advancements that will both help humanity and them (by making them rich, powerful etc.). They are much more likely to be &quot;good&quot; then older groups because they aren&#39;t so concerned with pure control. Not everyone is out to dominate the world.</p>

<p>Recently the OWO has been trying to rebrand itself as the NWO which is really amusing to actual NWO groups (remember Bush Sr. talking about a &quot;new world order?&quot; Attempt to rebrand).</p>

<p>Start looking at the world through that lens and see how it changes your perspective on things.</p>
