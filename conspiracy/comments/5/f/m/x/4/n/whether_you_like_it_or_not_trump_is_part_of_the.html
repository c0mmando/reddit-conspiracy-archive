       I completely agree.

      <p>
       Good did not win here people. Stop playing these stupid games. It was another election where people had to vote for the lesser of two evils.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both had deep rooted conflicts of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both have enough money that makes them out of touch with middle class America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both have questionable relationships with horrible people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both are professional liars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that the election is over, how silly will Trump supporters feel if they look past the rhetoric and go down the list of decision Trump will make?

       There will be a lot of cognitive dissonance going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, the Trump-bots are all talking about how horrible Mitt Romney is because he dared insult the God Emperor.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if Trump includes Romney in his cabinet, watch how the Trump-bots will rationalize it and start saying how Romney isn't such a bad guy after all. It's either this or "the god emperor is playing 5D chess; he's keeping his enemies close, he's draining the swamp by putting the swamp monsters in his cabinet".
      </p>
      <p>
       We've seen this already with several of Trump's awful cabinet picks.

       The same amount of cognitive dissonance it takes to keep "murdering, money laundering, primary cheating, has a husband who is a rapist" Hillary Clinton out of prison.

      <p>
       Does that help?

       It takes cognitive dissonance to keep that woman out of prison. She is a criminal, focus on putting her in jail.

       Don't worry about what Trump did, he's yet to steal money from Haiti or murder anyone and his wife isn't a rapist.

       I've never said I intend to put her in jail. It's beyond me. Trump said he'd do it though, but then -- "surprise, surprise" -- he changed his mind. Not surprising, really, since he's a close friend of the Clintons and since he's donated huge sums to TCF and to Hillary's campaigns. The zionist billionaire is not gonna lock up a good friend; he's too busy appointing neocons, zionists, warmongers and Goldman Sachs executives to his "anti establishment" cabinet. It's called "draining the swamp", supposedly. It's what he does when he's not at AIPAC, promising to give Israel more money and start a war against Iran.

       Just for the record, it's not the President's job to put Hillary Clinton in jail. He will, however, select bureaucrats who can ultimately make those types of decisions.

       He bought a $650k home, which is really not insane. Especially considering his wife sold her home to help pay for it. They have these things now called mortgages based on your salary and credit rating. I have one too, do you think I paid $200k in cash?

       I would have to agree. You havent been able to clearly make your point you are knowingly passing along bad info (Disinfo) and you cant seem to string a sentence together without proper spelling or without writing like youre in highschool.

       I mean youve brought up Bernies dick and from your post history you seem oddly fascinated with dicks and fags. Do you have something on your mind, do you think about "fags" frequently or have uncontrollable intrusive thoughts about dudes dicks?

       Except the users attacking Bernie for buying a 600k house and saying he was out of touch with the middle class. Compare this to the person  who is going to be president and you see how it actually makes sense.

       I sure would like a third house. If that's middle class then &gt;90% of the population must be poor.

       If your go to response for criticism of Bernie is: "b-b-but Trump is worse!", maybe the candidate in question is not worth defending. I would be sad if my entire existence and legitimence was defined by my enemy.

       "The company owns, operates, invests, and develops residential real estate, hotels, resorts, residential towers, and golf courses in different countries, as well as owning several hundred thousand square feet (several hectares) of prime Manhattan real estate."

       I don't know how true this is, but there are many articles out there saying he didn't have a regular job until he was 40.

       Apparently his net worth is around 500k-1M?

       There are just a lot of signs that state that he would not be able to comfortably afford three homes (one that cost 600k) because after taxes that 200k isn't all that much. Especially when you take into account living costs and the extra costs when financing a home.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a...

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So not that much time to make that kind of money. Even then he recently bought that 600k home. Either it was a consolation prize or he used campaign funds to buy the home. I don't know which it is, but its suspicious timing.

       He also has a wife that was pulling in about 160k being the president of Burlington College.

       Add in a few decades of reasonable investments and I can see how people who were making a combined income of ~360k can afford a 600k home, a DC condo and a rental property in VT.

       Glad we don't share finances. Granted Berno and his wife can easily afford that. However, most Americans who don't have Dr in front of their name cannot. Personally, I'd rather have the deed to my lesser home than a fat mortgage on a "look at me house".

       Sorry i should have specified that he isnt out of touch. What im getting at is he and his wife have enough money and assets to bump them out of the "middle class", especially when comparing to you and I.

       But like my last sentence says, how much money someone makes means nothing. Just because you are in a different tax bracket doesnt mean you are completely out of touch with those in who are poorer than you.

       I never said anything about Bernie wanting to display wealth. Someone could buy a house for 250000 to show off wealth. But honestly compared to the average middle class citizen, would a house that was bought for 650k be realistically affordable? And really it doesnt matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Im not comparing their wealth. Im saying Bernie has enough money and assets to be considered upper class. As does Trump. But both he and Trump resonate and connect with the less fortunate. Someones wealth doesnt determine that they are a bad person whether they are a millionaire or billionaire

       You dont understand what i mean. Bernie and his wifes net worth is more than likely far off from being in the middle class, but he still resonates with the poorer and less wealthy. As does Trump. Doesnt matter how much money you have.

       It's funny how Trump supporters keep using deflection instead of owning up. Hillary is not president, Bernie is not president. This is the alt-right rhetoric. When he says flag burners need to go to jail and lose citizenship it doesn't matter who else said it, HE DID and HE is now your president.

       It has to do with your deflection. WTF does Bernie have to do with the subject of OPs post? Own up to your candidates shitty policies. I'm sure you're ok with creationists influencing policy and people that hate gays running health. EVANGELICALS. First we're going to go to prison for dissent, next it'll be all non white christians. I stand behind my comments that YOU'RE lord and savior is a piece of shit.

       Trump has some really good policies, as most of them tend to lean towards a free market solution. Hes a bit hawkish when it comes to security, but its all in good faith. As long as he stays within the parameters of the constitution i cant argue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it seems as if you have a serious problem with people whom are religious or believe in any god. With your statement about you getting thrown in jail and non white christians, again, you are bringing race into it, just feeding into MSM liberal talking points like Pence wants to throw gays into camps and Trump wants to deport all muslims.

       I have a problem with religious people who use it as an excuse to oppress others. Why won't you answer to his creationist and anti gay appointees? I can only assume it's because you agree with them. I don't buy into any MSM, I buy into human rights and not turning back social progress back to the 50s because this is about all us middle class people get from our corporate government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am all for free market and trade reform but this is about as far as I agree with any of his "policies". I could give two shits about immigration reform, it's very small potatoes. You're the one that has bought into his hate and fear tactics. If you are following along with the vein of this subreddit (just to remind you, this is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .) 9/11 was an inside job as well as any other massively publicized terror attack brought on to the western world and any terror attack or organization poking their boogie man heads up in the middle east was invented by the same ilk that did 9/11 to further their agenda of control. 9/11 being an inside job negates any argument for a wall or bolstering our already massive military industrial machine. Trump is a insecure feeble little man who at one point
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       have thought he stood a chance to make things right but the only way to make this country right is to hang the 1% and guillotine all in washington who vote against the interest of the many for the greed of the few. Trump is a greedy fucking twerp and will merely use this opportunity for his gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't be critical of the man which I have not seen you do once in any of our crossed paths then you have bought into the alt-right's talking points. I don't put my head in an echosphere for information, I am objective, I am pointing out that policies like forcing creationism into public schools and abstinence only are disasters and far from progress. I am upset that Trump appoints people that contribute to anti gay groups is wrong. If you are for these things I can and will not see eye to eye with you.

       Ok. Who is anti gay or creationist out of his 3 appointees so far? Not to mention that you fail to realize Trumps position on gay marriage and other social issues are more in common with progressivee than old guard republicans. And once again, your claims about education are completely backwards like i tried to explain to you the last time we debated about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, i know full well 9/11 was an inside job. To what extent? No one really knows. You dont know, i dont know. We just smell something fishy. But guess what, so does Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just because many major events like this couldve been false flags or hoaxes, does not mean immigration isnt an important issue or that there arent any extremists whatsoever in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is illegal immigration. Not only does a pourous border leave members of ISIS or other extremists in, but also other regular common folk, that lowers wages here all the while sending remittance back home. Immigration is more important policy than most people think.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i just want to say lastly, i can be very critical of Trump. I dont like that hes playing with Romney or Patreus as SoS. Although its probably just another strategy point. I dont like his hawkish security positions, thats where is authoritarianism can come in. Thankfully im sure he will stay within his constitutionality for decisions he makes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But honestly alot of you guys on here are taking the criticism a little too far.
By all means critique and debate, but the man hasmt done anything yet, hasnt even been inaugurated yet and you guys act as if he just opened up concentration camps all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Than many of you, not you specifically, sit there and act like a guy who basically robbed millions of good honest people of their money, while acting like hes the next revolutionary, completely gave up on his own message. This subs gibes me alot of mixed emotions and it doesnt make sense half the time.

       But just remember, hes isnt president yet. If he ACTUALLY does violate our rights, ill be right there with you, but for now reserve the crucifixion until he actually commits treason or something. So far, with him just being the president-elect, hes already making moves. I have faith that Trump is going to be one of the good ones, or atleast better than Bush or Obama.

       Not even nearly on par with DT wealthwise.   But if you want comparisons that matter, Bernie has invested his entire life in helping his fellow Americans.   His track record in this regard is long and wide.

       DT by contrast seems to have a track record for enriching himself at the expense of others.  Not sure how on earth he'd suddenly have an ephiphany in this regard.

       Well Trump is giving his life up to serve the American people, as far as i can see, for our best interest. He could just ride out the rest of his years in style, but decised to run for president. But as far as his education policy goes to his tax reforms to immigration reform, many of his policies are both constitutional and for the good of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       A huge problem with people thinking Trump is extremely divisive and racist and xenophobic and every other ist that people called him and his supporters, is the media. Which we know Clinton had in the bag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is what we call a pied piper candidate, this was in the DNC hacks. The media propped up Cruz Carson and Trump to let them become front runners, than when the nominee started to be chosen from that group, they start the media witch hunt. Almost nothing about Trumps policies are racist or xenophobic or anything like that.

       Bernie write bills that helped the american people you say? Sure its his job. Like his first job ever.

       I also agree he needs to be held to a very high standard. I'm still not sure about his intentions though, I'm still holding on to the hope that he genuinely wants to drain the swamp. He campaigned on things like congressional term limits, auditing the Fed and banning former representatives from becoming lobbyists. If he accomplishes any one of these things I'll be thrilled.

       Term limits do not limit corruption it just shifts more power from elected to unelected persons (lobbyists, campaign professionals, fundraisers, donors, consultants). California has term limits, go check out how well it is working for them corruption wise.

       well not much dirt was found ( except corporate dirt / scams ) about trump.
       <br/>
       He,s not been linked to murders yet ( like hills body bag list )
       <br/>
       There is some info about him and the pedo express but that is still kinda cloudy.
       <br/>
       The thing is the media and loads of other players where against him.
       <br/>
       And all the stuff they attacked him on was kinda low compared to Hillary,s shit list.
       <br/>
       I do agree trump needs to be toughly scanned.
       <br/>
       But anything that has to do whit corporate scams and tax evasion is a mute point sins well every one that can would do those things ( and law allowed it so mhe )

       People might find it difficult to believe Trump is just that clean. I mean if there was real dirt don't you think the establishment would have used it? They resorted to false rape accusations towards the end. He was the better choice compared to Hillary. And were seeing now that even Jill Stein was a Soros minion so we didn't have any real other choices.

       We have to stop him! (Why because he goes against your personal ideology?)

       The democracy has spoken, but typically like most Americans, they need to be fully involved in the process so they can feel some form of personal control, the same phenomena leaders experience when they go into countries all over the world and try to keep their hands directly on the power structure of various nations.

       The election is over. Trump is going to be president, the more you undermine him the worse of a job he will do, that doesn't mean people can say I told you so if he fails.

       Bill Clinton is a rapist, he's not going back to the white house. The Clinton Foundation is a money laundering scheme, it's being investigated, the Clinton family may be associated with murder, it is being investigated.

       While I agree that we should all be aware and on the lookout for corruption and misdealings all the time, where was this enthusiasm when obama was in? I certainly did not see anything close to what trump is now getting, which makes me highly suspicious of all of these cries to rally focus.
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly has driven you to speak out now? And are you sure the media was not behind this? We should all be skeptical of our news and make sure we do our own research... and if you see almost all of the establishment pushing in one direction, you better be damn sure to try finding what they are hiding or why they are trying to manipulate you.

       Donald Trump is worth 10x what Hillary Clinton is, and she stole all of her money from Haiti and other charities.
      </p>
      <p>
       She's associated with the murders of at least a half dozen people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes, it's just awful how Trump wants America to obey federal immigration policy. What a racist!

       Interesting. Where's the tape. I would love to hear it? Was it before or after he won the election? The Trump supporters are going to also shit on Trump if he doesn't follow through with his promises. He was THE candidate for change and Hillary wasn't. That is why he won the presidency.

       You seem to be among those that missed the whole point of why CTR was such a big deal on here. Both sides have armies of shills pushing their narratives with equal vigour and anyone who thinks otherwise is dangerously naive. By concentrating on the Clinton campaign's outed shills, Trump's shills managed to deflect attention away from themselves. Now that the election is over, CTR's job is largely done but Trump's shrill orange spinsters are just getting started for an eight-year run. Politics
       <em>
        is

       Honest-to-god explanation I saw yesterday: "Trump is such an outsider he has to appoint insiders to maintain his legit outsider status. If he appointed other outsiders, he wouldn't be an outsider anymore, he'd be an insider of outsiders."

       Yes, because the man is an idiot that makes
       <em>
        Clinton

       look less corrupt (that is SOMETHING), I spent twenty minutes trying to come up with a convoluted way to justify his hilariously establishment cabinet picks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you're obviously quite invested in slobbering his knob, can you tell me why YOU believe his cabinet picks show he's not corrupted to the hilt? You must have a better talking point than those poor fools I've seen around here today giving the "he can't be an outsider if other outsiders are involved" response given your zeal in here.

       I know all about Clinton's corruption - you don't just need Wikileaks here (and I know plenty about that), and I was one of the biggest sharers of Clinton's corruption (which we all know is voluminous) here, and anyone with eyes knows Trump blows her crooked ass out the water. Which is why I said what I said because it's true.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I note your deflection, so I'll put you down on the little sheet in my brain as: refuses to answer the question as to why you believe his cabinet picks are proof he's "draining the swamp." Which seriously, is sadder than the guy or gal yesterday with their outlandish insider-outsider theory.

       Ignoring the obvious Jeffrey Epstein for now,  lets focus first on Rudy Giuliani,  longtime Trump Friend and who is currently being considered for Secretary of State, Rudy headed the "investigation" into the pedophile operations at West Point in the 1980's. Despite overwhelming evidence, Giuliani did not secure a single indictment and in fact facilitated the protection of the ring:
      </p>
      <pre><code>The West Point case, among others, was alleged to be linked to the Presidio case. As The Times Herald Record reported in June 1991, the "incidents [at the West Point Child Development Center] unfolded against a backdrop of satanic acts, animal sacrifices and cult-like behavior among the abusers, whose activities extended beyond the U.S. Military Academy borders to Orange County and a military base in San Francisco, parents charged." The case first broke in July 1984, when a three-year-old girl found herself in the emergency room of the West Point Hospital with a lacerated vagina. She told the examining physician that a teacher at the daycare center had hurt her. The next month, the parents of another child leveled accusations of abuse at the center. As the Mercury News reported, "by the end of the year, 50 children had been interviewed by investigators. Children at West Point told stories that would become horrifyingly familiar. They said they had been ritually abused. They said they had had excrement smeared on their bodies and been forced to eat feces and drink urine. They said they were taken away from the day care center and photographed."

Despite abundant medical and psychological evidence and literally dozens of child witnesses, and despite "950 interviews by 60 FBI agents assigned to the investigation," the investigation, "led by former U.S. Attorney [and future mayor] Rudolph Giuliani" produced "no federal grand jury indictments," according to the Herald Record. "In 1987, Giuliani said his detailed investigation showed only one or two children were abused." Giuliani's contention was directly contradicted by an independent investigation, as the Herald report divulged: "a still-secret, independent report - produced by one of the nation's top experts on child sexual abuse - confirms the children's accusations of abuse."

www.real-debt-elimination.com/child_protection/child_sexual_abuse_at_the_Presidio_and_Westpoint.htm
</code></pre>
      <p>
       It would later emerge that one of Giuliani's "oldest friends" is Fr. Alan Placa, a Catholic priest implicated in pedophile operations:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Rudy Giuliani's consulting firm, Giuliani Partners, has for years employed a Catholic priest who was accused by a grand jury of orchestrating the over-up of nearly 60 separate molestations allegation -- a priest who allegedly partook of the activities himself. The priest, Alan Placa, is one of Giuliani's oldest friends; in turn, Giuliani has become Placa's highest-profile defender.

       All of the modeling agencies, and trumps isn't without its own drama, are extremely sketchy.

       Yup, this isn't Bernie Sanders we're talking about. Trump is a billionaire with global connections, someone who is just as corruptible, if not more so than someone like Clinton. And he's been setting off red flags ever since he became president elect with his cabinet appointments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that this dude is anti-establishment is laughable. His entire bid was an ego trip and now he's in over his head, ready to be exploited by the neocons he's surrounding himself with. I'm afraid everyone was played, including Trump himself.

       Is this the same Bernie who endorsed the establishment candidate? The same guy who took over 200M from his donors and probably rolled over and gave it to the DNC/Hillary? Same guy who got a nice 600k consolation house in Vermont and who took his family and others on a vacation to Italy using his campaign funds?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wake up. Hillary, Bernie and most people in washington are basically two sides of the same coin.

       This is a poor strawman, of course he's not perfect. He's just not a billionaire with global connections/interests, someone who is the literal antithesis to anyone who even remotely believes in the conspiracy of a totalitarian world government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was slightly optimistic following the election, that maybe he actually believed what he was preaching but it's now blatantly obvious that he was pandering to the highest degree. He's not even in charge, Pence has headed the transition team and it shows.

       Clinton may say she believes in climate change, but the reality is, she would have done just as much about it as Trump. She is a fracking salesmen with no intention of disappointing her fossil fuel friends.

       That's a far more realistic view than I see the majority brandishing (omg ww3!). I bet the trump government will either be unremarkable or excellent in terms of growing american power and prosperity. I don't understand why so many people's view of the world hinges on Trump being stupid... he would not be here today if he was stupid.

       The best thing we could see is that he is playing the game by his own rules. This makes the establishment worry due to the lack of control they really are. This makes him a good president in terms of actual power. The past ones is just puppets

       The worst thing we could see is the same: he is playing by his own rule. We dont know how shits will look like and prepare for it. This makes him a bad president in terms of policies. Who the hell knows what he is up to, and why? And this uncertainty is pretty scary.

       Overall, this makes the hopes high and expectations low tho.

       You need to give it time. Whats the point of arguing so much about this when the man hasnt got into office yet. The sitting POTUS is still allowing children to be bombed, protesters to be beaten, treating whistleblowers like shit, etc. Pizzagate evidence is being vaporized!!! (a little /s)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how come people who can realize that most of what these politicians push through as law, ie war on drugs, ends up being a ploy to divert funds from the majority to a tiny minority, yet when it comes to "climate change" suddenly every piece of shit politician is working for the common good? The cognitive dissonance is astonishing. Think about the term, its completely inocuous and neutral, yet evokes religious levels of apolyptic fervor, to the point where people give up their sovereignty. Global climate agreements arent ratified for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pollution, deforestation, animal poaching... all horrible. But I'm not sure what to think about the changes in weather. Weather is not climate, by the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I hear the words "99% of experts agree..." attatched to any claim, my bullshit meter goes up. Maybe yours should, too.

       Err.... The cabinet is pretty segmented. U got the loyalist (pretty much those who will agree with him no matter what), the coporationist (confusion setting and ruse tactic) and the one in between (who the hell knows what those guys would do). It's the basic "play by my own rule" style. Nobody knows what he is really up to. And I mean nobody really knows. He has thrown a lot of smoke bombs lately. Looking at reddit, nobody focus on his meeting with Gary Cohn and everyone just focus on him commenting about the flag burning. This makes this guy dangerous as fuck since maybe everything he revealed is just that: smoke bombs. Hard to say tho.....

       100%. It's okay to be enthusiastic about a candidate or a president, but once people become too stubborn in their devotion to a candidate or party and fail to see what is really going on... then it is over.

       First and foremost there ain't no fucking wall being built. Mexico aint paying shit.  Second the swamp is looking like a expansion, I mean shit how many shitbirds is he gonna list before the Trump party supporters say this is Bush squared. Not to mention the conflict of intrests already occuring with the hotel fiasco.  He tweets like a drunken college student about shit not based in any reality.  How you gonna shit on the election results that made you the winner.  I am starting to wonder if its just that Alex Jones effect.  You got everything you wanted and more but have no clue how to be rational or funtcional so you play this victim attack shit constantly.  Infrastructure plan?  Obama tried that for eight years.  It goes on and on.  However what I am seeing on reddit is this cancer of denial that everything is not okay.

       There will never be an end loose enough to unravel this clusterfuck, whether it be PG, 9/11, you name it. Loose ends go missing and forgotten and then it's business as usual. We either need some generous country to bomb the fuck out of our leaders or a coup from the inside to give this country back to the people.

       I think that's part of the technique - bury us in corruption and scandal so that we're just exhausted and give up and stop paying attention to them. Worked for the Clintons and holy hell, has Trump blown them out of the water in that respect. There is just
       <em>
        so much
       </em>
       on either of them that when people say, "name one thing," you're left spluttering because you can count off ten things and barely scratch the surface (and that's how you know the people that counter like that are completely disingenuous - you can easily get 10+ mainstream news sources to confirm more than 10 different things Clinton or Trump have done that would get
       <em>

       It's changing. There was a time around the election when saying anything negative about trump got you labeled as a shill or CTR. This is a subreddit for conspiracies and people sort of just let it happen as if nothing was going on. It was eerie. Did people really think Trump didn't have his own version of CTR? Or did people not want to speak out against the mob?

       Yeah, I get called a shill, CTR, all kinds of shit for posting actual common sense or just plain facts.  It all started with pizza gate and the fanatics have just pushed harder.  I really used to like this sub but lately its been in denial.  I mean Trump threw Patreaus name to see how much flack he would get.   I used to lurk and learn. Guess I gotta start posting

       I voted for him so that we could hold him accountible. As we should. We have a better chance of controling him because of the contention surrounding him and his relative outsider status. The Clinton's have too much momentum. We made the right move. Now we just have to follow through.

       We have a zero chance of controlling either Clinton or Trump; they're both controlled be the establishment. The only difference is that Trump's party wants to bring us back to 1950.

       You're argument is akin to "Water isn't wet!" I just hope not all Trump supporters are as retarded as you or we're in trouble.

        Trump started a modeling agency to have sex with underage women. Where do people think his current wife came from?
       </del>
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the modeling agencies, and trumps isn't without its own drama, are extremely sketchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the fake news constantly pumped against trump I'm not sure I can believe the accusations brought up recently. Those agencies do have a pattern of abuse though. Doubtful trumps was any different.

       Once again read one of my 3 or 4 responses to other users about my statement, as it puts it into context a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has some really good policies, as most of them tend to lean towards a free market solution. Hes a bit hawkish when it comes to security, but its all in good faith. As long as he stays within the parameters of the constitution i cant argue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it seems as if you have a serious problem with people whom are religious or believe in any god. With your statement about you getting thrown in jail and non white christians, again, you are bringing race into it, just feeding into MSM liberal talking points like Pence wants to throw gays into camps and Trump wants to deport all muslims.

       There will never be an end loose enough to unravel this clusterfuck, whether it be PG, 9/11, you name it. Loose ends go missing and forgotten and then it's business as usual. We either need some generous country to bomb the fuck out of our leaders or a coup from the inside to give this country back to the people.

       there's as much hope with trump as with obama, which is to say none/zero, and there is no hope until people stop thinking that their political salvation lies in a millionaire/billionaire running for a single office once every 4 years. none.
