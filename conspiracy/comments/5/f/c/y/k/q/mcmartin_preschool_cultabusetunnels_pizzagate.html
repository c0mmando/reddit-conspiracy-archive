    <div class="md"><p>Been thinking about the McMartin preschool case. Didnt they excavate the area under the preschool years later and find evidence of tunnels?</p>

<p>Also, wasnt McMarin connected to the Aquino/Presidio/army pedo scandal? Or were they two separate things? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll have to look into it later. I also saw in the /new/ queue that thousands of cables from 1979 were just released by wikileaks. Wonder if there might be anything in there about any of the players involved in these two cases.</p>

<p>::sigh:: The need to do more research never ends, does it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tunnels were real and children in the Presidio case directly identified Michael Aquino and his wife and their home as being the perpetrators and place where they were sexually assaulted. </p>

<p>The Presidio Child Development Center was the centre of rampant sexual assaults and satanic ritual crimes. If anyone recalls, Former U.S. Attorney Rudolph &quot;Rudy&quot; Giuliani was prosecuting on this case and produced zero federal indictments on any of the perpetrators. This despite abundant medical and psychological evidence, as well as literally dozens of child witnesses, along with the complete and utter disregard of the 950 interviews conducted by 60 FBI agents assigned to the investigation.</p>

<p>In 1987, Giuliani said his detailed &quot;investigation&quot; showed only one or two children were abused, notwithstanding the 58 children who reported sexual assaults and/or molestation. Giuliani&#39;s contention was directly contradicted by an independent investigation, as reported by the Times Herald Record.</p>
