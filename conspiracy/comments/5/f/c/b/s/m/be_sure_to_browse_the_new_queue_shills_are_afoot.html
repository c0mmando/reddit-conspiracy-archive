<p>Pretty straightforward narrative when you have hard ties to convicted child traffickers and are also posting disturbing content like that. I mean we are talking about someone who literally consumes a bloodypisscum concoction for power or god knows what they think it provides them with. Clearly these people are disturbed and its a fact that they are tied to child trafficking in Haiti. </p>

<p>These people are tied up protecting convicted child traffickers in Haiti</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;These people&quot;?  You are making a HUGE leap in that connection.</p>

<p>Yes, there is a lot of human trafficking in Haiti.  Yes, the Clintons (Bill and Hillary) are very involved in haiti, and I would not be surprised at all if you could link them to human traffickers there.  </p>

<p>But the story you&#39;re referring to is the Idaho church which got busted bringing orphans to the dominican republic post earthquake without proper paperwork.  There&#39;s an email from Cheryl Mills about that- which makes perfect sense considering the state department deals with exactly THAT.  Understand that almost all orphans in Haiti are stripped of documentation and made into house slaves.  There were some shady things about that story, but the involvement of Clinton seemed to be strictly as secretary of state, and there is NO evidence of a connection between that story and the pizza parlors near dupont circle.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>disturbing Instagram posts with children in suggestive positions and known pedophile codespeak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you&#39;re referring to a picture of a girl with her hands taped to a table in a pizza place which caters events for both children AND adults. If this wasn&#39;t in the context of story about abuse, people probably wouldn&#39;t have the same reaction to it.  It&#39;s not evidence of abuse in itself. and by &quot;known pedophile codespeak&quot;, you mean the word &quot;pizza&quot;?  It&#39;s one of the favoritest foods of Americans.  Yes, &quot;Cheese Pizza&quot; (and ANYTHING with the initials &quot;CP&quot;, for that matter) is used as code for illegal porn in some internet forums.  That doesn&#39;t mean that &quot;pizza&quot; is.  That&#39;s pure wild speculation.</p>

<p>And YES, pizza shops (and restaurants in general) are cash heavy businesses that have always been used for money laundering.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Connection_Trial">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Connection_Trial</a></p>

<p>And YES, handkerchiefs are used in sex clubs to distinguish sexual predilection.  But there&#39;s no evidence that &quot;white = virgin&quot; in handkerchief code.  Not saying it&#39;s not true, but there&#39;s no evidence of pedos using handkerchiefs to communicate, specifically.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Marina AbramoviÄ‡ is a performance artist.  Have you ever seen performance art?  you have no idea what the art is about.  Art is really weird.  And even if art does represent molestation (which abramovic&#39;s does not), that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s celebrating it.  I met this girl years ago.  She wasn&#39;t a satanist pedofile, she was just a weirdo trying to create shocking art.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_student_abortion_art_controversy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_student_abortion_art_controversy</a></p>

<p>but yes, pedofilia is something that happens.  And it&#39;s something that&#39;s covered up and secretive.  The greeks groomed young boys through sexual relationships.  There&#39;s a reason intercrural sex is referred to as: &quot;Princeton First-Year&quot;, the &quot;Oxford Style&quot;, the &quot;Oxford rub&quot;, or the &quot;Ivy League rub&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercrural_sex">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercrural_sex</a></p>

<p>there are sociopaths who use sex as a power-tool and sometimes it&#39;s used against children.  And there are lots of sociopaths in power.  I&#39;m not arguing about whether or not there are pedophile rings amongst &quot;the elite&quot;.  I&#39;m not arguing that it isn&#39;t used ritualistically as a &quot;cremation of care&quot;.  I&#39;m arguing that the posts about &quot;pizzagate&quot; rush to conclusions and attempt to push &quot;proof&quot; where there is very little in the way of evidence.</p>

<p>lol wait are you saying that Podesta, the Clintons, and Alefantis aren&#39;t connected?</p>

<p>Also you got the Haiti situation pretty mixed up, Bill Clinton was the one who brokered the deal to release the convicted child traffickers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like if you are going to be illegally trafficking children you would want to do it under the guise of something else? I dunno maybe like a group of missionaries? These Laura Silsby children weren&#39;t even orphans they were taken from their parents and lied to that they would be able to come see them again. Pretty fucking sinister shit Breitbart was writing about Podesta and Haiti back in 2011. </p>

<p>Not a good look for you sticking up for the perps in the Laura Silsby case. Icky.</p>

<p>So there are plenty of hard ties between all of these things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You edited your previous post and accused me of &quot;sticking up for the perps in the Laura Silsby case&quot;.  You also claim that Bill Clinton was involved Laura Silsby&#39;s release- which I wouldn&#39;t be surprised by, but don&#39;t see any evidence of.  Please cite (and not breitbart/ gatewaypundit/ harambe_remembers.blogspot.com)  I didn&#39;t debunk the clintons&#39; involvement in that case- I said that it makes sense from the perspective of an aid worker being held in a haitian prison, who would reach out to the state department for help.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not even arguing with you about that case.  I think it&#39;s shady.  I&#39;m arguing about the relationship that case has to a pizza place in Washington DC.  You&#39;re making a huge leap when you connect those two things. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>probably many people who are tertiarily related to the clintons post odd instagram photos.  but you&#39;re referring to a picture of a girl with taped hands and a picture of walk in refrigerator in a restaurant.  it&#39;s a leap to associate those two pictures with pedophilia.</p>

<p>Come on man, there&#39;s thousands of emails at this point linking Podesta to Alefantis and comet ping pong and there&#39;s plenty of evidence linking him to child trafficking in Haiti. It&#39;s no leap at all to associate these people and that&#39;s before even considering all of the disturbing art and Instagram posts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It says that Bill Clinton (who was clearly already &quot;coordinating relief efforts&quot;) brokered the deal to get the rest of the members of the church released.  I know enough about the case to know that they claimed that Silsby told them she had all the proper paperwork to transport the kids.  Clinton didn&#39;t get her out of jail.  She had to serve her sentence.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about thousands, but I&#39;m not questioning whether or not he eats pizza there- among many places that he eats pizza.  And obviously the owner is connected to Brock, who is a shady political operative/ spook.  I&#39;m questioning whether there&#39;s any evidence that &quot;eating pizza&quot; is a code for molesting children.</p>

<p>and what does podesta have to do with Haiti?  you&#39;re saying that because he&#39;s a clinton advisor and the clintons are tied to haiti (known for child trafficking), that therefor a place that he eats pizza must have molested kids tied up in the basement?  These are huge stretches.  </p>

<p>They both have hard ties to James Alefantis and his horrific Instagram account. </p>

<p>There are clearly dots to connect here, maybe its not enough evidence to get an indictment, but enough evidence to justify further investigation for sure. </p>

<p>These people are drinking blood and cum (you say its performance art but the lady specifically stated its only art if performed in a gallery). Clearly they have some severe issues. The Alefantis Instagram account is one of the most disturbing things I have ever seen, the spirit cooking was one of the most disturbing things I have ever read, and the Podesta emails involving pizza and other pedophile terminology make 0 sense in the context of the email. </p>

<p>maybe.  but the clintons are diplomats who are very involved in haiti. it makes sense that they would have been involved with negotiating the release of a church group there given the official narrative.  </p>

<p>Please cite this.  How did Media Matter try to cover it up?  I&#39;m not really sure what Podesta&#39;s affiliation with them is, but I know he was involved in their formation and that Brock is a sketchy dude and it&#39;s unclear whether he has always worked for the clintons.

<p>What is a &quot;hard tie&quot;?  Are you responsible to the shadiness of all the people in your network? Do you know how huge the clintons&#39; network is?  How are you connecting the owner of the pizza place with the clintons and with haiti?  You&#39;re literally just saying that the know each other. </p>

<p>i&#39;ve seen the pictures you&#39;re talking about and there&#39;s no way i would ever assume they were referring to ritual child molestation without being prompted to. </p>

<p>I stopped reading after this because its just such complete garbage the rest must be as well. The &quot;church group&quot; you are referring to was lying to parents telling them they would get to see their children again then just taking them and trying to export them out of the country. Shady doesn&#39;t even begin to accurately describe their actions here. The dots are there to connect for anyone interested.

<p>According to Pizzagaters, pedo-rings wouldn&#39;t demand a D.C. police / FBI investigation knowing they&#39;re protected by police / FBI on the inside.  &quot;Trust the FBI&quot; these dozens of new Pizzagate user accounts tell us.</p>

<p>According to all these new Pizzagate accounts, sincere questions like those by &quot;know_comment&quot; must be downvoted, except that real journalists will ask those questions, and they won&#39;t disappear with downvotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s always good to be skeptical, but at the end of the day, there is enough here to warrant an investigation. Way less has spawned investigations. </p>

<p>I have a friend who works in sex crimes. I ran this past her, and to her the signs of the businesses on this block alone are enough to start an investigation. No single post on their social accounts are enough on their own to be alarming, but all together, she said they are highly alarming and very unusual. </p>

<p>Create a control group: We can always just pick a random block and see how many logos of businesses you find contain pedophilia symbols.  We can always look at random or friend social media accounts for pedophilia like posts or text and see what comes up. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I did, and how I determined something really might be happening here with these business owners. The truth is, you will be hard pressed to find one business with pedo symbols in their logos, let alone several on the same block. You will be hard pressed to find a social media account of an innocent person that contains many pedo jokes and slogans. </p>

<p>These are all red flags. And if we are not looking into these people and businesses that present red flags, we are basically not even putting up any front against pedophilia. </p>

<p>I agree.  Try it in any city.  You&#39;ll see tons of symbols that you can say look like whatever you want.  Try it with all seeing eyes, or with the star of david or with the valknut or a fleur de lis.   I&#39;m not a symbologist, but I suspect the symbols you are seeing also have other meanings.</p>

<p>if you apply code, you can accuse anyone of it. Especially people in a sexual/ artistic environment.  Do it in new york or san fransisco where you have large gay communities where people are rubbing shoulders with the very wealthy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for the symbols, no. They have to literally match up with the pedo FBI symbol list. Again, if you try it, you will not find it elsewhere with ease. </p>

<p>And yes, there are all sorts of weird stuff on social media. I&#39;m not saying you aren&#39;t going to find that. But when people are using pedo code/slang routinely in their posts, it means they have, at the very least, some knowledge of that world. </p>

<p>I get that not everyone has a mind for connecting basic patterns. But if law enforcement says these are red flags that almost always lead to finding pedos, then I am not about to assume these people with all these red flags just have terrible luck and just happened to pick an unfortunately identical code with pedophiles. This does not automatically make them pedos, BUT it does warrant an investigation. One or two oddities, no. A laundry list of them, absolutely. </p>

<p>And the red flag posts they make are obviously not art. And it&#39;s mostly the words they use, which again, is pedo code. Weird sex stuff is fine. No one here has an issue with that, obviously. I mean, we are on Reddit. Excessive pictures of children, coupled with comments on them using unusual slogans that carry meaning within pedo community, is obviously something anyone with a head on their shoulders would know to be leery of or investigate further. It&#39;s not rocket science. </p>

<p>but they don&#39;t. the only one that really matches is that besta logo.  the comet logo kindof matches one, but that&#39;s a really common pattern. the rest really don&#39;t match at all.  and again, i haven&#39;t been to the fbi site to determine if that&#39;s a real document- but I&#39;ll assume that it is for the sake of argument and because that&#39;s on me.</p>

<p>again, you have to cite this.  I&#39;ve seen a few pictures of children on the instagram of a restaurant which hosts child-oriented events. I haven&#39;t heard anything about &quot;pedo-code&quot; other than the allegation that &quot;pizza&quot; is code for pedos.  but we&#39;re talking about a pizza parlor and one of the most common foods...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not talking about the word &#39;Pizza&#39; here. A pizza place will obviously talk about pizza. They use known code in their comments. There were many instances of that. My sex crimes law enforcement friend pointed out all the instances and what they meant, but I did not make a list of it as I don&#39;t really want to know about these things so well. I&#39;m sure someone else has though and it should be easy to find. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know pedo code and you don&#39;t work in sex crime investigating, good for you for not knowing the jargon. Means you probably are not a practicing pedo. </p>

<p>There was one that she pointed out to me that stuck in my mind. I believe it was &quot;#chickenlovers&quot;. According to the internet, a gay friend of mine and law enforcement who specialize in this stuff, that means a gay male who is into underage boys. It was a comment on a photo of an adult male holding a very young boy. No chicken (food) is present in the photo. Could totally be an inside joke that they had no idea sounded that bad. But it does not look good. In light of that post and many more, it would be reasonable for law enforcement to keep an eye on. </p>

<p>You want to say you have not seen anything weird, yet you have no idea what even to look for (which really is good thing that you were not previously aware). But what good is that argument? There simply is no point in proclaiming you have not found evidence of something you aren&#39;t even aware of. </p>

<p>I know my friend who works in this field of law enforcement was very alarmed when I brought to her attention these accounts without telling her why I was showing her the accounts. I wanted to know if this was something actual law enforcement would see as an issue. I shared the accounts with her under the idea they were humorous. Despite that, she came to the possible pedo conclusion. That is when I started taking this shit seriously. And again, they might just have terrible luck in picking out inside jokes or code words for something that is not pedo related. But technically it is more likely they might be pedos. </p>

<p>A quick investigation should sort it all out. 
Because benefit of the doubt when it comes to pedophilia is always a bad idea, this too according to law enforcement. If you have to rationalize someone&#39;s actions and words into seeming normal, there is likely a problem present. </p>

<p>that&#39;s what I&#39;m asking you for!  if i&#39;m missing something here, i want to know.</p>

<p>&quot;Chickenlover&quot; is a south park reference about molesting chickens.  You&#39;re right that it&#39;s probably a pedo joke, but i think that&#39;s just gay community slang rather than pedo slang.  If there really is a pattern of these types of jokes, I&#39;d assume over-sexualization before overt pedophilia.  </p>

<p>If your friend really did do an analysis of the language, you should post it for evidence, because again- many of us think this narrative is ful of huge leaps and wild accusations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but with the 9/11 conspiracy, most of the shit being thrown at the wall didn&#39;t stick.  I agree that if there&#39;s smoke, there is quite often fire.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that tomohawk missiles fired by holographic israeli jets is a theory worth pursuing.  You have to be smart about it and use some logic.  Connecting random dots to make a picture isn&#39;t helpful.</p>

<p>and the government&#39;s 9/11 narrative ISN&#39;T cohesive.  disproving is much easier than proving theories about what really happened.  it&#39;s intuitive and logical to note that there were cover ups and that the attack was used to advance a political agenda.  there is a lot of available information now that was obvious even then.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that Podesta might be into some weird shit- he very rich and well connected and maybe even works for the church (there are other people in his line of work who certainly do).  The only thing we really know about the pizza shop owner is that he&#39;s the ex-boy toy of Brock- who is clearly a spook (he somehow went from catalyzing whitewater with &quot;troopergate&quot; to being the main disinfo operative for the clinton campaign).</p>

<p>We also know the Clintons are very involved in Haiti- which is renowned for child abuse and human trafficking.  We know that the Clinton Foundation is shady and political and it&#39;s very hard to trace where its money goes...</p>

<p>As far as &quot;pizza&quot; being pedo-code, that&#39;s a stretch without much evidence to back it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people are connecting dots that were already connected by Anons 2 weeks ago. Normies are just starting to eat the slice, whereas anons are getting close to the crust.</p>

<p>As the scope of the investigation goes up the pizza slice and we get towards the crust, this appears to be something far greater than a single pizza joint. </p>

<p>The idea of pizzagate is almost a PSYOP in itself. By confining the investigation to a pizza joint, the investigation is easier to debunk. If pizza gate can be debunked, then the idea of a transnational enterprise gets thrown out with the bathwater. It&#39;s the ultimate PSYOP. </p>

<p>There are all kinds of psychological operations underway. When you see someone posting &quot;ZOMG ANOTHER DOT CONNECTED!!&quot; and it turns out to be easily disproven bunk, consider the possibility that this is a shill tactic to slide the forum, drive dissent and weaken resolve. </p>

<p>As for pizza being code, it&#39;s not much of a leap to consider mafia have terms for common things. Any subculture has its own language, and often they re-define words to mean different things. In order to find the evidence, one has to lurk the dark web, where cheese pizza is code. Same as Clover. CLover. Child Lover. </p>

<p>Any group that is unwanted by the broader society will find a way to hide from the masses in plain sight while still advertising to those in the know. There are plenty of analogies to draw from.

<p>yes.  I&#39;m not debating whether or not people speak in code.  but there&#39;s no evidence that &quot;pizza&quot; or &quot;hot dog&quot; or french fry or whatever is pedo code.  whoever made that up is playing to cognitive bias.  and maybe it IS code, but could just as easily be code for gay sex or cocaine or some other thing people wouldn&#39;t want to speak frankly about.  but there&#39;s not even evidence that it IS code.  When I was in college, i knew people who used pizza as code for ordering weed over the phone.  I&#39;m not arguing over whether it&#39;s possible- in know it is.  I&#39;m saying this story is flimsy and the leaps are crazy- and I&#39;m saying this as someone who sees very real conspiracies everywhere and knows all about this stuff.</p>

I used to think there are some leaps but this article <a href="https://aceloewgold.com/2016/11/20/pizzagate-clinton-podesta-what-is-it-and-is-it-credible/">https://aceloewgold.com/2016/11/20/pizzagate-clinton-podesta-what-is-it-and-is-it-credible/</a> is quite enlightening (if it&#39;s too long just look at the pics)</p>

<p>well said.  This is something we just FEEL.  We know there&#39;s this vague nebulous concept of corruption and we know it&#39;s not fair.  And we also know that we don&#39;t have the same way of life that we used to.  So a candidate and the media that supports them can just pray on that idea and we&#39;ll associate whatever we want with it.  There don&#39;t need to be facts or nuance there to back it up or measure its weight, because we FEEL it&#39;s true and it gives us something to blame.</p>

<p>this happens on both sides, but your right that one side has really preyed on a low information populist demography.  and honestly i think that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re seeing a continuation of with this pizzagate thing.  it&#39;s low information, it&#39;s bad logic, but appeals to something very visceral- &quot;but what about the children?&quot;.  On the other side, the mirror image is the &quot;racism of the alt right&quot; associated with fake anti-semitism accusations and this richard spencer guy, and all the swastika/ trump graffiti going up in cities.</p>

<p>hitler and child molestation are THE two things that are unquestionably WRONG.  They&#39;re always used to associate the other side with evil, and should always be questioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Alt Right thing, from everything I&#39;ve seen from all sides, is in fact extremely messed up, and I went into it not looking to condemn, but to understand before I made quick judgments. Check out the Daily Stormer for what&#39;s basically a more radical Breitbart with the slurs and segregationalist/white identity is US identity stuff intact. Their head guy writes of Bannon as &quot;alt-lite,&quot; not fully representative of the alt right idea, which is, unfortunately, neo-nazi and fascist by any reasonable metric. </p>

<p>I realize the likelihood of the partisan mirror and how tempting it might be to fake hate crimes in order to make the other side look heinous, but have so far found less than a handful of faked incidents, which the far right is using in much the same way actual evidence of unethical leftist behavior-- Donna Brasile&#39;s &quot;leaked&quot; expectation of a death penalty questions coming up during a CNN debate, for instance-- has been used as a seed of corruption and doubt that SURELY must just be the tip of the iceberg, leading to happily taking money from terrorist governments, international child sex rings, satanic blood rituals, etc. </p>

<p>i see it all the time.  there are swastikas going up all over my city.  just logically, it doesn&#39;t make sense for trump supporters to graffiti &quot;trump&quot; next to a swastika.  Here&#39;s an example of a Jewish kid putting up trump swastika graffiti in a church:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5d35wb/fake_hate_jewish_students_painted_swastika_and/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5d35wb/fake_hate_jewish_students_painted_swastika_and/</a></p>

<p>you&#39;ll note that the top comment indicates that there&#39;s no evidence that the kid is jewish (he clearly is), and it also adds that the daily stormer picked up the story.  The daily stormer is the perfect honey pot for driving fake anti-semitism.  I called out joshua ryne goldberg for posting there before he was arrested by the FBI.  But he isn&#39;t the only example of fake anti-semitism that we have on r/conspiracy.  are constantly bombarded with it.  it&#39;s a political/ ideological strategy and part of the narrative.</p>

<p>And breitbart is NOT &quot;neonazi&quot;.  Yeah, they clearly don&#39;t like black people or muslims- welcome to white working class america.  And everyone expected this backlash.  You have a lot of white people living in poverty who have always been told to blame dark folks for their problems, and they&#39;re constantly being inundated with non-stories about welfare queens and crack and urban crime.  Now they&#39;re being told they they&#39;re cis-white-males whose opinions don&#39;t matter because they&#39;re the patriarchy.  they&#39;re not the patriarchy, but you just invented an identity group- good luck with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true that the motivations for shit like that cannot be known, and anyone who does so is simply spreading fear, and it sucks. I too had the initial notion that the logic of associating Trump with nazism and anti-antisemitism is illogical, and that painting such shit makes no sense, but logic is at an all-time low right now, especially among frustrated people recently elevated to all-time highs of finally being recognized, or however you want to put it. Is a mass misinformation-hate campaign more unlikely than morons spreading fear for fear&#39;s sake? I would argue that it probably is, and I&#39;m still an optimist in humanity&#39;s basic decency, for some reason. </p>

<p>I see Breitbart as Fox News given a populist, younger-skewing makeover. I didn&#39;t claim that Breitbart is neo-nazi, only that it&#39;s a very watered down and palatable version of that concept&#39;s root claims. The connection perhaps need not be made at all, but I can&#39;t help but examine the strings. They have someone like Soros as their evil-socialist-rich guy mascot now instead of focusing on his heritage, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a piece of the thing. Islam, though, is now openly demonized, and has been combined with extant &quot;evil progressive/feminist/PC police&quot; concepts. I appreciate your take on the white working class America mindset, it has been thoroughly shaped beyond their direct experience and perhaps common sense.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about a coordinated campaign, though in a way, there ARE coordinated campaigns to this effect.  I&#39;m talking about an obvious reaction of people who are told over and over again that they are victims of the &quot;bigotry&quot; and &quot;racism&quot; that the media is associating with trump.  I&#39;m not downplaying racism and bigotry.  But Matthew Shepard&#39;s mother doing an anti-trump ad IS part of a coordinated event.</p>

<p>The swastikas going up in cities all across the US are NOT racists coming out of the woodwork, who finally believe it&#39;s ok to hate jews (trump and his cabal have never in any way represented anti-semitism.  this is just part of an attempt to create a narrative which drives fear and division).  I just found this in the paper today about the &quot;hate speech&quot; graffiti in my neighborhood associating trump with anti-black sentiment. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/12/nj_man_charged_with_pro-trump_vandalism_in_philly.html">http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/12/nj_man_charged_with_pro-trump_vandalism_in_philly.html</a></p>

<p>but the media will never admit this is a false flag campaign almost every time.  it&#39;s too much for people to get their heads around, because it doesn&#39;t fit what they think is going on.</p>

This election proved that the repeated suggestion of corruption is all the public needs to be convinced of corruption, somehow. Quantity over quality, not to mention truth...it&#39;s the very doctrine of the populist idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched the youtube videos.  i&#39;ve seen &quot;the evidence&quot;, and I&#39;ve drawn the conclusion that there are wild leaps being made to assume these pizza parlors are being used as an underground network to traffic children for the purpose of pedophilia.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s something specific that I seem to be ignoring, then I&#39;d like to know, so i can take it into account when forming an opinion.</p>
