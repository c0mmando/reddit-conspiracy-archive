       DOJ And Rule 41&lt;-------------------
      </p>
      <p>
       This quite frankly scares the crap out of me and it happens in a couple days.. I believe this to be a topic of extreme importance to all conspiracies in general right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine that all people who attempt to become anonymous on the internet getting put onto an FBI list to become one of the "thousands of devices searchable with one warrant."
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not even touching on how it could become a diplomatic nightmare because it's basically saying it can put out global warrants for arrest. Just read folks. Don't take my word for it just look at the documents.

       Democracy is an ideal that blinds the people to the actual oligarchy that stepped into power.  Authority is a claim made by one party and acquiesced to by another.  The democracy that we were sold never existed- it is nothing more than the definition of the  system we now live under.  The true values of this system are plain, and we are deluded to believe it serves the interests of any but the psychotic few.  The political system is slavery.  Totalitarianism, fascism, communism, socialism, progressivism....these are all different masks on the same face.  Some masks are more appealing to certain people.  But the face underneath remains the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word
       <em>
        anarchy
       </em>
       comes from the Greek words '
       <em>
        a/an
       </em>
       ' meaning against/opposite of/without, and '
       <em>
        archon
       </em>
       ' meaning ruler.  So the word anarchy literally means "without rulers".  So it is not a state of "no rules", but one of no rulERS or masters...which is the definition of FREEDOM.  Look at the way this word has been co-opted and contorted in our lexicon.  For many people it drums up ideas of chaos and lawlessness, when the ACTUAL word means "a state of not having masters".
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to be extremely critical and cognizant of the way words are used against us by the control system.

       Our society today is called Neo-Feudalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Medieval System of Government, never left us, it simply adapted to changing times. Nobility is a real thing, we(You and I) are peasants without even being aware of it, well of peasants in relation to most of the worlds peasants.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Oligarchy rule and own the Industry's, Banking, and Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Religious leaders appease to the peasants daily struggle by promising a light at the end of the tunnel
      </p>
      <p>
       -Military protects the oligarchy Abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Police protect the Oligarchy domestically.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Every form of tax is the peasants way of paying homage to the oligarchy for protection. With taxes upwards of 40% for well off peasants, is used to crush the upper-middle class to prevent new oligarchs.
      </p>
      <p>
       -You're a land baron if you own property ( Ie...ranch,farm, apartment housing).
      </p>
      <p>
       -Merchant if you own a small business.( Which is why they are trying to crush small business owners)
      </p>
      <p>
       -House ownership is way over priced in relation to what you actually get, less than an acre, with a glorified TeePee on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       -You're fenced in like a sheep through something we call a "border". You can visit other ranches (countrys) but you sure as hell can't stay unless you bring something big to the table, Like $250,000 investment to get into a country like Ireland
      </p>
      <p>
       -Your given an "identification" number at birth something they call a "Social Security Number", what does that even mean??? Like a tattoo on a holocaust victims arm.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does the Income gap mean? What does unfair wealth distribution mean? It means is an ever polarizing Peasant-Noble society/economy.

       The CIA Factbook (2015) defines the USA government as "a constitution-based, Federalist Republic, with strong democratic traditions".

       What about that spells Freedom? A Republic (especially if Federalist), is about as far from democracy as one can get, while maintaining the illusion that "the sovereign" has any kind of choice.

      <p>
       I am just pointing it out, because I am frustrated with how many people argue from the position of,
      </p>
      <p>
       1)America should be a Democracy
2)America doesn't resemble a Democracy
      </p>
      <p>
       In making that the foundation of their argument, they are actually defeating themselves, before they even begin.

       Some of what you said is accurate, but your SSN regardless of whether you agree with the program itself is necessary for identification purposes. If we want to live in a more secure society. Yes there will always be bad guys able to steal your identity, but it makes it just that much more difficult when you add in another layer of security like SSN.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be far too hard to track hundreds of millions/billions of people simply by name alone, especially when thousands of people have the same name.

       SSN were never meant to be used for identification. That they are has created more problems than solved. Use of SSN was meant to be relegated to use by Social Security offices. Just a way to get and track SS payments, not a way for third parties to record your credit history, medical history, education history. Each of these entities should be producing their own unique identifiers for you (in addition to your account number or medical record number). As it is, a SSN is a great skeleton key to someone's identity.

       The only true sovereignty that exists is that of one over their individual self, and that is based on the Natural Law of the universe, not any law that man can make.  Authority doesn't truly exist as a force in this universe; it is claim that one person makes that another then agrees to.  It is a contract created between two parties that has no bearing on anything outside of the words of the contract.  A claim of sovereignty by an outside source over anything but that outside source's own individual self is a claim of authority that is not real or valid.

       Thank you for admitting that sovereignty doesn't exist (as most think it does). Authority is merely a measure of either conquest or consent, and is arrived at through natural methods.

       This is something I have been trying to discuss for some time on this thread, but people continue to want to ignore it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to know what happened to your 4th Amendment?  It's called the Third Party Doctrine, as well as multiple other governmental programs that you may want to look into.  To anyone that was paying attention, this is nothing surprising.  Please, people, educate yourselves about the very real things that are happening and quit getting distracted by stupid shit that doesn't matter.  No offense to you, or anyone else, but for a bunch of people who believe in conspiracies some of you really do go out of your way to ignore the very real stuff happening right in front of you.  Why?  Because it's not a "conspiracy" anymore?  It doesn't mean that it doesn't matter nor that you shouldn't know about it (as based on some of the responses I have gotten a lot of people don't know about this stuff, and that's terrifying in it's own right).

       IF you're using companies to encrypt for you then you're placing your trust onto them. That's not what i meant. I meant things like end to end encryption which is open source without any backdoors, such as signal by openwhispersystems.

       It's sad and strange how we once used to look at dystopian novels like 1984 as the stuff of nightmares when under our noses, they were quietly coming to life. Our constitutional rights are being circumvented as we speak.

       Well, VPN users will now officially be people of interest.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       I use a VPN for a few reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         When browsing the Internet at a coffee shop I use a VPN to encrypt my traffic so nobody can sniff it out (which is pretty easy to do using Wireshark).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The only way to connect to my work's network is with a VPN.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sometimes I use Xfinity Wifi and I don't want the owner of that router sniffing my packets.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I kid you not, but sometimes I get faster Internet speeds at home when using a VPN; so why wouldn't I use one?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This is just ludicrous. It's only a matter of time until we all have Internet IDs.

       He was allegedly the leader of Anonymous.  But, also, most people don't know that Reddit was conceived as an extension of Aaron's work on RSS, which was supposed to be a completely decentralized communications system in which individual users published RSS feeds filled with enough syntax meta-information that they could be aggregated by the browser into a forum format.

       Well,  basically I see this as no different in the sense, of creating new laws, then pushing them through worldwide. That's what's going on here. The FBI has done this twice before related to a CP sting the article said, but this Rule 41 law will be for in perpetuity, if enacted. Just like the drug war laws were, which propagated to every corner of the globe, after US lead the charge.

       So Obama hands over Internet addressing to the UN, and will sign off on making VPN's illegal on his way out the door. They really seem to be realizing the Internet got out of their control, and are trying to put the cat back into the bag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course realistically speaking I doubt VPN's could hide you from the sophisticated kind of tracking the intelligence agencies were already using. Even TOR is supposed to have been compromised. So i'm not sure what this is other than maybe an intimidation tactic?

       TOR has weaknesses, it's not some high and mighty best security of the internets technology that you make it out to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       VPNs can very much hide you. They don't have some super secret government utility that can render a VPN useless. Now if they can force the provider of the VPN to turn over records and such, that's a different story.

       Yes.. but this just makes it legal now my good sir. That is why it is so important to put as many eyes on this as possible. Of course they are already doing it.. But this gives them legal authority (Ha) to do these actions without fear of prosecution.

       "To: Members of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules. 
From: American Civil Liberties Union. 
Date: April 4, 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: ACLU Comment on the Proposed Amendment to Rule 41 Concerning Remote
      </p>
      <p>
       Searches of Electronic Storage Media
      </p>
      <p>
       The American Civil Liberties Union writes to offer its perspective on the proposed amendment to Rule 41 concerning remote searches of electronic storage media. The Rule 41 Subcommittee approved the proposal (over a dissenting vote) on March 12, 2014, and forwarded it to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules (“Advisory Committee”) in a March 17, 2014, memorandum. The proposal is on the agenda for consideration at the Advisory Committee’s April 7–8, 2014, public meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The proposed amendment would significantly
       <strong>
        expand the government’s authority to conduct remote searches of electronic storage media
       </strong>
       . Those searches raise serious Fourth Amendment questions. It would also expand the government’s power to engage in computer hacking in the course of criminal investigations, including through the use of malware and other techniques that pose a risk to internet security and that raise Fourth Amendment and policy concerns. In light of these concerns, the ACLU recommends that the Advisory Committee exercise extreme caution before granting the government new authority to remotely search individuals’ electronic data."

       This is serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       'They' do this already though. Since 911 at least. Probably well before that. It's on the books, NDAA. 'They' can say you're a suspected "terrorist" and your done, you might as well be dead. This is just an elaboration. Truly, there is nothing new to worry about, it is just an update. There are no real consequences for the government or anyone with the resources, never have been. We are not sovereign, they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theoretically any one with the knowledge can use the governments resources and networks for their own personal ends. Multiplying the danger. This could also be humanities saving grace.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to assume that someone is always watching to be safe. Not just while using technology, but in every aspect of our lives. 'They' want to do to the internet what cctv does for a theme park, and much more. Panopticon. All too soon they will try and do the same with your mind, in a far more literal way than being incessantly bombarded with mass media.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're either with them or against them. There are no neutral parties or questions allowed. This is war. It looks different than we expected, but we are are all living in a war-zone, while also living in a mental prison. What passes for the little crumbs of freedom we have left is simply an intelligence gathering operation before a larger clamp down.

        It also wants to treat anything that anonymizes internet users or hides their locations to be presumed acts of a guilty mind. The stripping of jurisdictional limits not only grants the FBI worldwide access for digital seizures and searches, but also encourages it to go venue shopping for judicial rubber stamps.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As much power as the FBI might want to have, there are certain things which just aren't mathematically possible for them to do. They cannot always determine the identity of somebody using location protection software. VPNs, TOR networks, and other forms of protection. As a resident of California, they'd never be able to find me from a public location, because there's always a way to tunnel somewhere else to make it look like you're from somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I just spoofed you, I'm not from California. Not like it matters, you probably wouldn't be able to verify it. The FBI is going to try to collect heaps of data to try and pin point people to being criminals when they're probably not. Looking at big data, most of it is actually useless for developing any sort of plausible model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, if we are expecting to grant the FBI worldwide access to seizures and somehow claim legality, it will only hurt online business, both by giving legal authority to an entity that shouldn't have international powers, as well as making the US open to other countries granting international powers to meddle in other countries internet activity as well.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       It also opens up a lot of issues. If people control your online behavior, don't they also diminish your 4th amendment rights? Is that something we are forgetting in this day and age? we do have a bill of rights and we should damn well fight for it as Americans. Along with every other right the constitution grants us. Because, let's face it. If we don't like our government, it's up to us to change it.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I live to support and defend the constitution of the United States, and I will bear true alliegance to those sacred values that brought about its birth in the first place, to create a society of free thinkers where government wasn't oppresive, but rather a force to help people, not frighten them. No more big brother, no more 1984

       If you could get this story out to every american I bet it wouldn't be able to sneak through all the distractions so easily. I feel this is what we should be focused on in the immediate future. Because if this fails a lot of investigations will have to fear the long arm of the USA. (Even if you live abroad.)

       Chances the OSU shooter was placed to distract attention away from this? I've seen articles about Rule 41 all over the place today (today is actually the first time I've seen them) so I can conclude that word is spreading quickly about it.

       Is it likely TPTB needed to put everyone's attention elsewhere for the next few days while this slips by unnoticed?

       The first two things I did this morning after finding out about the OSU shooting: 
1. Contacted my friends that go there to know theyre safe.
2. Lurked all conspiracy cables (literally jokingly) to see what could possibly be going on within the rest of the USA that may be important.

      <p>
       I truthfully thought "why am i putting on my tinfoil hat right now" until stumbling upon this. Classic diversion. All that will be talked about on MSM and most social media for the coming weeks will now be how 8 people were inured in yet another "mass shooting".

       It is serious. The world is waking up, bit by bit, day by day. The next global conflict will be a true uprising against "the masters" because all talk will inevitably fail and they will push us to it finally. We just better make sure we finish the job and actually change our system of slavery.

       Coincidental timing that a "mass shooting" at yet another college campus (the Ohio State University) occured this morning which will inevitably bring about "more important subject matter" on MSM regarding gun violence or not? BRB putting on my tinfoil hat.

       This amendment literally tries to put bot nets on the same level as counter terrorism and national security mandating the need for out of district warrants.

       And they clearly skirt the truth by saying "this is consistent with existing practices".. Yea against terrorism and the likes.. but not normal people.

       You should always assume "the internet" and any other network you connect to is compromised. Always have a

       tied to your wrist and assume swat is going to jump through your window and tackle you to the floor at any moment. Run linux and encrypt your drives. Your adversaries always have the advantage of picking when and where to strike. This law doesn't change that.

       Nothing, as long as calling people or saying things is all you're prepared to do. The time for hyper-violent resistance is now. Either we blow up every data center being used to spy on us, or we consent to being ruled by tyrants.

       It's not terrorism, it's self-defense against an immediate and existential threat. Mass surveillance is an immediate precursor and direct facilitator of every major genocide in the last century. Your nation was founded specifically to resist such tyranny, and that's why you have rules against mass surveillance in your constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       By putting you under mass surveillance, your government has betrayed you, and become your enemy. It has taken away from you a fundamental human right guaranteed in your nation's founding documents. If it took that human right away from you so easily and comfortably, what other rights is it prepared to take? Your right to free speech? Your right to keep breathing?
      </p>
      <p>
       But sure, write a letter to your representatives. History is
       <em>
        positively chock-full
       </em>
       of references to tyrannical surveillance states brought down because someone wrote a letter. And while you debate the next passive course of action, it grows in power, making the chances of successful resistance less likely.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So you want every federal agent to only use one judge for certain crimes? That's pretty convenient if you are trying to hide something like SAPs being sold or anything game changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could also be a win for the good guys if they were the majority.. But the lack of democratic backlash over this law coming into place just screams something is up! Are they all about our rights and liberties as we think? And this Rule 41 in the first place violates the 4th amendment if you are considered a threat to national security, why should a bot-net rank up there with national security?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is this proof that bot-nets are so dangerous it requires perverting the 4th for americans and infers to being used elsewhere to bring charges against people in other countries. We should definitely have a review of this in great detail.

       From what I have read on Guatemala and what went down there. I can see your point on the drug wars pushing U.S law. It's scary how a look into what happened in the early 80's of Guatemala shows what a corrupt government is capable of.

       IF you're using companies to encrypt for you then you're placing your trust onto them. That's not what i meant. I meant things like end to end encryption which is open source without any backdoors, such as signal by openwhispersystems.

       Is this something that has happened in the past? Would be an interesting topic to discuss if other controversial government happenings too place shortly after a mass shooting or other attack (hostage, bombing, etc).
