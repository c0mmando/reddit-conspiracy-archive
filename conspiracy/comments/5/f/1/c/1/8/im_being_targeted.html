       Believe what you want, OP is delusional.... Has mental illness blah blah blah.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I've been going through has been a covert operation against me, since September I've been suffering silently. Currently I use an emf detector.. And it reads sky fucking high. Upon waking up I feel achy and my organs are too
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now I'm sitting down at a restaurant and I checked my heart beat and it's resting at 116bpm....ummm that's not normal. This is all directed energy weapons. These people are sick and twisted, it's the perfect way to harm/kill someone. If you start talking about it to friends and family.... Guess what?  You're going to the psyche ward.

       Call me crazy but I believe I was targeted through my iPhone beginning in October, when the spirit cooking stuff came out. I believe my iPhone was hacked and some program was running causing something to trigger weird shit in my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        A day after the elections an iPhone update was released
       </strong>
       and everything stopped. I tried to look into what the release changed and apple did not say what it was in the release notes. (Tin foil hat stuff I know)
      </p>
      <p>
       [edit] all I can describe it like was, it felt like that lingering sound you hear after you shoot a pistol without ear protection.. that constant high frequency buzz more subtle but def like that.. It was annoying as fuck feeling that feeling constantly. Weird shit

       R.N.M. works remotely (ever wondered why have we all been driven relentlessly towards wireless systems?) to control the brain under the objective to detect any criminal thought taking place inside the mind of a possible culprit.  Inevitable question: How can you isolate a criminal thought if you do not have a comparative measure of non-criminal thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       This undertaking is based on two principles:
      </p>
      <p>
       The research studies have shown that the humanoid intellect thinks at a speed of about 5 kilobits per second and, therefore, does not have the capability to contest with supercomputers acting via satellites, implants and biotelemetry.
The human brain has a characteristic set of bioelectric resonance structure. By using supercomputers, the R.N.M. system can home in on it, and send messages through an embedded individual’s nervous system in order to affect their performance in a preferred way.
The entire system has been developed

       False. Since you posted in a sub that is not a targeted individual sub, you need to define your abbreviations. Don't be lazy. Either define or don't use abbreviations. Type out the words.

       RNM is the abbreviation for remote neural monitoring. RNM does not induce humming. RNM is solely remotely monitoring brain EEG waves and thoughts. See the remote neural monitoring wiki in

       They're creating a dependence system with people and their
       <em>
        fucking
       </em>
       phones. (sorry, but I really can't stand seeing people with their heads down and on their phones all the time. Not EVERYONE, but man......).
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, I think, people's health will be come dependent on their smart phones (or rather, anything with the "Smart" label in front of it). Maybe in a couple of generations the effects will show a bit more.

       Hell, I have an older Droid HERO model, with a broken screen that I really only use for an alarm clock and at work when someone needs to call me. Other than that, I don't even carry it on me.

       I'm fucking fed up with it all, at first I didn't speak about it because of the total fear they had on me. But i can't just stay silent anymore....there has to be thousands that are suffering and I wouldn't be able to live with myself not speaking up. Most will dismiss me because it's unfathomable, why me? I'm not that special... But there's so much information involved with my story. I'm dominican but look middle eastern... And I think that plays a  part in all this.. Also I'm pretty good with computers and have used Tor for years. I'm in a constant state of surveillance now.

       Why are you covering for

       Thanks for speaking up, I am targeted too in Iran. Don't worry about everyone asking why, TBTB are psychopaths and I find it amusing that they keep asking why, like they need a reason to torture...a lot of it is done for research purposes for those who think they're chosen randomly or they choose people with strong brain waves cuz they're sensitive to their tech and ruin their life so they give out shit emotions cuz telepathy is natural

       I don't doubt that this sort of thing is real but so is mental Illness,and we have much more evidence that it can happen to people than we do for covert use of directed energy weapons against the general population.

       I don't mean to sound patronising but I have experience with mental illness and if your being serious then you tick a lot of the boxes.

       I would urge to see a doctor who you trust ,just to rule out anything mental health related before you pursue any other avenues.

This is why I believe many mass shootings have happened, they are trying to mold me..into something I'm not for political reasons.

       The government absolutely can analyze our internet use,i have no doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can also use secret weaponry to make us ill,this is a real thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what are you going to do ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing you can do?
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand if there is even a tiny chance that what you are experiencing is mental health related,you could rid yourself these symptoms with a simple course of pills.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean are you going to sit around feeling like this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously you have to do something,you can't go on like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is the government you would need to get proof and pursue legal avenues possibly media,i don't really know,it would be a long and complex difficult thing to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to speak to a doctor or a family member you trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must rule out any chance of mental illness before you do anything else
      </p>
      <p>
       Get some medication and treatment even if you dont think anything is wrong and if you still feel like this after treatment then you will know it is real and can decide what action to take.

       If there are people who are doing this, and those people have been proven to have conducted unwarranted, surreptitious medical experimentation on people (military research intelligence), why would it be a stretch to think they would sometimes pick people randomly and monitor the effects on them?

       Please see the list of confirmed conspiracies on the right sidebar, for MKULTRA, mind control, directed energy technology and the history of US military intelligence experimentation and the same from other goverments throughout the world.  This might surprise you.

       I'm well aware of these and i don't rule out the possibility but things like schizophrenia and psychosis are also very real and very common,we have no known statistics for use of secret government weaponry.

       I absolutely agree they should rule it out.  I just figured they had already since they had obtained an EMF meter.  Then it's a matter of making sure they did a control read, like in a field far from power lines and such

       btw the government will never publish statistics on surreptitious human experimentation or torture...we're going to need hackers to "open up the government" on that issue, and/or insider leaks like snowden

The government has not previously nor presently picked people randomly for medical experiments. Prior subjects were prisoners, institutionalized children due to being orphans or mormons, institutionalized adults and enlisted military officers and draftees.

       We also sprayed chemtrails, some of which had dangerous club moss lycopodium spores that cause a cancerlike growth when it gets into cuts.  They sprayed off the coast of charleston and it dispersed over 3 states and settled onto populations, unknowingly.  That's human experiementation in my book.  You may call it somehting different.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with saying the people were volunteers or on the payroll is that these people did not know what they were getting into and were dosed with serious drugs that screwed them up forever.  Also, the CIA redacted stuff and has been caught lying before, so we really don't know if those prostitutes were knowingly "on the cia payroll' or just paid by 'random johns'

       Absolutely false. Targets were chosen randomly for LSD dosage and monitoring of interaction with prostitutes trying to get them to divulge information at several safe house. Read about Operation Midnight Climax. I would say the majority of MKUltra victims were chosen randomly. Some happened to be institutionalized for reasons such as depression when Ewen Cameron practiced psychic driving on them- leaving some permanently comatose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marshal Thomas is not a good source. Much of his research is opinion-based and I vehemently disagree with his conclusion that individuals are targeted and followed around and surrounded by "agents" in the guise of their neighbors. That's ridiculous.

       Chosen at random. That was the only criteria. Dr. Ewen Cameron (head of the APA and WPA) "chose" his victims by the criteria that they were admitted into a psych hospital. These victims weren't picked for personal reasons.  People who think they've been singled out for torture bc they wrote an angry op-ed piece for their local newspapers are delusional.

       No. I am not a fan of your subreddit. We've been through this before. I have said you run it like a little dictator, making rules about how many times I can cite my site. If you really want the truth to get out, you'd ask if you could put my site in the sidebar. Because you have not read it, I, once again, have to correct you about MKUltra 101 information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The information in that subreddit is frequently wrong and is not based on real research. It cites sources like Thomas. Then, when someone who has actually read Tomas corrects you, you say Thomas' ideas are ridiculous. You think you can shield yourself. You refuse to read actual research I recommend to you and you ask that I take you by the hand and show you things of interest one at a time. I made my website so I don't have to do that.

        “MKULTRA Subproject 119 was a literature review which included a summary of existing information on “Techniques of activation of the human organism by remote electronic means.” What a coincidence that I, and so many others, were told we were “activated.” According to a report in Defense Electronics, [64] consideration was given to using non-lethal weapons technology on David Koresh during the Branch Davidian siege in the spring of 1993. P. 105 Research on the ability of magnetic fields to facilitate the creation of false memories and altered states of consciousness is apparently funded by the Defense Intelligence Agency through the project cryptonym SLEEPING BEAUTY. “Sleeping Beauty was a Defense Department study of remote microwave mind-influencing techniques.” [65] P. 116“ Much more information below:

       Proof CIA created mind-controlled assassins that would not even remember that they killed
      </p>
      <p>
       Another document dated 10 Feb 1954 describes an experiment on the creation of unsuspecting assassins: “Miss [deleted] was instructed (having previously expressed a fear of firearms) that she would use every method at her disposal to awaken miss [deleted] (now in a deep hypnotic sleep). Failing this, she would pick up a pistol and fire it at Miss [deleted]. She was instructed that her rage would be so great that she would not hesitate to ‘kill’ [deleted]. Miss [deleted] carried out these suggestions including firing the (unloaded) gun at [deleted], and then proceeded to fall into a deep sleep. After proper suggestions were made, both were awakened. Miss [deleted] expressed absolute denial that the foregoing sequence had happened.” (CIA Mori ID 190691, 2/10/54)

       The above info is from my website. You would be exponentially more educated on this subject you spend so much time on if you actually read it, instead of complaining about its format.

       Another reason I don't want to co-mod your sub is that you ignore my requests to read real research, and over and over again, I have to correct you. I wouldn't have to do this if you took 20 minutes to read my research- let alone Dr. Duncan's books. Oh, you'll criticize them, but not read them. That's hypocritical.

       In wanttoknow.info they list other MKUltra subprojects. Some have goals like, "Can we seize a subject and get him to crash a plane using hypnosis?" "Can we get a subject to act against his or her own better judgement, even if it means their death?"

       The initial rule was everyone who promoted their blogsite, website or youtube channel could do it once. I was enforcing Reddit's rule on self promotion.

Reciprocation is fair.

       You had complied. You had unlimited self promotion as long as your website keeps referring the sub and the survey questionnaire. However, you didn't link post to your blogsite. You removed the suvey questionnaire.

       Not saying I don't believe you, but you didn't really give any explanation of what makes you think you're being targeted other than an emf detector that reads high levels.. AFAIK electromagnetic fields can be caused by something as simple as faulty wiring and can have an effect psychologically (like the rapid heartbeat, can cause hallucinations/paranoia). Again, not saying I don't believe you, I was just curious as to what makes you believe this is a result of you being targeted other than the unusual electromagnetic field.

       It could be some sort of microwave weapon, there's plenty of precedence for that. We have devices that emit microwave radiation (which excites molecules, causing energy to build up and cook the food), available to the public, and have had them in excess of 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Microwave radiation gives off electromagnetic frequences when emmited, as will the device being used to emit them.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Denial_System">
        This reminds me of the military's Active Denial System
       </a>
       , that uses microwave radiation to heat up the water inside of your skin, and cause debilitating pain. Like you're being cooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only difference between the two is the exact frequency used, as the military's public 'nonlethal' version isn't capable of penetrating deep tissue. I believe that your heart rate increase could be caused by a vasovagal response to the trauma caused by such a device.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you found the right materials, you could attempt to build a faraday cage, and hide it underneath a hoodie and pants. Or pajamas, as it seems you're being targeted at night. If you can, try and shield the whole room, and hole up inside. They could attempt to gain access to use this device against you.

       I think the best thing you can do is just stay calm. With so much fear in you, you'll be giving yourself adrenal fatigue which will make you more tired than you already are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are being targeted then you need a calm and clear head to be able to deal with the situation. Maybe set up something so friendly people can help with the stuff you need to buy to help deflect that shit.

       Did you test the EMF meter under a control situation--maybe give it to a friend and have them read it in the middle of a field or something?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       One thing you can try that is inexpensive is to get mylar sheets (or aluminum foil), hang them in a small area in your house with banana clips clipped to the ground wire (middle lower wire) of the wall to ground it (easiest to cut an old 3 prong cord and tape off the 2 sides and connect the banana clip to the bottom one (usually green or green-yellow striped), but best to just trace it to the ground prong)
      </p>
      <p>
       Then retest with your emf meter and see if it reduces the readings.  You can get more expensive and complex with it by adding a layer of tight weave steel hardware cloth, building a more official faraday cage.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can get this from home depot and just try it out (again hooking it to the single wall ground wire), and if it doesn't work to greatly reduce the emf, then just return it.

       Taking measurements in the middle of a field will give a baseline reading of the environment but not of the body. Instructions on how to measure DEW attacks are in the meter reports wiki in

       .

       The torturers can increase dirty electricity on house wiring. The ground wire needs to be tested and retested for dirty electricity. See the dirty electricity wikis and the earthing wikis in

       Best to run a copper speaker wire through a window to a steel stake in the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I submitted a shielding report that wearing three mylar ponchos did not shield maser and laser attacks. Aluminum shields electromagnetic fields very poorly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earthing does help. I earth every day by walking barefoot or in earthing shoes on grass at a park.  Wiring a blanket, sleeping bag, sleeping mat, floor mat below a computer, etc. are good ways to earth if the wiring is connected to a stake in the earth.

       Can you rule out all other causes before you go down this road of assuming you are targeted?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are a big coffee drinker you might want to look at potassium and magnesium and their relationship to tinnitus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what about dirty electricity? There's a great documentary from Canada called 16x9 Dirty Energy that might help you navigate this situation

       Ok I am no doctor, you will have to do some googling on the subject. 
If you drink any diuretic or caffeine, it messes with your electrolytes - Magnesium, Potassium and Sodium. This, in turn impacts your nerves. When these three are not in the right proportions, people get ill. I suppose a doctor might say everything will be fine if you eat a balanced diet, but how many of us do? I have taken magnesium and it got rid of visual migraines and neck tension. The tinnitus is still there, but I am around EMF fields at work (generators).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when I type on my iphone my left hand goes numb. I tend to talk with the phone on my left ear, and get neck tension on the left side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am going to try updating the iOS to see if that makes any difference.

       Yes. Omnisense is a friend of mine. You and he are both spot-on with the realization that AI is critical to the conspiracy and that they would cast a large net for targets to get samples from a wide variety of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Omnisense,org is a great resource for anyone looking into this seriously. Microwavedindividual has ignored all the research I've directed him to and comes up with his own theories. He calls them facts but then cites people like Marshal Thomas who is writing opinion that common sense contradicts- for example Marshal believes entire neighborhoods are constructed against targets with all neighbors being active agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can friend Omnisense on Twitter and/or Facebook. He'll help you with solid research. My site has a lot of factual irrefutable evidence from MSM sources as well:

       I really resent how often you state "facts" which are completely false. This isn't fair- it's like making me double over my research and work again, just to illustrate, over and over, that you're lazy, haven't done proper research, and behave like a dictator, making statements that are simply wrong, can be proven wrong, and you wouldn't make if you read the research I've practically begged you to read.

       I entered "omnisense manchurian candidate" in ixquick.com's search engine. No blog on manchurian candidates from omnisense.org came up. The blogsite does not have a search engine. The table of contents are partially hidden with large pin wheels. Omnisense self defeated his blogs by covering them up with pin wheels.

       Regarding Aaron Alexis, Omnisense provided no evidence that he was mind controlled. Aaron Alexis was not.

      <p>
       The only TI Omnisense mentioned that possibly was mind controlled was Myron May. The other people he mentioned are not TIs. Myron May gave several reasons. A separate post on him would be a better place to debate.

       That's great. Everyone is responsible for educating themselves. I refuse to further take you by the hand and show you things you should already know. I recommended that user read my blog and Omnisense's. Both of you should. I can't be responsible for educating you on things you should know if you were responsible and did a little research on your own.

       Ridiculous. This is a stated MKUltra goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The driver in Kalamazoo stated he became possessed by an electronic Satan. Jared Loughner became obsessed with mind control. Myron May said he was a victim and that's why he was going on his shooting spree. 
Many victims have experienced this possession by an electronic SATAN (silent assassinations through amplified neurons). It's written about extensively in The Matrix Deciphered (free to read online), which, for reasons I can only speculate on, you refuse to read. Hundreds of victims were surveyed and studied in the research phase of that book and it provides a lot of insight, yet you ignore it time and time again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some real research. At the minimum read all the mind control info at
       <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info">
        www.wanttoknow.info
       </a>
       . They've uncovered many of the goals for MKUltra. Creating programmed killers was a goal that was repeatedly stated in CIA literature.

       My statement "The goals of torturers is not to create manchurian candidates" applies to the present. Targeted individuals are not mind controlled to murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is it stated that a goal of MK-ULTRA was to create Manchurian candidates? Which articles from wanttoknow.info?
      </p>
      <p>
       PROJECT MK-ULTRA occurred decades ago. No targeted individual claimed that they are a Manchurian candidate. No TI who murdered stated they were going to murder because of mind control. Alexis and Myron May murdered because they were being fast killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What driver in Kalamazoo?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does it say Jared Loughner was a Manchurian candidate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Myron May was not a Manchurian candidate. Myron May was being fast killed by directed energy weapons. Not having knowledge of shielding, he suicided himself. He wanted to bring awareness. To create publicity, he murdered. Myron May never stated he was mind controlled to murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
      </p>
      <p>
       Your interpretation of SATAN (silent assassinations through amplified neurons) is completely different from other TI's interpretation. SATAN is not satanic possession. The footnote Robert Duncan gave for SATAN was #4 which was undisclose source. Robert Duncan did not create the theory of SATAN based on interviewing victims:
      </p>
      <p>
       [Perps: Goals] [Brain Zapping]
       <a href="/u/curiosity36">
        /u/curiosity36
       </a>
       interpreted "silent assassination through amplified neurons" (SATAN) as satanic possessed manchurian candidate. Brian Tew interpreted SATAN as the target is assassinated by remote brain zapping.

       You literally want me to hold your hand. Do a little actual research, read the mind control sections of wanttoknow.info. Read their material about Project Bluebird. There you will see that there were stated MKUltra goals about creating hypnotized assassins that wouldn't even remember they killed. They even have documents obtained through the FOIA that proved they were successful in this undertaking!
      </p>
      <p>
       You would know all this if you read my website. All documentation is there. You should really know these things. This is introductory material to the subject.

       Nowhere does it say that, however, if you were up to snuff on your research, you would definitely have that impression. Laughner underwent a complete identity change, started asking his profs if true mind control was possible, and (again with the Satan angle) built a shrine to Satan in his yard. I go into all this on my site, and you should have read it by now. It frustrates me constantly having to retype things for you bc you can't be bothered to read a 2 page website.

      <p>
       Truly brainwashed people don't know they're brainwashed. What May did say though was that his handlers were promising him his freedom if he went on a shooting spree. He said he was mind-controlled and then offered peace through killing. Then he killed. That sounds like a Manchurian to me. You would know this about May if you researched properly.

       Mayron May asked that in the Facebook group Targeted Individuals International. I don't do Facebook. You do. What was the response? Did other TIs admit being mind controlled to become a manchurian candidate? If not, then this is not a goal of perps.

        but my goal is to garner some much-needed media attention to the plight of targeted individuals because we are a marginalized group with few financial assets. Coincidentally, that means we get ignored.

       No other TI who were fast killed by directed energy weapons has murdered claiming they were mind controlled to do it.

       referred Covert Transhumanism because it discussed manchurian candidates, he needed to have said that and quoted or cited an URL.

       You had not asked me to read omnisense's blogsite. Yesterday, was the first time you discussed omnisense's blogsite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I entered "omnisense manchurian candidate" in ixquick.com's search engine. No blog on manchurian candidates from omnisense.org came up. The blogsite does not have a search engine. The table of contents are partially hidden with large pin wheels. Omnisense self defeated his blogs by covering them up with pin wheels.

       Since you initially conducted research, finding the sources should be easy and quick for you. What is your problem?

       We are not having a private conversation. You demand the 407,114 subscribers of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and me to blindly believe you unless they read your entire blogsite. You never link to a particular article or blog on your blogsite. You merely link to your entire blogsite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have submitted hundreds of posts, many of them medical papers. I am not lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop lying I haven't read the research you begged me to read. I have read some. You referred Eleanor White's book on shielding but would not submit a link post. I submitted the link post. We discussed her book.

       Regarding Aaron Alexis, Omnisense provided no evidence that he was mind controlled. Aaron Alexis was not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only TI Omnisense mentioned that possibly was mind controlled was Myron May. The other people he mentioned are not TIs. Myron May gave several reasons. A separate post on him would be a better place to debate.
