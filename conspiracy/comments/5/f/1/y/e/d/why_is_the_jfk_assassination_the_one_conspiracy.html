       Out of all the conspiracy theories out there, the assassination of JFK is the one where most average citizens have their own pet theories. LBJ, the mafia, the CIA, the list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the public so accepting of questioning that, but anything else makes you look like an unhinged nut?

       It's interesting to me.

       After shouting he was a patsy, being an obvious pawn asset (his work in Louisiana), then was shot on camera by a guy with mob ties after the police did a sweep wfeveryone there.

       Yeah, the fact he was yelling about being a patsy was really creepy. You'd figure if he really did assassinate the president, that he'd at least be motivated by some fanatical purpose that he'd preach about. I don't see any logical reason for him to have yelled about being a patsy unless he was crazy enough to think that would somehow get him off the hook.

       Its never nutty to question the official lies.   What gets nutty is when people waste a bunch on time on alternative theories that are nutty.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many decent investigators,  but conspiracy nuts would often rather mix themselves up with the kooky people who make a living from tantalizing tidbits of fringe material that is a disservice to the goal of getting average people to be willing to question the official lies.

       The Germans only knew the truth about the Reichstag fire after Nazi Germany was defeated. Unfortunately, the truth for many events within the Western world will never come to light, or perhaps.. it will take decades until truth about things are universally accepted. The power structure remains intact.

       Well, because it is so ridiculous. 
I believe they had a government comittee on assassination that admitted there was likely a conspiracy, but they didnt name possible suspects.

       I could be wrong on this, im just going off internet, other tab toooo farrr.

       Its funny because during that time they never knew in the future we would have youtube/forums to collaborate on ideas. So now it almost looks like a joke when you see how obvious that whole thing was, although very sad.

       Back then, people thought for themselves. People had actual journalists working in the media.

       Then operation mockingbird started (and never stopped) and the Western world changed forever.

       Now, if you question anything, you are mocked.

       Actually I've seen people become reinforced (believing the single gunman theory) recently - primarily because of the NOVA special.  It seemed like for years friends of mine and others were stating to accept the possibility of multiple gun men but after the NOVA program, they seem renewed in their confidence of the lone gun man theory.  Ugh

       Cause EVERYONE knows "they" killed Kennedy.  It's only a "conspiracy theory" in name (thanks to the CIA/FBI forced derogatory label nonsense that just completely backfired.
