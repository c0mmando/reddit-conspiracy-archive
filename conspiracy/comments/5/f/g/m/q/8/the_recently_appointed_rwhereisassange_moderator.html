       OP, anyone here can check your post history and see that all you've done lately is attack me (it's suspicious how many nit picks you seem to have and how much you recycle the exact same points). But attacking not knowing a title could be edited? Forgive me for being used to subs with title change policies, it was an admittedly dumb mistake, haha. That's just a little bit silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to be trying very hard to undermine our sub. As
       <a href="/u/iamdanger_us">
        /u/iamdanger_us
       </a>
       said before, banning
       <a href="/u/TheEarthquakeGirl">
        /u/TheEarthquakeGirl
       </a>
       was not my unilateral decision. She was banned only when her behavior became unreasonable and unprofessional. We have no issue at all with her sub, and linked to it in the sidebar and have encouraged others to go there for less organized and maintained discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not "recently appointed" either. I've been working with
       <a href="/u/iamdanger_us">
        /u/iamdanger_us
       </a>
       since the inception of the sub, and moderating Discord, I have only recently begun helping with moderation on the subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have standards for discussion to allow people to converse and share information. This requires we actually moderate somewhat, since otherwise vote farms for clickbait and hype content completely overrun our regular subscribers.

       We expect our users to conduct themselves according to standards, not to lower themselves to the level of those they are criticizing. That is childish and inappropriate for what we would like to be a serious sub for citizen journalism, investigation and information organization/discussion.

       If you think someone is acting inappropriately, report them. The "big deal" is responding with CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL anger and vitriol, and lashing out at users who attempted to criticize her behavior.

       Look don't take it personally, anyone would be suspicious with statements like these, as newly appointed mods no less. I don't know what your deal is, I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.

       I personally have no problem calling out shills after the exchanged has developed and reached the point of no return. "Fuck off" is reasonable enough. If anyone does it from the get-go, that is wrong, but being rude to someone after they are clearly shown to be an annoying shill is something else.

       Congratulations? I'm not sure what you hope to achieve by screencapping something I willingly admitted?
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't find it a huge deal. But, I do take it personally that almost all of your recent activity is attacking me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want our sub to experience censorship either. But the fact of the matter is that with the shill and vote farming activity since we've been "on the radar", organic voting is not accurately representing the interests of the sub. Certain posts have been repeatedly upvoted absurdly (compared to their comments), and are then reposted repeatedly by the same user or users that always seem to show up with the original poster. These threads without exception contain a handful of astrojerked comments at the top, with the dozen comments by longtime subscribers asking for it to be removed pushed down, or sometimes even slid with repeated copy/pastes of the exact same walls of text.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sort of activity requires us to intervene to maintain a community our users can browse and discuss freely on. The argument you're making is similar to saying that Citizens United enhances free speech: no moderation of these threads led to them drowning out the voices of legitimate users, suppressing their speech and making it difficult for them to actually discuss.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deciding to moderate more was not an easy decision, and not one we came to until we had a 10 page mod queue backlog and angry users. Also, I am not a "new" mod. I have been with
       <a href="/r/WhereIsAssange">
        /r/WhereIsAssange
       </a>
       since its inception, /!; have moderated Discord since the first few days we were around. I volunteered to assist
       <a href="/u/iamDanger_us">
        /u/iamDanger_us
       </a>
       when he was unable to handle the moderation load alone.

       Anyway, to get an idea of what I'm talking about, check out this thread:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5fhtzb/where_did_serco_take_julian_did_they_help_him/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5fhtzb/where_did_serco_take_julian_did_they_help_him/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Make of it what you will. If you believe those vans are Serco trucks, that's fine. But I sure don't, and many others don't. I was simply trying to explain why people may have been downvoting their posts - not trying to tell them what's allowed and what's not.

       No, they told us the 23rd, and then the SRoTD bot moved it back to the 28th. You can ask

       OK. I was like wtf 2 times in a week or 2. Someone wants us to be the place people go to for This and not wikileaks. Are any mods in this sub (r/whereisassange) directly connected to wikileaks?

       The first post is two mods on the sub discussing Reddit rules. Probably should have taken the conversation to Discord, but it wasn't. They're completely capable mods with a lot of work to do to keep the sub decent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, if you go to the r/WhereIsAssange sub it has a public mod log.  You can check out the why that user got a ban. Given the details, it's understandable, but I'm sad to see her go.

       The mods over there take it pretty seriously. Of course, people should always be suspicious if they have reason to be, but so far so good on the sub front.

       They usually gives warnings not bans for calling a user a shill. That's what I see normally happen anyways.

       No, I'm not a moderator. I was there in the thread, where the user kept calling people shills and swearing for no reason.

       Then there's
       <a href="/u/wrines">

       who was also in the thread (their mate), who kept calling me a CIA agent - just because I didn't think the blurry images of 3 white Ford Transit vans on a traffic camera were enough "evidence" for a police operation.

       The sub being trustworthy is more important than it being PC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you care about a couple of mods so much? If they care about the sub they can still contribute as regular users. Even if this a question of optics, without any accusations, we should always err on the side of caution.

       I care because someone is claiming that sub is going under and I'm there every day. I have plenty of evidence to the contrary.  Call me a shill for defending the subs I frequent, but if you start to make accusations without supporting evidence, we look like idiots, not intelligent truth seekers that we want to be.
