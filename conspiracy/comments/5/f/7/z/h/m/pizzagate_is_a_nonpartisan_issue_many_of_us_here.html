       I'd like to take the opportunity to point out to newcomers that Pizzagate is not a Pro-Trump nor Pro-Hillary discussion. A lot of us on here were not heavily invested in either candidate this election, and we largely reject the two party system. This is a non-partisan issue, something people of all leanings on the political spectrum can agree on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, I believe that is one of the great appeals of Pizzagate, it gives us an advantage to break through political barriers and "party-whipped" type of thinking from the masses. Once this topic starts to identify with a certain side of the spectrum, the media will use that as a wedge to split us up. And you know how egotistical and irrational people who are obsessed with their political side of the spectrum get when something becomes a "party" issue...They stop thinking clearly, we need to maintain a "non-partisan" atmosphere here to welcome a broader audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're doing very good so far, keep it up.

       I agree. As Bernie Sanders said over and over.... "When WE stand together"...he wasn't talking just to democrats. He was talking to everyone of all political ideologies, income levels, religions, skin colors etc. What makes the 2 major parties nervous is those of us who part of the working/middle class base of these parties coming together. We need to set aside our differences and work together to take on the Establishment/government.

       Agreed, seems to be a reoccuring theme. But lots of newcomers here could potentially be scared off if they detect a hint of a certain political leaning. The guys over at The_Donald seem to be genuinely devoted to pizzagate, but being associated with them is likely what got us our "alt-right white nationalists" label slapped on us by the MSM.

       Guilt by association is one of the favorite games the media likes to play.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until it is guilt by association with pedophiles, then all of a sudden it is a big "witch hunt" and it is not allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly think their brazenness is amusing since it is so blatantly pro-pedophile; it exposes them. Maybe they do not know we are fighting a war, but I sure do. The first rule of war is to know your enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pedophiles get away with what they do because they keep it a big secret, public exposure is deadly to them. That is why they don't out each other, instead they resort to murder.

       More important even than that, what is the point of all of it? Is it a way to control the powerful? Is it to establish a stranglehold on world leaders through blackmail? Is it how the powerful keep each other in check? Why does it seem to be so prevalent in those circles?

       I think it's partly because these people are selected and groomed for powerful positions because they are supremely compromised, and so easy to control. But also because we essentially have a caste of untouchables, who can do anything they want including child rape and murder. So they do. If you know your actions will have no repercussions, your moral compass becomes sickeningly warped. Hence we have a self-reinforcing system.

       Agreed.  Any time I post how both parties are in on this, that Trump is linked to the Clintons and Epstein, that he is part of the elite after all, I get downvoted to hell and replied to with smug partisan comments.

       Not really, trump banned him from mar a Lagos after he flirted with a friends daughter. He called Epsteins prosecutor during his case to tell him everything he knew while all other celebs and politicians refused to say anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       He made a what now looks weird comment about him many years ago, which I think is mistaken today. Epstein probably hang around young
       <em>
        women
       </em>
       in public, not the 11 year olds, hence his comment about Epstein enjoying his socials life. I would think it to be more sinister if I didn't know all the other imfo about Trumps interactions with Epstein.

       I don't lump DT in with the pedos. For one, the real psycho's are pointing the finger at him and projecting their activity onto him. You don't single one of your own out and point the finger at them. And Two, he isn't one of the "elite".

       Exactly, they're already trying. If we nip their smear campaign in the bud and expose it, we can probably limit the amount of damage it could potentially do to our cause. Seems like most people are aware of this so we should be good. Just have to keep focusing on the issue at hand.

       Call the media out on exactly what they are doing, which is giving cover to pedophiles.

       Are they doing it ignorantly or as a part of some kind of a conspiracy? They need to be challenged on the topic. Mostly what I'm seeing in media is a big stoney silence.

       That is my point. I'm a left wing radical, for the media to be referring to me as an alt-right white nationalist Trump supporter is a joke.

       It is fake news, again. That is the only kind they know how to make. How much of the population is an alt-right white nationalist Trump supporter? 15% max? How much of the population cares about sexually abused children? I bet it is close to 100%.

       I remember way back in 2012 or so I was on other forums trying to promote this. Then the Jimmy Savile case broke and it was much easier to make the argument that Western Governments are run by sick satanic pedos. I got busy with life and stopped, also got sick of the pedos who astroturf those threads, especially on 4chan. I'm happy to see this go mainstream, but wonder if #pizzagate is as legitimate as Franklin scandal/Jimmy Savile. Always thought Wikileaks is disinfo. Did they not clean up the emails as well as they should have? Veterans Today is pretty silent on pizzagate. They expose other pedophile rings (like Belgium royalty) but not pizzagate. They seem to cheerlead for Hillary Clinton, maybe that has something to do with it. Or maybe this is disinfo - no victims coming forward, unlike the many other scandals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got banned from the Donald for saying Ronald Reagen was a pedophile. It's in Liz Taylors autobiography that she slept with him when she was 16. My question on the Donald AMA about prosecuting Epstein properly went unnoticed. Funny how the Donald seems to care about it once it seems like a Democrat only issue.

       I'm so so so so amazed at how many people are so dismissive about the idea entirely without actually looking into any of it at all. I mean the response from powerful people as quickly as it came is indicative of something sketchy going on. It's like people forgot the phrase "better safe than sorry" meaning you can say it's not real but wouldn't it be better to actually investigate things and be wrong than to refuse to investigate and evil shit continues to happen.

       It's a reading issue, honestly.  It's like "this looks long and there are a lot of connections to be made, I'm not going to read this"....But they still want to be part of the conversation despite not reading the  material on pizzagate.  So they take the extreme "you guys are morons" approach.  It's that, and shills.  But both sound exactly the same when they make it known they haven't done much reading

       Exactly. Something "has been up" for hundreds of years, if not the last 50 for sure. It's not JUST a Democratic party thing, the piece of pizza the pizzagate alt-right crowd doesnt get is that it's WAY BIGGER than just the current people with all the fingers pointed at them, it permeates throughout the upper echelons, and even the middle echelons, and the lower, and the right and the left, and the middle, and the entire structures of power themselves is created around the protection of perpetuation of debauchery on all fronts by all fronts. Pedophilia was rampant into the Ford administration with Cathy O Brien with Trans Formation, and into the Reagans/Bushs with the Franklin Cover Up and Boystown in Nebraska, and what was covered in the banned Conspiracy of Silence documentary. Into the Clintons, The 2nd Bushs, likely the Obamas, and probably the Trumps if we're all truly being honest. Let us not forget that no matter who we elect into office, they're going to take advantage of ALL aspects of power.

       Problem is, many on the alt-right are using the "think of the children" excuse to carry out their fantasy of a complete democratic party obliteration.  That is why they are unwilling to see the other side of the coin.

       Both parties should be scrapped and investigated, imo.

       This 100%. Just remember when Republican leadership was trying to downplay the wikileaks. They said it might be them next. I fully believe it was a warning for pizzagate type stuff. Especially if Podesta was the ring leader for all of them you know they would think there was stuff on them in his emails.

       I'm not sure if I agree with that sentiment. I think most people on here have distanced themselves from the 2 party system. Thats probably why this post made it to the top, because it resonated with people here who feel disenfranchised with the 2 parties.

       I do not know how factual it is, but I have seen comments that Obama had given info to Justice Scalia to blackmail him into supporting his Obamacare thing. Then Scalia was a murdered at one of these places, meaning both Scalia and Obama at least knew about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could Obama not know? That would be unbelievable. This has been going on for decades at least, so it MUST be a bipartisan leadership thing. They just have different camps competing against each other, but they are all using the same blackmail methods.

       I'm highly skeptical as it seems "pizzagate" evolved from 4chan after an anon looked through those emails, and with his warped mind connected "pizza" (the food) with "cheese pizza" (pedophilia). I mean for fucks sake they claim other foods are code for pedospeak and you people believe it. I mean what the hell happened when people start believing 4chan? No, the world isn't turned upside down. People just got more stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of "proof" or "evidence" I've seen is essentially the same as what's in this image:

       Does that mean spez is a cannibal? Well if you believe the pizzagate infographs it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even saw speculation on what was inside some zipped files with mysterious names sitting on some servers owned by some stratfor guy. It was music and related work but a horde of easily trolled basement dwellers were too busy chasing ghosts to even apply a hint of skepticism in any of the threads I visited.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I think these groups most certainly exist (look at what happened in norway), but to think you're going to uncover an international conspiracy with the lives of powerful people on the line by shitposting about recipes in leaked emails and creating jpgs implicating everyone in washington on reddit and 4chan is beyond stupid.

       You might want to look into that one, but be warned, you probably will find a lot of disinformation about it too and may come to the same (wrong) "nothing to see here" conclusion. They are good at covering their tracks and setting up diversions and fake news articles.

       The Elites seem to have factions. This all part of of dumping Hillary. They switched to Trump towards the end of the campaign, and decided to burn her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Possibly because Podesta etc made many enemies over the years using the pedo stuff to control people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is bi-partisan, but you wouldn't know it. This controlled leak is being used by the elites to burn one side of politics. It's a distraction folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think Podesta is the only one running this disgusting scam? I bet the Republican one is 10 times worse.

       Do you see how that comment could make democrats on this sub harbor some animosity and entice an attack/argument from them? Then, once an argument happens, this all drifts away into some dumb rambling incoherent shit show of comments that detract from the original content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just don't drag party lines into the discussion of pizzagate, and try to refrain from using words like "Democrat" or "Republican" or "Liberal" ect. They are keywords that stick out to people while reading and could cause their "political defense mechanism" to go off and start defending their position on the political spectrum.

       Rudy G throwing it to Trump by disclosing what was on Weiner's laptop was not a distraction. It was pure party politics. The Republicans had dirt on Clinton and they used it - successfully.

       Pizzagate is absolutely a partisan issue. All the major players are heavily involved with the Democratic party. John Podesta was Hillary's campaign manager for crying out loud.
      </p>
      <p>
       These aren't pedophiles who happen to be Democrats. These are leaders of the Democratic party who have satanic pedophilia somehow woven into the very fabric of their power structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maintaining a non-partisan atmosphere would be great, but it's impossible if the other party is literally the problem.

       I disagree. Just because Podesta's emails were the source of this investigation, and he happened to be a Dem, doesn't mean its only the Dem party partaking in this.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are uncovering a whole new world of criminal activity, and both parties are implicated. Put the party narrative aside and just focus on the investigation and we will wake way more people up.

       Yes, this is a valid point. But I'm not sure I'm seeing that both parties are implicated at this point. It seems integrated into the Dem power structure. However, do you have any info that might me - cross party involvement?

       It's not linking Trump to it but the assumption that this satanist club with pedophilia and worse(sacrificing,cannibalism) is some democratic exclusive activity is naive.

       Based on the publicly available information I would say Trump is only involved on the sidelines. He is the kind of guy who crashes dressing rooms to goggle the naked girls, grabs women by the crotch and parties with 16 year old models who are trying to get a "career" going by sleeping with rich men for money.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of it is good, but it is not anywhere near as bad as the stuff we know about other people. For example the elder Bush, now there is a seriously bad guy.

       Epstein and Trump were friends, shared time in the lolita express and sex slave island, Trump is a longtime friend of the Clintons yet you think that Trump is basically blameless and not linked to all this.  Bet you think he's not part of the elite, is antiestablishment, shares your personal pain and struggle plus will save us all.  K.

       Lol...You're on r/conspiracy, a forum that encourages the questioning and investigation of things that we accept as true, yet pushing a pessimistic attitude about this investigation at the same time? You're weird...And I think you might set a record for downvotes with that comment anyway..

       It's amusing that your comments are not constructive, yet you're criticizing me for not being constructive. Instead of entering into a dialectic where we have a dialogue and arrive at some understanding of truth, you call me weird, then suggest that I'm going to get downvoted so I should be worried, then you try to tell me how to contribute to this community in a smug fashion? The motivation behind my comment was not to insult you, but rather it was simply to point out that while you are here trying to get people to not politicize this as though that's what is keeping people from believing it, the real reason no-one believes it or cares about it is because they do not want to. A well coiffed talking head or periodical or media outlet they've been conditioned to trust told them not to care, so they won't. The fact is people will not believe this because they've been conditioned not to and no amount of evidence will ever wake them up. The truth is that the elite won the war because there will never be enough people to care. They use the education system to indoctrinate, they use the media to distract and direct, and they use the government to control. We're allowed our reddit threads because, again, no-one cares. This is how you hide in the open, you manufacture a world where the truth is a lie and everyone is too brainwashed to even know what truth is, let alone care about seeking it.

       If you don't agree with what is in here, just move along. It's one thing to disagree with intelligent rebuttal, but to lay out the psychology/sociology of why people don't need information makes you just seem a troll.

       I like how you have to make fun of someone with a better vocabulary than you to make up for the fact you are a moron. That's the lowest of fallacies right there, my friend. "Well... uh... screw you because you used big words and shit!" Seriously. Also, not really sure any of those counts as "big words" but OK... I'll remember to write more monosyllabically for you. Moreover, who are you to tell me what to do? "Move along, fella! We don't want your kind here. This is a place for open, honest discussion! So screw you and get outta here!" What a bunch of cognitively dissonant sheep you people are. You're not truthseekers, you're just like all the people you claim to be smarter than. Someone invades your bubble, you tell 'em to take a hike. You lack reason. A less divisive response would be, "Hey, buddy, why do you feel that way? Oh, really? Well, I disagree with that. Here is why." But that involves being able to think, talk, lay out what you believe. That's exhausting. Instead, insult, mock, marginalize, etc. But you're a "free thinker." You've got an "open mind," right? Gimme a break.

       Problem is, many on the alt-right are using the "think of the children" excuse to carry out their fantasy of a complete democratic party obliteration.  That is why they are unwilling to see the other side of the coin.

       Both parties should be scrapped and investigated, imo.

       I agree. As Bernie Sanders said over and over.... "When WE stand together"...he wasn't talking just to democrats. He was talking to everyone of all political ideologies, income levels, religions, skin colors etc. What makes the 2 major parties nervous is those of us who part of the working/middle class base of these parties coming together. We need to set aside our differences and work together to take on the Establishment/government.
