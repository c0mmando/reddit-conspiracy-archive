In reality it&#39;s corporate feudalism. Where corporations can establish dominion over territories with nearly zero oversight for the wellbeing of the individuals that work for them. In conditions that any reasonable person would call slavery.</p>

<p>Proponents of &#39;Globalism&#39; or &#39;Corporate Feudalism&#39; will tell us they are happy to have the opportunity... but tell that to people jumping off roof tops to end their suffering.</p>

<p>The example was that if you&#39;re an IT worker in Michigan and your job is outsourced to Bangalore then the barriers to you moving to Bangalore to follow your skill should be low.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These jobs are only outsourced because the countries they outsource to don&#39;t demand the same rights and quality of living that the origin country boasts. This equates to cheaper labour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically, what it looks like is the corporate outsourcing (along with some wars and H1B&#39;s) has allowed worker migration which has fuelled nationalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, jobs being outsourced, reducing the local job market has caused unrest. It has nothing to do with nationalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference however.</p>

<p>Governments are an avenue for control. They represent the will of the people (Whether or not they actually exercise that will is not what&#39;s being discussed here - it&#39;s still their purpose... otherwise people would tear them to pieces).</p>

<p>Corporations can and do exist outside of sovereign borders. Where a government is almost exclusively interested in its own power, reach and influence it can only do those things within borders it controls. Corporations exist outside of this structure and can influence and control entities regardless of formal borders or treaties - to an extent - which is where government comes in, for, as you said, tariffs and trade deals. </p>

<p>Corporations aren&#39;t subject to people or territories. Governments are. Anything a government does usually must take place within a structure of oversight that can be approved or dismissed by the people. Corporations don&#39;t necessarily have to concern themselves with such obstacles and when they do face these problems they can simply move to a location where that isn&#39;t an issue. </p>

<p>How do they sell things or operate in those key locations that still present an issue? They spend time and resources softening those locations until influence can be reintroduced.</p>
