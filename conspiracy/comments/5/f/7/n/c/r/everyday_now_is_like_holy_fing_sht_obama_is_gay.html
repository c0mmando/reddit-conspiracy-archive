       EDIT: Please don't call me a shill, I had no intention to be one, anyway, Icouldn't care less about Obama/Michelle/Michael thing, I find it funny. The point of the post is Breitbart, Hastings and Clancy.

       This looks like a delusional post written by someone coming down from a 5 day crack binge. Thats the best evidence you have for Obama being gay and Michelle being a man? Anecdote and bulges? If they went to the trouble of covering up Obama was gay, dont you think they would have used a real woman and let him just keep "Michael" on the side? Come on. Yall are reaching hard with this one.

       Because that's essentially what it is, but the guy is pretending to be real and probably gaming the upvote system, to discredit this sub. It happens literally every day on this sub. But I'd rather have the free speech than the mods deleting things at their discretion. But people should seriously be downvoting the OP, imo

       I have no intentions of discrediting this sub. I was watching the 'Obama is gay' video , (which I don't believe fully myself) , then stumbling on the next one about Breitbart, Clancy and Hastings, which you must say, sounds suspicious. The whole point of posting is to share, maybe someone will investigate further. After all, none of us believed that HRC is so crooked up until a month ago. God knows what future brings. Nevertheless, I couldn't care less if he is a gay, I find it funny , actually.

       Also, you can call me stupid, but telling that I'm gaming the upvote system, is giving me too much credit.

       Then a lot of people are getting caught up in this (to me) nonsense story. I don't mind you posting it, but I also don't mind sharing my opinion. That way, everyone learns and there is maximum information available. I see this OP post as a distraction from the much more serious things going on related to Breitbart today

       This "Obama is gay and michelle is secretly a man" storyline is literally tavistock disinformation designed to discredit conspiracy theorists and related discussions. It used to be an extremely frequent topic of discussion on godlikeproductions, which is a known tavistock disinfo front. It's right up there with flat earth, and "cern is a secret wormhole producer that will kill us all or shuttle in aliens from another dimension". All these are frequent disinformation stories, paired up with real stories, to discredit everything that is real

       Yes, so let's focus on that conspiracy instead of this made up pointless one about Obama being gay and Michelle secretly being a man. Even if true, it literally would not matter. But clearly there is something else going on with this podesta stuff that they're coming out very hard to censor

       so you think that the most powerful person on the planet lying about their gender and sexual orientation would 'literally not matter?"

      <p>
       I think you're wrong on that point, it would have mattered to a lot of people at the voting booth, he probably wouldn't have been elected and the entire course of history would now be different, but surely it doesn't matter.

       Obama is obviously gay. I know this is Reddit so you all think your morality is measured by how much you love gays anyway, but the guy could not be more effeminate and obviously homosexual. "Michelle" is also 5'11" which is very strange if she is a female but makes perfect sense if she is a dude.  There's a reason Joan Rivers died during a routine medical procedure over which there was/is a malpractice lawsuit.

       "Michelle Obama is a man" is the best explanation? Really?
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on what, Obama said Michael in a public speech? That video cuts off so quickly I have no idea what Obama was even talking about. He said "Mi-" on Bear Grylls' show? She must be a man, there's no way he stumbled over his words /s. She's tall? Gosh, I wonder if there are any other American women that are taller than average.

       I could see someone using that as evidence it's a sham marriage but I still say it's a pretty big leap to go straight to "she's a he".

       I didn't say she's a man. "Inference to the best explanation" is a type of adductive reasoning; you were supposed to read about this by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two hypotheses are (a) she's a woman or (b) he's a man.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that she's 5'11" is just one piece of evidence. It's just one piece of evidence that is
       <em>
        more easily
       </em>
       satisfied by hypothesis (b). To say that that alone proves she's a man would be stupid. But the higher likelihood is conferred on (b) by that one single fact, taking literally no other facts into account, just her height. Of course there are other facts - Obama has called her "Michael" on several occasions, she has a bulge in several photos, her body proportions are more masculine than feminine, then of course there's the evidence that points towards her being a woman, like the fact that she says she's a woman, whatever her birth certificate (real or fake?) says, does she menstruate, can she be proven to have given birth to their daughters, does she have XX chromosomes, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just brought up her height because it's a little known fact. Not saying she's a man, just saying it's an interesting idea. I personally only know one girl that tall that I can think of so no, it's not that common. By itself it doesn't prove anything however. Stop making a big deal out of it. It is a conspiracy theory that some people believe and her height is one reason they believe it, not the only reason.

       Like the video?  I addressed that in my previous comment.  For one, how do you know he was talking about Michelle in the first part of the clip?  It's like ten seconds of the speech, for all we know he was talking about Michael Jordan.  As for the second part of the video, you don't think he could have been stumbling over the words "my wife Michelle"?  Nah, total Freudian slip where he gives up his cover /s.

       If you only look at certain photos, sure.  Here's one where she has feminine proportions (wide hips, narrow waist, narrow shoulders) and zero bulge.

       If I'm reading that graph right, it says that around 20% of women are 5'11".  1 in 5 women isn't all that rare.

       Look, this is literally all I'm saying:
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had a person behind a curtain and didn't tell you anything about that person - their name, their ethnicity, what they looked like, or anything else - and told you that this person is 5'11" and you have to bet $100 on their gender, you would put it down on their being a man. Or at least I would. That's literally all I'm saying. Ok? That's how inference to the best explanation works. You start with evidence and choose the hypothesis on which it casts a higher likelihood.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have made YouTube videos and stuff about the Michael/Michelle thing and her being a trans-whatever if you want to check it out. I don't really have an opinion on it, but it's an interesting theory. Obviously Joan Rivers' suspicious demise contributes to why people wonder about this.

       FFS are you even reading what I said about that video?  I've commented on it twice saying the same thing each time, yet you keep dragging it out.  First half:  how do you know he was talking about Michelle?  Second half:  he didn't actually say Michael.  Would you consider that he simply stumbled over the words "my wife"?

       Autopsies are requested by the family, they're not automatically performed on everyone who dies. If the death looks like natural causes or the cause is obvious, normally autopsies are not carried out.

       How many female have you met in your life with a build like Michelle Obama? For god sakes,look at her shoulders, biceps. She is literally built like a dude. I have never personally met or seen a woman with a body like that.

       Apparently some dude who just happened to be at the hospital, and who wasn't supposed to be treating her was just allowed to waltz in and be like "hey guys, I'm a doctor and I could do this if you let me use your equipment" and the real doctors were like "hey, sure thing guy, give it a go!" Next thing she's in a coma and dies from complications from the procedure. Apparently this is what someone who was close to river's said. I'll try to find the article, I'm on mobile though so it's a pain.

       Seems that Tim Russert and Andrew Breitbart had alot of similarities in their death.

       Russert was obese and Breitbart was a massive cokehead, they were heart attacks waiting to happen.

       I looked into it a bit and I certainly don't see any overwhelming proof he was as you put it a 'massive cokehead'. From what I can tell it's only speculation, some of it even anonymous.

       But regardless, even if he was a junkie that certainly doesn't rule out the possibility of him being assassinated.  And given some recent tweets about some very power people I certainly wouldn't rule out assassination.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Given his track record, he probably did have some very damaging information on those in power who mostly likely would not take too well to being outed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course nothing I said proves he didn't just die of natural causes either, but given his proclivity for stirring shit in the pot I think it's fair that his death should be closely examined.

       Yep, and this comes as no surprise to those who were aware of Bathhouse Barry frequenting the Chicago gay spas and rumors about Reggie Love. And Sasha and Malia aren't their kids of course just like Chelsea isn't Bill's.

       Man, what am I, on godlikeproductions? Jesus christ. This "Obama is gay and Michelle is secretly a man" conspiracy theory is the stupidest one I've heard. It's literally designed to discredit conspiracy theorists, just like flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here we see it mixed in with the story that is coming out about Breitbart, to try and discredit it. Don't fall for this stuff, people. Keep your eye on the ball.

       Why would Obama ever call his wife Michael? Can anyone explain that to me besides saying she's a man? What's another reason he might of said that? Was he even referring to his wife?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when asked by Grylls what he is afraid of I've never heard of Obama say something so incoherent before saying "When Michelle's mad". Does anyone have a video of him being so incoherent when talking besides the video OP linked?

       I'm particularly interested in the Michelle part and just watched a video about her body proportions, that's all fine and well. (

       ). But what about the missing Adams apple?  And don't they have children? That would imply an adoption, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: also didn't meant to be mean or so. Just saw another post earlier about Obama being actually a white guy. So now he's a white, gay, Muslim, married to a transguy. That was just too much :D

       This is obvious disinformation and an attempt to revive the vilification of unliked politicians/famous people. Not even yourself really believe this.

       The information like this just darken the attempts to disclose and bring to the public real issues. Focus in important matters happening right now.
