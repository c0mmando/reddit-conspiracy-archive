<p>has two hospitals involved:
Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, (see , where is Kanye West hospitalized)
and Johns Hopkins Hospital, (now that Johns Hopkins has some university also, being involved in Soros things <a href="http://www.sais-jhu.edu/news-and-events/for-the-press/press-releases/george-soros-speak-jhu-sais">http://www.sais-jhu.edu/news-and-events/for-the-press/press-releases/george-soros-speak-jhu-sais</a>   ,    <a href="https://extremeliberal.wordpress.com/tag/daniel-serwer/">https://extremeliberal.wordpress.com/tag/daniel-serwer/</a>    ,   <a href="https://twitter.com/danielserwer">https://twitter.com/danielserwer</a> ,  which I&#39;ve found because of this article <a href="http://archive.is/uivhQ">http://archive.is/uivhQ</a> )</p>

<p>TL;DR :  Obama is gay, Michelle is tranny, and  Andrew Breitbart, Tom Clancy &amp; Michael Hastings were all killed because they had evidence, and strange reoccuring hospitals involved)</p>

<p>EDIT: Please don&#39;t call me a shill, I had no intention to be one, anyway, Icouldn&#39;t care less about Obama/Michelle/Michael thing, I find it funny. The point of the post is Breitbart, Hastings and Clancy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This looks like a delusional post written by someone coming down from a 5 day crack binge. Thats the best evidence you have for Obama being gay and Michelle being a man? Anecdote and bulges? If they went to the trouble of covering up Obama was gay, dont you think they would have used a real woman and let him just keep &quot;Michael&quot; on the side? Come on. Yall are reaching hard with this one.  </p>

<p>so you think that the most powerful person on the planet lying about their gender and sexual orientation would &#39;literally not matter?&quot;</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re wrong on that point, it would have mattered to a lot of people at the voting booth, he probably wouldn&#39;t have been elected and the entire course of history would now be different, but surely it doesn&#39;t matter. </p>

<p>Obama is obviously gay. I know this is Reddit so you all think your morality is measured by how much you love gays anyway, but the guy could not be more effeminate and obviously homosexual. &quot;Michelle&quot; is also 5&#39;11&quot; which is very strange if she is a female but makes perfect sense if she is a dude.  There&#39;s a reason Joan Rivers died during a routine medical procedure over which there was/is a malpractice lawsuit.</p>

<p>Based on what, Obama said Michael in a public speech? That video cuts off so quickly I have no idea what Obama was even talking about. He said &quot;Mi-&quot; on Bear Grylls&#39; show? She must be a man, there&#39;s no way he stumbled over his words /s. She&#39;s tall? Gosh, I wonder if there are any other American women that are taller than average.</p>

<p>I could see someone using that as evidence it&#39;s a sham marriage but I still say it&#39;s a pretty big leap to go straight to &quot;she&#39;s a he&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say she&#39;s a man. &quot;Inference to the best explanation&quot; is a type of adductive reasoning; you were supposed to read about this by now.</p>

<p>The two hypotheses are (a) she&#39;s a woman or (b) he&#39;s a man.</p>

<p>The fact that she&#39;s 5&#39;11&quot; is just one piece of evidence. It&#39;s just one piece of evidence that is <em>more easily</em> satisfied by hypothesis (b). To say that that alone proves she&#39;s a man would be stupid. But the higher likelihood is conferred on (b) by that one single fact, taking literally no other facts into account, just her height. Of course there are other facts - Obama has called her &quot;Michael&quot; on several occasions, she has a bulge in several photos, her body proportions are more masculine than feminine, then of course there&#39;s the evidence that points towards her being a woman, like the fact that she says she&#39;s a woman, whatever her birth certificate (real or fake?) says, does she menstruate, can she be proven to have given birth to their daughters, does she have XX chromosomes, etc.</p>

<p>I just brought up her height because it&#39;s a little known fact. Not saying she&#39;s a man, just saying it&#39;s an interesting idea. I personally only know one girl that tall that I can think of so no, it&#39;s not that common. By itself it doesn&#39;t prove anything however. Stop making a big deal out of it. It is a conspiracy theory that some people believe and her height is one reason they believe it, not the only reason.</p>

<p>Like the video?  I addressed that in my previous comment.  For one, how do you know he was talking about Michelle in the first part of the clip?  It&#39;s like ten seconds of the speech, for all we know he was talking about Michael Jordan.  As for the second part of the video, you don&#39;t think he could have been stumbling over the words &quot;my wife Michelle&quot;?  Nah, total Freudian slip where he gives up his cover /s.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you only look at certain photos, sure.  Here&#39;s one where she has feminine proportions (wide hips, narrow waist, narrow shoulders) and zero bulge.</p>

<p>Do you check her for bulges too?</p>

<p>You brought up her height in the first place, it was the first piece of evidence you offered here that suggested she might not be a woman.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m reading that graph right, it says that around 20% of women are 5&#39;11&quot;.  1 in 5 women isn&#39;t all that rare.</p>

<p>Look, this is literally all I&#39;m saying:</p>

<p>If I had a person behind a curtain and didn&#39;t tell you anything about that person - their name, their ethnicity, what they looked like, or anything else - and told you that this person is 5&#39;11&quot; and you have to bet $100 on their gender, you would put it down on their being a man. Or at least I would. That&#39;s literally all I&#39;m saying. Ok? That&#39;s how inference to the best explanation works. You start with evidence and choose the hypothesis on which it casts a higher likelihood.</p>

<p>People have made YouTube videos and stuff about the Michael/Michelle thing and her being a trans-whatever if you want to check it out. I don&#39;t really have an opinion on it, but it&#39;s an interesting theory. Obviously Joan Rivers&#39; suspicious demise contributes to why people wonder about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FFS are you even reading what I said about that video?  I&#39;ve commented on it twice saying the same thing each time, yet you keep dragging it out.  First half:  how do you know he was talking about Michelle?  Second half:  he didn&#39;t actually say Michael.  Would you consider that he simply stumbled over the words &quot;my wife&quot;?</p>

<p>Good thing we know more about Michelle Obama than just her height.</p>

<p>As for Joan Rivers, she was 81 and joked about the number of plastic surgeries she had undergone.  That shit takes a toll on a person&#39;s body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked into it a bit and I certainly don&#39;t see any overwhelming proof he was as you put it a &#39;massive cokehead&#39;. From what I can tell it&#39;s only speculation, some of it even anonymous.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/154463/what_really_killed_andrew_breitbart_the_likely_cause_of_death_the_mainstream_media_ignored">http://www.alternet.org/story/154463/what_really_killed_andrew_breitbart_the_likely_cause_of_death_the_mainstream_media_ignored</a></p>

<p>But regardless, even if he was a junkie that certainly doesn&#39;t rule out the possibility of him being assassinated.  And given some recent tweets about some very power people I certainly wouldn&#39;t rule out assassination. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5f7gsg/the_tweet_that_killed_andrew_breitbart/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5f7gsg/the_tweet_that_killed_andrew_breitbart/</a></p>

<p>Given his track record, he probably did have some very damaging information on those in power who mostly likely would not take too well to being outed. </p>

<p>Of course nothing I said proves he didn&#39;t just die of natural causes either, but given his proclivity for stirring shit in the pot I think it&#39;s fair that his death should be closely examined. </p>
