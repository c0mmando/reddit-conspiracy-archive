        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Every major leak from Wikileaks has been countered with misinformation intended to discredit them. When they leaked the diplomatic cables, they framed him for rape. When they started posting the Podesta emails, they smeared him as a Russian agent and even tried to frame him as a pedophile. Now that they are posting the Yemen files, they want you to think Assange is dead and Wikileaks is compromised. The sad part is, people that should know better are falling for it.</p>

<p>Downvote and ignore anyone insisting they &#39;know for a fact&#39; that Assange is dead or Wikileaks is compromised. They don&#39;t. They are clearly trying to distract you from the Yemen files, as well as slow down donations and leaks to Wikileaks.</p>

<p>I say, instead of paying attention to the shills constantly making the same points and same arguments, we assume Assange is alive until proven dead and get to work digging through these news leaks. </p>

<p>If you are someone reading this who isn&#39;t a paid shill but has been constantly spamming about POL thinking you&#39;re helping, we get it, there are some legitimate reasons for concern. Stop derailing conversations just to get across the same points every one on this board has already heard a hundred times.</p>

<p>To be clear;</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;m not telling anyone to shut up, I am saying that pushing the idea that WL and Assange are <em>definitely</em> compromised is dishonest and only serves to benefit the people who will be harmed by the current and any upcoming leaks.</strong></p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s important we discuss openly and honestly anything concerning about the current status of Assange and Wikileaks, but constant shouting of the same points and conclusions is counterproductive and even if not intended to derail important discussions, it&#39;s achieving it.</p>

<p>Skeptical about the new Yemen files? Great, let&#39;s figure out if we can verify/rebuke their legitimacy instead of dismissing them off-hand because of people jumping to conclusions. That would be productive. The fact there has been no effort on that front from the Proof Of Lifers is another example that makes it look a lot like this push is coming from shills in an effort to discredit and distract from Wikileaks.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t care what&#39;s in the Podesta emails because they were definitely hacked by the Russians and were probably altered&quot; is no different to &quot;I don&#39;t care about the Yemen files because WL is definitely compromised by the CIA and they were probably altered&quot;.</p>

<p>Can you clarify this? As far as I&#39;ve seen they&#39;ve not released anything PGP signed since at least October. That&#39;s the main concern a lot of us have (they won&#39;t sign a PoL with PGP)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya all the files in the insurance torrent. I was reading stuff in that post and couldnt find answers as to exactly what files this would deem falsified. I guess i could download the torrents myself, but Id rather not haha.</p>

<p>Maybe someone else here did and can say what is in them?</p>

<p>Edit: This is interesting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5defzv/some_clarification_for_those_who_might_still_be/">https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5defzv/some_clarification_for_those_who_might_still_be/</a></p>

<p>Edit 2: I guess the insurance files are encrypted? Seems like the guy in the post i mentioned said they were</p>

<p>The other day however 11/7/2016 wikileaks tweeted out 3 new .torrent files. Nobody knows what is in these files...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is a deliberate deception, for two reasons. Firstly, nobody is trying to convince you Assange is dead. There are many people who are concerned that his safety has been compromised, and his whereabouts is uncertain, and they (or should I say WE) do want to see some proof of life.</p>

<p>Secondly, the &quot;they&quot; who accused Assange of being a rapist, a Russian agent and a paedophile are the elites, and &quot;they&quot; are trying their utmost to give the impression that Assange is still alive. But nice try.</p>
