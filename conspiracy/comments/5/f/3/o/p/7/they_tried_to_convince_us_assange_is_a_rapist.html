       Every major leak from Wikileaks has been countered with misinformation intended to discredit them. When they leaked the diplomatic cables, they framed him for rape. When they started posting the Podesta emails, they smeared him as a Russian agent and even tried to frame him as a pedophile. Now that they are posting the Yemen files, they want you to think Assange is dead and Wikileaks is compromised. The sad part is, people that should know better are falling for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Downvote and ignore anyone insisting they 'know for a fact' that Assange is dead or Wikileaks is compromised. They don't. They are clearly trying to distract you from the Yemen files, as well as slow down donations and leaks to Wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say, instead of paying attention to the shills constantly making the same points and same arguments, we assume Assange is alive until proven dead and get to work digging through these news leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are someone reading this who isn't a paid shill but has been constantly spamming about POL thinking you're helping, we get it, there are some legitimate reasons for concern. Stop derailing conversations just to get across the same points every one on this board has already heard a hundred times.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear;
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I'm not telling anyone to shut up, I am saying that pushing the idea that WL and Assange are
        <em>
         definitely
        </em>
        compromised is dishonest and only serves to benefit the people who will be harmed by the current and any upcoming leaks.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it's important we discuss openly and honestly anything concerning about the current status of Assange and Wikileaks, but constant shouting of the same points and conclusions is counterproductive and even if not intended to derail important discussions, it's achieving it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skeptical about the new Yemen files? Great, let's figure out if we can verify/rebuke their legitimacy instead of dismissing them off-hand because of people jumping to conclusions. That would be productive. The fact there has been no effort on that front from the Proof Of Lifers is another example that makes it look a lot like this push is coming from shills in an effort to discredit and distract from Wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I don't care what's in the Podesta emails because they were definitely hacked by the Russians and were probably altered" is no different to "I don't care about the Yemen files because WL is definitely compromised by the CIA and they were probably altered".

       Assange may be safe, dead, or in prison, but Wikileaks is definitely compromised to some degree.

       Assasinating a person in a foreign embassy in a center of a megapolis is too much even for the secret services. It would be an international scandal they would not be able to silent down, and I am pretty sure that Assange knows that

       Could easily be presented as a crazed Hillary supporter or agent from another Government that Wikileaks has damaged in the past, you're really underestimating the power of the people being exposed in the (thoroughly suppressed by POLers) Yemen leaks.

       Can you clarify this? As far as I've seen they've not released anything PGP signed since at least October. That's the main concern a lot of us have (they won't sign a PoL with PGP)

       I think OP was mistaken. One of the major reasons people believe Assange is dead and Wikileaks compromised is because they have not sent anything with their PGP signature. It's the hashes that don't match up with the insurance files, which is a different issue

       Ya all the files in the insurance torrent. I was reading stuff in that post and couldnt find answers as to exactly what files this would deem falsified. I guess i could download the torrents myself, but Id rather not haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe someone else here did and can say what is in them?

       they're out there and are encrypted... they keys may or may have not been released when the dead man's switch activated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there was a team of hackers that were operated when they took assange to prevent the release of the keys.

       there's people that say that the dead man switch was already activated and whenever someone tries to submit the keys to the blockchain all sorts of shit happens...people have been scraping the blockchain for keys and putting up guides how to do so...

       You guys spin actual evidence that he's alive and elivate evidence that WikiLeaks has been compromised. People want their narrative to be true because they believe it so strongly without sufficient reason. He's written a letter that you refuse to believe was written by him, he's done several interviews in October and in November that you refuse to believe are real, and he's had multiple people check up on him in the past two months, which you guys have also disregard. The main reason anyone, either a government institution or a singular individual, would want to compromise WikiLeaks would be to distrupt their publications. WikiLeaks is still publishing.

       Not saying you're wrong about Assange; i personally am still holding out strong hope he's alive despite several worrying details. But as to your last point, if the US government or affiliated individual were to compromise Wikileaks, the reason may also be to use that avenue for misinformation and propaganda, which could potentially be far more damaging than simply disrupting the publications.

       This post is a deliberate deception, for two reasons. Firstly, nobody is trying to convince you Assange is dead. There are many people who are concerned that his safety has been compromised, and his whereabouts is uncertain, and they (or should I say WE) do want to see some proof of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, the "they" who accused Assange of being a rapist, a Russian agent and a paedophile are the elites, and "they" are trying their utmost to give the impression that Assange is still alive. But nice try.
