    <div class="md"><p>Saville was probably <a href="http://charlesfrith.blogspot.com/2013/01/jimmy-savile-worked-for-mi5.html">MI5</a>.  At minimum he was protected by them.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We also know from the unparalleled intimacy that Jimmy Savile had with Downing Street and Buckingham Palace that his security clearance was as high as it can possibly be. Eleven consecutive New Years and Christmases with the Thatchers and a mentor relationship with Prince Charles as well as a mediator role within the Royal Household are concrete proof that MI5 knew everything the BBC management gossiped about for decades and a whole lot more.   </p>

<p>Jimmy Savile was not blackmailed by MI5 Per se. He collaborated with them and the Royal household and Downing Street by trading the information he was intimate with, of the power elite&#39;s predatory sexual abuse of young children in exchange for a life of affluence and security. </p>

<p>Strange that these people are ONLY &quot;outed&quot; by authorities when they are either DEAD or so old that they that they can avoid prosecution by claiming to be &quot;feeble minded&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Cyril Smith</strong> - Independent - UK - March 2015:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/cyril-smith-was-not-prosecuted-for-child-sex-abuse-because-establishment-was-scared-who-he-would-10113766.html">Cyril Smith was not prosecuted for child sex abuse because establishment was scared who he would name in court, detective claims</a></strong> - The late Liberal MP is believed to be among the politicians and public figures in a Westminster paedophile ring that was allegedly covered up</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cyril Smith was not taken to court when paedophilia allegations emerged i<strong>n the 1960s</strong> because of concerns that other high-profile sex offenders would be exposed, a retired detective has claimed.</p>

<p>Scotland Yard is already facing allegations of a cover-up after the BBC’s Newsnight reported claims that criminal evidence, including photos and videos of men abusing teenage boys, <strong>was buried in the 1980s</strong>.</p>

<p>Smith, a Liberal MP <strong>who died in 2010</strong>, was taken into custody after police walked into a “sex party” at a house in London <strong>but released within hours without charge</strong>, according to the programme.</p>

<p>Jack Tasker, a retired Lancashire Police Detective Sergeant who carried out the third investigation into Smith <strong>in 1969</strong> following two by Rochdale police, told Sky News the MP <strong>may have exposed several other sex offenders</strong>.</p>

<p>Mr Tasker said the investigation into his alleged child abuse at Cambridge House care home was stalled because “other people were rather worried that if Cyril Smith went before a court, he would open his mouth”.</p>

<p>Dead men tell no tales.</p>

<p><strong>Sir Clement Freud</strong> - Telegraph - UK June 2016:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/14/sir-clement-freud-exposed-as-a-paedophile-as-police-urged-to-pro/">Sir Clement Freud exposed as a paedophile as police urged to probe Madeleine McCann links</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>ir Clement Freud, the former broadcaster and politician, was exposed on Tuesday night as a paedophile who sexually abused girls as young as 10 for decades.</p>

<p>Freud, <strong>who died in 2009</strong>, spent years abusing a girl who he brought up as a daughter, and violently raped a teenager while he was an MP.</p>

<p>His widow, Lady Freud, has apologised to his victims, saying she is “shocked, deeply saddened and profoundly sorry” for what her husband of 58 years did to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freud was unmasked as a child sex abuser after one of his victims contacted ITV’s Exposure documentary team, who also broke the story of Jimmy Savile’s paedophilia four years ago.</p>

<p>Sylvia Woosley said Freud befriended her family in 1948, when he was working at a hotel in the South of France, and started abusing her when she was 10.</p>

<p>Four years later, following a family crisis, her mother asked Freud and his wife Jill if they would look after Mrs Woosley, and she found herself living under the same roof as her abuser, being brought up as a daughter. The abuse continued until she managed to move away when she was 19.</p>

<p>Another woman told ITV that Freud started abusing her in the 1970s, when she was 11, and eventually raped her when she was 18, by which time he [<strong>Freud</strong>] was a Liberal MP <strong>sharing an office with Cyril Smith</strong>, who was also unmasked as a paedophile after his death. The rape was so brutal that his victim bled for a week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lord Janner has been declared unfit to plead in a criminal trial over a range of sex abuse charges <strong>dating back 50 years</strong>, a senior judge has ruled.</p>

<p>In a hearing at the Old Bailey on the 87-year-old&#39;s mental health, Mr Justice Openshaw said the peer was suffering from &quot;advanced and disabling&quot; dementia.</p>

<p>[...] </p>

<blockquote>

<h1>Scores of other rich and powerful British Pedos breath a sigh of relief!</h1>

<p>To paraphrase George Carlin - &quot;<strong><em>It&#39;s a big [SICK TWISTED] club - and you ain&#39;t in it!</em></strong>&quot;. Carlin is right - I&#39;m NOT &quot;in it&quot;, but you can only imagine how many OTHER <em>&quot;important&quot;</em> sick fucks ARE in it.</p>

<p>So aside from Seville, here are three more VERY powerful British public figures who molested children for DECADES - and - protected by the police and their PEERS, they were NEVER PUNISHED - being spared such humiliation by the Grace of the Grim Reaper.</p>

<p>BUT REMEMBER, FOLKS - this was in <strong>BRITAIN</strong>. Such a network of Rich and Powerful criminal Pedos could NEVER operate with impunity in the USA...</p>

<p>They sure do like their little castaway islands too, some even with their own jurisdiction. All planned and with purpose far away from the public. </p>

<p>I really wonder how long it´ll take the average Joe to figure out that the ruling elite along with the priests are the kidnappers, pedophiles, rapists, murderers... The cops/pigs and institutions like the secret service, scotland yard, interpol and others, that we put so much faith in turn the blind eye every time they face reality. This can not continue anymore.</p>

<p>We are in dire need of a real and public investigation. Otherwise it will be swept again under a carped and if we´re lucky, only the small pawns will fall. </p>

<p>If we dont pull our shit together, its gonna get really bad, really soon. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t commit such a negative act and not expect it to eventually come full circle and reveal itself.</p>

<p>Thoughts, actions, and feelings are energy. Eventually something like this gets too big to contain and the lid is blown off. That&#39;s what&#39;s happening now.</p>

<p>The momentum has hit critical mass. People are coming forward, allegations are coming out, proof is slowly leaking out in small snippets.</p>

<p>Sports stars, Hollywood, celebrities, politicians, PizzaGate, this is all unraveling now because of this time of awakening we are in. </p>

<p>Expect more negative things to come to light but it has to happen for us to move on and move forward towards a more positively aligned civilization.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t build something new without knocking down what&#39;s in place first. That&#39;s what we are seeing right now. </p>

<p>The true power is in the underground cities and bases. There are no elections for them with absolutely no oversight of whats being done there. Just a handful of people that kept technological and scientific progress to themselves know whats up. </p>

<p>The thing is, these people would rather kill us then set us free. So for their puppets to be losing power on the surface is not that big of a deal. The next false flag is just around the corner and it probably wont be like anything else we have ever seen. Independence day will seem like a documentary. </p>

<p>How many people can discern a man made ufo from a real entity from another galaxy or dimension? </p>

<p>When people deny that this shit happens and is allowed to happen right under our noses because it&#39;s so unbelievable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what is killing me, the fact that people will still angrily deny this sort of thing happens and even mock those who point it out.  It reminds me of the anger and denial that a child gets from the church when a child is abused within the church.  Parents will ignore their own child&#39;s abuse because it shakes their world view too much to acknowledge it.   One of the things that horribly magnifies the abuse a child suffers is to have no one admit it or speak openly about it.  The child is left confused and hopeless.   </p>

<p>Please keep digging, keep up the pressure, this is the only hope the children caught up in it have.  Many do not even know what is happening or how to describe it or that it is not the way things are supposed to be, and even if they do, they are not believed.  In legal systems, the child is assumed to be lying, pitting the weakest against the strongest.  The only hope they have is that someone speaks for them and revels it for them.</p>

<p>Please keep  digging.</p>
