<p>This is getting curiouser and curiouser.   I assumed that by now they would have come up with some sort of cover story, but it&#39;s the same nonsense about &quot;alt right&quot; &quot;white nationalists&quot; etc.   They don&#39;t even mention James&#39; Instagram, which is basically what got everyone interested in the first place.  </p>

<p>I guess it might be difficult to ask Alefantis and his pals why they were writing things like &quot;hotard&quot; about little kids.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im convinced.  This is one of those topics that literally could not be if it were not  so full of little bits of connecting infomation, from pizza places to symbols used.  There is no way all of these things would exist with the connection of emails and code words used.......all of that cannot have happened out of chance.  These people didnt come up with code words for things just for a lark!  It has a purpose.  Its real.</p>

<p>The reason why people find it hugely difficult to make that connection is, we live inthe opposite world.  Pedo shit is not cool in our world.  We dont think twice about it.</p>

<p>Their world is different it seems.  They are protected and they can hide it all and keep hidden behind plausible deniablity.  A perfect setup for people in &quot;our&quot; world to pass it off as nothing at all.....an outright impossibility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a thread on r/politics about the WaPo article calling pizzagate &quot;fake news&quot; and the denial and ignorance from fellow redditors is astounding. The entire comment section was people laughing it off as insane and saying pizzagaters don&#39;t employ critical thinking. I understand and absolutely advocate skepticism, but the flat out vitriol and inane insistence on interpreting the emails as &quot;normal, duh, they&#39;re talking about playing dominoes while eating cheese you fucking loon&quot; type of atmosphere in that thread was so ridiculous i couldn&#39;t believe what i was reading. Pedophilia and extreme corruption in high levels of government is by no means a new concept, and there are enough strange coincidences to raise red flags, and yet the deniers think they&#39;re being the rational ones by refusing to believe it could be happening in the US. At the very least, it&#39;s obvious the emails use words out of context, much like people do when speaking in code. But the (shills?) refuse to even concede that and brush it all off as nonsense that people &quot;fabricate to fit what they already believe.&quot;  </p>

<p>Still, i think you&#39;re right. More and more people are waking up despite the cries of &quot;crazy fake news!&quot;  and the MSM and the corporations behind them are noticeably getting agitated. We&#39;re brushing up too closely against some sinister truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That all helps, but we live in a media driven world.  It is no longer about telling the public about critical issues like this.  They say what they&#39;re paid to say to the public.  </p>

<p>So, I believe that when we hear that the public &quot;doesn&#39;t care&quot; or is apathetic or whatever allows people to ignore it, it&#39;s not the real truth.  It&#39;s not representative of actual people and their thoughts.  They cannot have the ear of the people when reporting on things immediately after.</p>

<p>I believe a large portion of the media message is entirely backwards and we believe it because once upon a time, the media may have stood up for the little guy.  There once was investigative journalism.  There once was a force to speak truth to power, but that&#39;s long gone now.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time for something new.  The internet allows us to do this on our own and I think we need to step into bigger shoes and make it happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are counting on the ostriches among us to do their ostrich move and stick their head in the sand, the sheep among us to do their sheep thing and listen to every word the media says and take it as gospel, and that the rest of us left will not be a majority to oppose their silencing truth by shouting it down as fake news. In a normal situation, they&#39;d be right. There are not enough of us to put up a fight.</p>

<p>This situation seems different to me though, because of FBI Anon basically foreshadowing all of this, and the whole counter-coup stuff leading up to the election and the email leaks coming from not Russia, but within the government, and how things keep leaking out. It tells me that we are being led on this investigation by people who want to make sure this gets out in the open, and they have the impression that they can win the fight. I am obviously very much hoping they are correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a public relations campaign essentially (id say the only difference between PR and propaganda is disclosure). </p>

<p>Very common with lots of things. If you know what to look for someone like Jeb bush gets labeled low energy and then across multiple media outlets you get stories countering that with similar talking points?</p>

<p>I once posted on KIA that gamer gate was stupid cause that kind of bullshit is all over the media in things way more consequential than video games and that there energy would be spent better realizing that. Downvoted quite hard. </p>
