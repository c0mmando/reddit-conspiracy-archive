    <div class="md"><p>Believe me, if I had a bill that I could present you with that showed one of the suspects either bought or sold a child, I would love to share it. The whole point of pizzagate is that it is an open, citizen-driven, worldwide online investigation. The fact that there were SO MANY instances of very unsettling circumstantial evidence is why people believe that this investigation has real merit. </p>

<p>If you want to see the most comprehensive or best evidence, the sub on voat has all the best and most updated info. </p>

<p>Everyone involved in that research is looking for the undeniable proof that can be proven in a court of law, beyond any reasonable doubt. So far, this 100% undeniable proof has not found. But, that is why the constant sharing of info and exploring any and all leads is so important. The more people there are looking into it, the better. Plus, it puts pressure on the FBI or NYPD to answer the public call for a (proper) investigation. </p>

<p>What gives me hope, is the fact that, currently, England, Australia, Canada, and South Korea have all reported on a global pedophile ring crackdown that has taken place. Thus far, nearly 400 children have been rescued and hundreds of arrests have been made. The fact that these things exist is real and is being reported on right now. There have been many reports of pedophilia cover-ups over the years in Hollywood, in the Catholic church, in Boys Scouts, and all of them have been proven to be true. </p>

<p>As much as I hate to say this, it does not shock me that this exists in Washington too. I mean, Weiner already proved that you don&#39;t have to look too hard to find a DC pedophile, but I mean on a more widespread scale. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scope of financial and political illegalities within the CF are likely grossly more encompassing than pizzagate.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say people shouldn&#39;t be investing their time into pizzagate, the more we can use to take down the negative aspects of our political system the better. It&#39;s that the CF has completely fallen out of the public eye with pizzagate, Kanye and trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a logical fallacy: False cause. You are arguing that it is specifically <em>because</em> pizzagate, Kanye and Trump stories are being discussed that the CF is being ignored. Those <em>could</em> be factors affecting the discussion, but that isn&#39;t a fact - that&#39;s just your opinion. The lack of discussion could just as easily be due to the fact that there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding WikiLeaks right now and whether or not they have been compromised, there haven&#39;t been any new leads in the Clinton Foundation to examine recently, and 4chan(where a lot of the best info gets discussed/revealed and then is later posted to reddit) has been under heavy DDOS attack. </p>

<p>You have no logical grounds for assuming that pizzagate has hindered the CF discussion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pizzagate connections were found in the Podesta leaks, which were all verified and released while there was proof of a living and breathing Assange. Also, the amount of emails and the back and forth of them all discussing pizza/pasta/maps/comet ping pong have never once been disputed by Podesta. All the key players have been staying completely silent on the matter and using the MSM and paid internet shills to silence the discussion. Reddit banned the pizzagate sub and twitter AND Facebook have also been censoring pizzagate discussion/hashtags. If these very VERY serious allegations were in any way provably false, then I think Podesta and his friends wouldn&#39;t hesitate to say so. Not to mention, the Podesta leaks caused non-stop grief for Clinton during her campaign and may have cost her the election, so if this was some sort of &#39;ploy&#39; to trick people into believing false info...how did that plan help them? </p>

<p>Anything that has been released since his &quot;disappearance&quot; is met with some suspicion but that is just because people are being cautious and don&#39;t want to click on something/download that is meant to be a trap. </p>

<p>edit: But I also feel the need to add the fact that so far, every lead in the pizzagate investigation leads to pedos, pedos, and more pedos. Oh, you just like a bunch of pedo art hanging in your home? You just happen to have numerous convicted pedos as your close friends? You just happened to be hosting events at a pizza place that has TONS of pedo pics on their instagram page and all the listed &quot;friends&quot; of comet ping pong ALSO have tons of pedo pics on their instagram pages? Sometimes, you just have to see what&#39;s right in front of your face. If there was any way that this was a Russian hack or something, all the leads would be dead ends because the whole thing would be fake. But that isn&#39;t the case, instead, almost every lead has revealed more pedo connections. They are truly sick people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what about people who are saying &quot;ignore these bad laws, observe and understand pizzagate&quot;.  Let&#39;s say for a second there are some truths in CF stuff, but pizza gate is a big distraction.  In that world, if you are the PTB, don&#39;t you want to tell people to only look at pizza gate and ignore the real laws, cabinet appointments, and other things that have a very real impact on every citizen?</p>

<p>This is how divide and conquer works.  Because now we are arguing against one another when we likely would be agreeing on a lot otherwise.  It makes people think one or both of us are shills when I suspect neither of us are.</p>

It&#39;s not a commentary on whether pizzagate is real or not, it&#39;s commentary on making sure you&#39;re not getting distracted from very-confirmed-to-be-real things happening right now.</p>

<p>Sarcasm aside, it is important to continue to dig on pizza, that being said the survellience issues are also important and people really need to educate themselves. </p>
