       Previously I had noticed when I voted on the front page, read the article, went back to the front page my vote would not be recorded.
       <br/>
       Someone told me that to ensure my votes were registered/recorded, to vote and hit refresh which is what I've been doing since...
       <br/>
       In the last 12 hours I have tried to upvote stuff, hit refresh and rather than go up by one it goes down by two then up by one from that now lower number.
       <br/>
       Just now I tried to upvote a comment and while I got a pretty red arrow the number didn't change....WTF??!!
       <br/>
       So because we know about shadowbans they've evolved to this to hide stories, comments, ideas....etc??
       <br/>
       If I downvote it downvotes and if I upvote it downvotes, pretty effective way to get rid of stuff.
Has this sub been the victim of Dem fractional voting or rather, "how she won the primary" voting or is there something that does the opposite or editing or...what the flying f*ck is it??!!
       <br/>
       That just like walking into a hackable voting booth, or an elevator- trying the "close the door" button, the button on the crosswalk...that really....really, voting here has absolutely no effect other than to make us feel like were having an effect??!!
Yes, I get there are thousands of people here at times but....I was reading a comment on a post, not even a "HOT" post or even a super popular comment and it didn't change.
       <br/>
       Is there a mathlete here that could figure the odds of that happening, that of this number of comments and posts, that one of those 1595 people were reading that exact same comment (on 11/29/2016 at 4:18pm est) and cancelling my vote out??
       <br/>
       Has anybody else noticed this crap??
       <br/>
       Should we just all migrate to another place...??

       Upvoting. Either way. All users need to be constantly reminded to browse the new queue before hitting top stories. The only way this place survives and the reason r/conspiracy remains such a great place for info is because of the discipline these users have to visit newly posted content and upvote.

       Something fishy is definitely going on in this sub...they are down voting any pizzagate articles and submissions in particular and also Down voting constructive comments and upvoting troll destructive ones.

       Your votes don't count, vote fuzzing algorithm is the BS they try to pass off. Status is manufactured, ever since they no longer show the up and down vote tally.

       You can relax, haha. Reddit has implemented "vote fuzzing" to help combat... something. I don't know. I'm sure they did a post on it. You can search for it.

       Our right to peacefully assemble, even digitally is being squashed and taken....again.
       <br/>
       I feel like its time to move to Voat, see what that's like or how long it will be before it gets corrupted....right??
       <br/>
       Maybe check here but discuss there?
       <br/>
       There are a lot of great people here, doing great work but the armies working against any light shedding, working to dishearten people willing to put the work in, that care enough to stick their neck out, again, and hope that others are enlightened...man, this sh*t is getting really old but if we stop they win.
       <br/>
       I'm going elsewhere and will continue to check here, troll the new section and comment so the people posting know that I saw and appreciated their work.
