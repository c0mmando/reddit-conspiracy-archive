        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When you see a bear hanging around a bee hive, are you surprised? I hope not, because it&#39;s well known that bears love honey.  Animals, and people, seek out what they like.</p>

<p>As humans we can plan far ahead, planning can begin in the teenage years, subjects chosen to open access to jobs that will give access to the person&#39;s fetish material.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a sort of slave mentality/normalfag thinking to imagine that no one would go to the lengths required to have an unlimited supply of something which they love more than life itself.</p>

<p>Perversions/fetishes/addictions usually manifest after adolescence begins.</p>

<p>That an alcoholic would seek to work in an off-license surprises no one; but the aura of &quot;respectability&quot;, the priest-like status granted to the new priest class - people with science degrees, helps to shut the normalfag mind off from certain thoughts and conclusions.</p>

<p>So, while a working-class person would be a readily suspected of choosing their job to match their deviancy, when it comes to people with graduate degrees, the normalfag&#39;s mind is paralyzed.</p>

<p>The medical profession, specifically doctors, have the top level of drug and alcohol addiction out of any profession.  An excuser will say that it&#39;s because of &quot;stress&quot; but what better profession for someone with a love of drugs? The trust vested in &quot;professionals&quot; means that it is relatively easy for a doctor to supply himself with drugs.</p>

<p>Likewise, a desire to take a job which involves daily exposure to pictures of naked and abused children, should raise an immediate red flag.  But it doesn&#39;t, because authoritarian submission ensures that police, politicians and doctors are considered as &quot;higher than&quot; the ordinary man, in terms of moral fiber.</p>

<p>The same myth which greases the wheels of society through encouraging blind obedience, allows monsters to operate in plain sight by shutting off certain areas of thought.</p>

<p>tl;dr you shouldn&#39;t be surprised when doctors turn out to be junkies, teachers turn out to be pedophiles, zoo workers turn out to be beasters, cops turn out to be power-crazed sadists/BDSM fetishists and politicians turn out to be murderous psychopaths who achieve a state of sexual ecstasy through wielding power against the helpless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Laura Silsby who founded the New Life Children&#39;s Refuge tried to abduct and traffic 33 Haitian children. She was arrested along with other perpetrators and prosecuted for their crimes. Most of the children were not even orphans and even had families that they were separated from due to the earthquake. Laura Silsby was convicted, however Hillary Clinton intervened on her behalf by securing a lawyer on her and the trafficking network&#39;s behalf and they were summarily released with time served. The attorney was a Jewish convicted international sex trafficker by the name of Jorge Puello Torres.</p>

<p><strong>As for Laura Silsby who now goes by the name Laura Gayler or Laura Silsby-Gayler, she is VP of Marketing for AlertSense who provide service for the Amber Alert missing child warning system.</strong> Nice to see they don&#39;t run background checks on their employees and apparently hire ex-convicts convicted of attempted child abduction. The irony is if Haiti had an Amber Alert system, Silsby and her group would have been caught in the vigilance dragnet looking for the abduction of the 33 children.</p>
