<p>But help me out with the big conspiracy picture... I want to know where most people think the bottom of the rabbit hole is.</p>

<p>Is it the illuminati?  Skull n bones?  Bohemian grove?  Jewish elite?  Jesuit or rosacrucian elite?  Black pope?  Freemasons?  Kinights of Malta/Columbus?  Trilateral commission/ bilderburg/ cfa?  CIA?  Zionists?  Enlightenment thinkers?  Occult/esoteric study-ers?  Mossad?  Bolsheviks? Communists?  Crony capitalists?  Reptilian?  4th dimension brings?  Aliens? Do these groups overlap?  </p>

<p>Furthermore,  are conspiracy theories a strictly western phenomenon?  I never hear much about eastern conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Just curious what most people f the minds on here see as the &quot;mother&quot; of all conspiracy?  </p>

<p>Personally I think it&#39;s just human nature but I am open to all theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This community provides excellent information from diligent investigative work and connecting dots 99.9999% of humans fail to see. But one thing that is not touched on much is the spiritual aspect. At its core, this conspiracy is all about getting total control of the world, causing it to collapse into chaos, then introducing a charismatic leader who will promise peace and deliver. It&#39;s been going on since the fall of satan and his loyal angels. You may shrug it off as fairy tale talk, but my friends, look at the evidence YOU are presenting and ask yourself- if these people are not textbook satanists, what would you call them?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Is it the illuminati?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Illuminati are a defunct fraternity from the late 18th century that had some philosophical influence (esp. in France, if you agree with some views) in the early 19th century. Other than that, they&#39;ve been irrelevant outside of science fiction (e.g. The Illuminatus! Trilogy) and conspiracy theory for the better part of two centuries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Skull n bones?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A rich kids college frat, with initiation based on exposes of Masonic and other related fraternities. While rich kids are certainly a source of conspiracy in the modern world, S&amp;B probably isn&#39;t more interesting than any other rich kids frat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bohemian grove?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve honestly never understood this one. It&#39;s essentially a rich and powerful version of a fandom con. It&#39;s not even initiatory as far as I&#39;ve read, and has no ties that anyone has ever demonstrated to anything else. Again, if you think the rich and powerful tend to get up to no good, then you&#39;re paying attention, but BG doesn&#39;t seem particularly interesting in this respect when compared to anything else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jewish elite?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mostly the same as every other cultural slice of the global elite. The only difference is that Jews tend to have more sense of cultural and ethnic identity than most such groups. But do I think that Jews are more prone to conspiracy than, say, Hindus or Christians? Nope. We&#39;re all pretty good at being pretty bad in small groups.</p>

<p>... skipping ones I know little about ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freemasons?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The internal structure of Freemasonry makes any large-scale conspiracy impossible. Individual Freemasons, sure, but bad actors can have FAR more influence outside the Fraternity than inside. This is because there&#39;s no one central administration of Freemasonry, and jurisdictions are fiercely autonomous.</p>

<p>Note: full disclosure, I&#39;m a Freemason.</p>

<p>... skipping more I don&#39;t know enough about ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CIA?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;ve explicitly toppled governments, assassinated leaders and lead the US into war on false pretenses. I hesitate to call it &quot;conspiracy&quot; so much as, their publicly acknowledged job. :-(</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Enlightenment thinkers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, we&#39;re definitely running everything, and we&#39;re doing a terrible job of it. :-)</p>

<p>Basically, everyone is an enlightenment thinker at this point. Most of the ideas  that were radical during the Enlightenment (like religious toleration and the value of rigorous experimentation) are now a common part of modern culture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Occult/esoteric study-ers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This requires some understanding. &quot;Occult&quot; and &quot;esoteric&quot; merely refer to knowledge which is hidden behind some sort of initiation, whether it be self-study, social initiation or a formal ritual of initiation such as in fraternities. So everyone from the Lions to the local sports team are &quot;esoteric&quot; and &quot;occult&quot; in one sense.</p>

<p>But I assume you specifically mean in the sense of wanting to learn about the nature of reality and how to affect it (e.g. &quot;magic&quot;). Generally, I find that people who are interested in such topics tend to find less and less in the world of power-politics and finance interesting, so most conspiracies aren&#39;t actually of interest to the vast majority of people studying such topics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mossad?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See CIA, above, they just have a smaller budget.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bolsheviks? Communists? Crony capitalists?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are mostly arbitrary self-divisions. All political and finacial special interests will have their own conspiracies. That&#39;s the nature of that particular corner of the human psyche, I&#39;m afraid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reptilian? 4th dimension brings? Aliens? Do these groups overlap?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, all three of those are based  on delusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The building of King Solomon&#39;s temple is referenced allegorically in the degrees of Freemasonry. Obviously, I&#39;m not going to go into the details of those degrees, but one might imagine that a fraternity focused on self-improvement (a phrase that&#39;s been mangled in recent decades) might use the metaphor of building and construction...</p>

<p>More generally, Freemasonry is, IMHO, four things:</p>

<p>Social - Any fraternity is a social organization, and Freemasonry is no different. It&#39;s an opportunity for men who never would have had any reason to meet, much less become friends, to instantly be &quot;on the level&quot; as we say, and bond as friends and Brothers.</p>

<p>Philosophical - This is where the self-improvement comes in along with a healthy dose of Greek, Abrahamic and Enlightenment philosophy.</p>

<p>Historical - The edifice of Freemasonry itself is a part of what we are. The earliest date that we have records for something like the philosophical lessons of Freemasonry are in the 15th century, and the first Grand Lodge was formed in 1717. That&#39;s a lot of history, and it&#39;s a a compelling element of who we are.</p>

<p>Community - The Fraternity isn&#39;t about politics or even philanthropy really... but it inspires men to be a part of their communities in ways that they might never have been. This has inspired men like Washington, FDR and Churchill to public service and generated countless millions of dollars of charity donation and time spent helping others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just thinking this last night, I&#39;m not sure which specific group thinks it&#39;s ok to fuck humanity over for themselves but I think it&#39;s highly probable it&#39;s a bloodline (or several) that&#39;s been around for a long time. There have always been elites, the structure of our society was built around what they wanted or decided to &#39;give&#39; the peasants (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant">see WASPS</a>). </p>

<p>This would only apply to America, possibly connected to the UK since they originated from over there (I think? Not completely sure). </p>

<p>&quot;Episcopalians and Presbyterian WASPs tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated than most other religious groups in America, and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business, law and politics, especially the Republican Party. Numbers of the wealthiest and most affluent American families (&quot;Old Money&quot;), such as the Vanderbilts and Astors, Rockefeller, who were Baptists, Du Pont, Roosevelt, Forbes, Whitneys, the Morgans and Harrimans are Episcopalian and Presbyterian families.&quot;
(From the link I posted.)</p>

<p>I think that it might be easy to track down who exactly is running what in connection to the &#39;old blood,&#39; it would just take a lot of time. I do think they believe they know what&#39;s best for everyone and the world would be better if they controlled it. This is just what I&#39;m thinking right now that seems most logical with the information I have. </p>
