<p>The Trudeaus have visited Cuba on several occasions. Here&#39;s Justin&#39;s mother with Fidel, happily allowing the tyrant to <a href="https://i.sli.mg/OmhrFL.jpg">hold her 4 month old baby.</a></p>

<p>Here she is... well <a href="https://i.sli.mg/uTIYCP.jpg">you can see for yourself</a></p>

<p>Justin and Fidel have maintained this close relationship over time. He was one of the very, very few to <a href="https://i.sli.mg/3I8Dqx.jpg">sing the dictator&#39;s praises when he died.</a></p>

<p>And of course you&#39;ve already seen Trudeau&#39;s <a href="https://i.sli.mg/TvUgPp.png">remarks on Castro&#39;s death</a></p>

<p>So with that established, here&#39;s the fun part. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve </p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/nRPoKJ.jpg">made</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/dHsuRY.jpg">some</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/u6KJSR.jpg">comparison</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/7dh7Sk.jpg">images.</a></p>

<p>So now that we&#39;ve established the similar appearance, we need to figure out if it&#39;s even possible that Fidel met with Margaret before Justin&#39;s conception. Turns out he did - in fact, Pierre and Fidel met for the first time one year before Justin was born.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/castro-and-trudeau-a-famous-but-also-fraught-friendship/article33058005/">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/castro-and-trudeau-a-famous-but-also-fraught-friendship/article33058005/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pierre Trudeau’s and Fidel Castro’s paths crossed for the first time in 1970</strong>, when the Canadian government sought to negotiate the exile of members of the FLQ, who had kidnapped British trade commissioner James Cross. Fidel Castro obliged the Canadian PM by providing a refuge, and in a private letter Mr. Trudeau later extended his heartfelt gratitude.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Born December 25, 1971 (age 44)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, let&#39;s talk about Justin&#39;s mother, <a href="https://i.sli.mg/L3e1am.jpg">Margaret Trudeau.</a> She&#39;s a fucking hoe. I&#39;m not going to post her nudes here, but you can easily find them with a quick search. Margaret is also know to be a drug addict who possibly(probably) had a gangbang with The Rolling Stones. She was no stranger to sex scandals.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/8-canadian-political-sex-scandals-and-one-maybe/">http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/8-canadian-political-sex-scandals-and-one-maybe/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>1977: Margaret Trudeau and the Rolling Stones. Margaret Trudeau spent her sixth wedding anniversary without her prime minister husband, instead partying with the Rolling Stones at a Toronto nightclub and later in Mick Jagger’s limousine. The rendezvous sparked rumours that she was having an affair with the band’s front man. She later disappeared to New York. The scandal signalled the end of the couple’s tumultuous marriage, but Margaret Trudeau denied having affairs with any members of the Rolling Stones, later telling a conference on mental health, “I should have slept with every single one of them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My conclusion is that at some point in 1971, Fidel and Margaret hooked up, most likely with Pierre&#39;s consent. Given the decade and her drug habits, it wouldn&#39;t be unusual. It&#39;s also no surprise that a globalist cuck like Pierre would also be a literal cuck, tolerant enough to raise his wife&#39;s son. There are still some timeline issues - anything that would place them together around the time of conception would seal the deal, but I&#39;m confident in what I&#39;ve found so far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The nose is very close. But...</p>

<p>You left his mother out of the comparison pics. There&#39;s no doubt that she is one of his parents. So Justin must get at least some of his looks from his mother&#39;s side.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s another layer of difficulty when you&#39;re analyzing a mother&#39;s contribution to her son&#39;s facial features. Men&#39;s faces develop differently than women&#39;s do.</p>

<p>A man&#39;s nose is bigger and more rugged. Same goes for the brow ridge, cheekbones and jaw. The heavier development also tends to give men more deeply set eyes.</p>

<p>Another detail that does not support Fidel as Dad. Justin has blue eyes, Castro&#39;s were brown. Both Pierre and Margaret Trudeau had blue eyes.</p>

<p>The brown eye gene is dominant. So it is possible that Justin could be Castro&#39;s son. But Fidel would have needed to be carrying one copy of the recessive gene.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Ángel Castro was born in Láncara, Galicia, in a small fieldstone house typical of the poor Galician peasants of that time.[&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Galicia is paradoxical because it is reputed to be the most genuinely celtic region in Spain, and yet the percentage of haplogroup R1b is relatively low. It also has a reputation as the region of Spain with the highest percentage of light hair and blue eyes. Well, I can say that after traveling for the rest of Spain this is true, but the difference is very subtle.
In my opinion blondism is closely linked with haplogroup I than with haplogroup R1b, and in Galicia there is the highest prevalence of haplogroup I (M253). That might explain that light hair is slightly higher than in the rest of Spain, although I notice that most of the Galician are brown haired or brunette.&quot;</p>

I mean, aren&#39;t there people who look &quot;nothing like their mother/father&quot; and get all their looks from one parent? Like I&#39;ve seen people say this for family members, and it holds a lot of truth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fidel Castro died at the age of 90. He left behind a large, extended family, including at least nine children. He had one son, Fidel Angel &quot;Fidelito&quot; Castro Diaz-Balart, to his first wife, Mirta Diaz-Balart. He had five other sons with his second wife, Dalia Sota del Valle: Antonio, Alejandro, Alexis, Alexander &quot;Alex&quot;, and Angel Castro Soto del Valle. He also had a daughter, Alina Fernandez Revuelta, with Natalia &quot;Naty&quot; Revuelta Clews. He had another son, Jorge Angel Castro, with an unnamed woman and a daughter, Francisca Pupo, with another unnamed woman. Click through the gallery to learn more about all of Castro&#39;s children.

    <div class="md"><p>Look NOTHING alike. I think this is a total ploy to make real CT look silly. And it undermines and takes away form focus on Pgate.  </p>

<p>Justin looks exactly like his dead awful father Pierre.

    <div class="md"><p>Well except for the fact that they didn&#39;t actually meet until <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ishmaeldaro/fidel-castro-justin-trudeau-paternity-hoax?utm_term=.clq9wQnWN#.oyAqElZzJ">1976</a> when they went to Cuba for the first time, in 1970 they only exchanged letters. And the fact that March 5, 1971 is when Margaret and Pierre married so they were probably boning a lot that month. But this is r/conspiracy so of course you are all going to believe any silly thing that gets shared on the internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is, it&#39;s  (h)yo͞omən. People are too often outwardly criticized for their frequency of unique sexual encounters. But let&#39;s be honest, if you&#39;re home alone and theres no chance of anyone coming home, all kinda fucked up things can happen with our external organs and orifices. It&#39;s the most natural craving we have, and when people exercise that desire, they&#39;re &quot;fuckin hoes&quot; or &quot;pig destroyers&quot; . </p>
