He needs to clean house and put people of integrity in place (if there are any people of integrity left :/ ).</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to take the opportunity to point out to newcomers that Pizzagate is not a Pro-Trump nor Pro-Hillary discussion. A lot of us on here were not heavily invested in either candidate this election, and we largely reject the two party system. This is a non-partisan issue, something people of all leanings on the political spectrum can agree on. Once this topic (pizzagate) starts to identify with a certain side of the spectrum, the media will use that as a wedge to split us up. And you know how egotistical and irrational people who are obsessed with their political side of the spectrum get when something become a &quot;party&quot; issue...They stop thinking clearly, we need to maintain a &quot;non-partisan&quot; atmosphere here to welcome a broader audience. We&#39;re doing very good so far, keep it up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, Trump&#39;s name is IN Epsteins &quot;Little Black Book&quot;. Do you think they document every flight and each passenger, honestly, on a plane where underage girls were potentially raped? Especially someone of Trump&#39;s status, you would think he&#39;d try to keep a low profile being around someone like Epstein. Regardless of whether or not he&#39;s in the flight log, theres evidence to show they had a relatonship. </p>

<p>Also, </p>

<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/court-papers-trump-ate-at-jeffrey-epsteins-house?utm_term=.wgzYDAR715#.dyKYZD5zoe">https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/court-papers-trump-ate-at-jeffrey-epsteins-house?utm_term=.wgzYDAR715#.dyKYZD5zoe</a></p>

<p><em>Epstein&#39;s &quot;houseman&quot; (Juan Alessi) testified that Trump would come over to Epstein&#39;s home for dinner.</em> </p>

<p><em>Epstein’s brother Mark testified he once flew on Jeffrey Epstein’s plane with both him and Trump, who were “friends.” Asked why Trump was on board, Mark Epstein replied, “You’ll have to ask Donald...</em></p>

<p><em>In 2002, before those allegations surfaced, Trump told New York magazine that Epstein was a “terrific guy” who he had known for 15 years. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</em></p>

<p>The fuck<sup>?</sup></p>

<p>Of course he&#39;s gonna lay low around this guy while he&#39;s running for president, but they obviously have a relationship and I&#39;d say Trump was well aware of Epstein&#39;s activities..</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how flight manifests work buddy. Hahaha, so they hide Trump&#39;s info but not Clinton&#39;s? Don&#39;t be an idiot. I have numbers for David Rockefeller and Nate Rothschild from halfchan dumps, does that means I know them? Or have a personal relationship with them? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are so many reasons for him to stay quiet right now. As someone else said, most probably it is because he is not inside the White house yet. He knows if he&#39;s going to pull through with all the things he promised that he&#39;s basically against anyone who&#39;s already in a position. Even if some of the corruption made by some of the members of the government were &quot;justifiable&quot;(done because of threat, extortion or other types) they will be gone. So basically <em>anyone</em> in a position where corruption is prominent will have to leave their job if Trump is going to fulfill his promises, right?</p>

<p>So, during this time where the people in office knows their jobs are threatened they might resort to any means necessary to either keep anyone from stealing their job or hinder any change. Obviously it starts from where someone jobs are threatened to the whole establishment.</p>

<p>Given this situation, it isn&#39;t the best to start talking shit about people who is potentially in a position that could hinder your own advancements. Like, if Trump started huffing and puffing about PizzaGate, someone not yet discovered who have connection to this might bring retribution to Trumps inconsiderate shittalking, if you know what I mean?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s both out of strategy and maybe some fear. If I were in Trumps position, I would be scared shitless. He will basically move into a position where he knows he is influenced by <em>a lot</em> of official people and a large proportion of them have previous ties to corruption which he is publicly against.</p>
