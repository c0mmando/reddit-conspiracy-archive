       You can't make this stuff up.

      <p>
       Remember in 2012-13 when Angelina Jolie was a
       <a href="http://www.unrefugees.org/angelina-jolie-unhcr-special-envoy/">
        UN Goodwill Ambassador?
       </a>
       Well, I never knew this until now, but that Goodwill program was a UN program started by a UN member / publishing co / strategy group called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucis_Trust">
        "Lucis Trust"
       </a>
       , which was formerly called "Lucifer Trust" and it was founded by a theosophist gnostic who--much like freemasonry--praised the light-bringer Lucifer.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when we say the world is being run by Luciferians, well in some very real ways, it true to the degree that Lucis Trust and other such groups have influence on global policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, it's a big damn club and you weren't invited so you don't get to know the degree of that influence. The only metric you have is body counts, youtube videos, pizza photos on reddit, and some small percentage of kids and monarch mind-control victims who come forward after-the-fact, in a world that does not reward bravery, will not protect its victims, and will not provide for the welfare of a world desperate for Justice.

       this is the only thing I can add semi related to AJ ----According to .slament.com a stunning recording has surfaced in which a 23-year-old Angelina Jolie reveals the factual inside mechanism of Hollywood as she describes her experiences involved in “undercover illuminati rituals” to close friends.

       One of alice baileys goals was to bring about the one world religion, since it is required along with the one world bank and government, which were well under way.  Im sure you, op, is aware, that organizations like the theosophy society and masonry hold the ideals that the entire new age movement is based on. The push toward a unitarian or "interfaith" style world religion is not just for the masses, its really for the leaders of the world, who if left to standard theistic religions, or even atheism, could and probably would reject the centuries long "great work" once the veil was lifted from their eyes.

       For a while I bought into the gnostic worldview, then I decoded rebis (alchermy) as siber backwards / cyber ... This with many other data points suggest singularitarianism --merging man with inanimate objects.  This boundary dissolutiin between the sentient and inanunate is the ultimate boundary dissolution and insult to humanity IMO, not an improvement or evolution
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what I have a problem with -- alchemy being misused to shape  our consensus reality and culture in inappropriate ways, suggesting that the blacks have overcome the whites (chessboard/ hats not race)

       Well it may be the goal, since what ever your religious inclination, you know these powerful people are not going to any heaven of any religion lol. So their only shot at immortality is to blend with machines. But I fear that once they join, they will link together, and a crippling madness will infect the whole network and they will be lost and seek to die but they cannot.

       Isaiah chapter 14 in the Bible... Lucifer is only mentioned once in the entire Bible. I'll post the context below.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;Dr Lucifer is what Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon used with his title among other things. He was hated and they talked lots of shit when he died.
      </p>
      <p>
       That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!
      </p>
      <p>
       5 The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.
      </p>
      <p>
       7 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.
      </p>
      <p>
       8 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       9 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?
      </p>
      <p>
       11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.
      </p>
      <p>
       12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
      </p>
      <p>
       13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
      </p>
      <p>
       14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.
      </p>
      <p>
       15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
      </p>
      <p>
       16 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;
      </p>
      <p>
       17 That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?
      </p>
      <p>
       18 All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.
      </p>
      <p>
       19 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.
      </p>
      <p>
       21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       22 For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.

       Is how the word Lucifer is used in the Bible terribly relevant?  The people who came up with the name of Lucifer Publishing were not christians.  They were theosophists.  I'm not super knowledgeable of theosophy, but my impression is that it is some kind of neo-pegan thing reacting to christian culture at a time when "Lucifer" was already more popularly understood as a name for the devil than as a bible reference.  The "Lucifer" myth of theosophy seems more inspired by the "fallen angel" myth of the devil than by biblical passages about Nebuchadnezzar.

       You are both correct. The word used in Isaiah is the Hebrew Heilel (spreading brightness), which is translated to the Latin Lucifer (fire bringer). This was the name for Venus, the morning star, being used as an allegory for the king if Tyre. But in occult circles, Lucifer is directly tied to Satan. Lucifer is Prometheus, who is linked with the serpent in the garden of Eden, who is assuredly linked to Satan. There is much more to this topic, if you are willing to look.

       Super late reply but... I think it's relevant because theosophy is an anglo supremacist ideology practiced by wealthy twats who have too much time on their hands.

       They love to claim lineage to ancient royal bloodlines as in their mind it lends credibility to their claim of superiority aka "right to rule".

       To firmly hold onto an ideology humans need to rationalize them. This is true whether a sociopath or an empath.

       Tl;dr they aren't paying homage to satan directly with the lucifer talk they're honoring their claimed ancestral heritage.
