       If they successfully block trump from the presidency that is officially the end of the American experiment, the country will tear itself to pieces before the people with all the guns let their president get couped out in the open. Godamn I hope the electors aren't that retarded.

       So true. If our election was based on popular vote we would see very different results. Candidates would campaign in different places, people would vote more because their vote would actually matter if they lived in a majority blue or red state, etc., etc.

       Point being, Trump won this election how it was intended to be played.

       Trump is Dubya/Raygun 2.0: a front man for the deep state bureaucracy. Or maybe even a new Charles II of Spain if we believe some of the claims about his health. He will put on his act for the cameras when required, while the representatives of the business world and lobbiests and neocons in his administration will run the show.

       I agree this won't happen. People are saying Soros wants a civil war and all this shit but it is not true. Most Americans live in a bubble where nothing exists other than watching the Kardashians or football. If that bubble were to burst it is essentially hitting a reset button on the country. I think it's much easier to control people how they have been doing it for the last 100 years in this country.

       That's honestly a more terrifying outcome to me than a civil war. At least in the latter scenario, there's some form of unity in mutual feelings. In the former, we're just cattle willing to be slaughtered.

       It should be clear to any of these politicians that trying to stop the Trump Train while it is going at this speed will only end up with them getting crushed underneath it's weight. I know they got a lot on the line, but sometimes ya just gotta stand back and lose your job instead of your credibility and possibly freedom.

       Fuck... at least I think we're out of the woods for a world war... and it is getting too cold out to try for a civil war when the ones that are "right" have already won. These soft SJWs are gonna get tuckered out and the checks will start to bounce and they will just mope back to their parent's houses where they came from.

       I've wondered what civil war would look like in modern day America. The biggest force that either side will try to grab is the local/State PD and Sherriff's Depts. Which ever side has them wins. If they side with TPTB then we have the final piece of proof we are living in an Orwellian nightmare.

       I don't know why you're being downvoted. He's already going back on a lot of the things he's said. And idk why people think Trump is going to be any different from the establishment. Just look at the guy's cabinet and it will tell you all you need to know. Trump is part of the same club as the rest of these crooks.

       Being able to change the vote outcome and steal the election in order to stop incompetent populist demagogues is one of the main reasons why the electoral college exists in the first place. Not only is it legal in many states, it's also its purpose.

       All of that is hard to believe with Hillary being the vetaran in all of those dirty tricks like she showed us in the primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       DNC staffers are on video talking about how they sign dems up to vote by mail but not republicans.  afaik there's no real information about voter fraud, or voter suppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary simply didn't get people out to vote.  She's not an exciting candidate.  She got something like 7-8 million fewer voters to the polls than obama in 2008... that's nobody's fault but hers and the DNC for putting forth such an impotent candidate.

       I'm not American nor a Trump supporter (although I'm conservative), but the electoral college is in place for a reason which I'm a sure you know and you have to agree that the founders of the US were right in implementing it otherwise Small population states would be irrelevant. Is it perfect? No. But honestly I think it's the best solution in the American situation

       You're thinking of senate and representatives. It's kind of like a safe guard between the will of representatives and senators and the popular vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say some jackass is nominated by the people because they prey on fear and ignorance, they have a history of business failure, and lie with two tongues. But the people eat it up, because they are racist, and live in an isolated culture of fear, and couldn't spend 15 minutes to learn about this persons's life and platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the other politicians and educated people know this person is a pile of rancid shit... The electoral college is there as a safeguard to make sure a QUALIFIED person is elected.

       The founding fathers believed there would be a charismatic tyrant at some point.

       The electoral college has a very important job to do, and I'm hoping for an unprecedented event and they do not nominate Trump.

       They could give Obama two more years if they really wanted, if they could all agree.

       So I'm confused, you want popular or electorate? You seem to want both

       I want the most qualified person in the country to run the country. since we're not going to get that, the most qualified between the two.
      </p>

       I would love the popular vote, but I'd like an electoral college as well to protect us in case a populist fear mongerer that consists of 538ish highly educated and informed people to choose.

      <p>
       I don't think we have ever had a situation like Trump.

       That's honestly a more terrifying outcome to me than a civil war. At least in the latter scenario, there's some form of unity in mutual feelings. In the former, we're just cattle willing to be slaughtered.
