    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the coup: voter suppression in the south in states like. North Carolina preventing poor and minorities from voting by limiting the number of polling stations in their neighbourhoods and limiting early voting + possible voting machine fraud in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The coup has been perpetrated by the GOP. Again. It is 2000 all over again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of that is hard to believe with Hillary being the vetaran in all of those dirty tricks like she showed us in the primaries.  </p>

<p>DNC staffers are on video talking about how they sign dems up to vote by mail but not republicans.  afaik there&#39;s no real information about voter fraud, or voter suppression.  </p>

<p>Hillary simply didn&#39;t get people out to vote.  She&#39;s not an exciting candidate.  She got something like 7-8 million fewer voters to the polls than obama in 2008... that&#39;s nobody&#39;s fault but hers and the DNC for putting forth such an impotent candidate.</p>

<p>You must live under a rock, on Mars.</p>

<p>Republicans have a long history of voter intimidation and suppression and fraud, <a href="http://m.imgur.com/rOTfJji">Florida 2000</a>, <a href="http://www.vox.com/identities/2016/11/7/13552832/north-carolina-republicans-black-turnout">North Carolina republicans have boasted of suppressing black votes</a>, and of course Steins recount.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s a problem?</p>

<p>She&#39;s a politican not a theme park.</p>

<p>Now if you&#39;d said she was a corporate stooge, then you&#39;d have something.</p>

<p>Obama got 68 million in 2008 and 65 million in 2012, and Clinton got 62 million. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not American nor a Trump supporter (although I&#39;m conservative), but the electoral college is in place for a reason which I&#39;m a sure you know and you have to agree that the founders of the US were right in implementing it otherwise Small population states would be irrelevant. Is it perfect? No. But honestly I think it&#39;s the best solution in the American situation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re thinking of senate and representatives. It&#39;s kind of like a safe guard between the will of representatives and senators and the popular vote. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say some jackass is nominated by the people because they prey on fear and ignorance, they have a history of business failure, and lie with two tongues. But the people eat it up, because they are racist, and live in an isolated culture of fear, and couldn&#39;t spend 15 minutes to learn about this persons&#39;s life and platform. </p>

<p>All of the other politicians and educated people know this person is a pile of rancid shit... The electoral college is there as a safeguard to make sure a QUALIFIED person is elected. </p>

<p>The founding fathers believed there would be a charismatic tyrant at some point. </p>

<p>The electoral college has a very important job to do, and I&#39;m hoping for an unprecedented event and they do not nominate Trump. </p>

<p>They could give Obama two more years if they really wanted, if they could all agree. </p>

<p>I would love the popular vote, but I&#39;d like an electoral college as well to protect us in case a populist fear mongerer that consists of 538ish highly educated and informed people to choose. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we have ever had a situation like Trump. </p>
