       Because everyone knows that conventional weapons such as .22 caliber rifles, 9 mil pistols, and 12 gauge shotguns can stand up to swat teams, drone planes, cruise missles, mask penetrating nerve gas, robotic warfare, and the propaganda that has brainwashed your neighbors into turning you in before you even leave the kitchen. /s

       Not a fucking argument. You’re just wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Precedent
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of the ‘drones’ argument is to suggest that America’s military power is far too powerful for the people to defeat, thereby making gun ownership for defense against government tyranny unnecessary. The idea that the one with the bigger stick wins is a common mistake. People often forget how the country started and how a bunch of traitors and revolutionaries were able to defeat the immensity of the British military. If this argument was taking place in the ’60s, people would be announcing ‘napalm’ rather than ‘drones’, and yet napalm did very little to stop the US from being defeated by a bunch of rice burning, pajama wearing, tunnel dwelling Vietnamese. And speaking of pajama wearing, what about Afghanistan? You go find Al Qaeda and tell them about ‘drones’ and they will be quick to remind you that they were able to drag the US into an 11 year, unsustainable war, the cost which helped lead America to an incredible financial crisis. If a bunch of cave-dwellers struggling with the cocking handle of soviet era AK-47s can keep a war going for 11 years, think of what well-educated, well-armed, partially experienced American citizens could accomplish.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Ineffectiveness
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       A drone strike might look effective when shot at some desert hut, but it doesn’t translate well to domestic civil war. Every citizen the US bombs is one less taxpayer, one less worker, one less consumer. Every building is one less factory, one less office building, one less residence. Every bomb the US would drop on its own soil and people is destroying its own precious resources. Hardly a sustainable way to wage war. Every bomb dropped also invites more and more revolutionaries. If you thought civilian deaths in the Middle East brought outrage here, think about what American civilian deaths would bring. Let’s say that 200 people gathered outside the Pentagon, protesting and screaming for blood. What is the government going to do, bomb their own military installation? How is that drone going to stop an unarmed protest, or even effectively distinguish between an unarmed protest and an armed one? How will that drone confiscate weapons and apprehend major revolutionary figureheads? It has been said before and I’ll repeat it–police states need police. Grunts on the ground. And that grunt is in for a bad day when he is head to head with an equally armed American citizen behind every door. In a few seconds, a simple search can show you all the shortcomings of drones and how one could combat them.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Defectors
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Killing rag-heads video game style is one thing, but how is that drone operator going to feel when he is forced to drop bombs on his own countrymen? His brothers and sisters and friends. How quickly are those politicians (who we are so quick to call slimy and self-interested) switch sides to save their own skin? Even without this almost certainly occurring variable, military and police amount to a few million while civilians equal hundreds of millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        International
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       NATO is quick to enter revolutions in other countries when the government massacres its people, so what would their reaction be when the US government indiscriminately bombs its own people? Other nations would also assist in any civil war for their own reasons (perhaps they have a vested interest in seeing the US weakened by domestic warfare).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Freedom
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the government and military was infinitely more well armed and the chances of victorious revolution against its tyranny was one in a million, so what? Should we just give up without trying and submit to oppression? Whatever happened to Live Free Or Die? Aren’t our freedoms worth fighting for no matter then odds, are they not worth dying for?
    The people who wrote the Second Amendment understood what government oppression was. They knew what revolution entailed. And they understood that the American people may have to do something similar to what they just did to ensure they remained free. So they kept guns available for citizens. But the main reason their ownership should continue is not to fight a war but to prevent it. The Second Amendment protects the rest and is a constant reminder to the government that an act of unwarranted aggression against its people can be swiftly retaliated against. Ultimately it’s not about guns. It’s about freedom.

       Actually, he doesn't. The big picture is that an elite power structure has survived for centuries, not only in SPITE of violent revolutions but partly because of them. Every now and again they realize people's anger valves need released so they either allow a lower class of political puppets to get beheaded or they give a Donald Trump to make people think some kind of real change has occured. After said change, everyone goes back to sleep and the same, multi generational bloodlines continue business as usual.

       Those powerful bloodlines exist outside of the political structure. They are above it. They got their power by working hard and kept it by working harder. They are the "bigger picture", and are not what is being discussed here. Stay on topic.

       I'm with you on that. That hasn't been my argument. But this other guy in the forum would disagree with you. He's implying a mass uprising of 1.5 million Americans or more, storming bunkers, and hanging political puppets.
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument is, that like always, after something like that happens, TPTB will halt for a decade or so, then everyone will go back to sleep. When they resurface, they just quietly reassure control from the structure that replaced their old puppets.

       I agree. That is the history or "modern civilization". But TPTB are fooling themselves into thinking they have complete control the same way we fool ourselves into thinking we are truely free. It's a fair trade off to me.

       Look, I appreciate your well made and thought out response, but I simply disagree with it fundamentally. I have nothing against private gun ownership. I've owned guns in the past myself. But mass ownership of guns is simply not an effective means for undermining this cabal. There's even evidence to suggest that gun availability  is being used as a tool in their favor. To create public clash. People do have a distinct ability to fight the wrong oppressers. While we're killing each other, the elites will just continue to drink cocktails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I suggest you read the federalist papers and several of the founder fathers diaries. The Second Amendement was never meant t stave off a tyrannical government. It was to prevent the need of a standing army and actualy to PROTECT the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm well aware of the history of drone use and western carpet bombing of the third world. I was simply saying it's just one of many in the arsenal the powerful can use. I think you're severely underestimating the power of the surveillance state combined with the propoganda machine. You'll never have a massive overthrow of the elites through conventional warfare, because you will (should) be too worried about your community 'black balling' you.

        Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments,to which the people are attached, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear,
        <strong>
         the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves
        </strong>
        , who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia,
        <strong>
         it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.

       Okay, lets agree to disagree on this subject. We're suppose to be on the same side right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's asume you are 100% right about an armed population being able to withstand the power of the elite. How do you suggest convincing our fellow Americans to join us? First, you'd have to break the propoganda machine and undermine the system of mass surveillance that would stop any leaders of an insurrection before they gather numbers. If we manage to do that, we never have to resort to a major conflict in the first place. We could simply walk in and take em out to bend the lampposts.

       A) I’m not necessarily advocating “violent revolution”.  I’m advocating giving each and every individual the right to DEFEND THEMSELVES against those wishing to cause them harm - including the very state they live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Revolutions can be non-violent - and that’s actually the kind that’s, of course, preferable.  However, a citizenry should NOT by any means ever be disarmed…unless, of course, one's okay with the state ruling with an iron fist with no fear of great reprisal from the citizenry.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) The reason why elites still “run the world” is because elites don’t just lie down and take it in the ass.  The struggle is constant at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet your solution is to have the citizenry give up their guns and give these ruling elites even
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       manipulative power than they already have.  How’s that going to improve things?  Giving the forces responsible for causing harm in the first place even more power?  Really?

       Look up covert intelligence programs (cointelpro).  More often than not the elite use agent provocateurs to infiltrate the masses and incite a type of mindless violence that isn’t anywhere near as much the case as would otherwise be the case.

       You've misunderstood a bit of my argument. Look at my other comments and you'll see that I'm against disarment. In fact I'm in support of your idea of self defense. My argument wasn't with you. I apologize if I misconstrued you with the other guy. He was the one promoting a mass overthrowing.

       Also, I'm well aware of cointelpro and the like. In fact that was one of my arguments that this other guy seems to be falling for their narratives. The elites want an outright rebellion from time to time.

       Your logic assumes an even playing field. Yes, a person with a gun doesn't stand much of a chance against a SWAT team. But how would the SWAT team feel trying to take down 100,000 people with semi-automatic rifles? Guns are an excellent source of protection against governments, either foreign or domestic

       You...kind of whooshed on that one.  Hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nation's in turmoil because the armed will of the people is strong enough to actually
       <em>
        fight against
       </em>
       the usurping state - so the state can't therefore just do whatever it wants.  If the citizenry
       <em>
        weren't
       </em>
       armed, their wouldn't be any turmoil because they'd already be enslaved.  As such, in this particular case, turmoil is actually
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       because it means that the people are actually
       <em>
        fighting back
       </em>
       - which they absolutely wouldn't be able to do if they had no arms to defend themselves with.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the argument isn't about turmoil or no turmoil.  The argument is about slavery versus freedom - and if you can't defend yourself, then the state will
       <em>
        very easily
       </em>
       enslave you.

       It’s apparent that you don’t understand the concept of transition.  Things aren’t either “free” or “enslaved” and that’s it with no in-between.  There is an ebb and flow - a struggle - and to a great extent on this planet, there is the back and forth continuous struggle in between slavery and self rule.  So long as there are those that desire self rule and can fight for it, and those that desire to enslave those wanting self rule, there will be conflict.

       Yes.  Many of us are still locked on it, unfortunately.  Many of us are afraid to leave it or think that another way is possible.  Many of us have

       I don't think that it's impossible for those still locked in to slowly be taken out of it by those who've already began looking for other ways of being and thinking.

       These are unrealistic hypotheticals. Sure, the government could launch nukes and wipe everyone out, but why would they do this? As for any other large-scale attacks on the population using conventional weapons, the people in the military wouldn't allow this to happen.

       This is the point I've been trying to make to him. It's not the weapons, or the people manning them...it's the fear and complacency tied in with the propoganda we've been fed that will uphold the system. Any insurrection will amount to little more than something say...oh...10 times that of Waco.

       Ok, you caught me being melodramatic. A more realistic scenario would be that the resistance force would get driven underground and spend decades launching guerilla attacks against the US military. Most of the population could probably be turned against these rebels through propaganda. I'm still pretty confident the military would maintain the upper hand, given their sheer firepower.

       YOU CANNOT CONTROL AN ENTIRE COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE WITH TANKS, JETS, BATTLESHIPS OR ANY OF THAT.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fighter jet cannot stand on street corners and enforce no assembly edicts. A fighter jet cannot kick down your door at 3 AM to search your house for contraband material or antisocial propaganda. A fighter jet is useless for maintaining a police state. Police are needed to maintain a police state. And no matter how many police you have, they are always outnumbered by the people, which is why it’s important for your police to have automatic weapons and your people to have nothing but their limp dicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when every random pedestrian might have a Glock jammed in his waistband, kicking down those doors becomes a lot fucking riskier, lest you catch a bullet on your way in. America has a small standing professional army. (I’m using the term “army” to refer to the entirety of the Department of Defense) of 1,456,862 personnel and 1,458,500 reserve. They are probably the best-funded, best-trained, and best-equipped fighting force in the world today and the best which has ever existed in raw technological killing power.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 311,591,917 people in the US, of which 73,270,043 are males age 18-49. There are also 90 guns every 100 persons in the US. Now, even assuming every one of those million and a half active members of the armed forces are trained infantry grunts (pro tip: they aren’t), how well do you think they will do against 73 FUCKING TIMES THEIR OWN NUMBER? Even assuming there would be no defection or desertion among the armed forces, they are still massively outnumbered and outgunned by an enemy they can’t tell apart from their supporters. We’re getting good at it, but not good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Al-Qaida and the Taliban ran us ragged for more than a decade with muskets used by illiterate goat herders and a few well-connected, college-educated fanatics in their leadership. Why?
       <strong>
        Because they hid among people we were told NOT to kill, and so were
       </strong>
       <strong>
        <em>
         allowed
        </em>
       </strong>
       <strong>
        to win.
       </strong>
       The only way to win against them is to slaughter them all, and while that should be done there, it couldn’t be done here in a civil war scenario. The US is a technologically advanced society completely saturated with the Internet and the advances of modern manufacturing. Nearly military grade weapons are the most common rifle here. Go ahead and try to stop an armed insurrection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s take a realistic look at the likely insurgent population. We could start with a “10% mobilization” scenario, but let’s start with 10% of gun owners. Roughly 15 million people. This provides us with:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        1,500,000 “tip of the spear” combat troops.
       </li>
       <li>
        13,500,000 reserves and support infrastructure.
       </li>
       <li>
        3,370,000 safe houses, and their land available for use.
       </li>
       <li>
        $6,000,000,000 in funding and $750,000,000 per year (at $750 per support person). Slightly less than the entire military budget of Mexico or Pakistan.
       </li>
       <li>
        2,160,000 privately owned vehicles.
       </li>
       <li>
        ~10,034 privately owned aircraft.
       </li>
       <li>
        ~13,237 doctors.
       </li>
       <li>
        15,000,000 guns, minimum, as many gun owners have collections. It could be as high as 90 million.
       </li>
       <li>
        10% of those guns would be ARs, AK, FALs, etc.
       </li>
       <li>
        15,000,000,000 to 90,000,000,000 bullets, assuming only 250 rounds per weapon.
       </li>
       <li>
        1,133,000 US military veterans, about 50,000 of which are bloodied combat veterans.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Considering the conservative, pro-freedom slant of the military, this estimate is likely quite low. Tis also includes a random distribution of EOD guys, COMSEC guys, pilots, mechanics, Special Forces, Scout Snipers, and others who can train people in skills, in addition to the 11B door kickers. This also includes whatever toys they can bring with them when they defect. AT-4s, grenades, palettes of ammo, M249s, and M240Bs, thermals and NODS, and other things that can be smuggled off-post.

       The American Rebellion would be a militia of 1.5 million troops backed by 13.5 million citizens, lead, supported, and trained by fifty thousand combat veterans and supported by over a million trained veterans, initially armed with about five million guns and one and a quarter billion rounds of ammo, with over a million vehicles, ten thousand aircraft, fifteen thousand doctors (and even more medical support), and an operating budget literally the size of Mexico’s.

       Let's say pragmatically your assessment is correct. What I guess I wonder is where our power is as a populous BEFORE the guns get pulled out. 
I mean, I get it, we all could kill each other. How does that improve income inequality? Cause... it's at the worst levels its ever been. But we could also ALL KILL EACH OTHER! Who... does that server... again?
Oh yeah! MULTI BILLIONAIRES with the tanks and the drones and the satellites. 
Again, my point: where is our power as a populace? I am not pro gun control, for the record. We've all got guns... and we're a paycheck or an illness away from homelessness... guns sure are great!

       Who… cares? Why does this matter? What is the end-game for “solving” income inequality? Is it to implement perfect equality across all jobs? That’s marxism. That’s genocide. Is it to forcibly set a maximum measure of success as a ratio of income? Who gets to decide said maximum? How is that fair? Here’s what you do: 1. End the fucking Federal Reserve. 2. Set Congress’ salary, adjusted each year, to the country’s average salary for the previous year. 1 ends inflation and 2 forces the government to, quote, “promote the general welfare.”

       Again, my point was how do we exercise power in our government? I see guns as a limited utility to those ends. Your points 1 &amp; 2 are great. Fantastic analytical questions in regards to income inequality. But again, my point, does the fact that we have guns mean we actually have rule of law and representation in our government. I'd say, given the state of things, no. I'm personally not invested deep enough in this argument to get into specifics, because I think it's self evident that guns have not practically improved the quality of life in this country. Am I wrong in that assessment?

       I can’t see how you are. Look at the rest of the West. Australia was disarmed and is now being depopulated. France, Germany, the UK, Austria, Sweden; no gun ownership, totalitarian governments replacing the native population, no freedom of speech. China; no guns. Tibetan genocide remains ongoing, no freedom of speech. South Korea; no guns, feminist government jails men for being men, no freedom of speech.

       I'm Native American. My people are being, frankly, abused because we're not using guns at Standing Rock. Although, if we did, we'd be massacred. So I can see you point, but can you see mine? It's of limited utility to genocide a people, and see that as a solution to economic and social threats.

       Other note, you're wrong about France. People have this idea that France is super gun controlled. They're not. It's actually fairly easy to get weapons in the rural areas. This is why it was no suprise of the major shooting that took place last year.

       Again good old rifles will do the job with enough rounds. But hell in my state I can legally buy a 20mm rifle with the same background check you get for purchasing a standard hunting rifle.

       Besides doing it ourselves don't forget just like in all the civil wars in the middle east whole bases and battalions would join the civilian resistance. Overnight we would have our own trucks, tanks, helicopters, UAV's, jets, and ships of varying sizes. And we as Americans have a huge advantage none of those country's had. We call it the 2nd Amendment. Because of it we are armed to the teeth with small arms and body armor already. Hell some of us even have legitimate military hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your just misinformed. Remember propaganda is legal under

       . It would probably also help if you talked to a veteran of recent conflicts. They know more than most the fallacies of our "almighty" military.

       That makes so much sense! I've been wondering why the government has been so anti-gun. We have a problem, no doubt, but I really don't believe the government is afraid of a gun totting populous. It would actually serve the governments ends, all of us trigger happy to defend ourselves from our neighbors. Good job, government. Slow clap.

       There is one thing that helps in these situations even more than a well armed populace, though, and we have it - a fed up military who knows they fight wars for profit and won't be complicit in attacking us for the government's benefit.

       This is the point I've been trying to make to him. It's not the weapons, or the people manning them...it's the fear and complacency tied in with the propoganda we've been fed that will uphold the system. Any insurrection will amount to little more than something say...oh...10 times that of Waco.
