       I cannot prove this.  He just called me.  It is quite interesting.  He told me to check the Google Trends, and yes, there certainly is a "hockey-stick" trend.
I honestly think this is "The Great Global Wake Up" - that is what it should actually be called, as it is much larger than Pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in interesting times, my friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: My apologies, I am new.  Long time browser, second time poster I think.  I appreciate the responses.  Yes, I meant to search "Pizzagate" in Google Trends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I did not think anyone would respond because I do not have any proof, aside from what I was told and to check out Google Trends as direct evidence wen using Pizzagate and related search terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out when you type in Podesta - yet another spike.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep taking screenshots of key phrases in Google Trends and track them.  They could lead to interesting information, potentially, but certainly reinforce the growth of the movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please capture these if possible.  I do not have time right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I felt I could contribute to the cause,  I did my best to help  Please, continue to spread the word to your friends and family.

       Please Help: Capture the Google Trends of all known Pizzagate keywords - It helps to convince others that they are a part of a large growing movement. Check out the trends over different time periods, as well. It is very interesting. (self.conspiracy) submitted 12 minutes ago * by hillaryclintonseizur

       I just thought of this - it makes sense to me, hopefully to you as well: this little pizza joint probably did not receive that much web traffic, UNTIL they planned a sex party. If we follow the Google Trends of "Comet Ping Pong" and other key phrases, we ay be able to put together a schedule of when they planned their sex parties, maybe tie it to missing persons cases, etc. Does anyone out there understand what I am trying to describe? The Google Trends data will lead us directly to spikes when web traffic was heavy, hence a higher likelihood that these alleged pedophiles logged into the site at that time, assuming they used Google to get there. We might even be able to put together a calendar of what went on when it went on through using Google Trends. The potential exists, at least, and we need your help to uncover if this is true. Does this make sense to anyone else out there?

       The West will be perceived as rotten to the core so it will be easier to convince the average Joe to go to war with the US and Europe. They already are perceived as oppressive due to 70 years of waging war but pizzagate is even worse as it breaks the most sacred taboo.

       I'm so glad you posted this because I was thinking the same thing about Putin knowing (of course he knows. I'm pretty sure all world leaders know but most don't have the power to say no to U.S.) and wasn't sure if there were other countries that also had a ban.

       THIS COMMENT IS COMPLETELY SPECULATIVE - so skip it if you want leads and proof - I've been waiting weeks for someone else to bring this up but I haven't seen it. It's relevant to foreign adoptions.  Famous actors/musicians, with either admitted or rumored ties to the Illuminati, have adopted foreign children. Like HC, at least one works tirelessly on behalf of children for international organizations.  I know this is going to get down votes but it seems there is a pattern emerging.

       The problem is that most people just want to live a happy life, but a small group of people want everything for themselves.  They think that if they can take everything for themselves and nobody will stop them, then it is alright to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They never stop to think "Should I take everything for myself?  What about other people?"

       I'm on this sub because I want to believe; it would be so helpful if all the world's problems could be summed up in a simple theory, even if it's devotion to a satanic murder cult or something. It's human nature to look for a simpler explanation like this. Our brains evolved in a way that likes to quantify and define things, it's what gives us language like we have, so it only makes sense logically to our brains to define the enemy. If there's a single, real enemy then there's a single fix for the problem: stop the enemy. It also makes it feel manageable, rather than hopelessly out of our control.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really all of that is why I think there isn't some unifying grand conspiracy. Life is insanely complex, with couness causes affecting every person and every decision they make. Honestly, I think people's propensity for greed and power is nothing new, we're still just animals. So those billionaires, who could live comfortably for the rest of their lives with only 1% of their lives, don't keep fighting for more power/wealth/influence for any logical reason; they do it because they're dumb animals that don't know any better. Except they're humans, so they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       know better factually, but they can't stop themselves from instinctively giving in.

       However, this world is like many RPG's i have played. There isnt just one big bad guy.
There are factions. Lots of them.  The whole pizzagate shenanigans is the work of just one faction.  There are other big bads, other good groups, and then plenty of neutral groups or somewhere inbetween.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's so much going on it's legit impossible to tell what groups desire which ending.  No real way to determine the end goal, because all the shit happening is not done by one faction by itself.

       Deleting it will just arouse suspicion. Best to start again with new computer with no mic or camera and no connection to you or your money or location. Then you'd still have to never look at the same sites as you did before as most people have a browsing finger print. Oh and so many more things to be anonymous. Best to just not sick out for now.

       My understanding is that it may be possible to identify users simply by keystroke patterns. I suspect that Google can identify the user, after they type in a few searches, simply by analyzing pauses between keystrokes.

       ive factory restored an old laptop i used to have and am in the process of learning all i can about crypto, security etc. Once i have collected the programs i want i will restore it again and install linux then load up all those other things.

       If this is true, then you have to consider one thing: The people implicated in this (whose names we know) like John Podesta or James Alefantis are now liabilities to the other people in the shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       As liabilities, they can lead back to a lot of other people whose names we don't yet know.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Powerful
       </em>
       people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch for Podesta and Alefantis in upcoming months to have "accidents," like falling off of buildings, or jumping in front of trains.
      </p>
      <p>
       (The reality is: They could keep a lid on all the brush fires for decades. They could take out the few random people who knew, like when they assassinated Andrew Breitbart who made a reference to Pizzagate in 2011 before his untimely death. But now that it's out in the open and hundreds of millions of people around Planet Earth know, a critical mass point is hit. In the changing paradigm certain "loose ends" will have to be taken care of to stanch the bleeding. That means certain players that we know about will now have to be eliminated.) All I'm saying is: Podesta better watch his back. Justice will come to him not from the corrupt criminal justice system (which he thought he rigged in his favor), but from his fellow pedophiles whose cover he's now jeopardized.

       Do you know how trends work?  You probably don't, and I doubt that you have a "friend who works at Google".
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why you're seeing an uptick in searches for "pizzagate" is because it wasn't a thing until a few weeks ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall traffic/queries for that phrase are not very substantial -
       <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/hottrends">
        not even in the top 20 of searches over the past 7 days
       </a>
       . Probably because the "pizzagate scandal" is really, really retarded.

       Yeah no shit, everyone is talking about it. That's how google trends work.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't take a 'credible source' to figure that out -- it takes someone who has heard of google trends.

      <p>
       "I felt I could contribute to the cause, I did my best to help" -- I'm really not trying to be a dick, but this entire post could have consisted of

       "google trends will show you how much any search term is being searched -- and as you all know these terms are gaining traction"
      </p>

       Please see my edit - Great question!  Duh!   I am sorry. :)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        My apologies, I am new. Long time browser, second time poster I think. I appreciate the responses. Yes, I meant to search "Pizzagate" in Google Trends.
Honestly, I did not think anyone would respond because I do not have any proof, aside from what I was told and to check out Google Trends as direct evidence wen using Pizzagate and related search terms.
Check out when you type in Podesta - yet another spike.
Keep taking screenshots of key phrases in Google Trends and track them. They could lead to interesting information, potentially, but certainly reinforce the growth of the movement.
Please capture these if possible. I do not have time right now.
I felt I could contribute to the cause, I did my best to help Please, continue to spread the word to your friends and family.

       For me and a lot of others I think it started this summer.  With all the election stuff going on during the leaks.  I mean so much shit has come to light since the summer.  Pizzagate is just a part of how fucked up our government is.  And at this point any Redditor has to know that something is fuckity with Reddit.  Lots of people had eyes on what happened to r/politics

       I just thought of this - it makes sense to me, hopefully to you as well: this little pizza joint probably did not receive that much web traffic, UNTIL they planned a sex party. If we follow the Google Trends of "Comet Ping Pong" and other key phrases, we ay be able to put together a schedule of when they planned their sex parties, maybe tie it to missing persons cases, etc.
Does anyone out there understand what I am trying to describe?
The Google Trends data will lead us directly to spikes when web traffic was heavy, hence a higher likelihood that these alleged pedophiles logged into the site at that time, assuming they used Google to get there.
We might even be able to put together a calendar of what went on when it went on through using Google Trends. The potential exists, at least, and we need your help to uncover if this is true.
Does this make sense to anyone else out there?

       About the phone call... did your friend say why google are trying to damage control? What was the story that they gave the staff in order to convince them they were doing the right thing? Seems like they'd be admitting some guilt to all of the staff if they're telling them to cover it up. How much detail did he give you?

       These people are Satanic. It is a fact. A group comprised of World Leaders and the Wealthy Elite. The entire group worships and answers to the ARCHONS. The Archons are Demonic Entities located in the Astral Dimension and communicate with the Elite through their insane rituals..
