        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Seriously I&#39;m not sure if I can say this right but my point is... If all these people &quot;in the know&quot; about all the secrets of the world are Luciferian then they must have some evidence that this is the way to do things ie sacrifice and stuff. Logical people don&#39;t turn into politicians and start drinking blood. What compelling evidence must they be giving to turn other people onto Luciferians?  And if the elite have evidence that their religion is true then why aren&#39;t they telling us?  What would be the point of keeping that a secret, especially when you are in charge of the whole world. I don&#39;t understand why Lucifer would want to be on the down low.  Its all so confusing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds sick, but I think there might be a little something of a truth behind these &quot;dark rituals&quot; whether it is all placebo-effect or if you really do feel some powerful high from consuming adrenaline drenched blood and pineal glands... but there has to be more going on than just blackmail. </p>

<p>If these rituals really do give you power... whether real or perceived... it would be in their best interests to keep it as secret as possible... normalizing it or making it commonplace would diminish it&#39;s strength. If baby blood really does make you live a life eternal then they wouldn&#39;t want demand to outstrip supply. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m certainly curious about it as well, especially after hearing some of the more fringe theories surrounding all the Podesta/Pizzagate/Spirit Cooking business. I don&#39;t necessarily believe it, but it&#39;s certainly interesting to ponder - What if the battle between Good and Evil is real in the biblical sense? What if politicians, the media, etc are just tools of the devil to lead us towards Sin and away from a righteous path? Interesting stuff for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to understand.</p>

<p>If the Rothschild&#39;s have been powerful for as long as they have, and if they have been practicing the same gnostic/pagan/luciferian rituals the entire time - the elders thought the information + rituals were valuable enough to pass down - then is there more to it than just symbolic significance? </p>

<p>Praying to the Goddess Minerva for knowledge, or the demon Moloch for power in elaborate rituals... spending money and time to do these things the right way... etching these symbols into granite on the facades of the most famous buildings in the world... it&#39;s gotta count for something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not magic, just first to market effect.</p>

<p>most of the most successful companies and products were the first to hit the market, which is why their names became the generic for the thing--google, kleenex, xerox etc. coke benefitted greatly from being one of the earliest to market as well.</p>

<p>same with families. if you look at the wealthy families in the US, most had already become established by madison&#39;s administration, the rest by 1900. </p>

<p>the only way families die out is by literally dying out, like the plantagenets, or being forced out, like the the plantagenets.</p>

<p>people like bill, hillary, podesta etc are pawns and tools of families like the rothschilds. they are only as powerful as their current utility to their &quot;patrons.&quot;.</p>

<p>from the wikileaks emails, it appears everyone answers to podesta, even bill and hill. if he is the lynch pin of the global elite pedo ring, his utility is not based on who is in office, and blood and horror are stronger comodities than political access.</p>

<p>the rothschildren owe their longevity to fact their ancestors realized that wearing the crown is a stupid goal, because it&#39;s the purse that matters. most can&#39;t set aside their ego to see the big picture, then or now. those first rothschildren could then. i assume they still can, but it&#39;s also likely they are just coasting now on inertia these days, like the queen of england.</p>

<p>very few rich people are smart, most are pretty stupid tbh. but once you have money and power, the laws of inertia set in allowing most to keep their money and power for a time. some of them mistake this inertia for the hard earned result of their torturing kids and drinking blood and running around in woods while wearing hoods. </p>

<p>most rich people also owe their wealth and power to initial patronage of someone else with money and power (esp true in politics and entertainment). this always takes a certain amount of luck. and likewise, instead of admitting they just got lucky, they chose to believe their wealth is the hard earned result of their torturing kids and drinking blood and running around in woods while wearing hoods.</p>

<p>the rothschildren got rich and powerful at time when the mere whiff of heresy would get you burned...i don&#39;t doubt it occurred to the original rothschild that the easuest way to get the king to pay his debts, was to be able to prove him to be a heretic, blasphemer...much easier than say going to war with him...plus a much lower transcation cost... </p>

<p>it seemes pretty logical that the reason satan worship is &quot;the hook&quot; is because in the christian world from the council of niacea up until 1800, it was the only truly effective means of blackmail among the rich and powerful, the only one that could bring down the mighty with the stroke of pen.</p>

<p>this thread alone shows that even now when belief is veiwed as quaint, santanism still shocks and scares, which is one reason it is still employed--none of the laws clinton broke had any effect on her, but if there was hard proof she drinks infant&#39;s blood, she&#39;d be dead in less than a year. if we could prove this we&#39;d own her. i&#39;m sure tony p knows this too. i&#39;m pretty sure tony p owns her and not she him, as well.</p>

<p>all of this sick crap done by the mind controllers, is also controlling, enslaving, them as well. it&#39;s like a mobius circle of mind control between the victims and the abusers...but someone is the ultimate puppet string puller. i just personally don&#39;t believe it is satan. i also feel it is more productive to focus on the crimes without the ideology. </p>

<p>raping a child is so wrong prison inmates have their own sentences for child rapists. satanism just makes it seem like crazy talk. sex trafficking and prosituting are universally condemned, all the more so if they involve children. physical abuse of children, whether beating, blood letting, isolating, starving etc, is uniformally condemned. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t care why they do it. it isn&#39;t on me to explain why they do it. and there is no explanation that they could give me that would exculpate them. it&#39;s enough for me to say they do it because they want to do it, that it&#39;s wrong, and be done with it.</p>

<p>the occult aspect is more like a signature to me, then a motive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been practicing and studying the occult for 20+ years and am coming to the same conclusion. These people are dilettantes and egomaniacs and on the end they don&#39;t actually care about spirituality be it positive or negative. Most of them anyway. However there are mythical, symbolic elements threaded in giving the glamour of magic which is a kind of power in itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Unless we have evidence those things exist in the first place, there&#39;s no reason to think that praying or sacrificing to them does anything. Step one- prove the religion is true. Step two- prove the elite practice it and whatnot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know.  I guess that&#39;s the question.  Hard to believe you would keep on eating hearts all these years with no effect. I mean what is the sales pitch to get other people to do it now?  Most modern people would not take up human sacrifice just to be part of the club. Or at least woudnt participate in a cover up. If all this stuff is true so many people have to know and be keeping silent. Its horrifying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not they believe they are on the side of evil I cannot say, but all of the magic and ritual around acquisition of power is dark in nature. Regardless of whom you invoke, it is the intent with which the ritual is done that makes it work. Using existing rituals from old times is probably the easiest way to go about it, since it has a proven track record, and the history of if adds a little weight to the matter at hand. It&#39;s why mass is still read in latin. One could very well create a new religion with effective magic, but it would take trial and error as well as sincerity. For any magic such as this, there is a very real cost, however. Something has to be given to recieve something in exchange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Notice how Pharaoh&#39;s magicians are able to recreate some of God&#39;s signs, but fall horribly short matching LORD Almighty.</p>

<p>Aaron’s Staff Becomes a Snake</p>

<p>&quot;The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, 9 “When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ then say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,’ and it will become a snake.”</p>

<p>10 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the Lord commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake. 11 Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts: 12 Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs. 13 Yet Pharaoh’s heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.</p>

<p>The Plague of Blood</p>

<p>14 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go. 15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river. Confront him on the bank of the Nile, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake. 16 Then say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the wilderness. But until now you have not listened. 17 This is what the Lord says: By this you will know that I am the Lord: With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood. 18 The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.’”</p>

<p>19 The Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs—and they will turn to blood.’ Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in vessels[a] of wood and stone.”</p>

<p>20 Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood. 21 The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt.</p>

<p>22 But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh’s heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said. 23 Instead, he turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart. 24 And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river.</p>

<p>25 Seven days passed after the Lord struck the Nile.</p>

<p>The Plague of Frogs</p>

<p>1 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. 2 If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs on your whole country. 3 The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs. 4 The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.’”</p>

<p>5 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’”</p>

<p>6 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land. 7 But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>8 Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the Lord to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord.”</p>

<p>9 Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile.”</p>

<p>10 “Tomorrow,” Pharaoh said.</p>

<p>Moses replied, “It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the Lord our God. 11 The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.”</p>

<p>12 After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the Lord about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh. 13 And the Lord did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields. 14 They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them. 15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said.</p>

<p>The Plague of Gnats</p>

<p>16 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,’ and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats.” 17 They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came on people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats. 18 But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not.</p>

<p>Since the gnats were on people and animals everywhere, 19 the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the Lord had said.&quot;</p>

<p>Exodus 8</p>

<p>Generation after generation, Israelites continued to neglect God and worship false idols like today.  Some more obvious than others.</p>

<p>&quot;So Ahab called all the Israelites and those prophets to Mount Carmel. 21 Elijah approached the people and said, “How long will you not decide between two choices? If the Lord is the true God, follow him, but if Baal is the true God, follow him!” But the people said nothing.</p>

<p>22 Elijah said, “I am the only prophet of the Lord here, but there are four hundred fifty prophets of Baal. 23 Bring two bulls. Let the prophets of Baal choose one bull and kill it and cut it into pieces. Then let them put the meat on the wood, but they are not to set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull, putting the meat on the wood but not setting fire to it. 24 You prophets of Baal, pray to your god, and I will pray to the Lord. The god who answers by setting fire to his wood is the true God.”</p>

<p>All the people agreed that this was a good idea.</p>

<p>25 Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “There are many of you, so you go first. Choose a bull and prepare it. Pray to your god, but don’t start the fire.”</p>

<p>26 So they took the bull that was given to them and prepared it. They prayed to Baal from morning until noon, shouting “Baal, answer us!” But there was no sound, and no one answered. They danced around the altar they had built.</p>

<p>27 At noon Elijah began to make fun of them. “Pray louder!” he said. “If Baal really is a god, maybe he is thinking, or busy, or traveling! Maybe he is sleeping so you will have to wake him!” 28 The prophets prayed louder, cutting themselves with swords and spears until their blood flowed, which was the way they worshiped. 29 The afternoon passed, and the prophets continued to act like this until it was time for the evening sacrifice. But no voice was heard; Baal did not answer, and no one paid attention.</p>

<p>30 Then Elijah said to all the people, “Now come to me.” So they gathered around him, and Elijah rebuilt the altar of the Lord, which had been torn down. 31 He took twelve stones, one stone for each of the twelve tribes, the number of Jacob’s sons. (The Lord changed Jacob’s name to Israel.) 32 Elijah used these stones to rebuild the altar in honor of the Lord. Then he dug a ditch around the altar that was big enough to hold about thirteen quarts of seed. 33 Elijah put the wood on the altar, cut the bull into pieces, and laid the pieces on the wood. 34 Then he said, “Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the meat and on the wood.” Then Elijah said, “Do it again,” and they did it again. Then he said, “Do it a third time,” and they did it the third time. 35 So the water ran off the altar and filled the ditch.</p>

<p>36 At the time for the evening sacrifice, the prophet Elijah went near the altar. “Lord, you are the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,” he prayed. “Prove that you are the God of Israel and that I am your servant. Show these people that you commanded me to do all these things. 37 Lord, answer my prayer so these people will know that you, Lord, are God and that you will change their minds.”</p>

<p>38 Then fire from the Lord came down and burned the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, and the ground around the altar. It also dried up the water in the ditch. 39 When all the people saw this, they fell down to the ground, crying, “The Lord is God! The Lord is God!”</p>

<p>40 Then Elijah said, “Capture the prophets of Baal! Don’t let any of them run away!” The people captured all the prophets. Then Elijah led them down to the Kishon Valley, where he killed them.&quot;</p>

<p>1 Kings 18</p>

<p>In this season of advent it&#39;s wise to remember:</p>

<p>12 “Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to each person according to what they have done. 13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.</p>

<p>14 “Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. 15 Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Satan, who is the god of this world, has blinded the minds of those who don’t believe. They are unable to see the glorious light of the Good News. They don’t understand this message about the glory of Christ, who is the exact likeness of God.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Most importantly, be disciplined and stay on guard. Your enemy the devil is prowling around outside like a roaring lion, just waiting and hoping for the chance to devour someone. 9 Resist him and be strong in your faith, knowing that your brothers and sisters throughout the world are fellow sufferers with you. 10 After you have suffered for a little while, the God of grace who has called you to His everlasting presence through Jesus the Anointed will restore you, support you, strengthen you, and ground you. 11 For all power belongs to God, now and forever. Amen.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes to the ruling elites who participate in such things, most don&#39;t believe in even half of the magical/supernatural crap they may go through the motions for, even the theistic ones. It&#39;s more so a psychological thing, and once you&#39;ve waded through tons of content explaining the &quot;left hand path&quot; the TL;DR summary is that it&#39;s simply an embracing of moral nihilism that is presented as religion and/or magical practices. Practices like rituals are meant to cement their perceptions as much as possible, and in some cases to be used for the purposes of blackmail and/or trauma bonding for cult members. It&#39;s essentially a big, grand, systematic way to strengthen their self-justifications for their own depravity. Psychopathic leaders feel no need to justify themselves to anyone, including themselves; that aspect of existence doesn&#39;t even occur to them. But all of their narcissistic puppets need to be heavily indoctrinated with the notion that serving the psychopaths&#39; whims will make the puppets superior, special, &quot;enlightened&quot; and so on compared to everyone else, in order to make the puppets eager and ambitious in their service. Then blackmail and trauma bonding is used to keep the puppets in line should they become disillusioned. These aspects of human psychology are at play even in such basic circumstances as dysfunctional, abusive families, but they work just as well on larger scales. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this is a case of true vs false religions. The idea that there&#39;s only one true &quot;god&quot; (or devil) is a distinctly Judeo-Christian point of view.</p>

<p>In my view, there are actually very many supernatural forces at play. The Jewish-Christian god is just one of them - though supplicants like to portray Him as the one and only. That&#39;s just marketing.</p>

<p>I do think there is an all-encompassing &quot;GOD&quot;, but this GOD transcends human thought and religion. Probably transcends all of reality itself.</p>

<p>Regarding your questions, worship of certain gods will convey more material gains in this world - though it comes at heavy cost.  If you feed a god, it grants you power. But it will also manifest itself in you. You need to be careful what you worship. All that is required for evidence is to show someone the gains granted with certain rituals. Currently, the elites won&#39;t show this to the masses because, frankly, the gods they worship are revolting, and if known, would easily be subdued by the backlash of - for example - <em>true</em> Christ worship and devotion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to note that these occult practices weren&#39;t always hidden. Look to ancient history, and you&#39;ll see blood sacrifice and cannibalism as common themes, openly practiced by the ruling elite.</p>

<p>In fact, the ancient Jewish religion itself is guilty of this. And even still, modern Judaism and Christianity perform obvious remnants of these rituals. e.g. Jewish cutting of the foreskin and drinking the blood. Christianity&#39;s drinking and eating of Christ&#39;s flesh.</p>

<p>This stuff has been going on for thousands and thousands of years. Nothing has changed. It&#39;s just become more sophisticated and adapted to the times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was starting to think about this too. I began thinking &quot;if they believe it and do acts to strengthen their beliefs then maybe WE should do acts to weaken their gods&quot;... Does that make sense?</p>

<p>even if it sounds silly like asking the whole world to meditate against Moloch, that owl god of theirs... Or think more positive thoughts...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science is a method. That&#39;s it. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p>I know there is no evidence because if there were, it would be the greatest discovery in the history of mankind, or earth history or even the history of the entire goddamn universe. There is no evidence because no one has seen God (or gods) and been able to show others what they look like or sound like EVEN THOUGH the Bible says I should be able to.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an ex-Christian btw</p>
