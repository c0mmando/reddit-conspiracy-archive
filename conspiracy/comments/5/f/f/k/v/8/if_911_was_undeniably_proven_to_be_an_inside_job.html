    <div class="md"><p>Truthfully, I don&#39;t think revolution / civil war would happen. </p>

<p>There are so many people who, while not knowing the &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, think that 9/11 was, in some way, utter bullshit. People I know who openly mock me for being a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; actually agree with me when I talk about 9/11. </p>

<p>The American public is too complacent or too feeble to do anything. They are too reliant on the government to survive because they were raised to believe that they were incapable, irrelevant, and unsophisticated. Shit, look at Millennials in college. If you make a compliment about their shoes you are sexually harassing them. You think this age group is gonna take up arms against their government? Hell nah. They got some Netflix to watch. </p>

<p>Regardless of your own personal beliefs on <strong>how</strong> it happened, if you are on this website, you probably believe (in essence) that 9/11 was utter bullshit. You can also probably speculate that another false flag of that magnitude is coming soon. And the cycle of complacency will continue. </p>

<p>Shit, the federal government assassinated a fucking president and that&#39;s not enough to get people in the streets. &quot;Happened too long ago to be relevant&quot;. Shit, a primary election was rigged in favor of the corporation&#39;s candidate against the &quot;people&#39;s candidate&quot; (Sanders), yet all the SJWs and MSM are too busy hating Trump. </p>

<p>The overwhelming majority of Americans are either too blind, too ignorant, or too &quot;precious&quot; to be bothered with these things. </p>

<p>As a Millennial myself, 9/11 is my JFK. The moment my life changed forever. The moment I learned (at a very young age) that my government hated me and viewed me only as a profit margin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I geuss it wouldn&#39;t be too far of a stretch to say that a civil war wont ever happen again in first world countries right?</p>

<p>Jesus, I don&#39;t know what happened to society. We used to fight for shit like this, now the closest we have are hippies holding up protest signs that won&#39;t even go near a gun. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>If we are lucky, maybe. At least those same hippies believe that something is fucked up, despite all the bongos and the pot smoke. </p>

<p>In my opinion, the overwhelming majority of Americans cant or wont be bothered with these things. They are too concerned about maintaining the integrity of their &quot;safe spaces&quot;. They cant become too upset or too troubled by things of this magnitude. </p>

<p>Thats why I laugh at the majority of my peers and view them as unfortunate, misguided, uninformed citizens. They are too busy talking about the evil, cis white male patriarchy when they don&#39;t realize that their own government is selling them off to the highest bidder. Social Marxism has ruined this country.</p>

<p>Face it, the MSM, the government, and social commentary has succeeded in creating a monotone, subservient new generation of citizens. We literally spend half our days flipping our fingers across a screen with pictures of other people on it hoping we get a &quot;match&quot;. Our value is measured in how many digital friends or <strong>followers</strong> we have. </p>

<p>We are el-fuck-o&#39;ed, brother. CNN could come on the air and show an interview of George Bush admitting 9/11 was his grand plan, and you know what the overwhelming majority would do? Nothing. </p>

<p>Just like the yellow bellied lap dogs they are.   </p>

<p>You can give someone any amount of evidence, and it will be dismissed because &quot;Well, then why isn&#39;t the media reporting on it&quot;, &quot;Well, if they did something wrong, the FBI would have charged them&quot;, &quot;if they staged that, everyone would know&quot;, etc etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha. What would that civil war look like? It would be 99.9% of the country versus a tiny section of individuals who perpetrated the event.

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I think would happen if it was undeniably proven. (which would be almost impossible IMO) </p>

<p>The public woulld immediately demand the persecution of all/any involved. There would be a great deal of the population that would simply still not believe it could not be real though(Even if they reported it on like CNN). A lot of people simply wouldn&#39;t be able to wrap their minds around a Conspiracy of this level. </p>

<p>Next IF the government/proper authorities didnt act VERY fast in rounding up all people who were thoroughly involved and proven involved it would then turn to HUGE protests in several cities and eventually some crazy amount of people protesting in Washington. </p>

<p>Im not sure there would be civil war. There would be violence though. People for sure would die over this. I just dont think it would be an all out civil war because the change of leadership will/would have already happened. (If that evidence had come out while Bush still in office I think it would be a way higher level chance of full civil war).</p>

<p>Without leadership, people will only protest aimlessly without sustenance to continue. It&#39;s also what&#39;s needed more than ever now. The information&#39;s out there. All the celebrity worship of the past few decades. The &#39;leaders&#39;, highly unqualified entertainers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real question is what will make the American people rise up. 9/11 disclosed as a hoax? That won&#39;t galvanize a critical mass. People just want to carry on with their lives and hope the shit blows away. BUT, crash the financial system, and people will grab their pitchforks. Take away their normalcy, and they will fight because they will have nothing else to lose. Think about it- commerce would dry up. Transports would grind to a halt. EBT cards would be useless. And when that happens (by economic manipulation or EMP) it will be hell on Earth. Survival rates for the coasts will be less than 10%.</p>
