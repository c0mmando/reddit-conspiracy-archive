    <div class="md"><p>I mean, from what is in the article, it sounds like he&#39;s bipolar.  But it&#39;s strange that they are saying they don&#39;t know what is wrong with him.  That&#39;s not reassuring from some of the best doctors there are. 
He&#39;s getting some reprogramming or his clone isn&#39;t ready yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This doesn&#39;t sound like bipolar disorder at all. It sounds like a personality disorder. My guess would be borderline personality disorder (BPD) or possibly even disassociative identity disorder (DID), with the former seeming more likely. This is assuming West isn&#39;t using methamphetamine, amphetamines, cocaine. If he has been using these types of substances, the DSM-V requires a minimum of 30 days (iirc) sobriety before a diagnosis can be considered. </p>

<p>All of that said, nobody can give a proper diagnosis based on news stories and PR bits. For instance, Tupac Shakur among many other hip-hop artists have stated that they are performance actors- they are playing a role. Paparazzi and tabloids have a history of sensationalizing things and even bait celebrities in the hopes of causing them to overreact. The MSM even gets in on the action. On top of that there are staged incidents. Kanye and Taylor Swift have/had the same agent back when he took the microphone and moment away from that litthe white girl. Kanye once stated that &quot;George Bush hates black people&quot;, in a moment of going off the script at an awards show. Hillarious, but this was done with the intent of generating publicity for himself, and little to do with Bush imo.</p>

<p>Taking that into consideration, let&#39;s also factor in his financial issues and the fairly recent incident in which Kim Kardashian was robbed. The trauma that led to his first hit &quot;Through the Wire&quot; could have understandably left him with PTSD.</p>

<p>BPD seems the most likely diagnosis imo, but it&#39;s just impossible for us to draw conclusions based on the man&#39;s public persona. <strong>BUT</strong> the likelihood of Kanye being part of an MK type program is high, not only because of his fame and actions, but also because of his connections to black magick. Where you find MK programming, you&#39;ll inevitably find witchcraft. I believe the case can be made that KW is involved with the black arts. Unfortunately, the hip-hop Illuminati banter has detracted from a truth that plagued the music industry: Mystery Religion. </p>

<p>Then again, it&#39;s really none of our fucking business what&#39;s wrong with the man from both a legal and consumer pov.</p>
