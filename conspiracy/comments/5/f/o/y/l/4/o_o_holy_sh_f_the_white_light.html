        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know that might be a pretty stupid title, and I apologize for it, but holy shit.  My head (and heart) is (yet again) beginning to spin a bit right now because I just came across yet <em>another</em> source referencing a concept that I absolutely swore I would likely never hear from anyone else.</p>

<p>About maybe a year or two (or so) ago, I listened to a lecture by UK politician and ET experiencer Simon Parkes where he went into a concept I had never heard about before.  You know the &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;inviting&quot; white light that our civilization has all but practically ingrained in us as A) what many/all of us will see when we die and B) <em>exactly</em> what you want to go toward because &quot;it&#39;s just so completely filled with love and beauty!&quot;?  <a href="http://www.relatably.com/m/img/meme-happy-crying-face/2607593.jpg">&quot;Yes  It&#39;s God calling you!  Just love it and accept it and go right toward it!  You&#39;re finally <em>free!&quot;</em></a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard and read this talked about on various occasions from practically every source that mentions the &quot;white light&quot; - from movies like the famous <a href="https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder799/500x/64936799.jpg">Poltergeist</a>, to books to shows, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Well, listening to a lecture of his a while back, I heard Simon Parkes specifically say to <a href="https://www.starwarshq.com/uploads/monthly_2015_07/TRAP.png.465b3073a56d512c3602d71ac7689bfb.png">go <em>away</em> from the white light.</a>  It&#39;s the <em>last</em> thing you want to do.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXznCEtY0rQ#t=115m03s">Here he is explaining it.</a></p>

<p>So when I first heard that, I was really...intrigued by that thought/concept - especially since I&#39;ve read a few books where the white light was greatly revered and its &quot;love&quot; was always talked about, etc...</p>

<p>So I started keeping the thought of NOT going into the white light in my mind - although, of course, I don&#39;t really have too much of an idea how effective I&#39;ll be at being able to <em>not</em> go into it at death or whatever.</p>

<p>But then just now, I was listening to a talk by recently deceased truth seeker Max Spiers...and what the <em>hell?</em>  I don&#39;t think that Max and Simon had any talks with one another and conspired or anything, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JukclW5_IGU&amp;t=19s#t=38m14s">Max says exactly the same thing!</a></p>

<p>So dayem.  I was like <strong>O_o</strong>.  And bloody hell, both Max and Simon even make specific mention of humans being genetically devolved/manipulated/brought down to only have two <del>strands</del> bands/helixes of DNA (thanks for helping me w/the word usage, <a href="/u/Ci_sees_seas">/u/Ci_sees_seas</a> and <a href="/u/KiA423469420">/u/KiA423469420</a>) when we&#39;re supposed to have a lot more (Max says we&#39;re supposed to have <em>&quot;twelve&quot;</em>) and this was done in order to kill all the psionic/telepathic abilities, etc that we&#39;re supposed to actually have been born with and have naturally.  Max mentions it at 35m and Simon at 1h54m27s.</p>

<p>So...</p>

<p>A - Either they&#39;re both referencing the same shit source</p>

<p>B - or they talked and agreed with one another about what they would both tell others</p>

<p>C - or they both actually, independently of one another have an understanding of a certain aspect of a truth that&#39;s kept from the rest of us.</p>

<p>We all know Spiers was getting balls deep in the rabbit hole and died under <em>very</em> mysterious circumstances.  Parkes is a very well respected professional and politician in his community who has never been shown by anyone to be a &quot;quack&quot; or &quot;insane&quot; (quite the opposite actually - he came out with his ET contact information before he held public office and he <em>still</em> got elected by the people after).  As such, I&#39;d sooner go with option C than A or B of the choices above.</p>

<p>So what does this all mean?</p>

<p>Well...it seems to mean that (I&#39;ll make it into my tl;dr since it pretty much sums up what this entire OP is about)</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>  If any of us see a beautiful, soothing, inviting white light upon passing over to the other side, DON&#39;T GO INTO IT.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>People have always speculated about what happens after death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there have been various studies done pretty provocatively indicating that what some people see after death is quite objectively valid.  See Dr. Elizabeth Kubler Ross’ work.  See Dr. Raymond Moody’s work.  See Dr. Ian Stevenson’s work.  These are just three of many academics who’ve published quite a lot on the subject and whose findings cannot be easily discounted by any intelligent critical investigator.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This premise is based on fear, it has no real meaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Elizabeth Kubler Ross, Dr. Raymond Moody, and Dr. Ian Stevenson (among others) would singularly disagree with this - and I’d much sooner vie toward their professional estimations than anything otherwise at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Walk towards the light versus stray from the light. A decision like this is akin to predicting a coin flip.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not quite.  If what is said about what might happen at death is true, then A) the white light is <em>extremely</em> inviting.  I’ve read multiple accounts in NDE literature where the experience of seeing the white light is described as “the deepest feeling of love I’ve ever felt”.  “I immediately began crying tears of joy upon seeing it and feeling that love wash over me.”</p>

<p>I’ve even read a few accounts of people coming upon the choice of either going into the white light where there’s “nothing but love” or <em>not</em> going into the light and turning around and rejecting the light…but then seeing nothing but “fearful darkness” and “a dark void” as the only other choice - an option which every subject naturally tore themselves away from.</p>

<p>In addition to all this, the mental state that one is actually in upon immediately crossing over may not always be as entirely lucid for everyone as it is during waking consciousness.  It might be more dream-like for some.  As such, if it is indeed more dream-like, that likely means that the critically thinking, higher level consciousness is not being used, and what will gain more control over your actions and decisions at that point will be the more emotional centers of one’s personality.  In this case, one will likely fly <em>directly</em> into the white, “loving” light unquestioningly without actually bothering to think critically about whether they in fact <em>should</em> be going into it or not.</p>

<p>As such, none of this seems to be akin to or as random or “chance” as any coin flip in the least.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why so many lights on this planet are false.</p>

<p>Vey well-said.  Very good critical discernment there.  Thanks for sharing.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Of course.  <em>All</em> light in this physical third dimensional realm is a dying light.  That said, the sun’s light’s not dying for another few <em>billion</em> years, so although it’s certainly not eternal, it’ll definitely be going on for a LONG time still.</p>

<p>If a thing isn’t eternal but, instead, lives for “only” a few billion or a few trillion years, then even though one can still say that the thing is “dying”, it’ll still be alive for <em>so</em> long in the future that - by human standards anyway - it can practically be considered “everlasting”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahhhh.  Say no more.  I get now what you were talking about with regard to the &quot;beautiful light&quot; as it pertains to the deep sea angler fish. lol.  Yeah.  I&#39;m familiar w/deep sea angler fish and <em>their</em> use of light.  It&#39;s definitely not a &quot;positive&quot; light - at least not for anyone but the angler fish who uses it to trap and eat unsuspecting prey.</p>

<p>&quot;Go into the light!!&quot;</p>

<p>And that light is a big ass angler fish in the sky waiting to consume your soul.  Yep.  Good times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll do my best.  I may reveal a weakness in my knowledge.  All for the best if so.  I don&#39;t understand this as well as I would like.</p>

<p>Chromosome is the technical term for a strand of DNA and its associated proteins.  Chromosomes are found in every cell of every life-form on earth.  Different creatures have different numbers of chromosomes.  Humans have 46 chromosomes.  So, every individual has 46 strands of DNA containing their genetic history.  Every cell has its own copy of the individual&#39;s chromosomes to serve as a kind of master guide to cellular activity.  (Cancerous cells have bad copies!)</p>

<p>Chromosomes are often described in pairs, since every chromosome has a specific other chromosome that matches to it.  They pair off and become X shaped during cell-division.  If you&#39;ve seen a distinctive X-shaped cell when people were talking about genetic engineering, those X-shapes are chromosomes.  Imagine a pair of DNA helixes connected at a hinge in the middle and you have a rough mental image of a chromosome pair.</p>

<p>The most famous chromosome pair in humans is the sex chromosomes - XX and XY.  The &#39;Y&#39; chromosome, found only in males, is shorter and differently shaped from the other chromosomes.  I think sometimes people mistake this for all of their DNA, but active genetic information appears on all chromosomes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this information.  Appreciated.  However, I’m still confused by what you meant in saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The two strands of DNA thing is a red flag. Humans have 46 chromosomes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does that relate to what you just stated in this most recent response?  How are two strands of DNA a red flag?  Why is it a red flag?  And how does humans having 46 chromosomes relate to it?</p>

<p>Yes.  I know.  I really, truly <em>am</em> asking questions like I’m 5…but hey, at least I’m honest about it.  :)</p>

<p>Incidentally, the talk of DNA and chromosomes reminded me of a lecture I’ve seen a couple of times a while back by recently(ish) deceased scholar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe6DN1OoxjE">Lloyd Pye.</a>  Fascinating video.  Very much recommend it to you if you haven’t seen it already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so wait a minute...Is it that the chromosomes themselves MAKE the strands of the DNA structure?  Is that it?  Is that what I&#39;m not getting?  So does that then mean that in my above OP statement where I said:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t dispute that we are indeed in a rather deprived state as a civilization, but I look suspiciously upon anyone that attempts to give too much of a justification for keeping us enslaved on this planet.</p>

<p>Additionally, I&#39;ve come across some extremely interesting information as it pertains to this very subject you bring up.  Captain Randy Cramer of an unacknowledged Marine Corp Special Access Program has been given authority by his senior command staff to speak out about some of the secret space programs he&#39;s been involved in.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjuDsAt0yo#t=111m14s">Here</a> he talks about some of the dynamics of our jurisdiction as Earth humans travelling in space.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been said that <em>that&#39;s</em> one thing that they (whoever &quot;they&quot; are) absolutely can&#39;t take.  They can&#39;t take our personality/proclivities - likes/dislikes/deep, core desires/intentions, etc.  It&#39;s sort of like what would happen to you if you suddenly awoke tomorrow morning and had pretty much no idea or clue who you were or where you were.</p>

<p>You&#39;d have no memories...but it&#39;d still be <em>you</em> - and you&#39;d still react however it is <em>you</em> tend to react to things even now:  Whimsically, happily, angrily, spastically, etc, etc.  Your personality&#39;s still <em>you</em> - even though the memories associated with whatever that personality experienced are (at least one some level) wiped.</p>

<p>...how is it that I do not remember anything of my past life? This can be easily explained. I am now speaking English. It is not my mother tongue, in fact no words of my mother tongue are now present in my consciousness; but let me try to bring them up, and they rush in. That shows that consciousness is only the surface of the mental ocean, and within its depths are stored up all our experiences.

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth I have a memory from when I was an infant. </p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t talk or walk yet. </p>

<p>I was in my crib and I had the same intelligence I have now. To the point I remember laughing in my head that someone had to change my diaper and that I was on easy street for the next few years. And that my family I was with wasn&#39;t my real family.</p>

<p>As years went by I kind of dismissed it until I checked out a few shows on reincarnation. Like the ones where kids &quot;come back&quot; remembering living relatives from a past life by name and even location. All I have is that memory and it&#39;s always perplexed me. After reading your comments I&#39;m pondering how effective a memory wipe could be to everyone. Or if for some karmic reason some people come back with limited memory&#39;s or intelligence from past lives.</p>

<p>Very interesting.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I imagine there’s technology that exists that simply wipes everyone’s memories that passes through a certain…portal or area or something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or if for some karmic reason some people come back with limited memory&#39;s or intelligence from past lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps it’s simply not really easy if even completely possible to wipe the <em>entirety</em> of a being’s memories.  Perhaps there’s a cosmic law that every being retains its experiences <em>somewhere</em> somehow in its memory.  After all, existence has been proven to be holographic, and in a holograph, every piece of it contains a full and complete image of the whole.  As such, it would seem that it doesn’t matter how wiped or fragmented our memories are made during the course of one or more lives.  We all still eventually have those memories and can get them back under the right circumstances.</p>

<p>It’s like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5foyl4/o_o_holy_sh_f_the_white_light/dame74w/">what I said about Swami Vivekanda elsewhere in this thread.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAHA don&#39;t touch the flame moth. The last sensory input before the lights go out possibly the last thoughts of being surrounded by family and the memories of life.</p>

<p>Seriously Flatliners will be nothing, what didn&#39;t you see.</p>

<p>Hey there are sleep disorders where if you have had them you can be haunted by the out of body thing, and see ghosts, demons, apparitions, or aliens. Sometimes also triggered from hallucinogens etc, and they can get incredibly messy. It works the same way as a REM disorders where your body is often still awake consciously alert hearing sounds having some sensory input by not being fully asleep, but it has drifted into sleep, and that result is freaking as hell from entering into a dream state. This can lead to sensations of something crawl all over you like rats, ants, or spiders, possibly also that abduction or operation, where you feel cramps or bruising and literally go into a panic screaming yourself awake. Or you see your last sensory input, confusing it with a dream state, like your room as it actually is, or you see your body, now enters the dream state and then comes the see through apparition, out of body, or that barely recognizable again see through blurry dream with your room or body being fully projected despite of your eyes being closed and in an early dream state of consciousness of that face, demon, apparition, or alien. The mind playing tricks on you from it being partially asleep, but it is still just about consciously awake. Sometimes this is caused by that OD from whatever the poison and you know you are dead unless you become awake, because you will gag on all the vomit, when your brain was in that dream state, probably the same as needing a wee and dreaming that you&#39;ll piss yourself.</p>

<p>Have you died and come back, there is nothing, because that memory is literally wiped. Where there are often the thoughts leading into and then after, but nothing in between.</p>

<p>We can argue about the dreams that come true, the brain a supercomputer acting out in probability, formulating a foreseeable future. So freaky when that result is perfectly accurate to the person, place or event imagined. No different then hearing the words of a passer by and them turning into the future, just like that sign post or palm of your hand. That narrative fitting its description. Like upon seeing a stranger in tears and then next a phone call for help from a friend or family. Do Atoms attract and we are all an equal sum of the greater parts in this matrix that we call a reality.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I wolverine when I sleep, all that snoring freaks me right out.</p>

<p>If you’re OBEing and are seeing “ghosts, demons, apparitions, or aliens”, then it’s not so much a disorder as much as it’s simply something that’s happening.</p>

<p>If you “dream” that you have an OBE where you go to the house of your out of town sister and see that she’s wearing a blue Pac Man shirt you’ve never seen before, and she confirms the very thing when you call her the next morning, then your minds not playing tricks on you “from being partially asleep”.</p>

<p>You were there and in point of fact saw what she was wearing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I have that REM condition. I can fall asleep in minutes, dreaming entering a dream state, before I am fully asleep. Literally I think about something and the pictures just project themselves or random pictures project them self. Before I am fully asleep. This REM condition is quite untreatable, take sleep pills was prescribed.</p>

<p>For years of my life I was plagued by the same dream about 10-15 times of a see through shadow apparition I thought was male and once a see through head that was female, in my various rooms in 5 different houses, it was exactly the same room as it was with my eyes open, but it was a dream with this freaky sinister thing in it. I would scream as it got near to me, except in my dream I couldn&#39;t psychically scream, waking myself from that scream covered in a cold sweat pouring out of my body. I also sleep talk sometimes and that wakes me up. I have fallen asleep within minutes and been plagued by something crawling up my body violently feeling it all over my skin. I have had friends and family members be in the room with me as I slept, awake, watching me with the lights on to assure me that there was nothing there, witnessing me react violent to something that I thought was pinching my leg and screaming. I have screamed so loud in my sleep before a neighbor has called the police from the bloodcurdling scream cried. I have seen my body before, twice in dreams, once as I rolled off the bed and I was looking at myself on the bed, I awaken and I was on the floor. The other time I was floating above myself, I couldn&#39;t see my dream self, but I was looking at myself on the bed. I have also had dreams which have come true, the person, place and event. Walking down the beach on the date with that person and seeing that same lighthouse, it wasn&#39;t planned either in ahead, no idea what, who, or where. Group of us met up unplanned and I went off talking to this girl first time met.</p>

<p>I have died before or there is a huge blank of memory loss upon waking up in hospital after 100+ mile an hour crash where that impact was on the driver side door into a lamp post and my car was bent in U around it, with all the windows smashed and the steering wheel moved over towards the passenger side, because the car was completely bowed. Except that I didn&#39;t even break a bone and the early report or call in was that there was two people in the car, no just me. Over the limit and hey it saved my life from being flexible, no points, no convictions the tire marks an burn out put the speed at over 100. My father went to look at the wreck and photograph it, and at the same time a mini bus of police there filing a report, couldn&#39;t work it out either</p>

<p>My memory can remember pictures of 1 and half years old and almost everything important from 7 on to today. Short term it is bad with names and the non important usual input.</p>

<p>I have heard the words of strangers, describing things that will happen next like a woman talking about death too her siblings saying that the organs gave up explaining why a relative died, and then one of my own kin dying that week. I have walked down the road seen somebody lost asking people for directions looking for something. I get back home and a surprise visit from a friend who is waiting for me. These things happens frequently. Things like once clubbing all night and well doing something reckless on the journey home with a friend, nicking a fire extinguisher cos hey foam why not. Anyhow the station guard wasn&#39;t having any of it, despite me assuring him, I was a fire man and that&#39;s my fire extinguisher. Only me and my friend on an empty carriage. So I was disappointed, where&#39;s my fire extinguisher, shouted down the road on the walk home. New town different week some idiot nobody I have ever seen before blurts out where&#39;s my fire extinguisher, really because it was a catchphrase?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really care. This shit happens, not because dreams are real, except for when they come true.</p>

<p>This topic those lights go out in death, and they are out. That light was last sensory input from sight sound and memory. Despite seeing the memories of dead kin. Or the unexplained, on the way to that funeral with the family and that weird foreign tourist barely coherent asking you for your family picture, because they wanted you framed for looking nice, even though we are in a time of grief. Just a coincidence right.</p>

<p>A phenomenon you experience is just that:  ONE phenomenon.  There are many different reasons for the occurrence of any one thing, and your being able to dream before you’re fully asleep is A) not all that uncommon (happens to me, my gf, and various other people I know), and B) it doesn’t in any way preclude or prevent the various other reasons for the existence of any number of other phenomena from happening while in the waking or subconscious state.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why use the word/term “untreatable”? as if it’s some sort of undesirable “disease”.  Why is being able to see pictures of what you think about (or just random pictures in general) before you are fully asleep anything that should <em>ever</em> require “pills prescribed”?  WTF?  Dude, you just described A NORMAL, WORKING MIND.  This is how minds work.  You <em>think</em> of thing, and you often visualize it.  Nothing wrong with that.  What’s so weird about this?</p>

<p>Or maybe I’m thinking it’s normal because this is the way I am and have literally <em>always</em> been my entire life and I figured this is just the way things are/people are.</p>

<p>Regardless, you seem to imply that there is “nothing out there” and that “they’re just dreams and that’s it” or whatnot.</p>

<p>There’s just <em>way</em> too much research that exists showing the exact <em>opposite</em> of this for any critical thinker to not understand that there is a LOT happening outside of this small, limited, physical dimension we&#39;re currently conscious of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through a very low point, and became unsettled. This was possibly what triggered it.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t really there prior to that point, and it hasn&#39;t been like that for awhile now, one of the reasons I am more settled and maybe my dog protects me now, it often sleeps at the foot of my bed. I still talk my self awake sometimes, and have screamed myself awake and had nightmares although not so frequently. I still dream in about 20 minutes having dreams in that time of sleep. but I don&#39;t tend to remember them, except for when those pictures start flashing and then something else wakes me up.</p>

<p>But I haven&#39;t seen those shadow monster apparitions in my sleep for awhile, waking up in that fit of shear panic screaming so loudly awake it could be heard next door, being completely soaked in perspiration and shivering. Having to sleep with the light on. Or having the sensation that something was crawling over my skin and feeling something psychically hurting, touching me. This hasn&#39;t happened for awhile.</p>

<p>So why would I want that dream again, yes I would like to have it treated, but sleep pills were irony.</p>

<p>We are connected and there is a connection to the random world we live as individuals, whether people see that pattern or ignore it, doesn&#39;t mean there is not some kind of path or lines to our fate.</p>

<p>However when those light go out, what science do you think that there is, because in trying to turn off a device, what memory is held. The light before it went out, the memories of love, joy, warmth, peace from a bedside of family and friends easing the pain of that morphine drip, or possibly the regrets of something more, and it wasn&#39;t that time. Now replay that inducing death except that light hasn&#39;t gone out completely, because you are still going to be awake later, and if not you are going to suffer from complete trauma by becoming vegetative. Possibly still having sensation within the time frame because that brain is still at work without suffering damage, or was it a full blackout like from hitting that bottle so hard you simply cannot remember that night you woke up with that stranger in your bed.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>You can treat it by realizing that you are one with Everything.  There is an energy that composes everything in existence - all the “good” and all the “bad”.  As such, you cannot be harmed because you are in fact not the body you look at in the mirror.  You are much more.  You are infinite and holographically contain everything and everyone.</p>

<p>How can any demon hurt you when it in fact comes from the same Greater Self that you yourself are one with?</p>

<p>It’s all one.</p>

<p>You don’t need any pills.  They’ll in all likelihood do you more harm than good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are connected and there is a connection to the random world we live as individuals</p>

<p>This is correct - though the world is not random.  Nothing is.  Our minds are just not evolved enough to understand Its order is all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>whether people see that pattern or ignore it, doesn&#39;t mean there is not some kind of path or lines to our fate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p>So then, if you say this, then why did you say “there is nothing out there” above?  This goes directly in the face of that and is directly contradictory to it.  There is a <em>lot</em> out there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However when those light go out, what science do you think that there is, because in trying to turn off a device, what memory is held.</p>

<p>Memory is not dependent on the lights going out or staying on, however.  Doesn’t matter if the lights go out or not.  Memory remains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t expect to be hurt in a dream state of mind at all, but whether I am scared out of my mind in a dream, because I don&#39;t have the same power as being awake is another story. That same state of mind as a nightmare of such loss and being consumed by any grief and waking up with your eyes streaming. Perhaps having a dream of satisfaction, love, or lust and well you know about that dream. When that dream becomes psychical like literally feeling something on your skin and awaking violently kicking or punching out in your sleep, can I trust myself to be in bed sleeping with another?</p>

<p>Where any treatment should find a solution.</p>

<p>When we are not in control of that journey&#39;s dream state is where that harm can affect your state of mind and reality, through not fully being in control of those actions. It is not something most people want to revisit later. </p>

<p>Good and bad are nonsense we are people that we consider to be as such, often from our perception of not fully understanding them. There are plenty of people with really short fuses like those raving psychos, lunatics, and predators, obviously these people we need to be very wary of.  And most other people have something to gain, it is called them self.</p>

<p>Our minds don&#39;t get more evolved, we don&#39;t gain more IQ later, but perhaps that is just how other people view our skill set, we gain knowledge, and we get better at doing things, controlling and using our minds, and we can train our memories to repeat, and we can also stimulate, hypnotize, meditate, our memories too remember, if we cannot otherwise.</p>

<p>What there is out there, is a collection of what you have gained and sourced, and also how you perceive those interactions. We often think there is so much more to our limitations. Then again perhaps there is and we are not fully aware.</p>

<p>Brain damage means after 3-9 minutes possibly longer upon training your lungs, those cells die without oxygen and blood flow, and your brain starts losing more and more function. Isn&#39;t Optography the work of science fiction? Again suggesting that when those lights are out, the last image seen, that light, lit room, or the faces of those family members, friends, etc at the bedside or passing, or the hell of that horrific injury and pain, was burnt in, and remembered as the last information stored, muddled in that dream state. I mean how else will we Santa Claus, providing a full rewarded life of somewhere afterwards giving us that heaven, or the wasted nothingness of wanting something more that hell. </p>

<p>Perhaps there is some other quest to embark on, satisfying those masses with a purpose or service, because of our insignificant meaningness needs to be remembered perceived by any others as it wants for a better place and its final resting place. </p>

<p>Way I figure it, if there is life after death, then hopefully I won&#39;t be in <em>too</em> much trouble when I get there. ;) and if there isn&#39;t? then I won&#39;t be alive to regret it anyway, so it&#39;s all good then too. :)  Win, win!</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I&#39;ve read various accounts stating that people&#39;s &quot;post physical incarnation&quot; experiences vary widely.  Some remain awake and conscious through the entire transition process coming out of their physical life, and other souls/identities actually go to &quot;sleep&quot; upon &quot;dying&quot; and remain in the dark for quite some time after transitioning - almost like the soul/identity decided to just go to &quot;sleep&quot; and take a nap after the physical vehicle passed.  I&#39;ve read that this &quot;spiritual nap&quot; can sometimes take a <em>long</em> ass time.  The soul/identity eventually wakes, however, and upon waking, it&#39;s faced with the same choices any other soul is faced with after transitioning.</p>

<p>And what if I do not choose the luciferian portal?</p>

<p>I guess that depends on which portal you consider that one to be.  It seems that if you go into the white light, you effectively get “wiped”.  If you <em>don’t</em> go into it and reject it…well…here you get into another quite interesting possible conundrum - one which I’ve spent a bit of time thinking about as well:</p>

<p>If you go into the white light, it’s said you get “wiped” and eventually returned/recycled right back into another life on planet Earth with all its trials and tribulation.  If you <em>don’t</em> go into the white light, the idea is that you won’t get wiped and recycled…but…well…what happens to you then?  I mean you won’t get wiped/recycled and you’ll presumably retain your memories - which, of course, would be a good thing indeed - but…then what?  Will you be thrust out into the cosmic wilderness? alone? by yourself? now with no one around you?  <em>Then</em> what?</p>

<p>It seems that, negative and mind-wiping as actually going into the white light seems to be, I’m not certain going away from the white light wouldn’t be fraught with its own perhaps even <em>more</em> significant perils.</p>

<p>Perhaps one can look at this dilemma using an analogy of a Springbok gazelle in the African Sahara:  If you’re <a href="http://www.cokesmithphototravel.com/image/37467357.jpg">in the herd,</a> you stand out a lot more and are likely to live your entire life being nothing but somebody’s meal in waiting - which, of course, would suck, would be a shitty way to live, and nobody should want that.  Conversely, if you say “Fuck the herd!  I’m gonna be free from this shit!”, and go <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Antidorcas_marsupialis,_male_(Etosha,_2012">on your own by yourself</a>.jpg/260px-Antidorcas<em>marsupialis,_male</em>(Etosha,_2012).jpg), then yea sure - you’re now “free”…but now, being on your own and by yourself, you are a LOT more likely to become <a href="http://www.yukozimo.com/media/o/6205-1.jpg">easy prey to all the vast and sundry myriad of predators out there.</a></p>

<p>Not sure if that’s actually a better option.</p>

<p>I’m not advocating <em>wanting</em> to stay trapped in this recycle bin of reincarnation, mind you.  I liken myself more to <a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/matrix/images/b/b5/Matrix-neo-stops-bullets-wallpaper.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131002032735">Neo</a> than to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7BuQFUhsRM">Cypher</a> after all (however true that self-image might actually be one way or the other).  However, at the same time, I certainly don’t want to be the dude that ends up with his <a href="http://www.yukozimo.com/media/o/6205-1.jpg">mouth open running for his life</a> because he decided to “be on his own”.  Who knows if there aren’t even <em>worse</em> dangers out there <em>outside</em> of the white light than in the trap of the matrix here on this planet?  I’m sure there are to some extent.</p>

<p>So yeah.  It’s a definite conundrum.</p>

<p>All this is to say that I certainly don’t want to get my memory wiped and get thrust back into life in the prison slave complex of this planet, but I also don’t want to break out of this prison and find myself out in the “real world” (the cosmic, open expanse) where I might be free, but end up being the spiritual equivalent of a homeless vagrant barely scraping by for scraps, all by himself, and begging for his living because he has no home, no family, etc.</p>

<p>…fucked up options it seems either way you cut it.</p>

<p>I would say this is because you’ve allowed yourself to be swayed by the marginalizing propaganda of this civilization’s matrix MSM - the one that bombards you from so many different angles saying “There’s no such thing as Reptilians, and if you or anyone thinks there is, then you’re just a stupid dummy and deserve ridicule from everyone around you!!”</p>

<p>There’s more than enough data from valid sources (Parkes and Speirs being two of many) for any real critical thinker to realize that it’s very likely <em>not</em> just some sort of “ridiculous tale” and that’s it.</p>

<p>I wonder how many people, say, a year ago would have thought that someone is patently crazy and off their rocker if that person were to tell them that the highest, most powerful orders of political influence in this country - as well as on this planet - housed an ongoing, systematic, epidemic level of child predation, pedophilia, child abuse, and ritual sacrifice/murder.</p>

<p>And yet it’s 100% true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While your explanation is interesting, I remain dubious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good.  Use critical thinking.  Don’t just say yes because you read it from me and that’s it.  Keep investigating.  Remain critically thinking, however.  Remain open.</p>

<p>And know that we do absolutely live on a prison planet; there’s a power that has control of our minds and our way of thinking to a great extent; we’ve been programmed to think many things that are debilitating and self-destructive to our ultimate, long term well-being.  It’s designed to dumb us down and keep us locked into a tiny, limiting space of shallow thought where we remain ignorant of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA">all the life that’s out there.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This all seems a bit speculative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So much on this planet is and almost <em>has</em> to be speculative because TPTB have made sure and sequestered so much of the actual truth away from our minds and eyes.  So much is cut off from us and we are left with so little real truth that we can do little more other <em>than</em> speculate as to what the actual reality outside the prison walls of this planet are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also the whole &quot;prison planet&quot; thing smacks of Scientology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you revert to what your mind has become comfortable having been taught to associate with - what it has become programmed to be used to.  This is not the fault of the associations that you draw, mind you, but of your own mind’s inability to realize that they are only just that:  Associations that <em>you</em> draw.  The associations aren’t somehow inherent in the actual subjects themselves that you’re associating.  Society and the paths you’ve taken have cause you to think that way.  The point is that it doesn’t matter if the term “prison planet smacks of Scientology” or not.  I didn’t here nor have I ever before meant it like that myself.  Therefore, realize that it doesn’t at all have that intention, association, or meaning with me and the way that I’m meaning it.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>  Lots of shit to consider.</p>

<p>Almost a decade later I nearly drowned in a undertow while swimming in the ocean. I was pulled to the bottom and was being hurtled across the coral. Again I saw the light, felt the same presence and blamo I open my eyes and I&#39;m on the surface and safely made it to shore.</p>

<p>Again almost a decade later while off trail skiing with friends 4 of us took a cut through some trees while bombing and we ended up nearly flying off a 100-200 foot cliff. The first 30 feet was at about a 45 degree angle. All of us hit or landed on something. One hit a tree before going off the edge. Another happened to land on the only flat spot and me and the last guy were both able to stop by grabbing onto downed trees. I literally had my ankles hanging off the edge of the cliff looking over the top of all the tree&#39;s below. No light but the same feelings of being over watched and guided to a &quot;safe&quot; passage.</p>

<p>And for whats it worth the one time I chose to go to the light I woke up with my memory&#39;s and I was still in this body.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very open minded so even with all these experiences I still doubt the validity of there even being a &quot;light&quot; that&#39;s not just natural brain chemistry during a traumatic event.</p>

<p>Edit: Family is not religious but we do have a couple odd family heirlooms such as death crowns. As far as my family can remember we have always been &quot;over watched&quot; by angels. Which is odd since no one in the last 3 generations has gone to church. My late grandmother possibly had the ability to know when someone would die just by touching them. She passed away before I was old enough to ask any legitimate questions. But everyone swears by it. Her and my Grandpa passed within a month of each other. And when he passed she never shed a tear &quot;at least around me&quot;.</p>

<p>Last note. I do believe in ghosts after living in a haunted house with 4 others guys in college. Whatever they may be like windows of the past, x-dimensional, what have you. All I know is they/it&#39;s are a legitimate thing what ever they may be. It was a 150 year old candy store turned into a rent-able house on campus. They (roommates) invited me in to live with them without ever telling me about there daily/nightly experiences. I found out the hard way alone while moving in the first day. Before that day I was one of those it must be high electromagnetic fields from exposed cables or blah, blah, blah types in regards to ghosts/apparitions. Because it&#39;s easy to write of what you see in your sleep or while having a legitimate lack of O2. But seeing shit with your own two eyes day in and day out pretty much clears it up for me. Since moving me and all my former roommates have not had any experiences since.</p>

<p>As I already mentioned in this OP, read the works of Dr. Elizabeth Kubler Ross, Dr. Raymond Moody, Dr. Ian Stevenson (Dr. Eben Alexander).  They’ve all done research on a multitude of subjects (or in Dr. Alexander’s case, experienced the phenomenon first hand themselves) and have all described occurrences where the subject is able to verify things that were going on around them while they were considered “officially medically dead”.  That simply cannot happen unless personal identity exists independent of the physical body.</p>

<p>Not at all. To this day I wonder. My mom believes it&#39;s my grandmother on her side of the family that didn&#39;t live to see my birth. She was so bright that I couldn&#39;t see really anything other than her outline and her hand reaching out. She seemed to be wearing some type of robe but again it was just an outline basked in light.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fucking scary…but very fascinating all the same actually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was terrifying to say the least. Right when I was about to pass out from being under so long I popped up on the surface. I was also in a foreign country at the time. When I arrived at the surface I started calling for help the best I could but in the wrong language. No one came to help. People did start to scream and run from the water so I&#39;ve always assumed they thought I was screaming shark which scared me. I didn&#39;t know if they were actually running from a shark or me screaming thinking I was under attack from one(I was around 11 years old). It made it all that much more worse. I had to swim back in alone crying and gasping for air. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>O_o Jesus. Dude, stay inside. You’re a walking accident. lol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right? I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t join the military or some other dangerous endeavor. These are the three that had some type of possible spiritual meaning to them. I have a few other near death story&#39;s I could tell but I didn&#39;t see or feel anything outside what I was experiencing in the moment. If I had the experiences every time I would probably lean more in either direction of the scale. One side being its natural(brain or psychosis) and the other being it&#39;s all real.</p>

<p>This is my skeptical brain at work. To see and hear things in this reality is one thing but to have them in say a dream state or near death experience leaves room for the easily explainable.

<p>More along the lines of the white light and my experiences may have just been mere hormones and brain chemicals on over drive. First time being a high fever. The second nearly drowning and the third almost going over a cliff.</p>

<p>To put it bluntly if I was certifiably dead tomorrow and was standing over my corpse in the morgue I would probably question whether I was actually dead.

<p>You’re saying that seeing a white light’s a known occurrence when you lack H2-0?</p>

<p>A) not that I know of, and B) I bet you a <em>lot</em> that seeing a white light when you lack H2-0 is <em>very</em> different than seeing a white light because your physical body just died.  Two different types of white light.</p>

<p>Be careful with skepticism.  It is no less a dogmatic disease as blind religious zealotry.  There’s really no difference between the blind religious zealot and the blind skeptic.  They’re just at opposite ends of the “denial” spectrum.</p>

<p>I’d say work more toward simply being a critical thinker than a skeptic per se.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for needing to breath while I was in the light I, don&#39;t remember.</p>

<p>There was no “physical you” while you were in the light, so there was no need to breathe there - certainly not in the physical, third dimensional scope of the word anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had to swim back in alone crying and gasping for air.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you almost drowned, but even though no one came to help you, you managed to swim yourself all the way back to shore?  How were you able to do that if you had almost just drowned moments before?  Sounds pretty scary actually.</p>

<p>Brain/psychosis is all real too though.</p>

<p>Yep.  Possibly.  Someone saying “Nope.  It’s not your turn yet.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not if what you experience in the dream state has a direct influence or causal corollary in the waking state.  If I dream that I went to the grocery store and saw a girl in a yellow dress I’d never known or seen before, started talking to her, found out her name was Mary and that she’s from Oregon…and then later on that day while I was awake, I go to the store and THAT EXACT SAME THING HAPPENS…then there’s simply no “skepticism” to work through.  You had an absolutely synchronistic event that cannot be explained by modern MSM science (“$cience”).  Simple as that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m kind of one of those &quot;have to see it to believe it&quot; types.</p>

<p>I’d say maybe not because you’ve already had various anomalous experiences in your life and yet you still doubt their validity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But as you can tell I&#39;m still open to suggestion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be open to critical thinking and logic is all you have to be open to really.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More along the lines of the white light and my experiences may have just been mere hormones and brain chemicals on over drive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That may have been what happened in <em>your</em> case, but there have been far too many cases where some of the things that people see while in the white light get verified in the physical, third dimensional state, and they are things the person in question had no way or knowing beforehand.</p>

<p>Like a 15 year old girl who’s an only child, born and raised in Alabama dies.  Goes into the light.  Meets up with a beautiful 9 year old boy she’s never seen before.  He tells her his name is Roger and that he’s her brother.  He says “Tell mom and dad I said hello.  And tell mom to stop kicking herself over what happened after school in Wyoming.  It wasn’t her fault.”</p>

<p>Girl is brought back to life, and after she’s stable and her parents come to see her, she tells her mom what happened.</p>

<p>Mom sobs uncontrollably.  Girl finds out parents never told her that before she was born her parents had a child named Roger who got hit by a car after deciding to walk home from school because mom was very late picking him up.</p>

<p>Accounts like this are replete in NDE literature.</p>

<p>Your white light might be explained away,  Cases like the one above one, however, can’t be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To put it bluntly if I was certifiably dead tomorrow and was standing over my corpse in the morgue I would probably question whether I was actually dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s not an intelligent critical thinker, however.  That’s simply someone who doubts just to doubt - someone who’s taken skepticism to absurd lengths.  You can doubt that you and I have been communicating back and forth with one another too.  You can doubt that you’re even communicating with another human being right now.  I could just be a complicated, intelligent program.  Sure.  A critical examination of all the known facts of the world we live in, however, should help you throw out almost any option other than that your <em>actually</em> communicating with a live human being (me) right now.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you died and are standing above your own dead corpse looking down at it, and none of the people around the dead corpse respond to your trying to get their attention…then you can reasonably come to the <em>non-skeptical</em> conclusion that A) they can’t see or hear you, and B) you’re still alive and your personal identity has survived the expiration of the physical body you were previously using as a vehicle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d most likely be standing there trying to make &quot;logical&quot;(scientific) sense of it all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I just finished making scientific sense of it in my response/example above.  What you’re doing is using a particularly caustic variant of science that’s much more like “$cience” that has gotten people to stop being actual critical thinkers and gotten them to, instead, doubt just for the very sake of doubting.  That’s a different thing altogether from actual science and critical thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I figure my lack of a religious upbringing leaves me questioning more than going on faith with this matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has nothing to do with religion one way or the other.  You can be the most non-religious person in the world, but if you’re truly logical and truly an intelligent, critical thinker, then you’ll go where the evidence and the data logically, rationally leads you <em>regardless</em> of whether it’s something that the MSM tells you is “hogwash” or not.</p>

<p>Don’t confuse skepticism for intelligence.  Too many people do nowadays - and they shouldn’t, for skepticism is only to doubt…and doubting is good IF YOU HAVE GOOD CAUSE FOR IT.  If you actually have a more logical reason for moving toward A rather than B, however, then it should never matter <em>what</em> B actually is or that it might be contrary to or go outside of the physical or what’s popular in this society, etc.</p>

<p>Again, this is not about religion one way or the other.  This is simply about intelligence and critical thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For me to 100% believe my own experiences I&#39;d need to be fully aware and not under any type of stress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I’d say you don’t actually mean that.  For example, you very much believed you were about to drown, didn’t you?  Your belief was so powerful that you screamed and cried out to anyone and everyone around to help you, right?  Yet you were under <em>terrible</em> stress at that time.  This shows that stress is not a factor the effects what you do and don’t believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Example would be while sitting here answering your questions a bright light starts to form. I&#39;d need it to happen in this reality if you know what I&#39;m saying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have an experience in one reality “A” that has a direct corollary and effect in <em>this</em> reality “B”, then one would be rather remiss to deny the validity and external existence of A.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only reason I can say I believe in paranormal activity what ever they may be is because my experiences were not under duress. That and 4 other dudes plus guests every day for almost a year all saw, heard, smelled the same things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then if you’re aware of the existence of paranormal activity, then you understand that there are things that are intelligent and that are not limited to existing in this physical third dimension alone.</p>

<p>Once you understand this fact, then you <em>necessarily</em> have to concede to the possibility of the existence of all <em>kinds</em> of other worlds and identities.</p>

<p>Well, I think A) people often get a lot more of a choice than they think they do, but B) karma (the real kind - not the reddit kind) does in fact seem to be a very real phenomenon, and depending upon one’s karmic ties/weight/baggage/debts, it might be quite a bit harder for some personalities to <em>feel</em> like they have a choice.  They might simply get drawn in to almost <em>having</em> to address certain incarnational issues which would otherwise keep them from just simply “taking off” away from the white light.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In your dad’s case, it could have possibly have meant that - given that he was young when this happened - it was simply not his time to finish the life he was living yet.</p>

<p>TPTB might have just been saying to him “Nuh uh, kid.  We’re not recycling you <em>that</em> fast.  Get back in that body and live out that life.  We’ll get you in a few more decades.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahhhh.  Say no more.  I get now what you were talking about with regard to the &quot;beautiful light&quot; as it pertains to the deep sea angler fish. lol.  Yeah.  I&#39;m familiar w/deep sea angler fish and <em>their</em> use of light.  It&#39;s definitely not a &quot;positive&quot; light - at least not for anyone but the angler fish who uses it to trap and eat unsuspecting prey.</p>

<p>&quot;Go into the light!!&quot;</p>

<p>And that light is a big ass angler fish in the sky waiting to consume your soul.  Yep.  Good times.</p>
