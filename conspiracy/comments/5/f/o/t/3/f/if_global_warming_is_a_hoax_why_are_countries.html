    <div class="md"><p>Possibly because coal is cheap and plentiful, hence harder to control.</p>

<p>By taxing/regulating coal into irrelevance, you force people to pay higher costs for power, further reducing  there ability to be successful and independent. </p>

<p>Additionally, it&#39;s pretty much a given that renewables/nuclear(lifter) are the future whether you believe in CO2 warming or not. They just make sense from a stability and strategic point of view, the cost isn&#39;t there yet though. But at some point oil demand will plummet. Likely long before we run out.</p>

<p>However, oil is a great tool for controlling nations and sucking economies dry. By pushing coal out now, it shores up already anemic oil demand. Allowing those providing the oil to peddle more of their commodity before demand tanks completely and irrevocably.</p>

About 83% of the radioactive waste has a half-life in hours or days, with the remaining 17% requiring 300 year storage in geologically stable confinement to reach background levels.[63] Because some of the fission products, in their fluoride form, are highly water-soluble, fluorides are less suited to long-term storage. For example, cesium fluoride has a very high solubility in water. For long term storage, conversion to an insoluble form such as a glass, could be desirable.<br/>
300 years decay is still better as current shit.<br/>
But still to long </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It also produces something like 2000x less waste if my memory serves. It&#39;s in the Wikipedia somewhere. If they can convert what remains to glass, storage is easy and 100% safe.</p>

<p>There is also basically zero chance of catastrophic meltdowns. Runaway reactions are unlikely and easily self-quenching with proper design. </p>

<p>Its a really awesome technology. It is unfortunate that the government didn&#39;t see any value in it in the 1970s because you can&#39;t use it to make bombs. Typical government research grants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So its debatable because we don&#39;t know why it&#39;s changing so fast. So they can not say for sure what&#39;s causing it.</p>

<p>While the fact is because of HAARP and other nation states controlling weather. Or the fact <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_warfare">weather warfare</a> has its own Wikipedia page. This is exactly like the evolution debate.
We all can see and agree there&#39;s fossils here. But that missing link gives the dumbasses their platform for denying the whole thing. 
We can all agree there&#39;s a &#39;global temperature spike&#39; occurring and that the air passed <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-s-co2-passes-the-400-ppm-threshold-maybe-permanently/">400 ppm of carbon in the atmosphere </a>  but because the data can&#39;t pin point it&#39;s cause, we&#39;ll deny the whole thing?!?</p>

<p>I mean how do you expect scientists to prove thru data crunching the ultimate source of it? Nations are literally controlling the weather <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Weather_Modification_Office">as we speak</a>. Of course there will be discrepancies in what is being caused by emissions and what is being caused by the other absurd things we are doing with the weather. How can one get accurate data when there are all sorts of variables. </p>

<p>Shit. I mean look up <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread526725/pg1">the tequila sunrise test</a> and video of eiscat testing its atmosphere control. Eiscat is norways haarp. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;The work of the Office is largely aimed at hail storm prevention or making rain to end droughts; they have also induced precipitation for purposes of firefighting or counteracting the effect of severe dust storms, as they did in the aftermath of one storm in April 2006 which dropped 300,000 tonnes of dust and sand on the city and was believed to have been the largest in five years.[2][6] Their technology was also used to create snow on New Year&#39;s Day in 1997.[7] Other proposed future uses for induced precipitation include lowering temperatures in summer, in hopes of reducing electricity consumption.[5] More prominently, they were enlisted by the Chinese government to ensure that the 2008 Summer Olympics are free of rain, by breaking up clouds headed towards the capital and forcing them to drop rain on outlying areas instead.[4] The office created a snowstorm in November 2009.&quot;

<p>If governments are openly doing this. And our own govt is secretly doing it. Why are they spending 500 million dollars on planes spraying chemicals to fight climate change? They have not informed the public this is their method</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A global temperature spike is what everyone can agree on. Burning fossil fuels as a significant factor to warming is debatable. What is very clear, however, is that transitioning to alternative power will NOT reverse the warming trend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No but it would reduce the pollution in our air and water.</p>

<p>And this &#39;global temperature spike&#39;  we agree on is also debatable because of ridiculous right wing sources like this other guy who posted &#39;climate scientist breaks silence on global warming&#39;.  From Corbett report.  Which loves finding these people that can tell their narrative.
&quot;The government wants you think global warming is real so they can your rights away and charge you money by green tax&quot;</p>

<p>If that&#39;s true why is the whole planet trying to curb emissions? America is the only one that&#39;s not. </p>

<p>Also the fact climate warfare has a Wikipedia page and China came out saying they are a world power because they can control the weather. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Weather_Modification_Office">wtf</a> ? How can you say humans are not Messing with the climate. further more, how can you expect a climate scientist to get an accurate reading when shit like haarp and eiscat exist. 
The fact humans are controlling the weather while scientists try to determine the ultimate source of why it&#39;s changing is why there will never be definitive proof that burning fuels changed the weather. No there&#39;s thousands of variables, but that doesn&#39;t mean any less we shouldn&#39;t be trying to pollute he world in less. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what pisses me off, i feel as tho most climate change deniers just don&#39;t care if they pollute the earth or not. </p>

That is a good reason in itself to move away to cleaner forms of energy, irrespective of whether coal burning causes climate change (or not).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you mind posting the wikileaks links for context?</p>

<p>The switch to solar makes your country less reliant on international market stability.  If your plan was to upset governments around the globe, or you expected them to become upset on their own, it would make sense to have nuke, solar, wind and hydro all built in order to maintain your own stability.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the opportunity for jobs projects and endless research on new tech as a way for people to enrich themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s two good reasons.</p>

<p>1) it&#39;s not a hoax (psst, this is the right answer) so they&#39;re moving to alternative energy for legitimate reasons. </p>

<p>But 2) let&#39;s play devils advocate and say it&#39;s a hoax, why not. </p>

<p>It costs governments nothing to placate the masses when we collectively get our panties in a bunch. </p>

<p>If I can stay in power by building some solar panels and shutting down a coal factory, then cool. Whatever. </p>

<p>Also, it lessens my reliance on foreign powers, so also a win.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m less beholden to other powers, AND I can pass draconian laws and still get voted back in because I run on the &quot;look how much I love earth&quot; platform? </p>

<p>There&#39;s no downside to play ball even if it&#39;s a hoax.</p>

<p>But again. It&#39;s not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno common sense things which make the move to non fossil fuels sensible even if global warming didn&#39;t exist</p>

<p>Renewable energy independance. No longer dependant on foreign energy supplies and costs if you can produce it in your own backyard for free.</p>

<p>Health benefits of not pushing tons of crap into the atmosphere which kills many millions a year.</p>

<p>Could also argue for energy decentralisation. If every building can produce its own energy you don&#39;t get mass blackouts.</p>

<p>More jobs and industries that could lead to future technologies.</p>

<p>There are so many reasons that are smart for doing it without even caring about global warming that make weird for people not wanting too.</p>

<p>Businesses operate on profit and they naturally choose the cheaper overall option.  Which to be clear, is solar.  </p>

<p>E: if you really want your mind blown search Wikileaks for zero point energy or zpe. They basically confirmed it&#39;s existence. Or at least strongly hinted at it.</p>
