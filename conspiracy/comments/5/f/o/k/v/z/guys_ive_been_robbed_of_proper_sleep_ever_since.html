       I don't have kids of my own, but my extended family is quite close-knit and I have several nieces and nephews. Every time I see them, meet them and/or play with them, especially the recently born infants, I smile with genuine happiness, but that smile is wiped off in an instant when I recall everything that's been unearthed and continues to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it worries me even more that I'm absolutely helpless. You guys, the ones who've been relentlessly compiling data and connecting the dots, deserve a medal of bravery and I hope and pray you all stay safe and that none of us fall victim to these horrendous people. But I don't want to just keep praying. I want to help yet I don't know how. I want to approach the parents of all these children I regularly meet, and warn them of these atrocious monsters, yet I'm worried I'll be called out as paranoid or something. I want to help with data compilation and the investigative work, yet I'm too much of a pussy to even click some links out of fear of what I might see (I've already seen the crap from Alefantis' IG and Podesta's house, and I actually woke up to puke that same night).

       Remember you don't control this world, only your personal actions and thoughts. Do not obsess over these sick fucks, focus on the good in your life. Keep everything in perspective, balance out and enjoy a nice walk free from technology. To disconnect for a bit helps me realign and regain my sanity.

       I feel the same way man. It's one of those things where the logic of your brain connects the dots but doesn't want to believe it at the same time...best advice is to get off reddit/voat/whatever your on, go play some video games , take the dog for a walk, take a minute to breath. You don't know how many of my "get my news from tv" family members I'd like to redpill about this stuff. If you are researching or looking it up my best advice is to do it like 5 hours before you go to sleep so you are not anxious leading up to bed. My anxiety is what keeps me up but also peeks my curiosity. It's a slippery slope that you have to nod out from every now and then. GL Op

       Have you been living in a hole?   I mean,  how did you react to finding out 9/11 was and inside job,  or how did you react to finding out Iraq invasion was unnecessary,  hundreds of thousands of unnecessary dead and wounded and refugees?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact the the pizzagate thing can get people is a way of identifying a particular class of imbeciles,  people who must have a tin foil hat gene,   like others have a god gene.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't doubt that Podesta and the others are sick fucks that commit crimes and get away with it,  but this kind of thing is not that uncommon.    Didn't they just find a child pornography ring in Canada?    I don't get why this is so special and has such a special effect on a certain group of internet junkies?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could understand JFK,  and 9/11,  our country was being stolen,  did that keep you up at night,  it did me.    Now that the country  IS stolen,  what did you expect the sick fucks to do in their spare time?    I wouldn't be surprised if some of them specialized in animals or human corpses,  or torture of homeless people or some other fucked up shit.    By all means,   the police should do their job.    But they don't.   They have been re-purposed to protecting the elite scum and preying on the people.

       You probably need a break. This topic had me sick for days at the beginning. Since then, I take regular breaks and it seems to not be affecting my emotional state so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just cannot let it get to you like that. If pizzagate is a real problem, then we need to do everything possible to make it very clear it needs a real investigation. So we need everyone working on this to be clear headed. You are not going to be able to put forth your best effort to stop this without maintaining a level of emotional separation from the matter. Sometimes if we make something our mission or duty to do good, we find a way to overcome unimaginable challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you cannot separate your emotional state from this (definitely no easy task), it really is best for you to walk away, at least for a bit. There are so many people working on pizzagate. No on person needs to be tormented over it. You cannot have your everyday life, outside of the time you spend online, affected by this. And you need to make sure you take care of you.

       Sending you positive and healing vibes (as hippy-dippy as that sounds, I mean it and it sounds like you need it right now).

       you got conned, by the PTB, using 4chan and reddit. Sorry. If you just looked at it objectively you'd see that. Don't be so gullible.
