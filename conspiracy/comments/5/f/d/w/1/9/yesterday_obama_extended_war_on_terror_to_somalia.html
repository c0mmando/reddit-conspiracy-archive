<p>CNBC is now reporting the &quot;shooter&quot; at Ohio State is a <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/28/ohio-state-tweets-that-active-shooter-is-on-campus.html">Somalian refugee</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The dead attacker was believed to be an Ohio State student â€” a Somali refugee who lived near campus, NBC News reported. It said he was a legal permanent resident of the U.S. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems oddly specific seeing as most other MSM sources can&#39;t seem to decide what the shooter&#39;s skin color even is yet, or whether or not he even had a gun but I&#39;m seeing the picture being painted here: <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/17/23/2799A3A000000578-3043276-Fighting_back_Immigrants_carrying_machetes_have_clashed_with_pol-a-10_1429310762990.jpg">A terrorist from Africa wielding a machete</a>.</p>

<p>We know nothing is a coincidence with these people, so where do you guys think this is headed next?</p>

<p>Are they trying to drum up support for bombing Somalia even more than we already do or does this seem like a domestic race war baiting type of thing?</p>

<p>If a third world person is getting a min wage,fooding and clothing,why would he resort to violence?

    <div class="md"><p>If you follow MSM coverage on these types of events closely long enough, you start seeing patterns: huge mass shooting or &#39;terrorist&#39; attack that creates an (intentional) frenzy in the public, ensuing legislation that takes away some form of citizens&#39; rights in the name of &quot;protecting the country&quot; and coordinated, relentless attacks on targeted groups of people. Throw in a lot of mainstream lively debates about the evil degenerate left versus the racist homophobic right and you&#39;ve created enough hate, anger and distraction among the people so nobody really questions <em>why</em> our government and our military is sticking their noses in everyone else&#39;s business and killing all these folks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, guess who are the real losers? Us. The collective us. Our people, their people, our troops, their troops, the millions of innocent people around the globe acting as collateral damage to serve the highly exclusive interests of a few. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the dude ended up being another government Muslim patsy plant that posted about his upcoming &quot;terror&quot; attacks on Facebook the day prior and I guess he&#39;s linked to ISIS (Israeli Secret Intelligence Service). Facebook part Sound familiar? </p>

<p>&quot;Adam Lanza&quot; did it.
Dylan Roof did it. 
Orlando shooter did it.</p>

<p>Y&#39;all know the drill. Originally I had assumed it had something to do with Somalia but it looks like the dude was talking about how he was a &quot;scared Muslim&quot; cause I guess apparently Muslims in the US are scared now and we need to feel bad for them? It&#39;s difficult to get people to feel bad for Muslims when the government has been telling us since <em>at least</em> 2001 that every month when there&#39;s a &quot;mass shooting&quot; it&#39;s because of Muslim/Islam extremists.</p>

<p>If any of that sounds like conflicting info it&#39;s because the government can&#39;t get their own goddamn story straight, which is incredible considering how professional they are at false flags at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read about the extension to the war on terror to Somalia.. I&#39;m kinda new to these boards so I read everything but put a pin in it all. </p>

<p>But I was actually ridiculously shocked when I read it was a Somalian refugee.. I know most of you aren&#39;t shocked by this but I haven&#39;t seen anything you guys have been saying unfold in real time and it&#39;s actually really disturbing :|</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been doing some reading on the MK-ULTRA project and the techniques of manipulation and brainwashing the CIA used. I took note of how they often prayed on vulnerable people, those with mental disabilities, the disadvantaged, social outcasts. Sounds just like the kind of people ISIS tends to recruit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m beginning to think that so-called &quot;radicalization&quot; is actually the application of mind-control techniques on unwitting victims. How else to explain these bizarre, inexplicable shifts where otherwise ordinary people suddenly become fanatics and engage in mass murder? It really wouldn&#39;t surprise me if these salafist and fundamentalist cells consist entirely of CIA operatives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I agree with this thought process because in my mind, there&#39;s only two scenarios that are possible with all these &quot;crazed mass shooters&quot; after seeing their appearances.</p>

<ol>
<li>They&#39;re fake. Adam Lanza in particular looks fake as hell and I&#39;ve never thought he was a real person. Bad photoshop job. Same with Dylan Roof.</li>
<li>If they are real, they&#39;re MK-Ultra victims.</li>
</ol>

<p>Both scenarios would explain the bowl-cut, wide eyed thousand yard stare all these &quot;shooters&quot; seem to have and how we&#39;re never given any info about them beyond the &quot;they pledged to ISIS 45 seconds before shooting and they really like violent video games!!!&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s zero reason to believe MK-Ultra was ever discontinued.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a really good catch.  Somalia was on the Wesley Clark 7 countries list, but we were taught just to blame &quot;pirates&quot;.</p>

<p>When SITE got involved, it became shady.  </p>

<p>I got downvoted to oblivion in the initial news thread for saying that I bet there was no &quot;active shooter&quot; and that the story was being misreported.  eventually people un-downvoted me once the media admitted they&#39;d been wrong.</p>
