<p>The only thing IMO that&#39;s evident here is that the stars are moving around us. The motion of the earth has not been scientifically measured by anyone.</p>

<p>Water is diamagnetic and is REPELLED by the moon. Also with the sun travelling overhead, water expands and contracts. That&#39;s all I have on this ATM sorry.

<p>I don&#39;t know about that, I know people have gone missing. The antarctic is very inhospitable at the best of times. Also no one is allowed to just go there and have a look. </p>

<p>On the FE model the sun is much smaller and much closer. Not bright enough to light up the entire disc - only about half.</p>

<p>So one rock of questionable provienance somehow proves that all moon rocks around the world are fake? Including those examined by scientists? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except, this isn&#39;t a conclusion that the earth is flat and doesn&#39;t rotate. It is just an assumption to simplify the derivations. Probably in the temporal and spatial scales that concern aerodynamics of an airplane, this is a reasonable assumption to make. This proves literally nothing. Physics and engineering make similar simplifications all the time to derive equations that are simple and easy to code, that doesn&#39;t mean reality <em>actually is</em> flat or frictionless or anything else. You cannot use this as proof of anything, and those who wrote it would gladly tell you that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You absolutely said it was. You presented it as evidence of your claim. </p>

<p>And of course a lot of things can be ignored, we do it all the time. I&#39;m in STEM (maths/physics), in my field we ignore the effects of general relativity because the phenomena we are studying do not move fast enough for those effects to be relevant. When you study particle physics at CERN, you don&#39;t care there was a tornado in Texas because it won&#39;t have an impact on your experiment. People who do biotech don&#39;t include the rotation of the Earth in their derivations. We always simplify, in everything we do. I am going to assume you have no background in science or research, since this is such a surprise to you.</p>

<p>If you want to use science to debate your theory, then you need to accept the methods of science. You can&#39;t accept science as a way to argue for your ideas and then dismiss it as soon as it doesn&#39;t prove what you want it to. </p>

<p>The only thing IMO that&#39;s evident here is that the stars are moving around us. The motion of the earth has not been scientifically measured by anyone.</p>

<p>Yes it has been</p>

<p>Water is diamagnetic and is REPELLED by the moon. Also with the sun travelling overhead, water expands and contracts. That&#39;s all I have on this ATM sorry</p>

<p>This is false</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about that, I know people have gone missing. The antarctic is very inhospitable at the best of times. Also no one is allowed to just go there and have a look.</p>

<p>Yes they are. Anybody can go look. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the FE model the sun is much smaller and much closer. Not bright enough to light up the entire disc - only about half.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Light obviously works differently for you then.</p>

<p>Based on your posting, I&#39;ve concluded that you are from an alternate dimension where the Earth is indeed flat. However in My Dimension, it is very clearly a Sphere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t sufficiently answered any question. Where is the content? I&#39;m as willing as the next person, Heck maybe even moreso than others to accept any evidence. But currently, you say that all these people are (knowingly or not)spreading lies, but with no proof of your own. I would even accept you taking a specific study and showing the faults and errors in the scientific arguments.</p>

<p>NASA are not the only organisation involved in space studies. In fact a lot of what we &quot;know&quot; comes from scientists collaboration and funding from the R.Catholic Church across the world. </p>

<p>I would like to know however as no one seems to have yet asked the question. Why, when people travel in only one direction (by plane/boat) on this earth, end up coming to the same place (full circle) on a flat earth?*</p>

<p>-Also I would really appreciate an answer here and not having to read through that post you have made before. Or an answer where you tell me to do research as your post title reads: to answer questions.</p>

<p>*or even the measurement of a signal between satellites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When your theory includes flat out denying any and all scientific research that disproves it as &quot;government propaganda&quot; then yes it probably is more likely.</p>

<p>I for one find it hard to believe that millions of scientists from all over the globe have been colluding against the public for thousands of years to convince them the Earth is round. It is preposterous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gravity is not a theory, it&#39;s an observable, measurable and predictable constant in the universe.</p>

<p>There are competing models for the theory of gravitation. The most widely accepted (i.e., not yet disproved or improved) is relativity. Prior to relativity the most widely accepted theory was Newtonian gravity. We know now that Newtonian physics are crude approximations. </p>

<p>Other theories exist, including quantum gravity, and they are being refined and improved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>one that has never been proven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tells me you do not understand the scientific method. Mathematics has <em>proofs</em>, because it&#39;s a finite, logical language that allows for it. Nature doesn&#39;t have &quot;proof.&quot; Even the most fundamental of scientific theories aren&#39;t &quot;proven,&quot; they are simply accepted because no better model has been proposed.</p>

<p>But having a model (or theory) to describe a natural phenomenon doesn&#39;t change the fact that the natural phenomenon exists independent of the model.</p>

<p>Would gravity still exist without humans trying to explain it? Of course it would.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, work on quantum gravity is ongoing. The holy grail of physics right now is interrelating all of the observed forces, including gravity, since relativity related EM, Weak and Strong.</p>

<p>On the FE model the sun moves in a circular motion over the circle of the earth. So you can follow it with a plane.</p>

<p>2,3, and 5 are all explained here <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobersNightmare/comments/5f9lw3/dear_newcomer/">https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobersNightmare/comments/5f9lw3/dear_newcomer/</a></p>

<p>4: I will be covering this later, it&#39;s a big topic. Be tuned at my sub I plan to post on that later today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>6: Like I mentioned in 2 we don&#39;t know much about the thickness of earth or where it ends. All we know is its at least 8 miles deep.</p>

<p>7: While few may believe the sky is fake, stars just revolve around us. I do believe they are modifying the sky with holograms (that&#39;s a whole other topic) but I don&#39;t think stars, the sun, and moon are fake, as they have been documented. </p>

<p>8: Not sure about Einstein, don&#39;t know much about Hubble, but Stephen hawking is likely to be in on it. They&#39;re either confused or paid to purpotrate this lie. Most scientists don&#39;t know their &quot;knowledge&quot; is fake. They get all their info from nasa, which is terrible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read that moonlight is not actually reflected sunlight and this can be verified through temperature measurments. The idea is that moonlight is actually COOLING and can be verified by taking temperature measurements under a full moon, both direct moonlight and then in the &quot;shade&quot;.  Anyone ever try this experiment for themselves? OP? Any non flat earth believers interested in me performing this experiment and recording results? I live at high altitude Colorado so I would have lower atmospheric interference than most.</p>

<p>For flat earth newbs, recall everything in life is yin/yang. Balance of good and evil (or in the case of our current world, imbalance, hence the tension). Moon and sun are opposites (and nearly the same physical size, one is not greater than the other, they are equals). The motion of the sun and moon mimicks a spinning yin yang symbol.</p>
