<p>Vladimir Putin (not Khrushchev) has stated explicitly &amp; repeatedly that he would prefer a peaceful, working relationship with the US. Of course he is supportive of Iran. They are in BRICS together. </p>

<p>Trump wants to see a peaceful, possibly profitable coexistence, while Clinton laid out plans to invade Iran followed by Russia which could legitimately lead to nukes.</p>

<p>Which would you prefer? Let us know how we should view <em>your</em> critical thinking skills. </p>

<p>There was a global civilization that fell after the Younger Dryas event that ended the last ice age. Mainstream egyptologists refuse to let people talk about it because it destroys the claim to the land that modern Egyptians (not genetically the same people) have there.
