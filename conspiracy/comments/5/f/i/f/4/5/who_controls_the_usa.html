       And you have sources for all this I suppose? Thought not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just randomly picking one of your claims, the
       <a href="http://group30.org/members">
        Group of 30
       </a>
       has 32 members of which 6 are Jews (Frenkel, Bernanke, Krugman, Rogoff, Summers, Warsh), not 23/43 as you suggest (which you also strangely include alleged spouses, which I'm certain that you have even less evidence for).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Open Immigration Law Of 1965 is a prime example of that hostility.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You mean the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965">
        Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965
       </a>
       , correct? Interesting that you bring that particular law up, since the immigration Act that preceded it (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924">
        Johnson-Reed 1924
       </a>
       ) actually sought to
       <strong>
        restrict Jewish immigration
       </strong>
       in particular. If Jews "control" America as you say, then they certainly weren't running things in 1924! And by the way, of the names that you mentioned with regards to the 1965 bill, only two (Celler and Javits) were actually involved in the bill's passage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have the time or energy to debunk all of your claims, but what I can do is bring a little balance to your insanity by showing how Jews have historically been one of the most oppressed and marginalised ethnicities in American history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a relatively new immigrant group, with the vast majority arriving after 1900, Jews from the beginning faced tremendous social discrimination in America. Being newcomers meant that they were naturally looked down upon by the establishment in almost all walks of life, and aside from ethnic and religious discrimination Jews also faced significant economic hardship to begin with. Most Jews back then were very poor, the vast majority having migrated from Eastern Europe, most notably the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement">
        Pale of Settlement
       </a>
       . In 1924, the Johnson-Reed Immigration Act was introduced – mainly to restrict the number of Jews entering the United States. Unemployment was rife in the early days as many businesses refused to employ Jews, whilst even some hotels and restaurants had a "no Jews allowed" policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exclusive
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membership_discrimination_in_California_social_clubs#Minority_groups">
        country clubs
       </a>
       and golf resorts would routinely deny Jews entry. To give one notorious example from the 1940’s, when Groucho Marx was prevented from using the swimming pool of a Los Angeles country club for being Jewish he famously quipped “My daughter’s only half Jewish, can she wade in up to her knees?”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Ivy League colleges at one time had
       <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/the-ivy-leagues-history-of-discriminating-against-jews-2014-12?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">
        ethnic quotas
       </a>
       which limited the number of Jewish students, with some prestigious private schools excluding them altogether. Many middle and upper-class neighbourhoods had restrictive covenants which
       <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/covenants_report.htm">
        barred Jews
       </a>
       from moving into the neighbourhood. Much of this lasted well into the 1980's, despite anti-prejudicial laws coming into effect during the '60s as a result of the civil rights movement.

       Ooh, a wordpress blog, and called "thezog" no less. Absolute horseshit. Most of the people that the author claims are Jewish clearly aren't, and he offers as much evidence to support his claims as you have, which is to say zero. Stop wasting my time or give me something real.

      <p>
       Law Of 1965.
      </p>
      <p>
       While serving Jewish interests, the Open Immigration Law Of 1965 was the beginning of America’s death as a unified nation. Jews were behind the law, promoting, lobbying, and “bribing” the law into existence with the fanaticism equalling the most dedicated Muslim terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews have continually evinced hostility toward American Christian culture in their aggressive efforts to change it. The Open Immigration Law Of 1965 is a prime example of that hostility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews are a paranoid people. Wherever the Jews go they fear Anti-Semitism. (Jews have a guilt complex - and for good reason.) Jews fear a homogenous Christian culture of which they would never ascend to influential positions. Rather, in a homogenous Christian culture, Jews are looked upon, (and rightly so), as “Christ-killers.” This is why the Jews tried to get Mel Gibson’s movie, The Passion of Jesus Christ, removed from the silver screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       A typical example of what characterizes the Jewish push for open immigration can be seen in the following 1948 quote by David Petegorsky, former Director of the AJCongress:
      </p>
      <p>
       —— “Jewish survival can only take place within the framework of a progressive and expanding democratic society, which through its institutions and public policies gives expression to the concept of cultural pluralism.” ——
      </p>
      <p>
       Here Are The Names Of The Jews Behind The Open Immigraton Law of 1965:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Senator Jacob Javits (NY)
       </li>
       <li>
        Congressman Emanuel Celler (NY)
       </li>
       <li>
        Leo Pfeffer (Former President of
American Jewish Congress (AJC)
       </li>
       <li>
        Norman Podhoretz (Writer and Member of The Council of Foreign Relations)
       </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Senator Jacob Javits played a prominent role in the Senate hearings on the 1965 bill. Javits authored an article entitled ‘Let’s open the gates’ that proposed immigration levels of 500,000 per year for 20 years with no restrictions on national origin.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Congressman Emanuel Celler, who fought for unrestricted immigration for over 40 years in the House of Representatives, introduced similar legislation resulting in the “Cellar-Hart Immigration Bill,” the precursor to the fatal bill of 1965.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Leo Pfeffer, a so-called, “Jewish Intellect,” (translate, “Christ-Hater”), wrote many treatises and books that propagandized for open immigration.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Norman Podhoretz, a former leftist, now a Jewish “neo-con,” (he’s still a leftist), also wrote many articles promoting open immigration.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Jewish organizations such as the American Jewish Congress, The Jewish Federation, the ACLU, and the B’nai B’rith, (there is no end to their organizations), filed briefs in support of open immigration before the Senate Subcommittee in the early sixties leading up to the passing of the 1965 law.
THE 1965 OPEN IMMIGRATION LAW IS PRESENTLY fulfilling the aims of the Jewish conspiracy as seen in its effects. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by the year 2050, European-derived peoples will no longer be a majority of the population of America due to the massive influx of immigrants since the signing of the bill in 1965.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Most of these immigrants come from Third World Nations whose customs, religions, and culture are far removed from anything remotely resembling Christianity. Within the context of a Jewish-informed “multicultural America,” these immigrants are encouraged by the Jews to retain their own languages, customs, and religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jews have also given these immigrants a moral mandate to expand both demographically and politically. And expand they will and do! But any attempts by European-derived peoples to retain demographic, political, and cultural control in America are represented by the Jews as being ‘racist’ and ‘immoral.’
      </p>
      <p>
       BOTTOM LINE
THE JEWS ARE GUILTY of the ruination of America. What can we do to stop them even now before the final sliciing of their knives into the effecting of the circumcision of our nation?

       Why are you spending so much time defaming Christianity and advocating Israel's crimes against humanity. Are so fucking arrogant and know-it-all jewish bastard? People can think for themselves and already have good understanding about ZOG.

       The "Ashkenazi" Jews are actually descendants from the former Khazar Kingdom. (Converts.) no study has yet accureately represented what would be the remnant survivors of this kingdom who more than most likely asborbed into the empire of russia and otherwise migrated westward to eastern europe. The study suggesting otherwise hinges on a thesis wchich rejects what most (all) historians' evidence find to be true

       The reason Jews are so often accountants and successful CEOs is because their people have been persecuted since the Middle Ages. They weren't allowed to work normal jobs like farming and blacksmithing, because the Christian rulers forbade them from doing so. So they had to work the more "undesirable" jobs such as tax collecting, and thus by circumstance have been fairly rich. It's not because they're part of some super-secret evil cabal which only you're smart enough to see. Get some perspective.

       Just owned by a series of knights and kings of which we all get to serve as serf's on their land of which they provide us just enough to sort of live off of. We basically went all the way back to being in a feudalistic society. Just now we don't have anywhere new to go to get away from them all so the only way to change things is to get rid of them and cause them to fight each other instead of them working together to continue to make the world as shitty as possible. Every single time I try to reply to your post it gets downvoted for some reason. I guess someone doesn't want the truth to get out or you don't like it when someone agrees with you.

       Are they Europeans then? Is it what you are trying to say?

      <p>
       In fact, they are Semitic , there is a clear documented history of the European Jews , rabbis , synagogues, Jewish courts, and books for 2000 years.
All the genetic studies show that Ashkenazi Jews are associated with other Jewish groups and are much closer to the Arabs than to Europeans. The Y chromosome is 90+% of Middle Eastern origin.

       They are european/Mediterranean. Its not meant to be an insult, just a clarification.
Edit: no I dont blame jews en mass for the crimes of the powerful. But it's their (the powerful) ability to claim antisemitism for even suggesting powerful jews are committing crimes. It shuts down the argument and they walk.

       They are in fact origin of eastern europe and the north caucus they are not indigenously europeans but the so called "ashkenazi" jews did infact intermix with europeans so some of them are infact part european. This is may be hard to accept but the studies that show otherwise are flawed and do not include any data to represent what would be the Khazar descendants. It is also likely that some semites did  in fact stay in Palestine but most estimates only put this up to about 5% of the jew population. If you'd like to see some studies and would like to further study this I'd be glad to be. And again I'm sorry but whatever has made these people do these evil things may not be genetic after all. It may have more to with the witchcraft "
       <em>
        Kabballah
       </em>
       " or may lie in the fact that these people were once before the word jew even existed were known as the "serpent people."

        A 1999 study titled “Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations share a common pool of Y-chromosome biallelic haplotypes” (M.F. Hammer et.al, Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences 6769–6774, doi: 10.1073/pnas.100115997) found that:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       “[D]espite their long-term residence in different countries and isolation from one another, most Jewish populations were not significantly different from one another at the genetic level.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Admixture estimates suggested low levels of European Y-chromosome gene flow into Ashkenazi and Roman Jewish communities . . .  Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations were not statistically different. The results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East descended from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population, and suggest that most Jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring non-Jewish communities during and after the Diaspora.”
      </p>

        A November 2001 study titled “The Y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East” (Almut Nebel et. al., American Journal of Human Genetics, Nov 2001;  69(5): 1095–1112) found that in most Jewish populations, male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The study found that Ashkenazi Jews in particular “share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East.”

         A September 2006 study titled “European Population Substructure: Clustering of Northern and Southern Populations” (Michael F Seldin et.al., PLOS Genetics, DOI:  0.1371/journal.pgen.0020143) found that both Ashkenazi Jews as well as Sephardic Jews showed more than 85% membership in the ‘southern’ European group which made their results “consistent with a later Mediterranean origin of these ethnic groups.”
        </p>

         An April 2008 study titled “Counting the Founders: The Matrilineal Genetic Ancestry of the Jewish Diaspora” (Doron M. Behar et.al., PLoS ONE. 2008; 3(4): e2062. doi:  10.1371/journal.pone.0002062) found that  about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A January 2009 study titled “A genome-wide genetic signature of Jewish ancestry perfectly separates individuals with and without full Jewish ancestry in a large random sample of European Americans” (Anna C Need et.al., Genome Biology, 2009; 10(1): R7. doi:  10.1186/gb-2009-10-1-r7) found that “individuals with full Jewish ancestry formed a clearly distinct cluster from those individuals with no Jewish ancestry.”
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This study showed that in DNA terms, Jews, both Sephardic and Ashkenazim, cluster as a distinct group—something that, if the Khazar theory was true, would be impossible.

       Previous genetic studies appeared to support the Rhineland Hypothesis, which posits that Ashkenazi Jews descended from Jews who fled the Land of Israel after the Moslem conquest in 638 AD, settling in southern Europe and slowly working their way north. 50,000 supposedly later moved from the Rhineland into eastern Europe in the later Middle Ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        But there are serious problems with the Rhineland Hypothesis – so serious that some of its proponents actually posited a Divine miracle to account for them.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the population of Eastern European Jews
       <strong>
        surged from 50,000 in the 15th century CE to about 8 million by the start of the 20th century
       </strong>
       – a birthrate
       <strong>
        10 times greater
       </strong>
       than the local non-Jewish population that surrounded them. That
       <strong>
        implausible
       </strong>
       population surge would have had to take place despite the
       <strong>
        economic hardship
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        wars
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        pogroms
       </strong>
       that ravaged those Jewish communities, and the
       <strong>
        plague
       </strong>
       that ravaged the entire region.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another
       <strong>
        problem with the Rhineland Hypothesis
       </strong>
       is Yiddish, the language of Eastern European Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Yiddish, the language of Central and Eastern European Jews,
       <strong>
        began as a Slavic language
       </strong>
       ,” Elhaik notes. It was classified as a dialect of High German later.
      </p>
      <p>
       European Jews and their ancestral groups in the Caucasus and Middle East share a relatively high risk of diseases such as cystic fibrosis, as well – another possible indicator of origins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elhaik’s study, published in the British journal Genome Biology and Evolution, compares the genomes of 1,287 unrelated individuals who come from eight Jewish and 74 non-Jewish populations.

        A December 2009 study titled “Genomic microsatellites identify shared Jewish ancestry intermediate between Middle Eastern and European populations” (Naama M Kopelman et.al., BMC Genetics. 2009; 10: 80. doi:  10.1186/1471-2156-10-80) found that :
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       “Jewish populations show a high level of genetic similarity to each other, clustering together in several types of analysis of population structure. These results support the view that the Jewish populations largely share a common Middle Eastern ancestry and that over their history they have undergone varying degrees of admixture with non-Jewish populations of European descent.”
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        A December 2009 study titled “The genome-wide structure of the Jewish people” (Doron M. Behar, et. al., Nature 466, 238–242 (08 July 2010) doi:10.1038/nature09103) analyzed individuals from 14 Jewish Diaspora communities and compare these patterns of genome-wide diversity with those from 69 Old World non-Jewish populations in order to “provide comprehensive comparisons between Jewish and non-Jewish populations in the Diaspora, as well as with non-Jewish populations from the Middle East and north Africa.”
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The results identified a “previously unrecognized genetic substructure within the Middle East” and that “Most Jewish samples form a remarkably tight subcluster,” and that “trace[s] the origins of most Jewish Diaspora communities to the Levant.”
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        A June 2010 study titled “Abraham’s children in the genome era: major Jewish diaspora populations comprise distinct genetic clusters with shared Middle Eastern ancestry” (Atzmon et al., American Journal of Human Genetics, 2010;86:850-859) refuted the idea of large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This study found used genome-wide analysis of seven Jewish groups (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek, and Ashkenazi) and “demonstrated distinctive Jewish population clusters, each with shared Middle Eastern ancestry, proximity to contemporary Middle Eastern populations, and variable degrees of European and North African admixture.”
      </p>
      <p>
       This paper specifically excluded the “Khazar theory” as an origin for present-day Jews, saying “the genetic proximity . . . is incompatible with theories that Ashkenazi Jews are for the most part the direct lineal descendants of converted Khazars or Slavs.”
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         A March 2012 study by Steven M. Bray et. al.,  titled “Signatures of founder effects, admixture, and selection in the Ashkenazi Jewish population” (Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences, 16222–16227, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1004381107)  found that the “Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population . . .  has a common Middle Eastern origin with other Jewish Diaspora populations” while concluding that the Ashkenazi Jewish population has had the most European admixture.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A March 2012 study by Christopher L. Campbell et. al., titled “North African Jewish and non-Jewish populations form distinctive, orthogonal clusters” (Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences,   doi: 10.1073/pnas.1204840109) found that genome-wide analysis of five North African Jewish groups (Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Djerban, and Libyan) “demonstrated distinctive North African Jewish population clusters with proximity to other Jewish populations.”
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the study showed, the Sephardic Jewish genome is “compatible with the history of North African Jews—founding during Classical Antiquity with proselytism of local populations, followed by genetic isolation with the rise of Christianity and then Islam, and admixture following the emigration of Sephardic Jews during the Inquisition.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, this study added “These populations showed a high degree of endogamy and were part of a larger Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewish group.”
      </p>
      <p>
       (*Endogamy: the practice of marrying within a specific ethnic group, rejecting others on such a basis as being unsuitable for marriage or for other close personal relationships.)

      <ol>
       <li>
        In his book, “Legacy: A Genetic History of the Jewish People”  (Oxford University Press, USA; May 2012), Harry Ostrer, a professor of Pathology and Genetics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University and Director of Genetic and Genomic Testing at Montefiore Medical Center, Medicine, concluded that “Jews exhibit a distinctive genetic signature.” (Jews Are a ‘Race,’ Genes Reveal–Author Uncovers DNA Links Between Members of Tribe, The Jewish Daily Forward, May 04, 2012).
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Ostrer, who is also director of genetic and genomic testing at Montefiore Medical Center, said in his conclusion that “Jews are a homogeneous group with all the scientific trappings of what we used to call a race.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Ostrer also deals specifically with the Khazar theory. He pointed out that the findings from the Jewish HapMap Project (see below) completely refute “the theories that Ashkenazi Jews are the descendants of converted Khazars or Slavs.” (Jews: A religious group, people or race?, Jerusalem Post, 8/26/2012)
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The Jewish HapMap Project, a joint project of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and New York University School of Medicine, was created to “understand the structure of the genomes in Jewish populations” and is an outgrowth of the Human HapMap Project.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       According to this project, “Jewish populations are remarkable for maintaining continuous genetic, cultural, and religious traditions over 4000 years, despite residence all over the world.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Its findings, based on first hand DNA studies amongst Jewish populations around the globe, found no evidence to support a Central Asian DNA origin for Jewry.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the Jerusalem Post, the “Jewish HapMap Project in New York City has so far shown “in exquisite detail what had been conjectured for a century. Jewish populations from the major Jewish Diaspora groups – Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Mizrahi – form a distinctive population cluster that is closely related to Semitic and European populations. Within this larger Jewish cluster, each of the Jewish populations formed its own subcluster.
      </p>
      <p>
       “A high degree of mixing of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Italian and Syrian Jews caused them to become more closely related to each other than they were to Middle Eastern, Iraqi and Iranian Jews. This genetic split seemed to have occurred about 2,500 years ago.” (Jews: A religious group, people or race?, Jerusalem Post, 8/26/2012)

       Dr Eran Elhaik of the University of Sheffield used a computer modelling system to convert Ashkenazi Jewish DNA - the Jewish communities historically located in Europe - data into geographical information, which revealed that
       <strong>
        90 percent
       </strong>
       of Ashkenazi
       <strong>
        Jews
       </strong>
       descend from the
       <strong>
        Greeks
       </strong>
       ,
       <strong>
        Iranians

       and others who
       <strong>

       northern Anatolia (now
       <em>
        northern Turkey
       </em>
       ) more than 2,000 years ago before

       Sorry your study was flawed there was no representation of what would now become the Khazar descendants. That is why the later study refutes this. It is more than very likely these Turkic people migrated north and created the Khazar kingdom were dismantled by russia and The Ottamans so and so forth poor Khazas flee and settle westward to eastern europe and then commence false narrative due to loss of ancestry.

       No, I'm not. Every culture is unique to whats important to them. I'm in the Philippines and they don't really have an emphasis on school or financial success instead they value family much more. However, the Jews value success more than other cultures as the end all. Every Jewish person I know had crazy pressure to be a doctor, or a lawyer out of just sheer pressure from their parents.

      <p>
       Law Of 1965.
      </p>
      <p>
       While serving Jewish interests, the Open Immigration Law Of 1965 was the beginning of America’s death as a unified nation. Jews were behind the law, promoting, lobbying, and “bribing” the law into existence with the fanaticism equalling the most dedicated Muslim terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews have continually evinced hostility toward American Christian culture in their aggressive efforts to change it. The Open Immigration Law Of 1965 is a prime example of that hostility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews are a paranoid people. Wherever the Jews go they fear Anti-Semitism. (Jews have a guilt complex - and for good reason.) Jews fear a homogenous Christian culture of which they would never ascend to influential positions. Rather, in a homogenous Christian culture, Jews are looked upon, (and rightly so), as “Christ-killers.” This is why the Jews tried to get Mel Gibson’s movie, The Passion of Jesus Christ, removed from the silver screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       A typical example of what characterizes the Jewish push for open immigration can be seen in the following 1948 quote by David Petegorsky, former Director of the AJCongress:
      </p>
      <p>
       —— “Jewish survival can only take place within the framework of a progressive and expanding democratic society, which through its institutions and public policies gives expression to the concept of cultural pluralism.” ——
      </p>
      <p>
       Here Are The Names Of The Jews Behind The Open Immigraton Law of 1965:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Senator Jacob Javits (NY)
       </li>
       <li>
        Congressman Emanuel Celler (NY)
       </li>
       <li>
        Leo Pfeffer (Former President of
American Jewish Congress (AJC)
       </li>
       <li>
        Norman Podhoretz (Writer and Member of The Council of Foreign Relations)
       </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Senator Jacob Javits played a prominent role in the Senate hearings on the 1965 bill. Javits authored an article entitled ‘Let’s open the gates’ that proposed immigration levels of 500,000 per year for 20 years with no restrictions on national origin.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Congressman Emanuel Celler, who fought for unrestricted immigration for over 40 years in the House of Representatives, introduced similar legislation resulting in the “Cellar-Hart Immigration Bill,” the precursor to the fatal bill of 1965.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Leo Pfeffer, a so-called, “Jewish Intellect,” (translate, “Christ-Hater”), wrote many treatises and books that propagandized for open immigration.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Norman Podhoretz, a former leftist, now a Jewish “neo-con,” (he’s still a leftist), also wrote many articles promoting open immigration.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Jewish organizations such as the American Jewish Congress, The Jewish Federation, the ACLU, and the B’nai B’rith, (there is no end to their organizations), filed briefs in support of open immigration before the Senate Subcommittee in the early sixties leading up to the passing of the 1965 law.
THE 1965 OPEN IMMIGRATION LAW IS PRESENTLY fulfilling the aims of the Jewish conspiracy as seen in its effects. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by the year 2050, European-derived peoples will no longer be a majority of the population of America due to the massive influx of immigrants since the signing of the bill in 1965.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Most of these immigrants come from Third World Nations whose customs, religions, and culture are far removed from anything remotely resembling Christianity. Within the context of a Jewish-informed “multicultural America,” these immigrants are encouraged by the Jews to retain their own languages, customs, and religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jews have also given these immigrants a moral mandate to expand both demographically and politically. And expand they will and do! But any attempts by European-derived peoples to retain demographic, political, and cultural control in America are represented by the Jews as being ‘racist’ and ‘immoral.’
      </p>
      <p>
       BOTTOM LINE
THE JEWS ARE GUILTY of the ruination of America. What can we do to stop them even now before the final sliciing of their knives into the effecting of the circumcision of our nation?
