        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Mark Zuckerberg is a corrupt piece of shit who is showing us the path other billionaires take to try to cheat the system. He&#39;s an outsider and the media knows him well so every step he takes is being recorded. For example, making his own foundation like the Clinton to launder in their money to avoid paying taxes. Or the more recent one of him trying to rob the local Hawaiian people of their land in order to build his house by placing a lawsuit against them trying to either scare them away or drive them into bankruptcy. I&#39;m sure if you look around you&#39;ll see all the corrupt shit this rookie billionaire is doing. I think this is a good window for us to look through because his actions give us a better insight on how they do their power grabs and how we could protect ourselves from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a garbage reply. If you literally cant do any research other than googling a reddit thread that doesn&#39;t actually confirm your research then you really shouldn&#39;t bother. </p>

<p>Also, one thing to note, none of these &quot;failed states&quot; had the internet. Personal computers. Automation in any real sense. </p>

<p>The biggest example is always &quot;people standing in line for TP in Russia&quot; while we had wall-to-wall groceries here in the US. Ignoring the fact that we lost 300,000 people while they lost 20,000,000. Ignoring the fact that exactly zero US cities were bombed to the ground, much less the backdrop for the <em>biggest battle in human history.</em> They would&#39;ve been standing in line for TP anyway. </p>

<p>Plenty of the countries on that list are doing fine, unless you compare them to the GDP of America like that&#39;s a standard the rest of the world could reach if they only embraced American capitalism. Most of them don&#39;t have either the land or the population to come close, and all the other ones that do got bombed to shit 60 years ago and spent the next generation rebuilding while we were &quot;the greatest country on Earth.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, scandinavia has literally been a battlefield since this cultural marxism snuck in the backdoor some 30-40 years ago. - Or no wait actually it hasn&#39;t, unless you think that having the highest living standard in the world is a destroyed civilisation.  </p>

<p>All that free healthcare, education, payed maternity and paternity leaves, getting payed if you get fired, etc. it&#39;s freaking poison, people are <em>even</em> so brainwashed by the system that we keep it on. But yeah who wants to pay taxes right, when you can live with lifelong student death, and a pathological fear of doctor bills instead, the murican way!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i&#39;m not from Norway, but that doesn&#39;t make them less marxistic, remember the insane nazi guy that killed 77 people in norway because of &quot;cultural marxism&quot; (i dunno if that&#39;s what you mean about poison, but that one guy clearly <em>wasn&#39;t</em> very culturally marxist).  </p>

<p>But i guess by pointing out the oil, that your pointing out that poverty might be the real poison towards society, maybe more so than cultural marxism.  </p>

<p>My point being that maybe it&#39;s not the exact ideology as such that poisons a society. Capitalism or liberalism can just as well turn out poisonous, an example could be what a market driven prison industrial complex has done to american society.</p>

<p>Definitely there needs to be a return to the gold standard, getting rid of the Fed, cryptocurrencies wide spread use, competing currencies, we are going to need some sort of UBI in place because A.I./Robotics are going to take all the jobs in about 30-40 years, and people get freaked out about that because whoever controls the UBI, controls the people.</p>

<p>There are some good economist phd articles on alternative systems of finance, however none of them have ever been tried in terms of some sort of hybrid system that comes in and upends what we have now.</p>

<p>Personally, I feel like rounding up the 1%, taking all their money, and redistributing it globally, as a sort of reset, would be the best bet. However, that would be a temporary fix and I have not yet even consider what kind of effects that would have on the global markets in terms of inflation/value.</p>

<p>Its a real complex question to answer</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree on the most part, however redistributing wealth is a very leftist idea and would destroy the economy. It really is an interesting question as everybody who isn&#39;t rich hates capitalism but everyone hates communism. Somebody needs to find the perfect mix of them both otherwise we will continue on this downward spiral</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah I agree completely. While I don&#39;t in anyway consider myself leftist, I still like to entertain the idea of redistribution for the simple fact that once you get into having more than a few $Billion, it becomes rather useless, Bill Gates being a good example of that as he donated the majority of his wealth and is left with only 2 Billion, now that could also be for tax exempt purposes, but still, no single person really needs more than 2 billion.</p>

<p>Can we cap the amount any 1% can own? Even if we did, they will circumvent the rules and find other ways to own more and manipulate the markets.</p>

<p>Also, Iceland jailed the Bankers that caused their own recession from the 2008 debacle and forgave Mortgages there, which boomed back their economy. So at the very least, I entertain the idea of snatching up a stain on our global history like Soros, taking all his wealth, and using it to forgive a shit ton of debt freeing people from being enslaved by the banks.</p>

<p>History is ripe with Kings and Tyrants being overthrown and their riches being redistributed, which does good for the community for X amount of time until the next King/Tyrant comes to power and fucks it all up again</p>

I am aware that lots of so called &#39;communist&#39; or &#39;marx&#39; socialism&#39; has failed miserably and ended up being some form of brutal dictatorship and insane censorship, is this because of the actual ideology or because of the faults of the people trying to implement it?</p>

To some people things like this are more important than however much money some asshole billionaire or corporation want to wave in your face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest even though I speak out against things like this now, given the field I was in if I just had to screw over a couple people in order to make a billion dollars I&#39;d absolutely do it.</p>

<p>And then the money would probably change me. I imagine two kinds of corruption in the world. The cloak and dagger conspiracy kind, and the &quot;I honestly don&#39;t give a fuck and I&#39;ll just do what I want kind.&quot;</p>

<p>The latter is much more transparent and has motives that are blatant instead of the ulterior kind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disagree. The media does not cover the crimes of Facebook and Zuckerberg by extension. I&#39;ve never seen an MSM report on the use of &#39;debt-slave villages&#39; by Facebook in India, I&#39;ve never seen an MSM report that Facebook is censoring criticism of Israel and Palestinians in general. There aren&#39;t too many places that cover Zuck begging the authoritarian chinese to allow Facebook into China, even if it means becoming a tool of chinese government supression.</p>

<p>He is an idiot though, and it&#39;s annoying that he&#39;s starting his presidential bid 0 days after the election was over. But of course, he really could be president, he&#39;s pro-corporate, pro-israel, anti-civil rights, and anti-left. Those are the only things required to be president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a garbage reply. If you literally cant do any research other than googling a reddit thread that doesn&#39;t actually confirm your research then you really shouldn&#39;t bother. </p>

<p>Also, one thing to note, none of these &quot;failed states&quot; had the internet. Personal computers. Automation in any real sense. </p>

<p>The biggest example is always &quot;people standing in line for TP in Russia&quot; while we had wall-to-wall groceries here in the US. Ignoring the fact that we lost 300,000 people while they lost 20,000,000. Ignoring the fact that exactly zero US cities were bombed to the ground, much less the backdrop for the <em>biggest battle in human history.</em> They would&#39;ve been standing in line for TP anyway. </p>

<p>Plenty of the countries on that list are doing fine, unless you compare them to the GDP of America like that&#39;s a standard the rest of the world could reach if they only embraced American capitalism. Most of them don&#39;t have either the land or the population to come close, and all the other ones that do got bombed to shit 60 years ago and spent the next generation rebuilding while we were &quot;the greatest country on Earth.&quot;</p>
