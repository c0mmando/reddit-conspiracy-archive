    <div class="md"><p>I guess I should have said misleading as opposed to off. Your numbers are correct, you&#39;re just leaving out the part about the 74% of the country that didn&#39;t vote for Clinton either. 
In total Hillary and Trump both secured a little over 25% of the country. You&#39;re including the 46.6% of people who didn&#39;t vote at all in the 2016 election, those same numbers could be stated to say how 75% of the nation also didn&#39;t vote for Hillary</p>

<p>An investigation by a New York Times affiliate has revealed that billionaire globalist financier George Soros, who recently called Donald Trump a “would-be dictator” during an interview at Davos, and whose Open Society Foundation works to finance and forward progressive causes across the world, and is intimately connected to numerous color revolutions, the Arab Spring, and various other political uprisings across the globe, has been revealed to be connected to more than 50 of the groups that organized the nationwide “Women’s Marches” that saw millions of Americans take to the streets across the country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So with the above, you don&#39;t necessarily have to pay protesters, because the organizers that run and operate those 50 Soros groups, are already getting salaries from him. All you have to do is pay the organizers, and they round up the people for these protests, that way its easier to control from people leaking out that they got paid</p>

<p>Trump has been supercritical against MSM even calling CNN fakes and Buzzfeed garbage, and is taking to Twitter to talk directly to us. He;s breaking all regular President protocol and undermining the propaganda machine and using it to his advantage.</p>

<p>They recently lied about him getting rid of global warming on the official gov website (normal protocol, Obama&#39;s admin wiped the site clean for trumps admin), they lied about him getting rid of the MLK bust, they keep coming up with fake news and running with it. We are clearly witnessing info/news wars which to me is awesome, because these are massive cracks in the propaganda machine.</p>

<p>Thats a far cry from paying people 50$/hr to protest... I mean does it surprise you that very wealthy people money trickles down to organizations they like? This happens on both sides of the aisle... </p>

<p>he made it harder for poor people to get mortgages</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re talking about poor folks who were given subprime loans, which banks were giving out like crazy, which caused the 2008 recession. You....um, I think there should be much bigger scrutiny for poor people getting subprime loans so, i don&#39;t know, we don&#39;t repeat 2008</p>

<blockquote>
<p>started the process of taking away 20 million people&#39;s insurance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obama care? That&#39;s a joke, the premiums are financial rape on the middle class</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On day 2 he called everyone with a pair of eyes a liar because of white tarps</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are plenty of websites/threads discussing the &#39;actual&#39; pictures of the inauguration crowds, MSM lied to you again just like the removal of MLK bust was a lie, and the removal of global warming from the Gov website was a lie. MSM just keeps lying</p>

<blockquote>
<p>told the press they should have been reporting on all the great things he did and not the biggest march in US history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A leftist feminazi march with madonna talking about blowing up the white house and one the leaders of the march talking about bringing sharia to america? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>that they still weren&#39;t being fair so they should maybe shape up or expect some resistance from him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. MSM lies about russian hackers, doesn&#39;t cover stories, bias, makes shit up, and if you watch it you are also being lied to</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On day 4 he axed the TPP. The same TPP that was dead regardless of who won in November.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&#39;t dead, it was in limbo, and never fully canceled </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah he sure is looking out for the constitution and the little man. Keep covering your eyes and ears though I&#39;m sure this will all go swimmingly and he won&#39;t continue to fuck the lower class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you not see or read about all the jobs coming back? Foxcon, ford factories, stock market up like crazy, etc. This has effects on us all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hilliary isn&#39;t paying anyone to vote on this subject, she has little to gain by doing so. CIA/NSA, maybe. No one gives a flying fuck about hillary now! It is our duty to question the government. Like it or not, Trump is president and should therefore be scrutinized to the same extent as every other world leader. Not all anti trump sentiments are in favor of Hillary and she is certainly not paying people to effectively troll a Sub that has less than a half million subscribers that most of the country already thinks is crazy. While I do admire some of Trumps positions and he is definitely less corrupt than Hillary, we do need to keep a watchful eye!</p>

<p>We crank the pizza oven up to the highest temperature and cook the bodies until they&#39;re ash. And the only evidence we leave behind is secret coded Instagram posts for you guys to find, that aren&#39;t considered actionable evidence in court.</p>

Who cares about crowd sizes, butt hurt Hillary supporters that want to dump on Trump every day?  Why does it matter if Trump has a minor spat with the media?  What does that have to do with anything.
