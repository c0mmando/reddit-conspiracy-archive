       They didn't vote. That literally means they didn't vote for him. Obviously they didn't vote for anyone else either, but because they didn't vote it means they didn't vote for him.

       I guess I should have said misleading as opposed to off. Your numbers are correct, you're just leaving out the part about the 74% of the country that didn't vote for Clinton either. 
In total Hillary and Trump both secured a little over 25% of the country. You're including the 46.6% of people who didn't vote at all in the 2016 election, those same numbers could be stated to say how 75% of the nation also didn't vote for Hillary

       That is the whole idea of this machine, you know. Deterrence is the art of producing in the mind of the enemy... the FEAR to attack. And so, because of the automated and irrevocable decision-making process which rules out human meddling, the Shill machine is terrifying and simple to understand... and completely credible and convincing.

       Pro-Trump partisans conjure up a claim that their political opposition is comprised of pedophiles. Now anyone who argues against this extreme demonization of the opposition party (Trump is the fucking POTUS with control of Congress) gets called a shill and/or pedophile along with vague threats.

       I question everyone and everything, including Trump. But as a patriot who loves this country and wants to get rid of the fed, reestablish sovereignty, get rid of globalism, raid the 1% and crash the bankster system, Trump's inauguration speech was something that we are usually all wanting in this sub.

        An investigation by a New York Times affiliate has revealed that billionaire globalist financier George Soros, who recently called Donald Trump a “would-be dictator” during an interview at Davos, and whose Open Society Foundation works to finance and forward progressive causes across the world, and is intimately connected to numerous color revolutions, the Arab Spring, and various other political uprisings across the globe, has been revealed to be connected to more than 50 of the groups that organized the nationwide “Women’s Marches” that saw millions of Americans take to the streets across the country.

       So with the above, you don't necessarily have to pay protesters, because the organizers that run and operate those 50 Soros groups, are already getting salaries from him. All you have to do is pay the organizers, and they round up the people for these protests, that way its easier to control from people leaking out that they got paid

       Trump has been supercritical against MSM even calling CNN fakes and Buzzfeed garbage, and is taking to Twitter to talk directly to us. He;s breaking all regular President protocol and undermining the propaganda machine and using it to his advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       They recently lied about him getting rid of global warming on the official gov website (normal protocol, Obama's admin wiped the site clean for trumps admin), they lied about him getting rid of the MLK bust, they keep coming up with fake news and running with it. We are clearly witnessing info/news wars which to me is awesome, because these are massive cracks in the propaganda machine.

       He has talked about weakening the first amendment and being able to shut down the internet along with his awful stances on personal device encryption.  His cabinet is all billionaires the lowest paid member of his staff had a net worth of JUST $800k.  That's not including trump's blatant violation of the emoluments clause of the constitution he has by not releasing his tax forms and saying he divested with no proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       What more evidence will you need that this man doesn't respect the constitution or you, he wants to be loved by as many people as possible to stroke his ego while everything around him fails due to incompetence.

       On day 1 he made it harder for poor people to get mortgages and started the process of taking away 20 million people's insurance. 
On day 2 he called everyone with a pair of eyes a liar because of white tarps, told the press they should have been reporting on all the great things he did and not the biggest march in US history.
       <br/>
       On day 3 he had his surrogate go on TV tell the media that they didn't lie they used alternative facts, that they still weren't being fair so they should maybe shape up or expect some resistance from him. 
On day 4 he axed the TPP.  The same TPP that was dead regardless of who won in November.

       Yeah he sure is looking out for the constitution and the little man. Keep covering your eyes and ears though I'm sure this will all go swimmingly and he won't continue to fuck the lower class.

       What a shill!
He didn't make it harder for poor people to mortgages.  The order he cancelled subsidized mortgages only for the first year.  It was a recipe for tears for the poor and for the economy.  Same thing as from 2006-2008.
       <br/>
       Who cares about crowd sizes, butt hurt Hillary supporters that want to dump on Trump every day?  Why does it matter if Trump has a minor spat with the media?  What does that have to do with anything.
So it's not bad the TPP is cancelled?  You know why it died in novemver right?  Cause trump won.
You sound like a summary of CNN talking points.  Stick to his Goldman Sachs cabinet

       You're talking about poor folks who were given subprime loans, which banks were giving out like crazy, which caused the 2008 recession. You....um, I think there should be much bigger scrutiny for poor people getting subprime loans so, i don't know, we don't repeat 2008

       The guy you replied to is a troll. There is someone that keeps getting banned and making new accounts, their replies always equates anyone that opposes trump to be a "hitlery" supporter, and that they regularly post on r/politics. Very low energy.

       Hilliary isn't paying anyone to vote on this subject, she has little to gain by doing so. CIA/NSA, maybe. No one gives a flying fuck about hillary now! It is our duty to question the government. Like it or not, Trump is president and should therefore be scrutinized to the same extent as every other world leader. Not all anti trump sentiments are in favor of Hillary and she is certainly not paying people to effectively troll a Sub that has less than a half million subscribers that most of the country already thinks is crazy. While I do admire some of Trumps positions and he is definitely less corrupt than Hillary, we do need to keep a watchful eye!

       It is, in my mind, impossible to sub  this sub for 7 years without understanding the powerdynamics in the world, yes? When there is finally a guy elected who all these powerpeople hate, OFFCOURSE we are going to support him. He is giving them the finger, telling them their show is over. If you havent understood any of those things after subbing here for 7 years, then maybe, just maybe, Maybe.

       Its just such an odd phenomena, usually everyone who does sketchy shit gets a deeper look except Trump.

       We we're given a choice between a party that rigged their own internal election and a party being led by their nose by a reality TV star capable of bringing out the best/worst in America's Xenophobes.  Then they went a picked running mates, a Blue Dog yes man and an epic Homophobe.

       I think he is talking more of conflicts of interest with his company's ownership. If Trump does not set up an actual blind trust and if he signs bills that would greatly benefit his company I think the impeachment process is very likely to start.

       Don't worry OP. I've already done my part by reporting several posts that appeared to question or criticize our current administration. I'll make sure to redouble my efforts so that we can finally stamp out all dissent once and for all. I propose we petition the mods to ban all users caught engaging ant-trump wrongthink.

       Pro-Trump partisans conjure up a claim that their political opposition is comprised of pedophiles. Now anyone who argues against this extreme demonization of the opposition party (Trump is the fucking POTUS with control of Congress) gets called a shill and/or pedophile along with vague threats.

       What a shill!
He didn't make it harder for poor people to mortgages.  The order he cancelled subsidized mortgages only for the first year.  It was a recipe for tears for the poor and for the economy.  Same thing as from 2006-2008.
       <br/>
       Who cares about crowd sizes, butt hurt Hillary supporters that want to dump on Trump every day?  Why does it matter if Trump has a minor spat with the media?  What does that have to do with anything.
So it's not bad the TPP is cancelled?  You know why it died in novemver right?  Cause trump won.
You sound like a summary of CNN talking points.  Stick to his Goldman Sachs cabinet

       Remember when
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       used to question the mainstream media -- especially in terms of politics?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, we're still doing that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when questioning the media didn't necessarily make you "pro" or "anti" government?

      <p>
       Oh, questioning MSM means supporting Trump?

       You're talking about poor folks who were given subprime loans, which banks were giving out like crazy, which caused the 2008 recession. You....um, I think there should be much bigger scrutiny for poor people getting subprime loans so, i don't know, we don't repeat 2008

       There are plenty of websites/threads discussing the 'actual' pictures of the inauguration crowds, MSM lied to you again just like the removal of MLK bust was a lie, and the removal of global warming from the Gov website was a lie. MSM just keeps lying
