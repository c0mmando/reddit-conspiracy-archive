<p>This isn&#39;t pro-Trump.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been pointing out governmental hypocrisies on reddit since W. Don&#39;t play the partisan hackery bullshitting game, it stopped working on me a decade ago.</p>

<p>This is about a misleading article, with a misleading title, hitting the front page of the self-proclaimed &quot;front page of the internet&quot;...for <em>at least the dozenth</em> time in just a couple of days.</p>

<p>This is about how the narrative and the public&#39;s perception of events is so easily swayed.</p>

<p>Bernie Sander inspired the young generation to become informed and active, and they learned that deals like the TPP are extremely nefarious and counter-productive to the interests of the people.</p>

<p>Hillary only followed suit when it became politically expedient. </p>

<p>I can guarantee she wouldn&#39;t have killed it in the first week.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>created by mods</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Created by *a mod. This is not an official post. I was a user here for many years before becoming a mod. Am I no longer allowed to point out when I see bullshit on the front page of reddit? I&#39;ve been doing that since the beginning of this website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why not post an article about the TPP</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because this is a <em>reddit specific</em> post that&#39;s pointing out the abject hypocrisy and unreliability of subreddits like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and let us debate the merits for ourselves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this isn&#39;t a discussion about the specifics of the TPP. It&#39;s about the absurd malleability of public opinion and their infantile impressionability when it comes to the media (both mainstream and social).</p>

<p>If you want to discuss the specifics of the TPP, by all means start your own thread!</p>

<p>On a side note, why are you being quasi-antagonist to me of all people?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been banned TWICE by the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods in the last few weeks, and after you personally appealed to me, I reversed your ban <em>both</em> times.</p>

<p>Trump wasn&#39;t a republican until two years ago</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Untrue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump&#39;s party affiliation has changed over the years. Although his party affiliation prior to 1987 is unclear, Trump was an early supporter of Republican Ronald Reagan for United States President in the late 1970s.<sup>[252]</sup> By 1987, he identified as a Republican.<sup>[253]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1999, Trump switched to the Reform Party for three years and ran a presidential exploratory campaign for its nomination. After his run, Trump left the party in 2001 due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani within the party.<sup>[208]</sup></p>

<p>From 2001 to 2008 he was a Democrat, but in 2008 he endorsed Republican John McCain for President. In 2009, he officially changed his party registration to Republican.<sup>[254]</sup> In December 2011, Trump became an independent for five months before returning to the Republican Party, where he has pledged to stay.<sup>[255]<sup>[256]</sup></sup></p>
