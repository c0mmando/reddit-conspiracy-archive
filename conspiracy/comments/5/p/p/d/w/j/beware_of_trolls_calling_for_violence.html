      <p>
       I've started to notice that these past few days we're getting a lot of new users calling for violence in response to the problems we are faced with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if it's just the lid popping on people who've had enough and can't contain their baser instincts or a troll group effort to start portraying dissidents as violent wackos, but either way I would like to suggest the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Calling for violence is a surefire way to get put on a list, as if most of us here need to be on any more lists.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Calling for violence dilutes the message of peace, awakenings and all that good stuff.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If violence could solve anything, the US would have already saved the world without any extra input by anyone else.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Just my 2 cents on the subject.

       The sad thing is, they'll do something stupid like burn down their own cities. Instead of hanging a couple of bankers, or burning the CIA.

       A violent uprising in America is not really an option. Our overall quality of life never dropped to the point of real desperation. We are not some third world country with desperate citizens willing to do anything for a warm meal and some shoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in the midst of our economic depression, we live in luxury comparatively. Sure the government fattens us up and lowers our intellect by pumping hazardous chemicals into our food, water, and air supply but it is a slow and comfortable death. We've been lulled into a chemical lobotomy that shields us from the emotional breaking point necessary for violent revolt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only people inciting violence, have been paid to do so. Some may honestly feel that violence is the answer but they would not act on those thoughts unless paid to. Everyone has bills to pay and taking time off from work to rage against the machine, will leave you jobless.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Soros is behind the recent protests, the purpose is not to ignite the second American revolution. Rather this is to give the illusion that there is unrest among the population. To incite fear among the masses. Drive the wedge between the people of this nation. Distrust your neighbor and hide in your house. This is the only purpose I see, anyway.

       But I know people who have begun to do so. Some ex-military. They aren't being paid.

       They are just angry. Very angry. For a wide number of reasons.

       I think you must live in a bubble if you think that most citizens of the US aren't economically oppressed. They have lived through the the wholesale destruction of the manufacturing sector in the "race to the bottom" so CEO's and stakeholders can make more profit; They have had to work multiple jobs in order to support their families since most companies do not pay a living wage; They have had to watch their loved ones die or face bankruptcy due to illness; They have watched their government be overthrown by corporate power to the point that these corporations literally write the laws and "regulate" themselves. Whole swaths of the rust belt are in complete disrepair. You could go to Detroit or Camden, NJ and it looks like a bomb went off.

       US poverty is first world poverty, you still have a safety net to a certain degree; Section 8, HUD, Welfare, EBT, WIC, . Try being poor in a second world country, it really really sucks: people where my family is from live on less than 300 Euros a month....then try being poor in a 3rd world country, that my friend is REAL desperation

       Could you point me towards your source for the 50% figure please? If that is true then conditions in the US are indeed ripe for some sort of revolution - it is always the middle class (historically) that are the instigators. If a large enough group of previously middle class people suddenly lose their trust in the government or loses their middle class standing...watch out.

       This is part of American propaganda, that violence is never the answer. So you see bouts of rage violence with no control, but you dont get the calculated violence of the RIA.

       As someone who lives in the third world with constant protests, nothing could be further from the truth. Its purely an ideological difference and the effect of state propaganda (promoting people like gandhi, mlk, but not marcus garvey or malcolm x). You do not have it better than anybody. People here have muuuch better health care than in the US, its free, for everyone, but people get in violent protests every year so they raise the funding. People die because of health care issues, and in the US is horrible system that ruins tons of lives but nobody cares. You do not live better than anybody, you just live differently, that is all that you can assume.

      <p>
       And violence works for one simple reason, there is no argument against that. A politician will do anything and everything he pleases until he feels for his personal safety or that of his property.

       Obviously you're not very familiar with American culture if you honestly believe this. The United States leads the world in military spending with a whopping 618 billion US dollars. That is more than the next seven countries combined. It's common knowledge that drone strikes kill innocent women and children and most Americans don't care as long as the "enemy" was vanquished. It's common knowledge that our government houses and tortures terrorists on an island like some super villain, yet many honestly believe the violence is necessary because that's what we've been taught. Necessary violence.

      <p>
       America is number one on the global murder rate chart released by the UNODC. Our police force would sooner kill you than try to assess the possible weapon your pulling out of your pocket. Domestic violence is common place and an apparent by product of our toxic environment. We celebrate mass murderers and serial killers with books, movies, and press coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Violence is America, it's what we were built on and it has done nothing but cause unspeakable tragedies throughout our history to millions of fellow humans. Yet, you have the audacity to sit there and condone violence as if it's the silent savior of the oppressed masses. You're not the first and you won't be the last to make that mistake. Breaking windows isn't going to bring about legislative change, nor will it empower the little guy.

       America celebrates calculated violence on behalf of the state, and condemns "temper tantrums" by individuals. I'm not saying it's right. I'm only saying that this is the reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that all violence is savage, and we should be above that. But in order to transcend it, we need ... something.

       I think everyone can agree that America, as violent as it is, hasn't found that something yet. Or, they simply ignored it.

       Fair enough, maybe he believes he's promoting calculated violence. But actions speak louder than words and the recent protests have been nothing but temper tantrums. I don't think either will bring about the desired results.

       My point is that any perceived resistance to the narrative is exterminated, stripped of any meaning, and marketed for profit. Neutered images of controversial leaders/activists are then turned into media to be consumed by the masses. Any real message that person may have been trying to convey is lost in the disinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Karl Marx is a perfect example of this, his entire existence has been rewritten to fit the narrative. Marxism as it is known today has absolutely nothing to do with Karl Marx's theory. Politicians re-wrote his entire theory and book on Marxism for a completely different agenda. Now college kids regurgitate this bullshit and wear a shirt with Karl Marx on it.

       That's why you should go read Malcolm X, particularly his later stuff (right before they killed him). He just wanted to be left alone, and was willing to use measured violence only in defense. He's not, at all, the villain or insurrectionist he's been made out to be.

       This is the most intriguing point you make. There's a huge "mental health crisis" in America, with 1/4 of the population using mood / mind altering drugs, prescribed to them by a doctor because they have a mental health problem. Why is that?

       What is it about life in America that so many self-medicate with drugs bought on the black market?

       As far as Americans protesting because the rulers decide to go to war, it doesn't work like that. China regularly spews jingoistic, martial propaganda,
       <em>
        because their people love it
       </em>
       . The Chinese have a superiority / inferiority complex, and their leaders talking big about "putting other nations in their place" makes them feel good. I'm pretty sure that if they were in a position to, they would start wars.
      </p>

       It doesn't matter if war is essentially a losing proposition. It's what makes people feel good.

       What I said was only partly true. War actually does make people feel good, or at least the thought of it does, anyway. But it's dependent upon the people and
       <em>
        what they believe
       </em>
       . War is horrifying and wrong to some people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like to see the American people respond to another war by engaging in a general strike and protesting out on the streets, but I don't think that they would, because it's not really what they believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just like have you ever heard of an anti-war protest anywhere in Asia, where predominately slanty-eyed Asians live? (Places like China, Korea, and Japan, as opposed to India). I never have. That's not what they believe in. They don't have a Christian heritage passing down teachings of love and brotherhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans had a Christian heritage. I don't see it have as much influence anymore. Something else has replaced it.

       They have better philosophies that teach love in a more real way and teaches you to avoid the evils of capitalism. They also teach you to not be a bitch, so of course its not an American ideology.

        This is the most intriguing point you make. There's a huge "mental health crisis" in America, with 1/4 of the population using mood / mind altering drugs, prescribed to them by a doctor because they have a mental health problem. Why is that?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is an interesting question with an answer that requires significant consideration. I've thought about it a lot actually, though I dont proclaim to have any comprehensive understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any analysis of this trend should of course start with Big Pharma, the mass amounts of Pharma advertising, and to an extent the complicity or takeover of psychology/medical departments/schools in terms of buying the Big Pharma Schtick. That is obviously one aspect of why drugs are so often prescribed...
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that though I think is a set of more existential considerations. Human beings
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       in response to their environment;
       <em>
        feelings
       </em>
       are how we determine whether we should create, maintain, modify, or destroy the physical or social environment for our benefit. If you come outside from shopping and see your car just starting to catch fire, you
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       panic. This
       <em>
        feeling
       </em>
       implores you to use logic to respond to your environment- you may scream "help! my car is on fire!" You may quickly look for a fire extinguisher or nearby business that might have one. You may look for a fire truck... Your feelings instantiate a response to benefit you in your relationship to the environment- to benefit you by preserving the social/physical power thats given to you by a properly functioning automobile.

       As time has gone on, real wages for the poor and middle class have stagnated in the US while the wealth of the upper echelon has skyrocketed. Further, government has been co-opted by corporate and financial interests, and thus the government is ultimately driven to protect and provide for the upper echelon.
      </p>
      <p>
       As people become more and more powerless, it is logical to understand that depression will manifest itself in portions of the population. This is where it gets infinitely complicated- its not solely not having any means to influence politics, its not just having less money- this depression also manifests from a loss of power that becomes evident by the increasing divisiveness in US society. Increasing racism, sexism (from both sexes), religious tensions- all occuring as various tribal groups pull together to try and pull as much social and material wealth as possible from the system in order to survive and have an effect on the direction of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human mood should
       <em>
        ideally
       </em>
       be neutral or happy- that is human's should have a neutral or favorable relationship to the social or physical environment; having such a mood means that a person understands himself to have the capacity to survive, and socially participate/influence his given social sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is where it gets particularly odious: the response to depression has been
       <em>
        to label the person defective
       </em>
       instead of
       <em>
        considering what aspects of society cause one to become depressed.
       </em>
       It is essentially allowing victims to become scapegoats for systemic problems, and ultimately
       <em>
        profiting off chemicals that neurochemically instantiate artificial happiness.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The depression epidemic in this country isn't because we have an epidemic of fucked up people genetically. We have a depression epidemic because
       <em>
        the system is making it increasingly difficult for all but a very few at the top to have any effect on policy, for all but a very few to have stability in providing for their own social and material sustenance, etc.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Depression is a state of the mind that
       <em>
        results from one's relationship to society.
       </em>
       Big pharma is profiting off of changing the definition to one where
       <em>
        people with depression are broken and need their drugs.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there ARE people with a genetic predisposition, or even those totally broken who DO need drugs. There are those who have experienced horrible things that broke their mind who NEED these drugs. But when such a sizeable percentage are experiencing depression, something is very very wrong with the system...

        JAY: Right. Okay. Question number six. Congress seems a wholly owned subsidiary of the multinationals, Obama is pimping for GE in Africa, the Koch brothers have made a down payment on the Supreme Court, and money will control the next federal election and most of the state elections. Is there any scenario you see that will return this government to the people? Now, we've been kind of talking a lot about that in the previous segments, but that was the next question.
       </p>
       <p>
        HEDGES: Mass protests that begin to scare the hell out of these people and begin to disrupt systems that they care about, that really is the only solution. I think they're very fragile. I think internally they know how corrupt they are, which is why they passed the NDAA, because they want to be able to pull the military on the streets, because I think ultimately they don't trust the police to protect them.
       </p>
       <p>
        And those are the sentiments of a dying elite.
So I think when we begin to organize against all the formal structures of power, I think that they may crumble as the Stasi state in East Germany, which when I was in East Germany appeared monolithic, fell in about a week, and it fell in a week because Honecker, Erich Honecker, the dictator for 19 years, sent an elite paratroop division down to Leipzig to fire on 70,000 demonstrators, and they refused to do it. And after that, in the same way that the tsar sent the Cossacks in to crush the Petrograd bread riots and they fraternized with the crowd, both Honecker and the tsar only lasted another week in power. And once the foot soldiers of the elite will not protect the elite, they're done.
       </p>
       <p>
        And that's why we have to be nonviolent, because ultimately what we are doing is trying to create a paralysis within systems of power, whereby we speak truth, we appeal to conscience, we expose corruption, fraud, lies by those in power so that when those forces are called into the street to stop us, they refuse to do so. That's how all revolutions happen. And that's really in the end what I'm calling for. I'm calling for the overthrow of this system. Let me say that again for Homeland Security. I mean, that's what I'm doing.
And I'm calling for it through nonviolent means, through mass protests, because as a father of four children, I know that if we don't stop these forces, they will kill us. They will destroy the ecosystem on which the human species and my children depend for their life. And that is really the stakes that lie before us and why there is an imperative for all of us to take risks. And I don't like going to jail as I have. Going to jail is more time than I care to donate to my government. But it really is the only option left, because if we fail at this, then it's not just this particular civilization that will be extinguished but human habitation.

       I agree with this entirely. We will see if Trump is any different. Nevertheless, I believe it would be therapeutic for those who have spent the last 8 years calling gun owners "domestic terrorists" to get to experience the other side of the coin.

       As a progressive, personally, I never thought gun owners are terrorists and always supported your right to own and carry. Every side has its fruits and wackos, but mass generalizations are never a good thing.

       Many have gone beyond violence. They want civil war.

       The questions area do they simply want 'a' change and do they realize the implications and/or consequences of a civil war. It simply won't be a change in leadership especially if one with actual fighting starts.

       They don't even have to "call" for violence. All they have to do is make posts accusing people of heinous acts and the violence will automatically follow... and they know it.

       There was once a time when everyone seemed to know that threatening to kill anyone, was known to be something to never do. Also, never to lie about a loved one's death, to get out of work or school. This was once common sense.

       This morning, I read a post by someone calling for violence against police. Felt sad for the poor, dumb dude.

       Madonna is old enough to remember these common sense rules, which means her words were meant to incite. I suddenly don't like any of her music anymore.

       Violence definitely works but only in specific situations. Everyone likes to think another revolution similar to the civil war and revolutionary war is what's needed right now but that will just end up pushing us into martial law and more of what they are against.

       Wasn't there a veiled call for violence in this sub whenever talk of weapons ban came about? I remember that. Strange that this sub is now pro gov now that there's a "conservative" president in office. I thought you guys were anti establishment.

       This maybe dillusional, but doesn't threatning to explode the place a president would live mean that they would be on some type of watchlist? (Even if it could be an hyperbole) The protest recieved a lot of positive attention (As well as bad i'm sure) so the event Madonna took place and what she said probably didn't leave a dent on the postive feedback the protest recieved. However, Madonna surrounded herself with supporters and when she said that she got an audible cheer. If the police or whoever would handle a threat treated it like a legit threat, wouldn't the supporters be put on a watchlist for dangerous individuals? Honestly, I may have smoked a bit much right now. Anyway, Madonna has enough money to pull herself out of the list possibly, so she might be off without a problem.

       Fair enough, maybe he believes he's promoting calculated violence. But actions speak louder than words and the recent protests have been nothing but temper tantrums. I don't think either will bring about the desired results.
