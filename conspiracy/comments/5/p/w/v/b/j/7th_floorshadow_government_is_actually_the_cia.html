Well according to this recent Daily Beast <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/24/cia-starts-recruiting-its-newest-asset-donald-trump.html">Article</a> on the CIA and Trump, the 7th floor refers to the CIA... Thoughts?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Former CIA Director John Brennan’s comment over the weekend  —where he said he “is deeply 
saddened and angered at Trump’s despicable display of self-aggrandizement”—was not helpful in   building a new relationship between CIA and Trump, some
insiders feel. “He’s reminding them of all the people he put in top positions on <strong>the 7th floor (home to the agency’s senior 
executive suites)</strong>, his followers and acolytes, and that they’re still in touch with him,” one said. 
“He should shut up.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To put it simply, it works like this. There is an international cabal, generally represented by a council of 7 (Switzerland). These people are a society of (demonic) philosophers. In biblical times, they were represented as Satan, and today are what we call government, but they are literally one in the same. Philosophers and aristocracies throughout time occassionally expose, or discover them, and then are killed off. Jesus was one, Edgar Allen Poe another, and so on...</p>

<p>There philosophical beliefs are as follows (in short). However, there are &#39;higher&#39; levels of beliefs that they are unwilling to even pretend to share with the masses. These occur within the halls of Bilderberg, and so on.</p>

<p>The best example of the ideas which they stole and corrupted are the politics of Aristotle. However, here it goes:</p>

<p>1) Reason vs Acceptance</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One who is willing to accept knowledge without question is a fool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2) Knowledge vs Ignorance</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One who is unable to learn is an idiot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3) Humanity vs Divinity</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those of great wisdom are divine, those of the pack are beasts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4) Sacrifice vs Homicide</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Life demands sacrifice, not of thy self, but of innocent children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5) Leadership vs Sloth</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The path to subduing a slave is to instill a system reliance upon others, removal of accomplishment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>6) Progress vs Forgetfulness</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every ~55 years, the slave achieve &#39;progress&#39;, which is reset by stupefying their children and provoking a civil war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>7) Duality vs Sameness</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man is both bad and good. The goodness of &#39;humanity&#39; is balanced by the evil of &#39;the ruler&#39;. Without the evil, there can be no good, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>8) Deception vs Closure</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;the magicians code&#39; - Society requires deception, or a puzzle to break out of. In this way, only the most enlightened are able to ascend to rule. - If &#39;all the answers were provided&#39;, then we would be unable to distinguish the learned from the enlightened, and there would be no purpose to life.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>That&#39;s the basics. Aristotle covers a lot of the ways to fix this. An Honest Liar (movie) covers a basic way in which this infects society (but apply it to economics, religion, and politics), and Hop Frog is just a fun tail of revenge, with the basic concept presented of the 7 councilors and the immolation of the guilty vs the innocent, along with presenting the perspective of the corrupt : that we are beasts, unfit for their world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bible is a good start, and then to understand it. Recognizing the deception requires great wisdom, but notably:</p>

<p>Satanic Phrase : &quot;God so loved the world, he gave his only son.&quot; (Infant Sacrifice)</p>

<p>Jesus Philosophy : &quot;For the good of all man, I sacrifice myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Satanic Phrase : &quot;Jesus died, so that you may be forgiven&quot; (Sloth)</p>

<p>Jesus Philosophy : &quot;I share truth with the world, so that you may do likewise.&quot;</p>

<p>Satanic Phrase : &quot;Jesus turned water into wine.&quot; (mysticism)</p>

<p>Jesus Philosophy : &#39;For he spoke unto the masses, and then water had the power of wine.&#39; (Essentially that truth sets you free, providing a renewed purpose for life - making the frivolities of life meaningless.)</p>

<p>Satanic Phrase : &quot;Judge not, lest you be judge.&quot; (You are incapable of judgement)</p>

<p>Jesus Philosophy : &#39;People are both good and bad. If you destroy the human for the bad, you are likewise destroying the good.&#39; (duality)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Switzerland is literally the only nation on earth ruled by a council of 7 - They have 7 Presidents, not one.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Poe was a great writer, military man, cryptographer, &amp; hypnotist. Additionally he essentially lived in battle against those of authority. Hop Frog is the most direct tail representing his conflict against the monarchs, which essentially is to remind them of how this was dealt with in the day (mob burning of the king), and a loose threat against those threatening his life (he believed a &#39;CIA&#39; was out to kill him).</p>

<p>I suspect if you look deeper into his work, you will find more than then was illuminated at first glance. The Mask of the Red Death, additionally, was regarding the idea of royalty shutting themselves out to the common problems, yet it found them all the same.</p>

<p>There no doubt in my mind Poe was &#39;on the level&#39;, with Hop Frog likely his most direct confrontation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to get too technical regarding definitions, however, I will suggest this.</p>

<p>Imagine an Ocean with 7 waves. At the top of each wave is the best of one&#39;s profession (agriculture, industry, housing, so on). Above each of these waves are the federations which bend these persons together; religion, politics, &amp; economy. And above that you might have the Guardians who remember the history and teach it to the young (in native American culture this was a council of women). Likewise, in addition to the visible waves, let&#39;s say there are 6 invisible ones (espionage, hypnosis, diplomacy, etc). Below all that is an ocean of &#39;drones&#39; or followers (or slaves).</p>

<p>Gates, who has the virtue of industry, sees all others as a slave or drone, when compared to his abilities of industry. He has sacrificed more to achieve then they ever will, and they fear him. Through tunneling through the halls of Knowledge he has sacrificed a piece of his humanity in exchange for the Wisdom of Industry.</p>

<p>Now what does he do with the Wisdom of Industry? Does he give it freely, in essence diminishing the value of his sacrifice, down to nothing? Likely not. Let&#39;s, for simplicity, say he uses this Wisdom to create economic gain - Then the next question is does he retain his humanity?</p>

<p>In the sense that all others &#39;could&#39; be a slave to Gates in the matter of Industry, so too could he be a slave to others in the matter of Education, Military, Hypnosis, and so on. Remember, his children are &#39;acceptable targets&#39;, and thus Gates must consider how they will fare post death - over ~55 years, will they be brainwashed into submission?</p>

<p>An Enlightened man realizes that, though he is an expert in somethings, he is not an expert in all things. And that only through &#39;faith&#39; or the creation of a common bond, can his children be protected and his &#39;species&#39; continue.</p>

<p>Likewise, a truly wise man recognizes that life is finite, and that the removal of wealth from the flow of society, via hereditary transfer, is a prevention of progress. The more &#39;flow&#39; within society, the better society is designed to reward beneficial achievements and consistent sacrifice, the faster the advancing of civilization.</p>

<p>And then you&#39;d need to ask:</p>

<p>Is society properly designed to reward the sacrifices made for beneficial achievements? In so much as it is, Gates has the Wisdom or Virtue of Industry.</p>

<p>Next would be, in which ways has Gates used such Wisdom? In so much as it relates to self-aggrandizement, then there is the possibility he has lost touch with &#39;the common&#39;. In so much as he seeks to spread such Wisdom, with at minimum to those in his profession, it&#39;s more likely that he realizes that the is but one of many experts, whom should do likewise.</p>

<p>Lastly, the question is to what extent and in what fashion does he return his $50 Billion of &#39;societal flow&#39; to the Polity. The establishment of Corporations or passing it directly to their Young, suggests a sense of naivety or prioritization of the creation of greater &#39;capital assets&#39;. Assets removed from the control of the &#39;common&#39;. In so much as it&#39;s returned to the society at large, then I would suggest that represents so form of Enlightenment.</p>

<p>I really can&#39;t tell which direction Gates might be going there. &quot;Helping Africans drink clean water&quot; is a good thing, but in which ways does he accomplish this? Through rewarding those hereditary or established power, or through the fostering of young minds? Likewise, I might suggest it naive that &#39;we&#39; can know exactly how best to construct a future society.</p>

<p>For example, the people of Flint &#39;have water&#39;, but it has been secretly poisoning them for 2 years, denigrating their mind. Had a &#39;motherly&#39; type figure from within the community been given this challenge, I would suggest they would have done better than a &#39;foreigner&#39; or someone so for advanced they feel unconnected with the youth.</p>

<p>Often times I would be inclined to believe that &#39;giving people water&#39; rather than &#39;teaching them how to fish&#39; would represent a misunderstand of the world, and an attempt to purchase a ticket into heaven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wealth and knowledge deal with the human aspect of ourselves. Neither are necessarily dependent upon the other. You can have wealth without being knowledgeable and you can be knowledgeable without having monetary wealth. We can learn a lot of facts and have knowledge, but that doesn&#39;t mean we understand anything.</p>

<p>Enlightenment and wisdom deal with our soul. To be enlightened, one must understand our selves and our world on much deeper level than that which we are taught. Enlightenment is a journey upon we find ourselves when we are seeking something more than just &quot;this&quot;. The lessons we learn, then apply, offer us understanding, which in turn give us wisdom. Through the continual practice of seeking, finding, applying, and understanding, we can find enlightenment.</p>

<p>The closer we come to enlightenment the less we are concerned with things like money, power, and succes. </p>

Satan is fighting a battle he will lose, but is being allowed to carry his evil agenda (destruction of humanity) for now.  So, if you decide to foolishly create your own world view, be warned.  The truth is already provided for you, and your refusing to acknowledge it, will be held against you. </p>

<p>&quot;For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.&quot;  1 Corinthians 1:18 </p>

I believe the original canon was put together before there were Catholics in the world and before Catholic Church was infiltrated by apparently evil players. There is a very well cited book written by a former detective that traces the New Testament books to origin.  Let me get that. It may even been free on Amazon kindle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, i had no idea that the Dead Sea scrolls contain all 66 books written in English so there&#39;s no chance for incorrect translations or short passages being added to serve an agenda. I won&#39;t argue with you, but I suggest reading about all the different counsels of the Catholic Church. I mean, the first counsel of nicea was funded by a roman emperor who was a pagan-convert but I&#39;m sure he had no possible motives to create a religious text that was agreeable to his world view and supported his authority... Also, there&#39;s certainly no way that an institution so corrupt they abused there followers through the practice of indulgences would ever slip in minor passages to benifits themselves and the papacy... God didn&#39;t hand the bible to man directly and there&#39;s no such thing as an &quot;original&quot; copy that we can compare for reference. But I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a good idea to trust a historically corrupt institution, one of the most corrupt in the history of man kind, to total keep their totalitarian agenda seperate from their sacred text...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had no idea you could not figure out that if what was found was accurate you could deduct the rest would be as well.  It is in original Hebrew OF COURSE, if you have prob w translation that is another issue.  Currently there are several translations that are very similar or you can learn Hebrew and Greek (New Testament).  </p>

<p>Whoever funded the original council, the canon has been unchanged and was formed from existing documents.  You can read the rejected ones, they are still around.  The Stobel book traces the &quot;chain of custody&#39; of how it was kept until today. I def agree that Satan loves to infiltrate and not only bastardize but turn God&#39;s word into blasphemy. But there are evidences what we have is authentic. Look into it. Stobel&#39;s intent was to disprove the Gospels, he could not. </p>

<p>What I meant by &#39;original copy&#39; was the initial documents from wherevit was transcribed. You should read on how carefully these transcribers has to do it. </p>

<p>It is a lie from Satan to have you believe God&#39;s words cannot be accurate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you not see the irony of you making this point on a conspiracy forum? That a horrible corrupt organization never altered a book, even slightly, to serve it&#39;s own interests over the course of a couple thousand years? I&#39;m a Christian so I understand the religious world view but it seems willfully ignorant to believe that an institution with almost unlimited power for hundreds of years that had control over the text from which their authority originated and also had the power to change the scripture, even slightly, never manipulated even a single line to serve their interests. The fact you find the book infallible in the modern day even though you&#39;re well aware of the corruption and money hoarding ways of the old church is perfect testament to why someone high up with ulterior motives would want to slip something in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too much to go into in one post.  But regarding the post (above), for example, the words &#39;Judge not&#39; are actually part of the Bible.  Not some kind of &#39;satanic phrase&#39; as the poster has indicated.</p>

<p>And Holy Scripture DOES say to accept Jesus as savior, and in order to be forgiven.  It DOES NOT say to &#39;put no idol above word of God&#39;.</p>

<p>Pretty much everything the poster has written is the inverse of what the Christian Church and Biblical Scriptures teach.  So from a Christian perspective, this post is utterly misleading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the actual quoted words of Jesus and not the interpretation?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus said…Thou shalt love the Lord they God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At no point in Jesus&#39;s teaching does he refer to God as a person. At this time, the Kings were worshipped as divity. At no time does Jesus ask to be worshipped, and likewise suggest that he not be worshipped. You are thinking of Old Testament, which personified God, and likewise the political leaders of the time were treated like better species, a &#39;God&#39; amoung men, if you will.</p>

<p>When Jesus talks of God, he refers to it as the collective Truth, or society. The word God transitions from an Idol, to a Personified Man, to a collective idea. That&#39;s the difference between old and New Testament. For example, Jesus isn&#39;t killing all those babies.</p>

<p>And then, it never occurred to you that when they were like, &quot;yoo, Jesus where is your pops?&quot; - and he says, &quot;yoo, I was born of society. Everyone is my father.&quot; - and they were like, &quot;yoo, it&#39;s Billy. You look just like Billy. Why didn&#39;t u just say worship Billy?&quot; And Jesus was like &quot;No you knit whit, don&#39;t worship Billy. It&#39;s a fucking metaphor dipshit. Here &#39;treat everyone like as if they were you&#39; k, get it?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its very hard to get to that point because I think a lot of &quot;discovery&quot; comes down to doing your own research, spending time reading things, and putting those ideas together over time.</p>

<p>It took me almost 7 years of visiting this sub before I broke through the negative conspiracies and found what I consider to be the culmination of it all. I came back from a trip where I had a great week to clear my head, went down a rabbit hole on energy, black holes, etc.  and ended up watching the primer fields series on youtube and Nassim Harameins &quot;Black Whole&quot; and one day it just all clicked. Ancient religion, freemasonry, occult/esoteric influences, energy manipulation -- it all leads back to the eternal source, the everything and nothing, the perfect stillness, etc. It allowed me to reapproach things like The Law of One (book of ra) with much more open eyes.</p>

<p>This stuff is so hard to conceptualize, let alone explain to someone.
You just have to spread information and hope that it opens someone&#39;s eyes. It&#39;s like that story about the boy throwing starfish back into the ocean one by one... &quot;kid there are thousands, you wont make a difference&quot; ... &quot;It&#39;ll make a difference to that one.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came across the Anunnaki the other night. Supposedly, they come from a far outer planet in our solar system. They built the pyramids (as we know them) all over the world as giant gold refineries. They extracted gold from sea water and sent it back to their home planet where it was scarce. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s true, but it&#39;s an interesting theory. Coupled with the fact that scientists have just acknowledged there may be a far outer planet with a revolution of 300,000 each years. And there is a Shark Tank episode where a scientist pitches a machine that extracts gold from sea water. Theories about the pyramids have always been far ranging. </p>

<p>I like all the different theories and think they are all more intertwined than meets the eye. Pizzagate, worldwide occultism, CERN actively searching for other dimensions with the LHC... How do people not see it? </p>

<p>That was a bit of a shock because I had faith in him, but in a way he is still disclosing so it&#39;s not exactly wrong, just somewhat controlled. It sounds like he is not completely honest here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to lump Corey Goode together with Tom Delonge for my point here. If you listen to Tom, he essentially says that he convinced these high level people to share the information about these black projects through his stories and whatnot. If you listen specifically to his interview with Jimmy Church, he essentially is arguing <em>in favor</em> of those that have kept this information secret because of some larger secret that will be revealed to us. Corey Goode generally gives a similar story, but with more political intrigue. </p>

<p>This is what they want us to think. That they have been working <em>for</em> us protect us from some external threat. Dr. Greer has evidence that they were planning to expose us to a fake interstellar threat as early as 1994 (and documents showing the CIA discussing it as far back as 1950&#39;s), <em>after</em> a global threat of terrorism. They have been planning this forever. I assume since you are on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> you can understand - these people (and all governments) aren&#39;t there to help us. They are there to hold onto power. That&#39;s all they&#39;re trying to do by using Corey Goode and Tom Delonge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was watching an interview the other day, unfortunately I can&#39;t find it (I&#39;ll keep looking), but they were discussing the evidence for an extinction level event that occurred around 11,600-12,000 years ago. Apparently they are now finding some scientific evidence to suggest the earth was in fact impacted by meteor fragments around this time.</p>

<p>It has always confused me as to why the history books basically just blank out after Egyptian history. There&#39;s pretty much a gap between 3,000 years ago, and upwards of 44,000 years in human history which is a long fucking time to not understand what happened to our species. </p>

<p>This guys was humans did in fact have advanced civilizations during this gap in history, but that civilization was either wiped out, and might have even left the planet. Whatever happened, remnants of this civilization were likely passed down to form new civilizations once the planet was fertile enough to support larger populations. Take for example longitude and latitude, the math and technical requirements to be able to accurately determine longitude and latitude simply did not exist according to our current understanding of history yet they did long before the technical means of understanding them were present. It is likely they were passed down through the centuries by a lost advanced civilization.</p>

<p>When you consider this possibility, and also consider more modern theories such as wormholes, simulation theory, multiverse theory, etc. It is fascinating to consider that there was possibly an advanced human civilization that was either wiped out or figured out a way to leave this planet or died trying. </p>

<p>The thing is, what the evidence are starting to show is that a very advance and global civilization was living on earth around 11,600-12,000 years ago and then, a meteor impacted the earth and wiped everything.</p>

<p>This is the exact story Platon wrote about: Atlantis. Even the date Platon is referring too, fits with what is being uncover.</p>

<p>Wait...   what the heck is that???  Logically, how would that even be possible? There are pretty much zero resources down there, just some research stations that require resupply. Who would be supplying them? How or why could any nazis be living down there for decades undetected, you don&#39;t think that the Jewish nazi hunters wouldn&#39;t be all over that if it was true?</p>

<p>This particular coup was just necessary, because JFK was convinced to get rid of this illegal, fascist, power grabbing shadow organization.</p>

<p>The current coup is very interesting. Who is all taking part in it. Just read the news.
Trump does crazy things which should please all liberals and lefts (TPP, NAFTA, CIA), and they still cry wolf and globalization and isolation and bla.</p>

Trump people have the same problem, just in a different way. I&#39;m fine with Trump as long as he keeps doing things to help America and doesn&#39;t start a bunch of wars. But what bothers me is that many of his supporters will not care either way and still support him regardless of what he does.</p>

Thankfully Americans started waking up and took that away and the dems have been steadily losing power at all levels of elected govt the last 8 years because Americans aren&#39;t as dumb as they think we are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a Trump supporter, and it worries me that there is no counter balance to his authority.</p>

<p>I never imagined that this election would be a clean sweep for the republicans. I was primarily trying to damage the current empowered party, but I never really liked either left or right ideologies.</p>

<p>This means we are now left to COMPLETELY rely on Trump to keep his own party (most of which hate him for his hostile takeover during the primaries) in check.</p>

<p>If he is either compromised or taken out of the picture, we then have a single party government (with Pence walking lockstep with his good friend Paul Ryan).</p>

<p>Alternatively, if his party doesn&#39;t walk lockstep with him, he will not hesitate to eviscerate them publicly. Nothing they ever get to his desk will be signed out of absolute spite, because he hates them as much as the Dems at this point. </p>

<p>The Dems are the only ones with the freedom to openly criticize Trump, because their resistance is viewed as a badge of honor among their ever-shrinking constituencies. The issue is that they are losing credibility fast as a result of the histrionics performed over the last few years. The majority of the Dems have not been able, or are resistant, to reading the tea leaves that they have lost control of our culture. If they do not get their shit together soon, those criticisms will not only garbage, no one will listen to them.</p>

<p>Nothing has actually happened to make me worry yet (in 6 days), but I feel like we have all our eggs in one basket at this point, and that is sort of unsettling to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a flowchart of the Cabal, or at least a part of it.  I am not sure where the Rothchilds fit into it.  </p>

<p>The only part of the Cabal that is a US government Agency is the CIA.  </p>

<p>Read about the Anderson Trust that was set up after WW2.  It had $1.2 T in it then, and I believe a portion of that money was used to create the CIA with the intent of having a US government agency to promote the interests of the Cabal.  </p>

These are the evil people Trump needs to purge from positions of power. He gets it and this is why they are openly hostile towards him. Their time is over. We the people know whats going on and have seen them control our government for far too long. They create evil in our name and I&#39;ve personally had enough of it.

    <div class="md"><p>I think one point of origin to CIA being the way it is could be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">Operation Paperclip</a>. Nazi leaders could have been picked and put directly into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services">Office of Strategic Services</a>, which was the predecessor of the CIA. Thus when the CIA was created they would have their Nazi minds already within. It is from this group that spawned so many negative illegal things</p>
