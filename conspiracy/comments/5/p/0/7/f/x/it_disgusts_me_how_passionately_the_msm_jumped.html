    <div class="md"><p>Whether there&#39;s storytelling involved or not, there is real evidence. Code words are evidence of fuckery. Pedo and cannibal themed art collected (almost exclusively) in large quantities is evidence of a psychological disorder. Chickenlover? Southpark covered that one pretty well I think and such a long time ago that you can&#39;t dispute that the definition was preexisting. Let&#39;s not forget that Podesta was accused of protecting human traffickers by a journalist years ago..</p>

<p>Do I have to continue? There&#39;s soooo much. No average Joe would have so many connections to pedo-themed anything. It&#39;s strange and disgusting. If you want to say there&#39;s not enough evidence to make an arrest, fine. There is certainly enough evidence of a child porn ring in the Pentagon to get that investigation back up and running but they don&#39;t want that to move forward either. </p>

<p>Why? Because we want to stick our collective heads in the sand and act like these types of people only get in to positions of power in other countries? Or only in football? It&#39;s well past time that we collectively stand up and let them know that we want these types of people stripped of government office at every level. I could care less about the pizza guy. If we start higher and he actually is involved, that card will fall too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s this proof...that dude has weird pictures on his instagram? Or that or that his symbol for his pizza shop logo is close to a pedo symbol? Or maybe its that in the emails it says his events are child friendly. Or maybe he&#39;s been noted say chickenlover?? </p>

<p>No that&#39;s definitely reaching if you consider that evidence..</p>

<p>Pissgate was creditable enough to be brought forth to a presidential intelligence briefing. Which I&#39;m sure  somewhere in all that some of what was claimed could be backed up. What about trumps flip flop on his stance with Putin and Russia. Or trump claiming he&#39;s had no association with Russia. 
All that is actual evidence, not just seemingly weird things like pizzagate. </p>

<p>I&#39;m leaving pizzagate a maybe, but I&#39;m leaning towards fake. Pissgate, knowing trump, seems highly plausible. Imo </p>

<p>Besta Pizza&#39;s manager is a sex offender from England.</p>

<p>Chickenlover is gay slang.</p>

<p>Pissgate was literally started by a fake report given by a /pol/ack. Proven even by Megan Mccain. The trump - russia connection is interesting but its just a fever pitch - a last minute attempt.  You are the extreme minority here trying to qualify the CIA on this board. The leaks are leaks not fakes. said so by obama.</p>

<p>If you really want evidence go on voat&#39;s pizzagate forum. Makes all these threads here look like kinder garden drawings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re missing is that, if they were false, an investigation into the serious allegations of pizzagate would clear everything up. The accused parties, if they are innocent, should be expediting the process. That&#39;s not happening. Instead everyone involved is hiding, slandering the investigators, or simply remaining silent. It reeks of a cover-up, which means it will never go away. I could go point by point thru your thesis on pissgate, but suffice it to say that I put more faith in a transparent citizen led investigation than a report by shadowy pro government entities, the actual content of which is only hinted at by a media conglomerate that demonstrably hates trump and wants to complicate his presidency as much as possible. Not that I&#39;m in any way a trump fan. </p>
