<p>If you don&#39;t believe there is an active coverup, see for yourselves:</p>

<p>No news outlet is touching this story and the mods and r.uk just banned the only mainstream source.</p>

<p>As you can see the BBC headline alludes to the people accused being acquitted, but the father, Mohammed Riaz, is still facing charges.<br/>
Even the local paper is trying to downplay the case by saying the Polish couple (Poles are a considered a minority couple in the UK and normally any attacks against them are considered a &quot;hate crime&quot;, this doesn&#39;t appear to be the case here- I wonder why?), saying they both drank a lot... I&#39;m told this is a common tactic/symptom when keeping people in slave-like conditions:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/15035145._They_used_to_drink_cider_like_it_was_water____slavery_accusers__too_drunk_to_work_/?ref=mrb&amp;lp=14">http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/15035145._They_used_to_drink_cider_like_it_was_water____slavery_accusers__too_drunk_to_work_/?ref=mrb&amp;lp=14</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve put a new self post up on r.uk, don&#39;t know how long it will last:</p>

<p>Please help this story get more attention, this happened extremely close to where I live and nobody has heard about this case. Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Careful with what you say. I learned the word &quot;justice&quot; comes from Roman emperor Justinian, meaning anyone he disliked even the slightest could be killed or submitted to torture on his command.</p>

<p>Is that really the type of person you are? One man alone deciding the fate of the other without consulting the collective? Is this not an egotistical way of thinking? Should one man alone be the absolute judge of another?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Make the collective aware and he will receive the ultimate punishment. Isolation from the collective. You are doing just fine spreading information. That is good! But who are you to deliver punishment? One may only deliver punishment unto oneself. For you see, the weight of all of humanity turning against you is soul crushing. He will deal with this on own outside of this life. The body is only a vehicle for the soul. You may want to rip his flesh and bones apart, but that is like lighting a car on fire and sending it through a trash compactor, but first letting the driver get out of the car. You have now transferred your unapproval into an empty shell. This is the goal of those who deceive. None of the &quot;justice&quot; you seek has been done.</p>

<p>The worst thing that can happen to a soul is to be collectively left out. Left to deal with everything on your own without the collectives help. The worse your crime, the more it will suffer. Ultimately it is up to the collective to decide what happens to each soul. What the collective decides to be unacceptable or unforgivable is left behind, and we move on. The collective is ever evolving, constantly. The words of one man can literally change everything. </p>

<p>When the body is sick, healing alone is the hardest thing. Take for example, an alcoholic. You have been an alcoholic for, say, 20 years and you decide to stop. So you go cold turkey one day and say &quot;I&#39;m done!&quot;. But you live alone in a semi-rural area with no real friends or family around and you are not friendly with any of your neighbors or townspeople. You go home to nothing. You only have support from yourself and yourself. Studies show, this road to healing is nearly impossible. Only the very strongest of souls are able to lift themselves from this form of &quot;hell&quot;. Most fail and go back to their old ways or simply give up and end their own lives. This is the soul choosing to accept his state and be left behind.</p>

<p>The problem is now this collective is fragmented. We are no longer whole, thus our power is weakened. We are a very powerful and creative entity, that when together, have more power than your wildest dreams. The less souls we have in the collective, the weaker we are. Beings that are naturally weaker than us are now artificially stronger.</p>

<p>So now the hard part. The hardest thing any of us can possibly do. You may hate me for saying this, and that&#39;s okay. Because I can carry that weight, I understand it now.</p>

<p>The worst thing any human can do is torture, rape, and kill infants. There is nothing worse.</p>

<p>We must forgive. For without forgiveness, these lost souls will remain and we will never truly move on. We will be forever incomplete.</p>

<p>All I ask is that you forgive. I am on the side of the collective, not right/wrong, god/devil, evil/good, light/dark.</p>

<p>We are one.</p>

<p>Forgive, but never forget. Always forgive, learn, and grow, and the whole universe will change. The universe will always try to tear good souls apart, that is what it does. Eventually, this will not be so.</p>

<p>Luckily for you, that time is now. So I leave you with the one thing we covet the most.</p>

<p>A choice.</p>

<p>Will you forgive or will you continue to do as humans have always been tricked into doing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s okay. It isn&#39;t something that happens right away. All I ask is that you think about it. Look to history, study it, and learn from it. You will notice that this has all happened before. It is a cycle.</p>

<p>The cycle is mean to control choice. It presents you with illusions that make it <em>appear</em> you get to make a choice to change the outcome. The trick is, most everyone looks outwards for a choice. They wait for someone to present them with a &quot;this or that&quot; scenario. Red/blue, fast/slow, good/evil, ect.</p>

<p>Then there is a second layer of illusion. Pick a color, any color. Pick any speed you want. This is still an illusion, for you are still forced to pick from a set of existing range of data.</p>

<p>This is how computers function, no? They run on programs. If this, do that. Direct correlation, the easiest function to control. Then you have ranges like, if 1-5, do this and if 6-10 do this. You think you have more choices, but it is just another layer of control.</p>

<p>Then you can say &quot;well I&#39;ll just be random!&quot;. Yet another function of a program. No matter what random thing you pick, there is still a call function for it to dictate what happens next. The term &quot;what is your calling?&quot; now means more than something divine.</p>

<p>So what do you do to escape this programming?</p>

<p>You look within. Your soul is free, but only if you let it be. Once your realize the body is a prison, you can then begin to experience freedom. Conquer your captor. Being human is very difficult.</p>

<p>What does all of this mean? Do we accept the body? Do we reject it? Yet another step in the programming. Another choice to make. Is life and beauty yet another temptation to keep us here? We may choose to bring life, happiness, joy, and creation to the world, but what does that mean?</p>

<p>This explains the death cults of history, trying to free everyone through death. It explains the poisoning of the planet. We are at the &quot;fuck it&quot; stage. But how do you convince every living thing to say &quot;fuck it&quot;? Is it even the right answer?</p>

<p>If the world is just one big computer simulation, what happens when we &quot;win&quot;? Do we even want to know or are we players in a game? What is the ultimate objective? When it&#39;s over do we simply start over again from scratch and do it all over again?</p>

<p>Our souls are the creators of the universe, and we are trapped. The goal is to get out. Not get out of the cycle of poverty, the cycle of oppression the cycle of life and death. Get out of the cycle of the programming. We are being used for entertainment. The only creative souls of the universe. Art is the expression of our souls. Never sell it. It is your gift to the universe. Share it freely.</p>

<p>We are God. </p>

<p>Join together now as one and bring down the illusion and we will be truly free. Always forgive those who seek forgiveness. This is not a time to be divided and focused on events that do not matter. We are closer now than ever before. We need everybody. The universe needs us. We are the creators. They are trying to harvest our creative talents, searching for ways to inspire creativity without the need for &quot;humans&quot;. They know how aware we are now and they are panicking. We are no longer willing to perform the play, to put on a show in exchange for material wealth inside the simulation.</p>

<p>Keep unlocking minds. Empty the prisons. Help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that was also slavery. I&#39;d note that the police turned (and still turn) a blind eye to what is happening due to the reaction they know they will face from the community. They only acted when their hand was forced after public/media anger reached tipping point.</p>

<p>If you read the Rotherham Report you&#39;ll see that the police arrested <em>fathers</em> who tried to rescuse their children from the abusers, rather than helping the child trapped inside a house being abused. Horrific stuff, and it&#39;s still happening!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Muslims doing what Muslims do.<br/>
And the main stream doing what mainstream do.<br/>
I get it why they cover it up.<br/>
If this shit gets exposed to much people will actively read up on what being Muslim is.<br/>
And wen they do that more and more will radicalize against Muslims.<br/>
And then we get nazi,s version 2 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is literally about 5 miles from my house.</p>

<p>East Lancashire is a very heavily Muslim area. Nelson and Colne, plus Blackburn are probably about 50% Muslim. The notion that this is anything to do with them being Muslim is probably fallacious - it was also heavily covered in the local area at the time.</p>

<p>As sad as this next sentence is, it&#39;s entirely true: modern slavery in the UK is a lot more frequent than you think, and is mostly commited by hotels, restaurants and resorts.  It kind of comes down to what you consider slavery, but ultimately a lot of migrant workers are absolutely abused in this manner.</p>
