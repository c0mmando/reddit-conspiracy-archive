<p>EVIDENCE OF CLINTON’S ODD RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY
1.  Bohemian Grove Rituals
Although he is not a member of the group, Bill Clinton attends Bohemian Grove ritual in 1991, the year before elected President. The Bohemian Club is a men’s only club in Northern California that began in the 1800’s consisting of the world’s most influential leaders. Members are sworn to secrecy and take part in several rituals involving human sacrifice. Uninvited guests are not permitted on the property and the first footage ever taken of the ritual was filmed by Alex Jones. </p>

<ol>
<li> Contacting the Dead
In Hillary’s book “It takes a Village and Other Lessons Children Teach Us” she describes séance sessions held in the White House with Jean Houston where she contacted the deceased Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi. Now I understand that this is impossible to prove, but what is noteworthy is the action itself. A personal advisor to Hillary once suggested that she reach out to Jesus Christ, however, Hillary stated that she is not interested in establishing that relationship. Bill Clinton has expanded on these rituals and has claimed that asking Eleanor Roosevelt for advice on being the first lady was a frequent habit of Hillary’s.<br/></li>

<ol>
<li> Admiration of Alinsky and Lucifer
Hillary Clinton was a known admirer of the infamous community organizer who wrote ‘Rules for Radicals’, Saul Alinsky. In the book, Alinksy crafts a strategy for implementing Marxist ideologies into society and delivers a full assault on the capitalist system with a dedication to Lucifer. While in college Clinton met with Alinsky several times and they maintained contact by regularly writing each other. Hillary’s admiration for Alinsky further developed into her Thesis Statement, taking Alinsky’s ideas  of community organization and applying them to America.</li>

<ol>
<li> Wiccan Church
A former hitman and accomplice for the Clintons, Larry Nichols, has come forward and disclosed information indicating Hillary’s involvement with the Satanic Church while First Lady. Nichols has stated that Hillary would travel to Los Angeles to attend a church for witches. In here current campaign, Hillary still is known to be missing for days at a time without a press conference.</li>

<ol>
<li> Spirit Cooking
Hillary’s campaign manager has leaked e-mails discussing “Spirit Cooking” and invites members of the campaign to join them. The e-mail originates with Marina Abramovic, who showcases her work involving menstrual blood, breast milk, urine, and sperm on YouTube. In correspondence on a separate e-mail Hillary cements her relationship with Marina by mentioning her by name. Marina’s work further devolves into cannibalism as part of one of her Satanic Rituals</li>

<ol>
<li> Moloch Acknowledgement
In an e-mail with Cheryl Mills, Hillary acknowledges sacrificing a chicken to the Demon God Moloch after a successful endeavor. This is significant due to the irregularity and unusual occurrence of the Demon God Moloch. The majority of the American population would not recognize this word and has have never had a reason to use it in any conversation.</li>

<ol>
<li> Decoration of the  White House
While First Lady at the White House, Hillary Clinton was known by White House staff to decorate with occultic ornaments during the holidays. These items included fertility gods, condom ornaments, ornaments using drug paraphernalia, and sexual idols.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are just some of the major known coincidences that all lead to this conclusion and all of this is the modern implementation of the Free Masons Fraternity. All of these ignore the known trips on Epstein’s Lollita Express, which can be a full e-mail on its own as well. You should definitely look into all of these and tell me what you think…</p>

<p>PS…</p>

<p>CERN HYDRON COLLIDER RITUAL
CERN is partially situated is called “Saint-Genus-Poilly.” The name Pouilly comes from the Latin “Appolliacum” and it is believed that in Roman times a temple existed in honor of Apollo, and the people who lived there believed that it is a gateway to the underworld. It is interesting to note that CERN is built on the same spot.</p>

<p>Religious leaders – always suspicious of the aims of the scientific world – drew a connection to a verse straight out of Revelations (9:1-2, 11), which makes reference to the name ‘Apollyon.’ </p>

<p>The verse states: 
“To him was given the key of the bottomless pit. And he opened the bottomless pit… And they had a kind over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.”</p>

<p><strong>This ritual was conducted directly next to the statue of the Hindu god Shiva that stands at the entrance to CERN. In Hindu lore, Shiva is the “god of destruction”, and this spot was obviously purposely chosen.</strong></p>

<p>-Interesting at time of tension with Russia and the threat of WW3 that a sacrificial ritual would happen at the European Center for Nuclear Research just last August 2016 on the eve of our upcoming election of the warhawk – wiccan, Hillary</p>

<p>The media has come out and said it was a joke, but with how the media has been lying about everything for the last year and a half who knows….</p>

<p>EDIT: I forgot the link for the CERN Ritual... Here it is...</p>

<p>However, Eclectic Wiccans choose their avatars for the Goddess and God. Moloch could be chosen as such, but it wouldn&#39;t really work given the nature of God and His fragile state. I mean, the guy only lives for, like, eight months a year. And isn&#39;t evil. Probably.</p>

<p>A perfect example of Gerald Gardner plagiarizing Aleister Crowley and his mantra of &#39;Do what thou wilt&#39;, though I must admit I prefer Gardner&#39;s version, with the added stipulation of &#39;Do no harm&#39; or rather &#39;An it harm none&#39; as he puts it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a former Wiccan, I can say that Wicca is a new age religion founded in I think the 40s or 50s. It has a lot of Celtic influence (obviously) and is very romantic in the literal sense.</p>

<p>It&#39;s deities are typically the Goddess and God, and the moon and sun serve as their respective avatars.</p>

<p>It&#39;s primarily nature based, spell-whipping, worship of the universe.</p>

<p>Satanism is a bit more complicated, but not necessarily evil in and of itself.</p>

<p>Others would have better explanations, as I&#39;m at work and I hate typing with my thumbs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of Wiccans today, those following the teachings of Gerald Gardner, are teachings and rituals based on if not outright plagiarized from the Thelemic order of the A∴A∴, which Crowley in turn had largely &quot;borrowed&quot; or plagiarized from the Golden Dawn, which in turn has its roots in a highly esoteric form of Rosicrucianism (among other currents), Rosicrucianism having its roots in a form of pseudo-&quot;Christian&quot; mysticism (though equally if not moreso hermeticism, alchemy and qabalah). </p>

<p>So yes, in a sense, I suppose you can say much of Wicca today as we know it can (ironically) trace its roots to a form of &#39;Judeo-Christian&#39; belief, though in the loosest sense of the word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which couldn&#39;t be further from reality. The Jesuits are pawns today (at best), and the Bavarian Illuminati was notoriously anti-Catholic and anti-Jesuit. The founder of the Bavarian Order, Adam Weishaupt, had attended a Jesuit university in his earlier years, however became disillusioned with the Jesuits, Catholics and religion as a whole, reflected by the distinctly anti-clerical and anti-religious agenda, writings and history of the Bavarian Illuminati itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of this &quot;spirituality&quot; of the elite is nothing more than glorification of negativity and beliefs based in negativity. </p>

<p>The elite of this world are far older than most anyone realizes and their history extends back millennia, before the commonly &quot;accepted&quot; start of civilization. The current members of the elite themselves are not thousands of years old, but the elite as a group has existed since that time, always recruiting new members and replacements throughout the millennia to continue their mission for complete control, domination, and oppression of the entire globe, which is all based around negativity. </p>

<p>Negativity is what the elite constantly propagate through their global system of control that runs through literally every aspect of human life here on earth, and they thrive and feed off of negativity. They are more deeply attached to negativity then anyone else on the planet and they will do literally everything they can, within the confines of their narrative of reality and the rules of their system of control, to continue the negativity. </p>

<p>That means that while they do have advanced technology given to them by certain negative et&#39;s (there are very few groups of negative et&#39;s), they can only use it covertly because their narrative of reality has convinced people that such technology is impossible and if they used it overtly then the narrative would be broken and the system would collapse because the narrative is the heart of the system, it is the thing that allows the system to exist.</p>

<p>This narrative is completely centered and based around discounting, disproving, debunking, hiding, and fictionalizing the existence of a certain &quot;mythical&quot; place that is the place the elite and this current system of control stem from. </p>

<p>That place is Atlantis.</p>

<p>Atlantis is simply the most important topic anyone could be discussing, <strong>especially</strong> on this subreddit since this sub is the most concentrated, populated, and organized place of people who are actively questioning parts of the elite&#39;s narrative and parts of their system of control. </p>

<p>Atlantis is the key to defeating the elite and destroying their system of control because the elite rose to power in Atlantis and formed the foundations of the current system there, and Atlantis&#39;s existence is what will destroy their narrative, and thus their system, because their narrative is completely based around the non-existence of Atlantis.</p>

<p>I have made a thread going into detail about Atlantis and its connection/importance to defeating the elite and their global control system <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">here</a>, and in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixn93/">this</a> comment, and in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixo60/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">this</a> comment that continues the first comment. <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbkbysz/">This</a> comment goes into Atlantis, the elite, secret societies, and spiritual initiates, all things that are important to understand Atlantis, and how there is a lie that the elite are somehow &quot;spiritually&quot; minded.</strong> (&lt;-- This one is particularly important for this thread since there is a running belief that the elite are somehow involved with &quot;spirituality&quot;, even if it is &quot;dark&quot; or negative.) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nmxg4/mysterious_10000_year_old_underwater_ruins_in/dcdga4q/">This</a> comment explains why the &quot;comet&quot; theory of Atlantis&#39; destruction is false and it explains how Atlantis absolutely would have been destroyed, and it also goes into why cyclical rising and lowering of human consciousness is false as well.</p>
