       From personal experience i'll say this; yes sometimes it sucks. For examaple sometimes i feel like skipping my workouts. Like Leg day is really intense and exhausting for me; While doing dumbbell lunges i ask myself why the f*** did i join the gym. But then i tell myself to be trans and go about the work. I'll tell you this small story- The reason i joined the gym was because i lost in arm wrestling to someone i hated and not only did he break my arm, i was ridiculed upon by the guy I was trying to win over. One more reason was that most guys I want to hook up with only want to only hook up with the "good looking girls" I'm not implying that i'm ugly but not drop dead gorgeous.These two reasons made me realize that i needed to work out,so that i could avenge myself in that arm-wrestling loss and so that i'll have a muscular and ripped body. Make yourself realize why you joined that gym,Visualize the benefits you'll have overtime. Try to focus while working out on your exercise and your form.And one reason you could be losing focus maybe that your over-trained/did not get adequate rest and hence were fatigued.That's all i can say kiddos

       I mean... then maybe reddit isn't the place for you. Maybe you need a community which is more conservative overall. Participating in a community that you KNOW is very liberal and then being upset they are liberal is counter productive to any kind of goal.

       I think the censorship has gone overboard and the overbearing nature of flair covered mods have gone too far. Anyone should generally be able to make a statement in as much as they do it respectfully to others. Still you have these hair trigger mods that are looking for that one guy that is acting just poorly enough. If he is attacked personally...ha ha funny. But he curses about it or even worse, personally attacks in retaliation....OMG...we must fucking NUKE USER N!
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a time when mods would ask nicely before going full nuclear on everyone's asses. Now...they're so blinded by the flair and the last 8 years of their dedicated service, they can't imagine someone ACCIDENTALLY breaking the rules....or worse...someone who is a regular getting someone banned by provoking them.
      </p>

       IT'S SO FULL OF SHIT.
