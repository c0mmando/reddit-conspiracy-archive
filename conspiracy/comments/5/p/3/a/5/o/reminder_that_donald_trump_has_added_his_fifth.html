    <div class="md"><p>It seems common sensical in a way, no? I mean to demonize Trump because he is rich is doing the same thing. I get it, we don&#39;t want more of the same. But do we bring in regular folk to do it? They have no connections. I&#39;d venture to say, we even need a little of the enemy, keep close eyes on, to help out! </p>

<p>I agree re the troops as well. If Trump is going to have closer relations to Russia, what good is having troops there do? That stops Russia from invading? No sense in wasting money. Talk, make business deals. Maybe Russia can become a nice trade partner. (They don&#39;T do GMO!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure I got you 100%, but I mean to watch their actions and get a feel for how they are correcting/directing things and changing the government. We are 20 trillion in debt, that is a huge figure. Trump, I do think he can actually mess up the globalist plan of crashing things, at least he can soften the fall. </p>

<p>Regular politicians and more of the corrupt FED to fix a problem they have created (and by the looks of it - with INTENTION) will completely destroy this country, so I think a businessman used to dealing in BIG money can grasp how to fix things here. Something that looks intentionally driven, just like all the recent corrupt wars driven off, in part, Falsely driven CIA data. </p>

<p>Tillison is in that group of being powerful in his connections. He can really make deals happen, he can really help to let America get connected to more of the world. We can be a bit like Germany having an industrial/factory (e.g. exporting cars, electronics, etc.) and still being an IT and service wherehouse. And whatever else. WE just have to re-arrange things and help steer the world in a productive direction, not ignoring the environment, but not accepting some laws that are designed with bad intentions and based on bad data or political intentions.</p>

<p>Having those military men, 3 Generals around him is gonna save us money and reflect a know nonsense approach to problems. Hopefully no more global police, but still a strong military until this world (Elites) can figure out how to stop killing eachother. </p>

<p>Or, we can just remove those Elites. That is what I am hoping for in the next 8 years. Taking back our world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep researching history. Look no further than Ron Paul to see how the media ACTUALLY treats people they are told to disallow. You simply, 100%, cannot even be properly in the race on a major party without agreeing to be a puppet. I mean no offense, but one has to be a very uncritical thinker to have ever supported Trump in any shape or form. The thought simply doesn&#39;t hold up to the slightest bit of scrutiny.</p>

<p>For instance, we KNOW there is a Committee on Presidential Debates - we have known this for years now and even alternative news have brought it to light and how unethical and antithetical it is to democracy - again many many years ago. To reiterate - the existence of this committee is proof by itself that the debates are completely scripted theatrical shows that everyone believes. This is cognitive dissonance at its purest. Then all of a sudden Trump comes along and people completely utterly forget about it. Why? Because of shilling and propaganda.</p>

<p>Or how about the fact that, if Hillary is in such cahoots with the elite - as the recent posts saying that she was promised the election by Bilderberg - and there&#39;s such a swamp to drain and he was such an outsider - then why did establishment republicans and indeed the majority of electoral college voters vote for him?</p>

<p>Or how about the fact of how the media treated Ron Paul? If someone ACTUALLY threatens the status quo as he did, they treat you like a ghost. They won&#39;t even include you in poll results on the TV, even if you&#39;re the winner - they&#39;ll list your name last on the screen to make it appear like you&#39;re the loser even if you won, so your average idiot who&#39;s entranced by the TV doesn&#39;t notice it as it passes by and their senses are raped by the billion things moving on screen. Trump got tons and tons of free publicity all while delightfully playing into the division. He certainly wasn&#39;t treated like how a media treats someone it dislikes.</p>

<p>Or how about the most obvious? A globalist Zionist himself has historically put himself over evem the sovereignty of countries, runs on a protectionist ticket and people don&#39;t think twice because?</p>

<p>The Zionists and the elite are people who have set the course of nations half centuries to centuries in advance - they created the ground work for Israel before the world war, then get it in class room curriculum that Israel was created as a result of the World War. And you believe a reality show real estate mogul, who was bailed out by the Rothschilds no less, outsmarted and some how got in the system? Even excluding the Committee on Presidential Debates (which again, you can&#39;t even run on a ticket without agreeing and being a part of it)</p>

<p>Do you see what I mean yet? It doesn&#39;t hold up to the slightest bit of scrutiny because it doesn&#39;t MAKE sense. Just like George Carlin said, the elite don&#39;t want people smart enough to be able to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they&#39;re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago.</p>

<p>However, I think the context mitigates this somewhat. Trump was legitimately having difficulty filling a lot of positions in his cabinet. And it is possible that he trying to find people within the system that will work to accomplish some good.</p>

<p>I have no illusions that he is George Washington, but I remain genuinely convinced he is going to work hard to work things in the right direction within the paradigm that exists. He has to, or he will die.</p>
