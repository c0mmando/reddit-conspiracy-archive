       The Zionists won this election, just like every other. Hillary was given adequate resources to steal the dem nomination specifically so Trump would win, since she was unwinnable.

       I wish a giant meteror was an option, cuz we humans should not be allowed off this planet.  We're 5150... You ever wonder why we haven't "found" intelligent life in the galaxy? Simple,  because the intelligent life won't come near such a volatile and dangerous specie.

       When it's all said and done I feel that the population would be so thin that maybe 10%-15% of the population will survive.  I'm fine with that.  But I'll last longer than any gun-hating liberal.

       My guy, you spend way more time Reddit. Just because I know it doesn't matter who I support doesn't mean I shouldn't. That may sound hypocritical, and it very well is, and that's what people need to realize, that everyone is a hypocrite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also don't tell me what to do. The fact of the matter is that there were only two choices this election. And don't use that third party excuse either.

       Don't make it black and white, you sound very dim witted. Trump was a good option to defeat Hillary, who would have undoubtedly caused a greater shitstorm and she should have already been in prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which option would you prefer: Obama 2.0 and further globalization and degeneration, or a resurgence in nationalism with a chance to focus on American infrastructure. The latter is much more appealing and beneficial for the long term if we're going to awaken the masses. Nationalism is a must.

      <blockquote>

        Trump was given rep nomination specifically so Hillary would win, since he was unwinnable.

       I liken Goldman Sachs to the CIA or any other large organization. To think that everyone in Goldman, or even a majority, is corrupt, is just crazy. Sure, CIA has ruined America but with their compartmentalization, a few evil folk can really run amok.

       In December, Obama moved 10s of thousands of tanks along with other military equipment to eastern Poland. Biggest move since wwii. I just don't want war and I think a lot of people would agree. I want us to start focusing less on that stuff and mo on fixing what's broken in America.

       You gotta be more diligent, don't just trust what some random guy says on the internet. Look up the info and see the numbers for yourself. You were closer to the truth. It is

       You're right to worry about this, since it's the first time in US history that we've established permanent occupation in Poland, which borders Russia. It is a thinly veiled threat.

       I looked it up, it wasn't 80 tanks, but it wasn't my original tens of thousands of tanks. Not many articles had accurate numbers and I didn't have much time to look up the number but I got a better feeling and edited the range.

       It seems common sensical in a way, no? I mean to demonize Trump because he is rich is doing the same thing. I get it, we don't want more of the same. But do we bring in regular folk to do it? They have no connections. I'd venture to say, we even need a little of the enemy, keep close eyes on, to help out!
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree re the troops as well. If Trump is going to have closer relations to Russia, what good is having troops there do? That stops Russia from invading? No sense in wasting money. Talk, make business deals. Maybe Russia can become a nice trade partner. (They don'T do GMO!)

       I agree. Does anyone really expect anything more than this administration? It's a step in the right direction for America. Maybe everyone will start realizing that all politicians are the same once they see the opposing candidates doing the same shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just hope Trump at least brings
       <em>
        productivity
       </em>
       back to America. That's what we've been lacking for a long time. And hopefully his business attitude will help get things done. And hopefully those "things" will help the people. I want tax cuts. I want efficiency. And this is the first time that someone with some experience in efficiency is going to lead us in awhile. We'll see.

       Perhaps the most exciting thing here, is that Trump is a businessman. He can fix a lot of these problems with common sense (business).
      </p>
      <p>
       As you said, a step in the right direction, but a big step. Honestly, we have been led by the least and most corrupt among us. I think this isn't just about fixing things, but about returning to prosperity, which we all deserve. But we have to fix our Country first, protectionism.

       There is no way Trump got here alone. I feel/think strongly he is being helped from the inside. Where Hillary/CIA was taking this country was dangerous. Trump is EXTREMELY well connected (I suggest you research here). I think this was a "simple" take back. If Trump really goes against these corrupt globalists, oh boy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I think the intelligence agenc(ies) leaked the information (or something similar) in order to take our country back. As we both said, time will tell.

      <p>
       Yeah, new to say the least and just at the right time. Where we were going was 1984 (their plan book.)

       This is a great point to keep in mind. Just sit back and watch until they give you a reason to scream at them. And there is some real corruption right now in our government maybe we need some snakes to help drive out the evil.

       Not sure I got you 100%, but I mean to watch their actions and get a feel for how they are correcting/directing things and changing the government. We are 20 trillion in debt, that is a huge figure. Trump, I do think he can actually mess up the globalist plan of crashing things, at least he can soften the fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regular politicians and more of the corrupt FED to fix a problem they have created (and by the looks of it - with INTENTION) will completely destroy this country, so I think a businessman used to dealing in BIG money can grasp how to fix things here. Something that looks intentionally driven, just like all the recent corrupt wars driven off, in part, Falsely driven CIA data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tillison is in that group of being powerful in his connections. He can really make deals happen, he can really help to let America get connected to more of the world. We can be a bit like Germany having an industrial/factory (e.g. exporting cars, electronics, etc.) and still being an IT and service wherehouse. And whatever else. WE just have to re-arrange things and help steer the world in a productive direction, not ignoring the environment, but not accepting some laws that are designed with bad intentions and based on bad data or political intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having those military men, 3 Generals around him is gonna save us money and reflect a know nonsense approach to problems. Hopefully no more global police, but still a strong military until this world (Elites) can figure out how to stop killing eachother.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, we can just remove those Elites. That is what I am hoping for in the next 8 years. Taking back our world.

       Yeah I agree with you, I didn't really state my point too clearly my apologies. But I agree I really hope that he is thinking about taking down the federal reserve and cutting the fat off of the CIA and removing these assholes that have been controlling us for so long from power. I'm hoping he may be a catalyst in the people's awakening and from there we will reclaim our world. Hopefully he can pull through hopefully humanity can pull through.

       Your point has some merit, but I would feel better if someone similar to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was appointed into the cabinet, rather than a super rich person who amassed their fortune by polluting and destroying the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       We sure haven't started off on the right foot if you ask me and we will never be privy to the backroom deals this cabinet does.  You'll get some fluff pieces of PR and a new health care system that will fool the public into trusting this regime (but still makes insurance companies wealthy).  Humanity is about to get the corporate screws tightened on itself more than anyone thought possible.

       There's no real evidence that crony capitalism is driving Trump's pics, just "muh Goldman Sachs" rhetoric.  From my perspective, I see Trump gearing up for a fight with the globalist powers that be.  Since he was only sworn in fewer than two hours ago, I'm willing to give him a chance to demonstrate whether my reality or your reality is more correct.

       Man I'm sorry to break this to you but we don't choose the president the elite does. So he just as corrupt as the last presidents. Hence why he has been picking people who worked for the Rothschild. If you don't know who that's  they're the richest family in the world and they have central banks in almost every country other than Syria, Cuba, and NK.

       So you are of the opinion that this whole thing was a giant smoke and mirrors show, and a Trump presidency was what they wanted all along?  I have entertained the notion but it doesn't add up for me.  I concede the possibility though.

       Yes, I do believe the elite chooses the president not us. If you do some more research you will see that the elite control everything we do and I mean everything. Propaganda a motherfucker and that's what they use to get us to vote for certain people or suggest us to do certain things and act a certain way.

       Keep researching history. Look no further than Ron Paul to see how the media ACTUALLY treats people they are told to disallow. You simply, 100%, cannot even be properly in the race on a major party without agreeing to be a puppet. I mean no offense, but one has to be a very uncritical thinker to have ever supported Trump in any shape or form. The thought simply doesn't hold up to the slightest bit of scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, we KNOW there is a Committee on Presidential Debates - we have known this for years now and even alternative news have brought it to light and how unethical and antithetical it is to democracy - again many many years ago. To reiterate - the existence of this committee is proof by itself that the debates are completely scripted theatrical shows that everyone believes. This is cognitive dissonance at its purest. Then all of a sudden Trump comes along and people completely utterly forget about it. Why? Because of shilling and propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how about the fact that, if Hillary is in such cahoots with the elite - as the recent posts saying that she was promised the election by Bilderberg - and there's such a swamp to drain and he was such an outsider - then why did establishment republicans and indeed the majority of electoral college voters vote for him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how about the fact of how the media treated Ron Paul? If someone ACTUALLY threatens the status quo as he did, they treat you like a ghost. They won't even include you in poll results on the TV, even if you're the winner - they'll list your name last on the screen to make it appear like you're the loser even if you won, so your average idiot who's entranced by the TV doesn't notice it as it passes by and their senses are raped by the billion things moving on screen. Trump got tons and tons of free publicity all while delightfully playing into the division. He certainly wasn't treated like how a media treats someone it dislikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how about the most obvious? A globalist Zionist himself has historically put himself over evem the sovereignty of countries, runs on a protectionist ticket and people don't think twice because?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zionists and the elite are people who have set the course of nations half centuries to centuries in advance - they created the ground work for Israel before the world war, then get it in class room curriculum that Israel was created as a result of the World War. And you believe a reality show real estate mogul, who was bailed out by the Rothschilds no less, outsmarted and some how got in the system? Even excluding the Committee on Presidential Debates (which again, you can't even run on a ticket without agreeing and being a part of it)
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see what I mean yet? It doesn't hold up to the slightest bit of scrutiny because it doesn't MAKE sense. Just like George Carlin said, the elite don't want people smart enough to be able to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they're getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago.

       Putin kicked the Rothschild's out of Russia too. Oh and goldman Sachs partners weren't allowed to donate to Trump. it's still strange he keeps appointing Sachs people to positions, but he's most likely not in bed with them like everyone's trying to act.

       Obama was just a tool of Soros to weaken our national unity and soil our reputation in the rest of the world, and he did a fantastic job at that.  Having HRC and John Kerry as Secretaries of State definitely helped with the latter.  I admit that I'm not completely up on all the horrible people he chose; I'm sure you would do a better job of fleshing out this idea than I would.

       It's concerning.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I think the context mitigates this somewhat. Trump was legitimately having difficulty filling a lot of positions in his cabinet. And it is possible that he trying to find people within the system that will work to accomplish some good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no illusions that he is George Washington, but I remain genuinely convinced he is going to work hard to work things in the right direction within the paradigm that exists. He has to, or he will die.

       Probably really hard to find folks who aren't blackmailed and actually want to do good for the majority. Honestly I think people are not giving pizzagate the credit it deserves for the effect on the election.

       The FBI is about to pounce but I hope they actually go for the big dogs on both sides. Them republican pedo's are just as much into satanic ritual as democrats. Sadly I believe we will get maybe 10 of the 100's of pedos.

       Did you read the FBI anon stuff on 4chan? It really would be hard to do this. I mean, civil war is likely if they do.

      <p>
       I'm not saying it would be wrong. Some things are worth starting civil wars over. But hopefully we can transition away from this pedophile-blackmail system of control without millions of people dying.

       Try to remember, Wall Street and especially Goldman hires the best and brightest minds from great schools. Because someone works for Goldman Sachs doesn't necessarily mean they will be corrupt and evil will follow them.  It's also possible Trump is filling the swamp with guys who are capable of getting the job done.   Or Trump's crooked too. Whichever.

       You cannot enter the White House without pandering to Jews. They have such an iron grip of America that it's virtually inconceivable to imagine a president without Jewish aids. The only thing we can hope for is that us commoners continue to disseminate effective propaganda concerning Jewish/Israeli nepotism and control.
