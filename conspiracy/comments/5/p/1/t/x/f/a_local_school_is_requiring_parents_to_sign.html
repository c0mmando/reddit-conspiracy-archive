       I haven't seen this anywhere else, but I understand it. I teach high school social studies and given the passion and skepticism and furor surrounding this election I didn't plan to show it live in class, rather we would watch highlights on Monday together and discuss.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am of the impression though, that if you feel you need a permission slip to show a current political event happening (violent events are the exception) that you maybe shouldn't show it...that's just me.

       I'm a teacher and we got an email reminding us to keep personal opinions about the inauguration out of the classroom, which I would have thought would be a "duh" thing. When Obama was inaugurated in 2008, the district I was working for at the time (different state) did not allow teachers to show the inauguration in class, period.

       We watched the OJ verdict in class in the fifth grade. The district that banned the Obama inauguration was in a small town with some really, really strange attitudes about most things. Also highly conservative and resistant to the views of outsiders. It's part of the reason I left.

       We watched 9/11 as it happened in high school. We watched coverage on American and Mexican news stations. The coverage on Mexican news was more graphic, and showed the jumpers. That was a strange day.

       Fellow Arkansan here. When i was in school there weren't any permission slips but you could opt out of watching it. Seems silly you would need a parent's permission to show kids a national tradition. PC bullshit if you ask me.

       I was 14 when JFK was assassinated, and we were given the choice to watch the continuous coverage on TV, or to spend the day in study hall doing our homework. I chose the former and watched the coverage all day long in the auditorium with other students. Watching Walter Cronkite wipe the tears from his eyes is something I will never forget.

       Today's "special snowflakes" are considered to be mentally incapable of handling anything remotely resembling the real world, I suppose, even a simple inauguration ceremony. If I had a kid in that school, I'd be livid.
