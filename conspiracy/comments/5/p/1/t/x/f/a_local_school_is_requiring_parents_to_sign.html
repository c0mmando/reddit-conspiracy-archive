I teach high school social studies and given the passion and skepticism and furor surrounding this election I didn&#39;t plan to show it live in class, rather we would watch highlights on Monday together and discuss. </p>

<p>I am of the impression though, that if you feel you need a permission slip to show a current political event happening (violent events are the exception) that you maybe shouldn&#39;t show it...that&#39;s just me. </p>

When Obama was inaugurated in 2008, the district I was working for at the time (different state) did not allow teachers to show the inauguration in class, period. </p>

The district that banned the Obama inauguration was in a small town with some really, really strange attitudes about most things. Also highly conservative and resistant to the views of outsiders.

    <div class="md"><p>Fellow Arkansan here. When i was in school there weren&#39;t any permission slips but you could opt out of watching it. Seems silly you would need a parent&#39;s permission to show kids a national tradition. PC bullshit if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was 14 when JFK was assassinated, and we were given the choice to watch the continuous coverage on TV, or to spend the day in study hall doing our homework. I chose the former and watched the coverage all day long in the auditorium with other students. Watching Walter Cronkite wipe the tears from his eyes is something I will never forget.  </p>

<p>Today&#39;s &quot;special snowflakes&quot; are considered to be mentally incapable of handling anything remotely resembling the real world, I suppose, even a simple inauguration ceremony. If I had a kid in that school, I&#39;d be livid.</p>
