<p>What I mean is, fuck those people who try to divide us by claiming that we have to be either a Trump supporter or a Clinton shill. This divisiveness is extremely toxic, especially to us as conspiracy theorists who are supposed to question every move the government makes. NOT say &quot;give the government a chance to do things right!&quot; This isn&#39;t going to happen guys. All of you fucking know this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your point is excellent and made me think.</p>

<p>This whole process seems like some sort of major regime change among the globalists.  We now see a trend in favor of Russian business relations; quite the opposite of what the old camp wanted.<br/>
Perhaps we are changing our long game to be united with Russia against China.  Exactly how is not hard to imagine, especially with more and more Chinese citizens wanting to own automobiles.  Russia would be in a very favorable position to monopolize this opportunity of supplying China&#39;s ever increasing energy needs, so of course the United States would have motive to strong arm the Russians into cutting a deal in order to not miss out on a buck being made.  Waging proxy wars throughout the Middle East on the other side of Russian interests and manipulating global oil prices to hinder the Russian economy are two very strong cards play at the negotiating table.</p>

<p>It is hard to imagine we are not attempting some big oil and gas deals with Russia with the appointment of Tillerson to the cabinet.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t enjoy imagining Russia as some &quot;enemy&quot;.  If the current Republicans want to mend relations with Russia, then I wish them luck.  If their intentions are less than genuine, something Trump is known for and excels at, then I really hope we don&#39;t face World War III in the fallout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would only feel obligated to cite something if I knew that you hadn&#39;t paid attention to the election, which I&#39;m sure isn&#39;t the case. Sourcing harsh rhetoric and xenophobia doesn&#39;t make a difference in influencing the ability of the apologists to see that he ostracized entire groups of Americans. It&#39;s as simple as the fact that you don&#39;t belong to said groups so there&#39;s no reason for you to care or even acknowledge the problem. For a lot of you (not all and maybe not you, although asking for a source for something obvious doesn&#39;t help set you apart from the rest of the brigade), compassion and the understanding that minorities have been forced to the left because the right doesn&#39;t shy away from dehumanizing everyone outside of straight white people are nonexistent.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve caught myself being hopeful about a Trump presidency multiple times. I want to be, but then I remember Mike Pence. Out of all the people that he could&#39;ve chosen to be VP, why a notoriously evil homophobe? I&#39;m from Indiana and he was extremely unpopular as Governor. Can&#39;t tell you how many &quot;Fire Mike Pence&quot; signs I&#39;ve seen in yards across the state.</p>

<p>I will wait patiently, but if/when the first anti-gay laws start to pop up, I&#39;ll be able to say that this is exactly what the plan was all along and it was barely a secret.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t vote. HRC is a corrupt, evil neocon and there&#39;s no way that reality TV star and trust fund baby Donald Trump should be our president. This election sucked and your blind support sucks even more because you&#39;re only feeding the system.</p>

<p>Er, after you’ve worked for the Pres. of the US you don’t go back to being a lobbyist. You work two days a year sitting on the board of a global conglomerate that is stealing up the worlds resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s totally possible to run a billion dollar company and not claim a profit. Amazon does this. All one has to do is initiate large-scale, expensive projects that put the ledger into the red. Of course, the tactic is that each dollar in the red will have a positive ROI.</p>

<p>It&#39;s entirely possible that Trump will donate his profits to the US treasury, on the other hand, it&#39;s entirely possible that Trump won&#39;t claim any profits in the next four years. </p>

<p>Why are there so many people here supporting the establishment? </p>

<p>Going to bat for fucking Corporate America? One of the most vile and corrupt group of organisations on the planet.</p>

<p>I have read several comments on here literally asking me to not judge Trump for picking fucking ex-Goldman Sachs Assholes for his Cabinet? Really? <em>we know</em> Goldman Sachs is corrupt! We’ve all seen the vile shit they do to people and economies across the globe.</p>

<p>IMO, it’s a sad day for r/conspiracy when more users here support the Establishment than challenge it. It’s even sadder that some here don’t even think we should be asking questions saying “give him a chance”.</p>

<p>Here is what I believed from jump street and still believe. Trump is a narcissist and ego maniac. Those characteristics lead me to believe he will want approval and popularity more than anything.  I can see Trump really focusing on race relations because everyone is calling him racist etc. Egomaniacs want to prove people wrong.  I have to believe his ego will not allow him to be anything other than great </p>

We have RNC nutters falling over themselves to ignore the 5, count them <strong>FIVE</strong>, Goldman-Sachs executives in Trump&#39;s cabinet after he spent months trashing Shillary for her ties to G-S and then went on to claim he was &quot;different&quot;.  Whatever drugs you diehard supporters are on with your &quot;Just wait and see...&quot; mentality, I want some of it because I could make a fucking fortune selling it, as strong as it appears to be.  </p>

<p>&quot;Give him 60 days&quot;?  WTF?  He has had 60 days from election and in that time he&#39;s pushed for a cabinet filled to the brim with the highest dollar amount donators to the RNC and his own campaign...you know, like <strong>EVERY OTHER POLITICIAN IN THE HISTORY OF EVER</strong>.  <em>So different...such a change from the &quot;normal&quot;.</em>  Bullshit.</p>

<p>In 60 days, when Trump has done the same bullshit every other politician does in their first 60 days, you&#39;ll say &quot;Give him 6 months, I promise, things will be different!&quot;  It&#39;s like fucking domestic abuse hotline material.  &quot;He can change...I swear it...I just tripped and fell into a doorjam...and hired <strong>five</strong> Goldman Sachs executives on my way down.&quot;</p>

To work around or bring to light things. He refused to go to the world summit, ffs. This is where the worlds elites get together to discuss how to control us. He wanted nothing to do with it. </p>

<p>Hey, question all you want, this is conspiracy room. But worked for goldman sachs isnt automatically a bad thing. Concerning, but hes just getting the best people he can for the positions.

They got where they were because they screwed over the right guys and cut corners, thats what you do if you want to make alot of money you know where to cut corners.

That right there gets people ahead. Less regulations to hold them back. It leaves them to their own vices and usually that doesnt go so well. We wind up with things like The Jungle by Upton Sinclair.</p>

<p>Sonny Perdue is the former Governor of Georgia. He supports factory farms, pesticides and genetically engineered crops. In 2009, he signed a bill into law that blocked local communities in Georgia from regulating factory farms to address animal cruelty, pollution or any other hazard. He took money from Monsanto and other pesticide companies for his gubernatorial campaigns. The Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a front group for the GMO industry, named Perdue their 2009 Governor of the Year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He won. We have no choice but to be hopeful. He&#39;s given enough reason to be hopeful, despite a couple of questionable appointments. I actually like most of his appointees, though some do make me very uncomfortable. Should I instead be hopeless and whiny like so many Hillary supporters despite the fact my guy won?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I&#39;ll OP, I&#39;ll bite. I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m not a fan of the DeVos pick either, being from Michigan, I know a bit about them and they have shown themselves to be very greedy and highly religious (I suspect that might be why they are there, to please the religious right in school and away from science, not good). I&#39;m curious as to who you&#39;d pick instead of Trump, CTR (<em>cough</em>) has come here hoping to pull an <a href="/r/redacted2">/r/redacted2</a>.0 on the folks here and so far haven&#39;t been able to pull it off.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, I don&#39;t trust the Democratic Party (maybe Tulsi Gabbard or Bernie who has gone back to independent) and consider the party fraudulent in every way. The subverted the will of their voters and cheated a good man out of the presidency so they sock puppet could be installed instead. It seems to me the only reason Trump is being attacked is because he has decided to skip the middleman and go right to the corporations showing great transparency on who is pulling what strings and thus who we should boycott, but I digress.</p>

<p>The only party I would consider voting for at all now would be the Green Party and Jill Stein, what of yourself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I couldn&#39;t see myself voting for any of the candidates. I initially liked Jill Stein and the Green party, but there were a few issues with her that I got a little turned off. I&#39;d say she and Bernie Sanders were the two people I&#39;d most likely support.</p>

<p>I think this election season was a good wake up call for Americans to not just rely on the Presidential elections to make a difference, and what we need to do more at the local levels and begin from there with the primaries. I also think it was a good time for people to begin organizing for things they felt that needed to be changed.</p>
