    <div class="md"><p>They do indeed - but only by our tacit consent. Collectively, the masses benefit from the current global system of government far less than a small percentage. If enough people realise this and demand a change, things can turn around very quickly. But as you&#39;ve rightly said, control of media, finance &amp; government ensures the true nature of reality is hidden from most. But things are changing. Brexit, Trump, Italian referendum, &quot;fake news&quot;, the loss in Syria- cracks are starting to show in the cabals defence. </p>

<p>The official narrative doesn&#39;t carry as much weight = more seek truth in alternative sources = increasing awareness in what&#39;s actually happening = people realise how badly they&#39;re being fucked and who it is that&#39;s fucking then = Revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t think it will.</p>

<p>he was already intensely unpopular, as was clinton, before being elected, and the MSM, deep stare, and political class are waging intense, 24/7 propaganda campaign to set the stage for the mainstays of establishment to be rebrandded as benevolent saviors.</p>

<p>the batshit crazy stream of the most irrasicle, marginal republican legistion, most of which has been introduced perenially for more than a decade, isn&#39;t helping. </p>

<p>at a time like this, stoki g the worst fears of at least half the nation, only sets up the rebranding of neocon, neoliberal, war criminal, corrupt, grifting, enemies of the common man and woman as shinning beacons, largely gecause the learned the number one rule of fight club: don&#39;t talk about fight club.</p>

<p>beat the shit out of the world in the dark, behind closed doors, with fake smiles and reasonable tones  and crocodile tears.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve been defending trump and criticising the bullshit, but i can only take so much extremism from the house republicans and trump&#39;s bullshit cabinet members (they are bullshit, even most trumpeters agree).</p>

<p>for instance, this bibi netenyahou ass licking move the embassy to jerusalem stunt is on par with the red baiting war monering to start a hot war with russia. we have a mutual aid treaty with israel. if israel is attacked by anyone, we have to join in. once we join in, NATO article 5 is triggered, and voila, WW3, but from a different front. plus, israel has nukes and is fucking insane.</p>

<p>i&#39;m pretty much resigned to the end of the world...i was until i was 20, so it&#39;s just going back to status quo ante for me...sigh...</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The real truth that dare not speak itself, is that no one is in control, absolutely no
one! Y&#39;know, you don&#39;t understand Monica, you don&#39;t understand Netanyahu. It&#39;s because
NOBODY! is in control! This stuff is ruled by the equations of dynamics and chaos.
Now there may be entities seeking control, the World Bank, the communist party, the rich
the somebody or others. But to seek control is to take enormous aggravation upon yourself.
Because this process, that is underway, will take the control freak by the short and curly
and throw them against the wall. It&#39;s like trying to control a dream, you see.
If I were dependent on the notion that human institutions are necessary to pull us out
of the ditch, I would be very despairing. As I said, nobody&#39;s in charge not the IMF,
the Pope, the communist party, the Jews, no, no, no, nobody has their finger on what&#39;s
going on. So then, why hope? Isn&#39;t it just a runaway train, out of control? I don&#39;t think
so. I think the out-of-controlness is the most hopeful thing about it! After all, WHOSE
control is it out of?! You and I never controlled it in the first place! Why are we anxious
about the fact that it&#39;s out of control? I think if it&#39;s out of control, then our side
is winning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the phrase NWO was coined by the up and coming new capatilist wealth during the late 1700s, at the exact time that secret societies took off as a means of politic organization in regimes that cracked down severely on dissent. </p>

<p>ironically, france&#39;s aristocracy was so dismissive of the rest of society that secret societies never really took off because polical clubs, like the jacobins and the girondins, were completely ignored and could meet openly....madam guillotine has been the boogeyman of the elites ever since...hence, jack booted militarized domestic police forces...</p>

<p>anywho, what was meant by NWO was the intial usurption, by the up and coming industrial/finance capital based wealth and power, of the old school heredity/land based wealth and power, i.e. the OWO. in france called it was even called the ancient regime.</p>

<p>the aristocrats sealed their own fate with the enclosure movement in which they kicked the peasants, who created and maintained their agricultural based wealth, off their lands to turn their states into parks during the 18th century. without a source of income they had to live off of debt. </p>

<p>the aristocrats were broke and being foreclosed on long before the downton abbey edwardian era. the ones who survived joined the NWO by marrying the daughters of the capitalist robber barrons, but even the majority of those dwindled to nothing by the 1940s, because doweries only go so far, even when large.</p>

<p>without the enclosure movement industry and capitalism could never have existed because it created the hordes of dispossessed, homeless desperate factory workers necessary for it to function. it created the wage-slaves.</p>

<p>if you look at who encouraged the enclosure/park movement, it was the wealthy bourgeois merchants/crafstmen/architects (skilled leeches), the burgeoning factory mill owners who needed the aristocrats&#39; workers and their land, and the bankers who got fat off the compunded interest owed to them (have to keep in mind, owning land was not an option for any but aristocrats, even today, ever person in cornwall is the tenet of prince cgarles, they only can rent, never own).</p>

<p>in otherwords, those advocating for  &quot;free trade,&quot; which isn&#39;t the quaint market based world most libertarians imagine it to be. it is laize fare, &quot;classical&quot; liberal economics whose primary goals were the destruction of tariffs to allow business and capital leverage to destroy local, small time crafstmen, artisans, and merchants through underbidding facilitated by their ability to exploit cheaper markets, along with the liberation of banking, which had been held in check through strict ursory laws, and the freeing of insurance brokers from the highly restrictive gaming laws that regulated them (insurance was originally seen as a form of wagering/gambling).</p>

<p>in the 20th century, the new world order matured into borderless, global neo-liberal, monopolistic finance-captilism--absolute free movement of trade and money, coupled with strictly enforced restricted movement of labor. </p>

<p>the mature NWO&#39;s goal, like as was the case with the OWO, is the consolidation of wealth and power i to the least number of the most ruthless capatilists and bankers, to push out all their competitors and dictate the laws of nations from behind the scences (they learned the lesson of madame guillotine--keep those whose heads really need to be chopped off a secret).</p>

<p>that there maybe a &quot;king&quot; and a &quot;royal family&quot; now: is no stranger than the emergence of kings 1000 years ago after the fall of the roman empire and the handful of powerful nobles who ruled with them in a strange, dysfunctional symbiotic relationship. </p>

<p>the weird, disturbing, and disgusting occult crap is just the way they establisha pecking order and assign themselves titles in their &quot;court.&quot; they&#39;ve always wanted to have titles, they make them feel special. this also why they build themselves ostentatious mansions, they&#39;ve always wanted castles. the have an inferiorty complex still about having been the sons of nobodies.</p>

<p>i was trying to describe how i veiwed john podesta to my mother, a history phd. it is clear from the emails that he is true power behond clinton and the DNC. everything goes through him. all i could think of was &quot;kingmaker.&quot; she asked &quot;so he&#39;s warwick?&quot; it is a perfect analogy and very funny because bill clinton is the spitting image the corrupt, debauched, lecherous edward VI and hillary is the spitting image of the conving, power hungry, money grubbing elizabeth woodville, who only got where she got through marriage.</p>

<p>Secret societies were certainly not a new invention of the late 1700s. They existed for millenia before that.</p>

New World Order is the concept of destroying traditional Old World values and culture to replace it with a &#39;New&#39; order that promotes a dystopian one world government. This NWO would crush all individual freedoms, thought, family, religion, and traditional values in the place of a Super Socialist globalist society run by Bolshevic bankers and crony capitalists.

    <div class="md"><p>I hope you&#39;re right, and you may very well be. However it shouldn&#39;t be forgotten that there are still <em>very deep</em> state intelligence apparatuses with tavistock playbooks on how to manipulate the public, start wars, and get the results they want. The science of population control and maintaining hegemony is millennia old and has many troubleshooting options for situations like this. I am cautiously optimistic; hoping for the best but wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all if Trump <em>was</em> an insider carrying out some part of their long game. People&#39;s brains aren&#39;t trained to think about double-speak, trojan horses, ad populum, subliminal manipulation, subversion, etc. It&#39;s way more nuanced and complicated then people make it out to be and if you think the powers that have been in control since time immemorial are going to go quietly you are sorely mistaken. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the original goal in creating the NWO was to establish one world government - thereby ending war all together. At least, based on my understanding on the writings of the original illuminati group from Bulgaria. </p>

<p>In recent times - the commentary by the powers that be is that going from many many nations to one world government was simply too large a goal and could not be achieved.  So they decided they should form 5 regions and then it would be easier to bring the five regions into one system.</p>

<p>What you don&#39;t understand is how fucking close we are to the 5 regions: The EU was formed - region 1; NAFTA was signed - region 2 - TPP was signed - region 3; The pan-african parliament - region 4; and unification of the middle east <a href="http://fpif.org/the-middle-east-the-only-way-forward-is-unification/">Link</a> is region-5.</p>

<p>What about South America - Clinton talked about that with open boarders - basically expanding NAFTA to include south America.</p>

<p>Unification of the EU was achieved but Brexit dealt a serious blow to this effort and now the powers that be are trying to salvage what they created.</p>

<p>TPP was just struck by Trump - and we are threatening to leave the EU.</p>

<p>Thus, while I think Trump is a terrible person morally, ethically, and personally - he is acting counter to the globalist agenda.  </p>

<p>Beware of the council on foreign relations and those in power in the media from the council on foreign relations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What seems more likely to me is that there are, and always have been, competing factions among the &quot;out of sight&quot; elite. They all want power, but they differ in how they wish to obtain that power and what they wish to do with it. The election of Trump seems to support this. Many believe it was all some huge political UFC match, which was all part of the Master Plan. Alternately, Donald may actually not be a part of the same elite faction we&#39;ve seen in the past few decades. That doesn&#39;t mean that his own team of cronies won&#39;t still fuck us over with zero hesitation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there is. The old world order was a manipulation of minds. The New World Order is manipulation of the environment, which reflect the old saying; &quot;We will have it whether you like it or not&quot;. </p>

<p>They control the weather, have put up hundreds of atmospheric heaters that alters the electromagnetic resonance of the earth and it&#39;s inhabitants, and have essentially bought up all resources, control the technology, alters genes and control most of the energy grid; electricity and fuel.</p>

<p>The New World order has been around since the &quot;fall&quot; of the 3rd Reich, in other words; since 1945. You are only now becoming aware of it. 3 generations have been indoctrinated into the social system called Socialism and Democracy, which is a replacement for Freedom and Republic. </p>

<p>There IS such a thing as a New World Order, and it is based on manipulation, likenthe old, but on a global, total scale. </p>
