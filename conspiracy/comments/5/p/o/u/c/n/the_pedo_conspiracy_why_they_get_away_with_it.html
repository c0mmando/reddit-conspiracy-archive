        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Everywhere you look nowadays, you see pedo/occult symbols in Hollywood. You can watch Obama joke about how he and Biden can&#39;t get served pizza in some places. You can even watch the elite Hollywood crowd laugh. Don&#39;t you wonder, why can they get away with this right out in the open?</p>

<p>The answer is... Bob Saget. Now, let&#39;s see if you&#39;re ready.</p>

<h2>Bob Saget Jokes About Father Raping Son Until Bloody Diarrhea Explodes From Son&#39;s Anus, Mother, Father, Son And Daughter Then Have Sex In Their Own Shit.</h2>

<p>See what I mean? I told you that you weren&#39;t ready.</p>

<p>Full House was a television show from the 90s. Bob Saget was the star. But, you have no idea how fucking disgusting he is! Turds have more humanity than this guy. To get a sense of how fucking totally disgusting he is, see if you can watch him &#39;kid&#39; around for five minutes here: I do not hate Jews, I just hate Pedos. The following short video is Saget &#39;joking&#39; about a family fucking each other in their own shit to impress a Hollywood agent. It&#39;s only 7 minutes long.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyRewFZOXy8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyRewFZOXy8</a></p>

<h2>Bob Also Jokes About Letting Someone &#39;Finger&#39; His Newborn Infant For A Dollar</h2>

<p>When given the chance to walk that statement back, Bob says, &quot;I should have said, &#39;Five dollars, not one.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>The person who made the following Bob Saget videos spent years listening to sexual abuse victims.</p>

<p>He describes how Bob rapes a plastic doll on a set bed in full view of an on-site schoolroom. The kids saw this act on a monitor that was trained on the set. Do you think for one second, that after all the years on set, Bob did not know this?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGJj1SkZtsU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGJj1SkZtsU</a></p>

<p>This abuse counsellor did a follow-up video about the Satanic angle, I couldn&#39;t watch it. I am an atheist. I always thought Devil worshippers were harmless idiots. I didn&#39;t think anyone could seriously believe in Satan. I was abused for years after my mother died at the age of 4, and even I cannot believe in Satanic child sex ritual sacrifice. They can get away with this because the media doesn&#39;t control our minds, we do it for them, by refusing to believe. It&#39;s that fucking simple.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erdgVYg-D4I&amp;t=92s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erdgVYg-D4I&amp;t=92s</a></p>

<p>If you don&#39;t feel the need for a psychiatrist by now, you can watch this. Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you must be a child, the aristocrats is one of the most well known jokes in comedy. You&#39;re going to watch South Park one day (when your parents let you) and see cartmen tell the joke and post about how Trey Parker and Matt stone are pedos also. Your point is ignorant and not well researched. Go back to the conspiracy drawing board lil guy </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If fucking your son until blood and shit spurt from his ass is considered funny in comedy circles, then what does that say about comedians and Hollywood. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the casting couch was just a bit weirder than we imagined. That joke may have been Saget&#39;s &#39;in&#39; joke to get the part. The casting director would likely pop a boner, and respond to Saget, saying, &quot;I like the cut of your jib, you got the part!&quot;</p>

<p>The clip you posted is from a movie of the same name which features dozens of comedians and various versions of the joke. </p>

<p>The whole point of the joke is to be so obscene as to offend common decency. </p>

<p>How naive are you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude- are you kidding?  Saget is doing &quot;The Aristocrats&quot; joke.  The joke itself is about how artistocrats are twisted perverts.  It&#39;s a shaggy dog joke where the purpose is to push the limits of vulgarity and the payoff of the entire diatribe is a stupid but apt punchline.</p>

<p>This is what comedy does- it pushes limits and makes a statement.  He isn&#39;t advocating pedophilia.</p>

<p>That said, Saget is not funny.  He has a huge chip on his shoulder because he is typecast as danny tanner- so he tries to make up for it by being as vulgar as possible with his comedy and it comes off as trite and pathetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s how the pedos reveal themselves-- they are so desensitized to the depravity they practice, they shock us with their callous jokes. &quot;It&#39;s no big deal.&quot;  Destroying children&#39;s lives is so passé. </p>
