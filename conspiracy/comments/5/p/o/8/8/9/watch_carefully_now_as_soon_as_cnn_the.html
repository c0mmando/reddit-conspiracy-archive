       Or, they were threatened with their access. As far as I can tell, Trump was relocating the location of the press conference to allow alternate media in.
      </p>

       It would be much wiser to focus on what Trump is doing, instead of guessing based on how CNN et al react.

       Trump is taking a leaf from Putin's playbook:
He is messing around with the established media by eschewing them in favor of feeding the loonies in the alt-media.
He is doing this to create mass uncertainty as to the truthfulness of anything you read about him or his administration, regardless of where you read it.
In one way it is a good thing as it will lead to more people questioning the validity of the news they are sold as 'truthful'; but terrible in another way as it means no-one will really have any clue what his agenda is until it's too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, the users of this site seem to be doing a better job of obfuscating fact and truth than any action on Trump's part.

       Well as your pal I would have to say you have a long way to go and you might not make.  Because you are so unstable your chances are pretty iffy.  I will continue to try to help you.  Maybe, you should take a nap now and we can talk more later.

       This was going on since the beginning, the whole anti trump propaganda was there just to make people belive that he's a outsider. Or one of us. Look at his cabinet picks, now the Clintons are good guys, and they are already presenting alternative facts.

       666=number of the beast 777=number of God. The universe uses number to communicate with us. On inauguration day, Trump was 70 years 7 months and 7 days old and it's currently the Hebrew year 5777. Trump is ushering in the golden/messianic age. He's not going to concede to the NWO.

       Try to look at it like a 3D chessboard.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM are doing exactly what they are supposed to do so set up the next move.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the woman's march, and all this anti Trump rhetoric,  in any way threatened the establishment the MSM would not have covered it, and riot police would have been out en mass to put it down. Just like that have with all other protests during the Obama regime that you probably never heard of.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not pretending to know what the next move is, but they are all in cahoots. Blatantly lying about Trump. Believe me, they do not need to lie about this man. There is enough truth to take him down, they new this before the election, and they didn't do it. I wonder why?
      </p>
      <p>
       The real proof will be in his continued pandering to Israel. Is he going to continue to give them 38 billion a year or "put America first" and send that money Flint, where they still don't have clean drinking water, and our other impoverished inner cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is the NWO, or he would not have been selected President. no matter how it might appear. Watch for the LONG game.
