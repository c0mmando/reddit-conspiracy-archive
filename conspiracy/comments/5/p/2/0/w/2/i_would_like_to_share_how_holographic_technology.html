       Awesome, great post.
      </p>

       There were a few theories floating around that this technology may have been used to give the impression that Julian Assange is alive and well in the Ecuadorian embassy.

       Absolutely.

      <p>
       If it seems like a conspiracy, it probably is. Our gut instincts
       <em>
        tell us
       </em>
       something is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now when groups of people start saying
       <em>
        hey, my instincts are telling me something is going on. See what we're seeing here!?
       </em>
       .... you know what I mean! It's lunacy to think that anyone would try to tell us our feelings are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing is believing and I believe we're seeing some shills spreading misinformation/disinformation to further divide us all. Sure we can have naysayers and fact checkers, but a quick glimpse on YouTube about debunked Assange recent news.... well, magic 8 ball instincts telling us outlook not so good.

       And if Julian Assange is just a CIA cartoon... why don't they make him say that Russians gave him the leaks? Why make a fake Assange that won't do what you say?

       Because we're witnessing a stage play. Assange has been controlled opposition all along, whether he's CGI or not. He's supposed to counter the Russia narrative; it's what he's scripted to do.

       So Assange was always on their side... so they killed him... and replaced him by a cartoon? Seems easier to just leave the real one there so they didn't have to expose the existence of futuristic livestreaming CGI technologies to a bunch of internet weirdos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh no... first Assange and Putin and now... me?!?! I'm controlled opposition too! How deep does this conspiracy go!?! If you see a video of me fucking a baby remember that it is just my CIA CGI doppelganger!

       If Assange is fake then we have no reason to believe anything is real ever again... You guys are just silly that push this... cause if you were really this far off the deep end you'd be all up on the hollow Earth shit.

       Seriously though, I don't think he's not real, that video  just looks really fake to me. No idea why they would fake it, my guess is they captured or killed him and are using whatever they can to string along anyone that is interested.

       Nah... if you take any re-encoded copy or a re-encoded copy of a copy of an edited digital video and scrutinize it you will probably see similar things going on... editing artifacts... but no one is trying to claim that Whoopi Goldberg is a CIA CGI cartoon...

       No... cause he did the livestream... and I asked a question and he answered it... so he wasn't prerendered... and no amount of CGI magic can accurately replicate the disgust of a grown man forced to look at a twitch chat.

       He said people that say he are dead are just part of a Black OPs Campaign to discredit Wikileaks to hinder donations and leaks... it's mind games... and you are either on the bad guys side... or fooled by the bad guys. It ain't too late for redemption... he's alive. Everyone knows it.

       That technology has been public knowledge for a while. But it's a limited hangout. The MIC is way beyond that level by now. Montauk Project technology cubed is where they're at.

       Yes yes... and they choose to use this technology on Assange... who 95% of the population pays little to no attention to... what other personalities have also been replaced by cartoons? I can't tell because they look so convincing... even can be rendered in real time... Is Obama still real or was he also replaced by a cartoon to pardon Manning?

       Heh. I make holograms for a living. The tech we use is actually pretty straight forward and it's something that's older than you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually the tech we used for the Tupac thing was over a hundred years old! True! It's called Pepper's Ghost and it's a simple light trick. Honest, this is really easy stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       The insidious stuff are the tech used in Hollywood movies. We can make anyone say or do anything and make it look...Well, real. We can computer generate any shadow or light or camera anomaly that you think are the "tells" for something to look real.

       The things computers do now scare me as much as they make me excited.

       That's why I think it's rediculous to talk about holograms as some kind of alien magic. It's the same idea just using tvs or projectors.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone is doing things like faking Julian Assange, it's not a hologram.  It's just straight up CGI like in star wars or mad max.

       Exascale computing refers to computing systems capable of at least one exaFLOPS, or a billion billion calculations per second. Such capacity represents a thousandfold increase over the first petascale computer that came into operation in 2008.[1] (One exaflops is a thousand petaflops or a quintillion, 1018, floating point operations per second.) At a supercomputing conference in 2009, Computerworld projected exascale implementation by 2018.[2]
      </p>
      <p>
       Exascale computing would be considered as a significant achievement in computer engineering, for it is believed to be the order of processing power of the human brain at neural level (functional might be lower). It is, for instance, the target power of the Human Brain Project.

       This is when the real shitshow will start. We're massively outgunned when it comes to sheer computing power. Your i7 is a joke comparatively.

       Follow your heart and soul. Others are waking up all around us at this time, just like you. Search from December 15th 2016 and on, here at r/conspiracy.... look for the "anyone else feel" or "anyone experiencing". You'll know what you're looking for once it hits you. Follow what feels right and go with it

       dodging the question?  Surprised that Assange didn't call out your little echo-chamber specifically in his last interview, what you're doing is absolutely obvious.

       Thankfully there's still places online where your kind haven't infiltrated truth seeking forums so people can actually discuss reality without being silenced by you types.

       Being in the third dimension stuck in the river of time in my opinion is our souls last chance. We obviously messed up and rebelled from the oneness causing separation. Based on your humanly life the good deeds weighed against the bad will be the deciding factor if you will ascend into a higher plane after death or be eliminated entirely.
