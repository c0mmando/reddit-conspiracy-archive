    <div class="md"><p>Donald Trump is about to become president and yet our &quot;hot&quot; page is all Clinton stories.  She lost over two months ago.How does Donald Trump after decades of billion dollar business, running one of the most unconventional campaigns ever, putting extremely rich cronies up into the cabinet, etc. not have a single conspiracy that sticks whatsoever?</p>

<p>Is it because everyone already thinks he&#39;s a piece of shit so it would change anything?  Is it because Hillary&#39;s supposed to be the postergirl for liberal&#39;s land and therefore needs to be disproven as an untruth?</p>

<p>How is this sub going to be legit if it refuses to look into conspiracies on the sitting president?  We have people now saying that it&#39;s a FACT he has no ties to Russia and all of it&#39;s a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Muh Russia narrative. Sorry buddy but if Trump is puppeted (and I don&#39;t know why anyone wouldn&#39;t expect that on here) it is by neo-cons/Zionists. </p>

<p>The Russia BS is a weak narrative. And the evidence is mostly shouting and &quot;u hurt my feelings if u disagree&quot;</p>

<p>The only two scenarios I see is that there is Trump/Zionist alliance primarily which can allow for moderate cooperation with Russia. </p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>There&#39;s an overarching much grander, more consolidated force which controls every nation. But it doesn&#39;t entirely make sense since the Soros/Saudi side wars with the Zionist/neo-con side. At the end of the day they will ally over outside nations or business powers but they still attack each other just the same. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a few. I think he&#39;s probably bribed a few officials to get building permits, and stiffed a few contractors. It&#39;s orders of magnitude better than what most of these politicians do, so I&#39;m hopeful it will be a good presidency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just white guys. I am half mexican, but because my skin is pale most of the year since I spend so much time indoors, SJWs have a habit of categorizing me as white whenever it&#39;s convenient for them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pissed because 100% of the racism I&#39;ve felt this past year has been from liberals.</p>

<p>Also, because I argued against my conservative mother as a liberal for the past eight years, only to see the liberal climate that made her a conservative in the first place rear it&#39;s ugly head during my lifetime.</p>

<p>Even though her and I still disagree on things like abortion and gay marriage, it&#39;s nice to finally have a mutual understanding and revulsion for SJWs and subversive corrupt snakes like Clinton.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one this year who found themselves agreeing with conservatives they never thought they&#39;d see eye to eye with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re wrong about the KGB, it does not work for global capitalism, nor does putin, which is why the oligarchs fled. they went to war with capitalist oligarchs who plundered russia in the 1990&#39;s. one reason putin is despized is because he reclaimed russia&#39;s natural resources for the country as public goods.</p>

<p>the KGB is espionage for sure, but has always been more about supressing citizen uprisings and protests. they&#39;ve always acted more like stazi than the CIA.</p>

<p>if you want to meet the russian members of the &quot;nwo,c come down to south, FL, sunny isles to be exact.</p>

<p>the &quot;nwo&quot; is global capitalism, the illuminati  mainstay famlies are all the decsedants of the &quot;first to market&quot; nascent 18th and 19th century capitalists and their bankers,  which were/ the linchpin of global capital. </p>

<p>&quot;nwo&#39; was i tially about toppoling the &quot;owo&quot; of landed, hetedity, agrarian wealth (in france officialyl referred to as tge &quot;ancient regime&quot;), and them morphing on purpose into the inverted totlaitarian facism it is today, in which democracy is a managed sham to legitimate our corporatist govt.</p>

<p>people like the clinton are not the illuminati, they are the illuminati&#39;s lackies. they are constantly tested for their effi acy and the fealty.</p>

<p>do you know what the american flag is? </p>

<p>it is the battle flag of the british east india company. the flag had been in use here since 1707.</p>

<p>the besty ross story is as apocryphal as washington and the cherry tree.</p>

<p>washington marched under the EIC flag.</p>

<p>fun fact: the 13 stripes were always on the flag. the this number matched the number of colonies in 1776 was just a funny coincidence, out of which grew the folktale we all know today. </p>

<p>the flag remained unchanged until the union jack in its upper left corner was replaced by stars on a feild of blue in the 1790&#39;s, because people started to object to having the union jack on the flag, because it made them look like they were still a part of britain.</p>

<p>Digging into the Obama/Hillary/media narrative that Trump is a Russian plant just seems like a waste of my time. </p>

<p>Albeit, this sub did receive a larger transformation during this transfer of Potus, but that is because CTR took over other subs, and where they didn&#39;t take over, alternative news (the only news actually reporting on Trump) is viewed as conspiracy garbage.

<p>It&#39;s getting annoying seeing the same 3 articles posted on the front page with different words and no new evidence, Clinton bashing-Bernie riding-Pizzagate article with nothing new and then rinse and repeat. </p>

<p>Not to mention the one well written conspiracy about Trump with a shit load of proof was removed from the sub entirely (Hmmmmm wonder why????)

<p>Which we should do. We genuinely don&#39;t know what he will do. We know what he is saying, and a few of his actions.</p>

<p>He could be literally Hitler (I doubt). He could be Ronald Reagan (I think). He could be Kennedy (I hope), in which case he will end up dead, and we&#39;ll have a golden opportunity to overthrow the Deep State.</p>

<p>Have you studied the transition much? Do you know what options were available, which would actually pass the Senate? Do you know what conversations happened behind closed doors?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not ecstatic about it, but it&#39;s not like he could put Ron Paul in charge of the Fed. There are limits to what one can accomplish without being assassinated, and so far Trump looks like someone who is at the good end of the establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that Trump was a perfectly executed psy-op. The way he was built up in the MSM with all that free and really unwarranted and irrational (appearing) exposure made no sense except as being part of a psy-op. The MSM knows full well the value of all that airtime and exposure they were giving him. It was not accidental, especially when you could flip between FOX, CNN and MSNBC and they would all be showing the same thing. That is what made me suspicious that something was afoot.</p>

<p>It used to be, most Americans generally trusted the government, and the government generally acted in their best interest. These are generalizations, to be sure, but they were generally true. </p>

<p>Politics was fun, and a hobby for those who were interested. If the other team won, you might be sad, but you knew they were Americans that generally shared your values. We had bad decisions at times, and some bad politicians, but the system generally worked ok.</p>

<p>Nowadays, people are taking time off of work because their candidate lost their election. They genuinely believe life will fall apart, and their friends will be put into camps.</p>

<p>When it gets <em>obviously</em> brigaded, even to the point that people in other subs are admitting that&#39;s how they got to the post, it gets deleted.</p>

<p>Every other subreddit on this site is allowed to delete posts that are being brigaded and ban users who are encouraging brigades except for this subreddit for some reason. </p>

<p>So when the post gets deleted, what does the person do? They go over to politics, subredditdrama, or enoughtrumpspam and cry and complain that they are being censored, that this subreddit has turned into t_d because apparently Trump supporters aren&#39;t allowed to post here.</p>

<p>Then someone makes another post. <em>Which again gets linked over and over again in those subreddits.</em> Without the np link, by the way. When the post gets downvoted by the regular users here because we actually see what the fuck these people are doing, they start whining that <em>they&#39;re</em> being brigaded by t_d and Russians. </p>

<p>How are people still bringing this shit up like it&#39;s somehow a problem with <em>this sub</em>??</p>

<p>The only problem are the people who whine and link their post on subs that specifically hate this subreddit when it doesn&#39;t get the amount of upvotes they think their post should get.</p>

<p>The problem is with the people who, instead of downvoting a somehow &quot;pro-trump&quot; post and simply moving on like a normal user of this subreddit with no bullshit agenda, decide to make posts and comments over and over again that this sub has been taken over by Trump supporters. Like they&#39;re trying to drill into everyone&#39;s head that people who voted for Trump <em>aren&#39;t allowed to post here</em> or anywhere but t_d really.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same shit people are saying all over reddit. It doesn&#39;t look like anyone is actually genuinely concerned that any sub is being taken over by Trump supporters. It looks more like people are trying to convince everyone else that Trump supporters need to stay in their own sub and never support or defend the president that they voted for when they see blatantly fake news or outright lies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking bullshit. Everyone&#39;s allowed to fucking post here provided you&#39;re not here purely to start shit. <strong>Stop trying to convince people Trump supporters have to stay in their own subreddit.</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even vote for Trump and I can see right through all of the bullshit that&#39;s <em>actually</em> taking over this sub.</p>

<p>This one was particularly interesting to me, and really threw me into his camp. It wasn&#39;t the usual moderate bias against the Republican, like we saw with Romney.</p>
