       The whole world is in swimming in debt.  but what is hard to fathom for the majority of us who were brainwash through the schooling system.  is that ..
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        most debt is manufactured and not real.
       </li>
       <li>
        they enforce poverty upon us to make us work more than we normally would.   (its not about money to them, they have an infinite amount like the game of monopoly). its about farming our time and energy.
       </li>
       <li>
        money is created as a debt with interest...(if it was created as a credit the world would be swimming in abundance)
       </li>
       <li>
        they create money from nothing every time someone takes out a loan. (THEY DO NOT LEND US THIER OWN WEALTH!! they just tap it into the computer - et voila)
       </li>
       <li>
        they use another fraud to attach debt to your flesh using this clever trick
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME7K6P7hlko">
         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME7K6P7hlko
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        all debts and taxes are owned by your LEGAL name and not by you...
        <a href="http://www.losethename.com">
         www.losethename.com
        </a>
        this is important!
       </li>
       <li>
        there is an important difference between legal and lawful that is kept hidden to the majority.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5Xtvu6rr5w">
         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5Xtvu6rr5w
        </a>
        .
       </li>
       <li>
        there can never be enough money in circulation.  this keeps us all running on the hamster wheel. but this means that X amount of people are a mathematical certainty that they will be homeless/bankrupt.
       </li>
       <li>
        this is why USUARY is UNLAWFUL.. it has been made LEGAL but that is still against the law.  remember jesus kicking over the tables....
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       THE GOOD NEWS....
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        the world of finance is based on contract law. if you enter into a contract but the other party does not disclose certain parts of the contract.  (or even if you were tricked or forced into the contract)   that contract becomes null and void!
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       all UNSECURED debt is easily able to be written off if you are able to break your programming.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>

       There's an easy way to prevent debt.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Have an emergency fund.  Don't borrow money for emergencies.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Live on a budget.  Budget every penny.  Failures to budget lead to more "emergencies"
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If you're already in debt:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        BUDGET
       </li>
       <li>
        Build an emergency fund
       </li>
       <li>
        Pay off debts from smallest to largest to free up minimum payments and get a sense of accomplishment every time you pay one off.  Take a second job,  work 60 hours a week,  sell everything in sight,  DO NOT eat out! Make it happen! You agreed to pay it when you took it. Be responsible and clean your mess up.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Get a $10 book called the total money makeover by Dave Ramsey.  There's no tricks or secrets here. It's common sense advice and he's been preaching it the same way on his radio show for 20+ years.  It's worked for thousands and thousands of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let the down votes roll in.  I hope this helps some people regardless of the ridiculous down voting nature of this sub.
