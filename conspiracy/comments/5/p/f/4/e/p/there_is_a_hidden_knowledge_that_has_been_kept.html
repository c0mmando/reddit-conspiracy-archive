        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">144</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-22 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/djklbd.html">djklbd</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since the dawn of man, groups of people with higher intelligence and knowledge have convened and networked with one another. Naturally, like any species, they do this to hoard resources and establish themselves as the rulers and the elite, with special privelages and control over the &quot;serfs&quot;. They simply feel that the decadent, lavish lifestyle is entitled to them because of the knowledge they hold. </p>

<p>As time progressed, these elites would
Breed and spread their influence across the globe. They constantly make their way into positions of power and influence, and even as systems of government evolved and progressed globally, the aristocracy was able to place its members in those positions of influence as well. </p>

<p>It has never stopped, there is some sort of society out there that has some kind of hidden knowledge that has been kept from the greater humanity. I&#39;m speaking very broadly and generally, but we all know that there is something the worlds aristocracy know that we do not.</p>

<p>My question is, what is this hidden information? Immortality? Is there a special bloodline with unique DNA? When the  Pizzagate stuff hit, I became obsessed with it. It seemed to bizzare that I was unable to look away, I had to see how deep the rabbit hole went...</p>

<p>What I think Pizzagate has done is brought attention to the elite&#39;s fascination with the occult and children. Does the aristocracy, the illuminated ones, do they have an obsession with decadence and deviance? Indulging in guilty pleasures is the best way to enjoy life for them? Is this their religion? &quot;There is no God, so we can live it up, fulfill our deepest sexual fantasies, do evil bad things and get away with it. Life&#39;s a party because we&#39;re in charge! And we have the secret knowledge. Satan gives us the power to be ourselves and reach our potential!&quot;. </p>

<p>What roles does the satanism play in the elites quest for power? These are all things I&#39;m trying to honestly understand. They have an obsession with rituals and abuse and sexual deviance, and they truly believe this is all RIGHT! They think this is the way to live life, this is their philosophy.</p>

<p>Does anybody have anything to offer here? Any elaboration? It&#39;s so interesting, but so terrifying at the same time. I&#39;m really actually kind of at a loss for words. But there is clearly some sort of secret knowledge or something that the people in power know that allows them to remain invincible. Does anybody agree with what I have said above? Is there something to this?    How deep does the rabbit hole really go? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elite have access to aliens who have unique knowledge about life. They are negative people though and are using this knowledge to enslave. They are worried about the people uniting because that will eventually topple the elite. </p>

<p>Also, the elite have insanely magnificent hoards of wealth, technology, and resources they are keeping from the people because by holding onto it, they literally wield power. If Trump is one of us, then he will quickly unleash this into our society but he will have to get past some serious security hurdles first. It&#39;s simply not fair to hold all that from the people and if I know about these hoards, then Trump knows for sure. If this stuff was released, the technology can make 2017 look like 2057 in no time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the &quot;satanism&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; rituals are is the glorification of negativity. There is no &quot;spiritual&quot; power or knowledge behind it, it is simply their own hedonistic endulgence in negativity and they do these incredibly negative things because they feed off of and essentially bathe in negativity.</p>

<p>They do not know anything special except the existence of a few things, like of negative et&#39;s and the advanced technology these negative et&#39;s have given them. They also know much of the true history of the world. But absolutely most importantly, they know of the existence of the place that they (the elite) as a continually changing group throughout time, stem from, and that place is<strong>Atlantis.</strong></p>

<p>Please read my comment in this thread, I introduce all of this there and from there please read all of the links I have put in my comment to my other posts about Atlantis and the elite. All of the other comments in here, except a few, will try to maintain the false beliefs about the elite and reality that the elite have sewed into the minds of nearly everyone in this sub. These comments will be upvoted because those up voting belief these false beliefs too, and these other comments reinforce them. </p>

<p>My posts about all of this are not based in belief, and make all of the connections between everything and simultaneously use logic to order those connections in the correct sequence. There is always a correct sequence to things like this since reality is inherently as logical as it can possibly be. Math, music, geometry, and so many other things speak of this.</p>

<p>The correct sequence in this regard means the sequence of connections that could objectively be possible. And the only way to verify what is objectively possible is by looking at the <strong>obvious</strong> evidence. That means evidence that everyone can see for themselves and has access to, and that is not hidden or kept away from everyone by &quot;scientists&quot;. That hidden evidence is not actual evidence because evidence needs to be available to all because evidence is a universal thing. Either there is evidence of something or there isn&#39;t. The pyramids of the different civilizations around the world are <strong>obvious evidence</strong>. Anyone can see them, even if they dont have access to the Internet. The point is that the evidence is available to all, and that means that the possibility to see them is there, because they obviously exist and they can be seen on the platform that anyone can access: the internet.</p>

<p>The possibility of being able to view the evidence is the key to obvious evidence. It is possible that if those people without internet get internet that they can see pictures of the pyramids. Even if the country restricts access, the possibility is still there if they can find a way around thst restriction.</p>

<p>Connection making and using logic are the 2 most important things to actually discovering the <strong>actual</strong>, objective truth because those things themselves are based in objectivity and do not take subjectivity into account. They are not based on experience, but are based on obvious evidence, whether that obvious evidence be in the form of concepts (possibility/impossibility, existence/nonexistence, etc.), or in tangible things (pyramids, water erosion, angles, geometric design, etc.)</p>

<p>Denying obvious evidence is insanity and should be exposed for what it is wherever possible. The goal of my posts, wherever they come up, is to expose insanity and show and explain as much as I possibly can within reason both why/how these things (posts, beliefs, actions, etc.) are insanity and why/how the things I am posting are objective and cannot be argued with because they are not arguments, opinions, or beliefs.</p>

<p>The world is run and ruled by insanity, in so many different forms, and this will inevitably end, because the nightmare&#39;s time is up. </p>

<p>So please read my standalone comment in this thread and then all of the links I have linked in that comment.</p>

I mean his <em>sourcing</em> is even a wealth of information. You will likely be able to find more source material for your research just going through his notes.</p>

<p><a href="https://infrakshun.wordpress.com/article-series-chronological/">Infrakshun Article Index</a></p>

<p>Here is his commentary on the subject area germaine to what you seem to be looking for-</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Part VI: Establishment Dynamics: Posts: 105 – 177</p>

<p>An exploration of the Nazi-occult influences working in the United States today including the CIA’s involvement with programs of mind control targeted against the American population and the existence of military occult homosexual sex rings; prostitution and child rape networks is also discussed. The presence of existential Satanism in society and at the highest levels of government is also explored.</p>

<p>We next to turn to the occult roots and the evolution of its presence in the United Nations and the highly influential strains of the occult and New Age Movement within its agencies. The Lucis Trust, the nature of its beliefs and its related affiliations will come under particular focus.</p>

<p>Occult precepts of world revolution and its origins are reviewed with attention given to the era of Enlightenment or “Age of Reason.” Parallel to this, the now popular mythology of Illuminism and how it relates to the Establishment world stage in the 21st Century is also highlighted. The French Revolution and its genesis is analysed in this context and the evolution of Elite belief thereafter.</p>

<p>This section further outlines the some of the historical roots which inform the current frameworks of a global totalitarianism or “World State” of psychopathy, otherwise known as Pathocracy.</p>

<p>We run through all the main players most likely to have a hand in its genesis. A detailed look at each of these organisations and groups is followed by a basic extrapolation of their ideas and the roles they play on the national and international scene.</p>

<p>The ideas and ideologies underlying pathocratic conquest and social engineering are reviewed in the US and Britain and the emergence of their designs in many fields of geo-political policy. The convergence of capitalism and collectivism; the 4Cs (commercialisation, consolidation centralisation and control) and the evolution and application of their belief systems.</p>

<p>The purpose of social engineering in economics (corporatism and collectivism dichotomy) and the use of the “scientific technique” in society up to the present day, is reviewed and its marriage to “new-genics” in contemporary society.</p>

<p>Planned Parenthood, UNESCO origins and the geopolitical tool of “food as a weapon” agribusiness and uses of genetic engineering under the umbrella term of the “Green Revolution” are also analysed. Genetically modified organisms, (GMO) play a huge part in the game-plan of psychopaths in power and we look at what they hope to achieve under the guise of philanthropy and “feeding the World.”</p>

<p>The hijacking of the green movement and environmental activism by eco-fascistic principles and a form of “eco-Intelpro” is reviewed and its history and origins in British and German royalty and the Anglo-American establishment. We appraise how a fusion of authoritarianism, corporatism and eco-fascist ideology has infiltrated the United Nations and many environmental organisations and institutions.</p>

<p>We look at how eco-fascism has been updated and applied in present day politics, activism, economics and green agendas such as sustainability, agenda 21 and climate change science.</p>

<p>This is followed by a detailed look into the rise of SMART-Surveillance society (SSS); UN Agenda 21 and Sustainable development, as well as an exploration of a rising technocracy under the steerage of transhumanism and its influence within government, military and society as a whole. The concept of a fusion between the occult and transhumanism as an alchemical metaphor for elite designs is introduced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Residual evidence often exists because people shift with their old memories in place. So, dude in timeline A saw Dolly with braces.

<p>Maybe it&#39;s a glitch in the matrix. Many scientists have also said it&#39;s possible that we live in a simulation. Maybe it&#39;s breaking down.</p>

<p>What version of the bible? Was it in greek? English? King&#39;s james, the catholic one? It is a thousand years old book that was translated by thousands of people from basically any language to any language and of course there are a lot of differences on these versions, one of the biggest part of theology courses is to study these differences</p>

<p>And are you saying that the textual description of &quot;animal and lamb&quot; changed but the images of it have not?</p>

<p>So why does both the geographical orientation, all maps and all textual description on how japan and south america has changed simultaneously?</p>

<p>Bible: If it&#39;s the same bible that changes then it doesn&#39;t matter which version, does it? The physical book changed. However, the Bible MEs that I&#39;m familiar with are KJV because that&#39;s the book I learned. </p>

<p>Did you Google what I suggested? That answers those questions.</p>

<p>Maps: No idea what you are asking. The maps I&#39;ve known for several decades no longer exist except for in obscure residual evidence. If we learned from bad texts or maps then where are they? They no longer exist. </p>

<p>Your memory examples are not analogous because these are not isolated incidences of memory lapse that occur periodically to one person at a time. These are mass memories based on specific and meaningful life experiences.</p>

<p>Take the Zapruder film. Any decent conspiracy researcher watched that film in slo-mo, reverse, pause, etc. We studied that film. It was black and white, 4 people, from a different angle, less gory, there was no glass divider and Nellie&#39;s window didn&#39;t mysteriously disappear. That&#39;s what these memories are.

<p>The maps were good, we simply didn&#39;t payed attention to the specific shape of things and our mind registered it in a simplified way, in those examples, south america being directly south of north america (a misconception i never had since i knew about the differences in timezones) or japan having less isles than reality</p>

<p>No memories are real, by definition they are a reflection of a real event that got registered in our brain, our brain discards and distort parts of the memory all the time</p>

<p>You should read The Quantum and the Lotus. It&#39;s a conversation between a Buddhist monk and an astrophysicist. Not only will you learn about quantum physics but you&#39;ll also learn how to treat people. </p>

<p>FWIW, I&#39;ve found that specific book suggestions are better than just insulting someone&#39;s intelligence. Especially when you use the word &quot;payed&quot;. Or is that a Mandela Effect :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before you start reading on the &#39;alternate theories&#39; on how memory works, the buddhist lotus and whatever, you should also read how most scientists believe it actually works</p>

<p>To you know, being able to compare the theories and learning in a broader spectrum beyond the things you already believe</p>

<p>Actually the way i used &quot;payed&quot; or &quot;from your mind&quot; instead of &quot;from memory&quot; and all these english errors are a very example of the way or brain builds these misconceptions and why it is simply a mind-bug and not a &quot;world shift into an alternate dimension where a bond characters had different teeth&quot;</p>

<p>I am not a native english speaker, in the language i use in my day to day when we want to reference things we refer to things differently (like &quot;i payed attention&quot; instead of &quot;i was paying attention&quot;) and since i never learned english in a school or textbook or anything like that, my brain tought that &quot;payed attention&quot; is a valid term and will keep using it, in my mind i even have some memories of other people using &quot;payed attention&quot; but thinking about it now it may be that these people were simply as wrong as i was or that i am actually remembering things wrong, since i can&#39;t remember any of these specific people and can&#39;t fact-check</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will agree that you seem to have a poor memory. Just based on some of the things you have shared it sounds like it affects both short and long term memories. </p>

<p>For example, you already forgot the part about the astrophysicist co-author. That sort of memory loss would make life difficult and I am proud of you for making it this far. </p>

<p>Especially considering that you are unwilling to educate yourself because of it. For example, a quick Google search would indicate that prior to becoming a monk the other author was a molecular biologist. That&#39;s 2 people with more science in their pinkies than you&#39;ll ever have in wherever you store memories.</p>

<p>But please understand not everyone suffers as you do. Many of us have both strong memories and a willingness to learn new information. And that explains why some people experience the ME and some don&#39;t. </p>

<p>With that, thanks for the conversation. Please don&#39;t forget to have the last word :) </p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neuroscience-Exploring-Mark-Bear-PhD/dp/0781778174/">Neuroscience: exploring the brain</a> is a very good textbook about the &quot;circuitry&quot; of the brain</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013">Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning</a> is a very layman directed read and is more about &quot;how to remember more things when studying&quot; but it have some good explanations on why some memories are &quot;clear&quot;, some are &quot;diffuse&quot; and some memories fade out</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sinauer.com/the-neurobiology-of-learning-and-memory-724.html">The Neurobiology of Learning and Memory</a> offers an integration between the neuroscience of memory and some behavorial analisys, it also have some very interesting topics on the plasticity of our mind</p>

<p>they educate their own in the center of this system, passing down the &#39;secret knowledge&#39; - which is likely how to keep the money coming in and the slaves from getting away</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the philosophy.  I think it is important to dissect on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>You mention Scientology.  Ron L Hubbard, its founder, was formerly a science fiction novelist.  There have been many whistleblowers that speak out against Scientology.  There are also connections to Scientology taking action against people who speak out against them.  Reports of nefariousness at the higher levels.</p>

<p>Correct me if I am wrong but I take it that your philosophy is that is all disinformation from the cabal to make us discredit Scientology.  For me, I need evidence that the cabal is involved.  I keep an open mind to it.</p>

<p>Mormonism is stigmatized as well.  Does that mean the cabal wants us to discredit them too?  Mormonism is quite different from Scientology.  I think that Mormonism does not teach people to trust themselves but rather to trust God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as Scientology, I didn&#39;t take extensive notes when I was researching so I&#39;d have to go back if anyone wanted citations, but the general gist I got was that Hubbard was being &quot;pursued&quot; in his later years.  </p>

<p>He was always on the move either in a boat, out at sea, or in a travel trailer when on land.  He felt he needed to be mobile for some reason.  I can&#39;t say exactly what was going through his mind, but the behavior sure looks like somebody wouldn&#39;t let him get comfortable in one spot. (Here&#39;s an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6TRCgJ2HkY">interesting video</a> about &quot;battles of will&quot; and making the other guy &quot;move&quot;).</p>

<p>In my opinion, it&#39;s pretty clear who was after Hubbard.  The US Government was not too happy about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White">Operation Snow White</a>.  After that happened they had no choice but to <a href="http://www.rense.com/general41/coverup.htm">counter-infiltrate</a> Scientology not only the institution, but again, in my opinion, his <em>mind</em>. </p>

<p>I think the Deep State/Cabal/Shadow also had a hand in derailing all the other &quot;Spiritual&quot; leaders around that time like the resistance out in Oregon to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneesh">Osho Rajneesh</a> and many others.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know too much about Mormonism.  The only thing I&#39;ve read recently was this passage in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conversations-Nostradamus-Prophecies-Explained-Vol/dp/0922356017">Conversations with Nostradamus</a> who everybody thinks is talking about Joseph Smith:</p>

<p>&quot;He says a minor event this quatrain refers to as well, is an event that has already taken place. In the early 19th century there was a man who came into possession of some Egyptian documents of ancient times that were discovered in some tombs. And this man had a trace of psychic ability. Through this he gave an interpretation of these documents that was partially correct and partially incorrect. But he used this interpretation of these documents in the founding of a new Christian sect Some of the beliefs of this sect disagreed with the prevailing beliefs at the time and made the followers of this sect very suspect. For they seemed to be looking at some things backwards from what the theologians at the time assumed they should be, based upon the Bible, since these followers were also going by the information obtained from these Egyptian documents. He simply mentioned this as a minor event that this quatrain also described. History moves in spirals.&quot;</p>

<p>This above was part of the translation of Quatrain VII-14:</p>

<p>He will come to expose the false topography,
the urns of the tombs will be opened.
Sect and holy philosophy to thrive,
black for white and the  new for the old.</p>

But you have to read in between the lines on all these things (especially Blavatsky- who is intentionally difficult to understand).  Don&#39;t take it too literal.</p>

<p>The mysteries are represented in every order, society and religion.  You, as an &quot;initiate&quot; are told a narrative, and as you complete the tasks to move to the next level the metaphor changes meaning and components are added to help unlock the mysteries.  The reality of this is that 2 fold and meta.  It is taking advantage of our psychology and subconscious to help unlock keys that we don&#39;t have direct access to.  It also brings you closer to the group- because one of the secrets of humanity is that we are social animals and can accomplish more together than on our own (but that&#39;s where macro cosoms and microcosms come into play- how we affect our universe).</p>

<p>The secrets are about the self, the society, and hierarchies and systems structures that are present throughout all of nature and how they can be used to control ourselves, others and our environs.  The &quot;natural order&quot;.  They both free us an impose strictures on us- rules which can be broken.  The secrets and mysteries are not for the vulgar- they are kept close in order to manage the inherent chaos.  (see guild societies.  Masonry uses the best practices of building as a metaphor for the spiritual and physical realms, while teaching the TRADE- as valuable commodity, to its adherents.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a false paradigm in this sub as to the nature of the elite. So many people believe that they have some kind of secret spiritual power and knowledge that allows them to control the world, and they think these things because the elite have deliberately sewed these beliefs into the minds of the &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; who are also conditioned by so many other beliefs that the elite have sewed into their minds as well. </p>

<p>The elite have no secret or special spiritual power or knowledge, and in face completely lost track as a continually changing group of true spirtuality millenia ago, which is how far back this group comes from.</p>

<p>The elite of today know a few things most of humanity does not, and that&#39;s the technology the negative et&#39;s have given them and the verified existence of these negative ets.
But most of humanity by now, at least has a suspicion thst aliens do indeed exist and so many know that they constantly visit this planet and are in the skies all around the world every day. </p>

<p>The one secret thing that matters most that the elite know, however, that essentially almost every other human does not know, is the existence of a &quot;mythical&quot; place that they stem from and that they have done everything in their power to hide and keep secret this place&#39;s existence, including debunking, devaluing, discrediting, and ultimately fictionalizing it. </p>

<p>This place is Atlantis.</p>

<p>This place was very very very very real and is the most important topic anyone, including everyone on this sub (<strong><em>especially this sub</em></strong>), should be talking about. Atlantis is the absolute key to destroying the system of control of the elite that runs through every aspect of life here on earth. That is because the system can only operate if people believe the narrative of reality the elite have created over time, and there are many aspects of this narrative, many even contradictory, but all serving the same purpose: to control and oppress humanity and to spread and propagate as much negativity as possible while still keeping a large populace alive to control and do negative things to.</p>

<p>This is because they thrive and feed off of continual negativity and if they simply killed everyone that continual negativity would end and they absolutely do not want that. </p>

<p>Their narrative and their system are based around both perpetuating/propagating negativity, and keeping the existence of Atlantis as secret, hidden, and &quot;fictional&quot; as possible. </p>

<p>Atlantis is where the elite first rose to power and it is the one thing that can and will destroy their narrative of reality, and thus destroying their system of control. The rediscovery of Atlantis will annihilate theor narrative of history, and that will spread to literally everything else because people will understand that everything else about their narrative is fabricated and/or distorted too. That includes religion, &quot;science&quot;, economics, government, and psychology. </p>

<p>Once the narrative is destroyed then the world will finally be free once and for all from the elite&#39;s negative system of control and negativity in general. Negativity is not the natural state of things and the world will return to the pure positivity that was once the norm in Atlantis.</p>

<p>I explain everything about Atlantis in the thread and comments I have made that I will link to. This includes why it was real, the connections between everything that absolutely show its real, the connections between everything that point to just how incredibly, mind bogglingly advanced they were in every way, the connections between everything that show why and how the elite became negative and slowly created the system of today, <strong>why the elite are not &quot;spiritual&quot; in any way, and finally what everyone on this sub **needs</strong> to do to actually change the world for the better.</p>

<p>This is my thread that goes into detail about Atlantis, all of those things i just mentioned in the previous paragraph, and ultimately its connection/importance to defeating the elite and their global control system <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">here</a>. All of that continues in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixn93/">this</a> comment, and in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixo60/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">this</a> comment that continues the first comment. <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbkbysz/">This</a> comment goes into Atlantis, the elite, secret societies, and spiritual initiates, all things that are important to understand Atlantis, and how there is a lie that the elite are somehow &quot;spiritually&quot; minded.</strong> (&lt;-- <em>This one is particularly important for this thread since there is a false running belief that the elite are somehow involved with &quot;spirituality&quot;, even if it is &quot;dark&quot; or negative.</em>) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nmxg4/mysterious_10000_year_old_underwater_ruins_in/dcdga4q/">This</a> comment explains why the &quot;comet&quot; theory of Atlantis&#39; destruction is false and it explains how Atlantis absolutely would have been destroyed, and it also goes into why cyclical rising and lowering of human consciousness is false as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all has to do with evidence. Evidence needs to be obvious and it needs to be possible for everyone to be able to access it, so it essentially needs to be available to everyone. I am going to write a thread on this showing and explaining it in complete detail as to why this is absolutely the case, but the fact of the matter is that the obvious evidence for Atlantis is there in great quantities and the connections between everything need to made and logic needs to be used to sequence these connections in the correct order, which means the order in which things could possibly happen. The possibility of things happening comes from obvious evidence. There is obvious evidence for everything I have talked about regarding Atlantis, the elite, etc. The impossibility of things happening comes from the lack of obvious evidence. </p>

<p>There are so many different connections and factors to take into consideration that it is pointless at this tme to go into literally everything in detail. There will come a time for that, but not now. </p>

<p>Beliefs do not take everything into account (the obvious evidence, all of the connections, and the logic needed to order the connections correctly), and so are not based in reality. Reality is what is real and what exists, and the obvious evidence is the proof of what exists, but connections and logic are necessary in order to use that evidence to prove the existence of larger things, like Atlantis, without direct lots of direct obvious evidence of the thing itself (the majority of the ruins of Atlantis itself). </p>

<p>Those 3 things are objective and they do not take into consideration subjectivity. They have to do with reality itself, and while some perceptions of reality would have to be accurate perceptions of the way reality actually is, not all are accurate because perceptions change, therefore subjectivity ( perecptions,  beliefs, opinions, feelings, attitutudes) cannot be used to gauge reality. </p>

<p>Almost everyone in this sub uses subjectivity to gauge realiy and that is something that needs to, and ultimately will change because subjectivity changes, and if subjectivity determined reality, then reality would itself ultimately break because subjectivity can contradict itself, which would make reality contradict itself and when things like existence and non existence, or possibility and impossibility collide, reality breaks.</p>

<p>And this hasn&#39;t happened yet and isn&#39;t happening, so to use a logical shortcut (because it&#39;s pointless at this time to go into detail about this), it will never happen. So therefore subjectivity does not determine reality, so using subjectivity to gauge reality is essentially insanity, because it is positing that one&#39;s own subjectivity is the key to understanding reality. When you understand reality, you are determining what it is. Subjectivity changes all the time so that would mean that your understanding of reality would constantly change too.</p>

<p>Therefore you would be insane, because your grip on reality would be gone, because in order to have a grip on reality, reality needs to be solid and unchanging, because you need to be able to anchor your existence onto something that does not ultimately threaten your existence. Your existence, for the purposes of this post, is your life here on earth, and if reality is constantly changing, then your existence is unstable, and thus will itself change. Changes in your existence that stem from a changing reality will be continual and ultimately never ending because subjectivity is always changing. Continual change, when it comes to your existence here on earth, can never have a positive outcome and can only lead to negativity. And this negativity will continue until you stop trying to gauge reality with subjectivity. </p>

<p>This applies to almost every human on earth and this will inevitably happen. Atlantis will be rediscovered, this subreddit will be the heart behind its rediscovery, the system of the elite will be destroyed, we will be united as one civilization once again, and we will finally be united as one planet. </p>

<p>The stars are the limit from there, and I go into et&#39;s and their extremely important involvement in building a global civilization just like how Atlantis was, and then becoming interstellar. I haven&#39;t, and I won&#39;t go into what will happen after the et&#39;s help us reform and restructure civilization, because thst is jumping the gun and I honestly have no wish to find out right now. </p>

<p>My goal, and this sub&#39;s goal, is to change the world for the better, not to postulate on what&#39;s going to happen after we&#39;ve done that. </p>

<p>My sub goal, is to change this sub, and that goal will be achieved, so there are no worries and no worries means no pressure. Objectivity allows you to understand that subjectivity is just as important, and subjectivity includes prioritizing things beyond the absolutely essential, like keeping good relationships with your family if you live with them, or eating, or sleeping, etc.</p>

<p>So I get to prioritize my life and I understand that because reality is unchanging, my subjectivity does not determine it, therefore I am not panicked into trying to convince people of the insanity that I am stuck in by believing my subjectivity determines reality. </p>

<p>This is what every single person that believes this does, they all try to convince the others of their insanity, and some agree on some parts of a shared form of insanity, and most others disagree. In fact even those people that agree, will inevitably disagree because subjectivity is always changing, even if in tiny degrees. </p>

<p>Pretty much everyone on this sub is constantly doing this, and since everyone here is already heavily questioning what they&#39;ve been told reality is, they are even more susceptible to insanity because their subjectivity is being used to determine an already unstable reality, so it creates even more constant change in their existence, and this enhanced constant change multiplies the negativity in one&#39;s life.</p>

<p>But on the flip side since they&#39;re heavily questioning what they&#39;ve been told reality is, they are less entrenched in the narrative of reality of the elite and thus it is the ideal place (along with the fact that this is the most concentrated and organized place of people like this on the internet) to begin the process of changing the world. All that is needed is to change the sub itself first.</p>

<p>That is where you and the others who respond to my comments come in. You are directly interacting with me, so I know that you have at least read some of what I have read and have actually internalized it enough to form a response. That means that you&#39;re more likely to remember it than those who simply upvote. Since you&#39;re more likely to remember what I have written, you are more likely to think about it and possibly come back and reread it again. The more you think about it and reread it, the more you will be able to understand it and eventually you will understand it, and once you understand it, you&#39;ll be able to appreciate it. By seeing the evidence of this everywhere, you&#39;ll start to appreciate it and that is the key turning point.</p>

<p>Once you appreciate it <strong>that</strong> is when you will actually feel the desire to spread it and the things on Atlantis, and you&#39;ll feel the desire to post your own posts about these things in the same way thst I have, with the same points that I have made, because you will understand and appreciate that they are objective.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;re posting on Atlantis and these things, then you&#39;ll finally start to have the desire to get others to do so as well, and once others are at the same place you are, then everyone will then desire to and eventually get involved with rediscovering Atlantis in the ways I outline in my original thread on Atlantis. </p>

<p>That will be the beginning of the end of the system of the elite and all it takes is for you to reply, and then (which I&#39;m asking you to do now), think about what I&#39;ve wrote and reread it (preferably as many times as you can until you actually understand it).</p>

<p>So thank you for replying and contributing to changing the world (even before you actually start doing all of those things)!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t condescending since it doesn&#39;t attack anyone and isn&#39;t negative. It simply highlights the false paradigm that is the collection of beliefs that this sub had regarding the elite&#39;s ritualistic practices. </p>

<p>The point is that this needs to be immediately called out since this entire thread is based around propagating and feeding this paradigm and the only way to destroy the false paradigm is to announce its existence first and foremost and then move on to what is more important so that people become temporarily detached enough from these beliefs to ingest and internalize the more important information, and then once the more important information has been internalized, then the reason why this paradigm is false and its connection to the more important information is given, to offer a complete package that guides the reader along a specifically laid out path to help them understand and aporeciate, to whatever initial capacity they are able to do so, the topics involved.</p>

<p>Logic involves the sequencing of different things in the correct order, and in this case to achieve the desired result. The correct order, objective possibility, and obvious evidence go into psychology and conditioninf, and there is so much of it that it&#39;s pointless to get into right now, just like the other things.</p>

<p>Logic is used to write everything that I write, and this post is no different. </p>

<p>In order to actually rid the world of belief, there must be firmness and essentially no pussy footing around, like suggesting that something might not be true and/or that something is true. I the closest I have ever come to this is in my original thread on Atlantis by saying this most likely would be the case, because of course I desired to reintroduce what Atlantis would have actually been like since there have either not been a post that long and in detail about Atlantis in a long time or ever.</p>

<p>When you reintroduce the topic that has not been discussed in a long time, people aren&#39;t as open to it and everything about it initially, because there is no familiarity between it and the medium of discussion, aka this sunreddit. It seems somewhat out of place to many people because they have become used to engaging in &quot;political&quot; posts or negative posts in general. Atlantis is a purely positive thing. The elite that rose to power in Atlantis are what was negative about it, and their system is but an indirect extension of their own negativity. </p>

<p>Combine this focus on negativity coinciding with the different forms of insanity that I explained and with the fictionalization of Atlantis by the elite, and this creates a situation where to immediately dive into the topic full steam would be far more inefficient and counterproductive. </p>

<p>Logic determines prioritizing and reintroducing the topic in a way that doesn&#39;t create more negativity and further insanity (by causing people to react negatively to the post, thus externalizating their subjective beliefs with negative emotion and words.) Is more important than immediately going into the topic without small condolences to people&#39;s beliefs (saying &quot;it almost assuredly, almost certainly , etc.).</p>

<p>About upvotes, they are only important because first and foremost they raise awareness of my post and influence more people to read it, and then secondly because it provides a small gauge of how people receive the post. </p>

<p>Downvotes show me that there are people whose beliefs and essentially insanity (<em>reread my comment about evidence that you replied to</em>) hold a far stronger sway over them than those who did not downvote. Upvotes show me that there are people who are at least understanding some of what I am saying enough to appreciate it in a small way. Many of those upvotes come from people who don&#39;t understand much but that some of their beliefs happen to have  a connection to what I am saying or at least parts of what I am saying.</p>

<p>Comments are far more valuable and I have already explained why. They provide a springboard to bounce off of and further address more beliefs and insanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why firmness and a heads on approach is absolutely necessary. The only reason someone wouldn&#39;t drink the water would be because of conditioning, and the only way to get rid of the conditioning is to first expose it for what it is, and expose every bit of it again and again because repetition breaks down any and all barriers and is one of the most crucial tools we have. </p>

<p>That means that I will not stop, and I will not ever stop, but of course dealing with outliers (particularly conditioned people), there is of course a limit, because it becomes unreasonable to scream and jump up any longer. Helping one person understand and appreciate these things does not matter, helping the entire sub is what matters.</p>

<p>But as I&#39;ve said in some of my other posts, when you actually objectively know the actual objective truth, then you will never stop, because you know the truth, and when you know the truth, you understand and appreciate that everyone else is under false pretenses and beliefs, and that repetition is the most crucial tool. </p>

<p>Posting numerous threads and comments, showing and explaining as much as you possibly can within reason (those outliers) to help as many people understand and appreciate what you are talking about. </p>

<p>So look for more of me, because I am going nowhere and this sub will be changed, and the world after that.</p>

<p>Prior, I knew a lot of what you said about Atlantis but it wasn&#39;t enough to awaken me to the establishment.  I thought that perhaps the government suppressed &quot;forbidden archaeology&quot; and ETs because it would cause societal chaos if the truth got out.  I was naive in trusting the government at the time.</p>

humans are very powerful creatures / animals, we have the power to create like no other being as yet known on this earth. if you can get a large enough group of us together and under the right conditions....  there is no limit to what we can create.  it takes work and practice, and usually the best way is to have a righteous leader/channel-er. to shape the idea. then the group can combine power and make the idea a reality.  nothing is beyond possibility anything can be created.. the only boundary is imagination this is the reason we are kept divided and conquered and why we are not allowed to have leaders who are of any quality whatsoever.   if a good enough leader comes along he will be killed immediately.   this is why every MP / politician has to be so bad.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s a lot of parallels here. Manipulation of public opinion, unstable geopolitical climate(Russia and America end up uniting), and the sociological effects of the internet leading to Stand Alone Complexes(collectives that rally behind an individual. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some elite have a rich royal history that goes back thousands of years. Like everyone, they crave fame, fortune and knowledge. However they have mastered a system for all 3 and are so conditioned to the sacrifices it takes to get all 3 that they don&#39;t care about the impure humans they step over to obtain it. They share their knowledge with other elitists and allow them to join the club......</p>

<p>The illuminati is essentially the knowledge, fame and fortune that one obtains by manipulating the rest of humanity. </p>

<p>With that said, knowledge was the topic at hand so let&#39;s put it this way. They know the various dimensions of existence...physical, astral etc. They know of other alien species in the physical realm and they also know of spiritual entities in the astral realm. They have communication with both. </p>

<p>They also know the history of our world. How religion is used to manipulate people. They know that some humans are born without a soul and are much easier to control. Mkultra programming for example. I believe a lot of these shootings domestically stem from this program. They consider these people empty vessels that can be manipulated fairly easily. They know that humans who have a soul can be controlled by highjacking the pineal gland. They do that with fluoride for example and the mainstream media. </p>

<p>As for pedophilia, this is also a practice that goes back thousands of years. They abide by spiritual laws not physical ones so they don&#39;t consider age the number when attracting a child. A child also represent youth and purity. They can have their holy trinity of fame, fortune and wealth but they will never get back their youth. That&#39;s why the attraction is so great. Time exists in the physical realm and aging cannot be controlled. At the end, death is a step for everyone. However, they have come to realize that the blood and organs of children are extremely nutritious and pure and can supply vast amounts of vitamins, minerals, cofactors, immune factors etc. to extend their life without consequence. Children don&#39;t contribute much to society so they can be easily disposed. </p>

<p>What else? Antarctica... just one of many sacred places on the planet for origins of life, storage of technologies and extraterrestrial communication. </p>

<p>Remember they also have security. Underground bases, seed vaults. All of these allow them protection just in case everything goes to hell. Even the planet can be accessed internally.
Hollow earth is a very real deal.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t believe they have. Time travel abilities, immortality, reptilian shape shifting and communications with God or Satan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m completely serious.  The book is a <em>complete lie</em>, created to keep you from ever understanding the truth.  There is no deep truth to it, only poorly crafted fictions that bind you in ignorance and darkness.  The idea that you even need a savior was created <em>by</em> Satan.  God created man perfect, knowing full well everything man would ever do, so there was never a possible way to sin against him.  It is a trick of the devil that you need to be &quot;saved&quot; for failing god in some way.  That cannot possibly ever happen.  The bible is the word of <em>Satan</em>, designed to fool you into worshiping him while believing you are worshipping a weak, watered down version of god.  Do you think the god who creates a trillion universes every second is a petty, jealous creature who cares deeply what you do with your sexual organs and get upset when you don&#39;t worship him?  No.  That&#39;s not god.  That&#39;s some pathetic vapor trying to trick you into thinking it&#39;s god.  </p>

<p>God has no need of any Bible, which is easily lost and destroyed.  Think about it, if you blasted off in a spaceship without it and the earth were consumed by the sun (which will happen in a few billion years), where would the bible be?  Gone <em>forever</em>.  It could never be recreated.  It&#39;s not eternal, it&#39;s flimsy, weak, easily destroyed.  We could have a global book burning tonight and destroy every last copy right here, forever, if we so chose.  What kind of &quot;word of god&quot; is so fragile?  No alien civilization will ever have a copy of it, either, it&#39;s purely human-centered.  It exists only because it was written by men who heard the devil whispering to them and they didn&#39;t know enough of the incredible power of the universe to understand what is and isn&#39;t god.  </p>

<p>The <em>true</em> word of god is written directly into the cosmos itself.  You learn of god by studying the reality around you and then through direct communication with divinity.  No matter where you are in the universe, the <em>true</em> word of god is there to discover by studying nature itself, and by communing with the real god that created not just this universe, but an infinite number of universes.  The confused and rambling words of men who prayed to demons for earthly blessings is not going to &quot;save&quot; you from anything, even if one of its &#39;prophets&#39; once said to be nice to each other.  The true god doesn&#39;t do cheap magic trick, turning water into wine when nobody is looking.  The true god creates quantum mechanics, where true and false can defy logic by coexisting at once.  Now <em>that</em> is a fucking magic trick.  That&#39;s <em>unthinkably amazing</em>. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve been led astray.  You can choose to continue, God will not stop you, but if you do you will end up in a hell you have created for yourself.  Not because god punishes you, not because you have sinned or even could sin, but merely because you refuse to seek and discover the truth.  Not a fake truth.  Not something that says &quot;thou shalt not test me&quot; like a con artist&#39;s game.  I mean the <em>real</em> truth.   Find the god who says &quot;test me a million times, and I will never fail you even once, then test me a million more and again not once will your prayers not be answered.&quot;  Such a god really does exist, and if you seek him, and never give up, eventually you will find a truth beyond anything you currently understand that word to mean.  </p>

<p>The hieroglyphs on the pyramids have been unchanged for thousands of years <em>longer</em> than any scripture you have ever read, so what does that say?  Are the egyptian gods more real to you because their writing has lasted longer that yours?  That isn&#39;t how the truth works.</p>

<p>Many of the &quot;prophecies&quot; of nostradamus are fulfilled, does that make him divine?  Here, I will make a prophecy now:  Somebody will respond to my comments.  Am I using powerful magic?</p>

<p>No, it just means if you say something and wait long enough sometimes things will happen.  In fact, if you know in advance what is supposed to happen, then people will attempt to go make them come true.  That isn&#39;t how truth works, or even how prediction works.</p>

<p>The devil has tricked you into thinking that vague handwaving is truth.  Want a true prediction of the future?  Go ask science where the planets will be ten thousand years from now.  They&#39;ll give you the exact positions, down to the millimeter.  Is that prophecy?  </p>

I grew up steeped in it&#39;s lies and was always unsatisfied with how obviously fake it is, and how obviously evil and demonic the god of abraham is, how it murder is condoned, how it kills it&#39;s own &quot;children&quot; on a whim, how it&#39;s solutions to problems are ham-fisted and inelegant, how it&#39;s followers call themselves merciful while showing no mercy to anyone but themselves, how they seek nothing but earthly blessings and riches while telling others that seeking such things is evil.  How could a supposedly good philosophy create such evil with such ease?  Have you ever met a person more judgemental than a supposed follower of Christ who says to not ever judge?  How could it be so easy to corrupt?  Maybe it was <em>meant</em> to be corrupt.  So I reread the bible, with the hypothesis that the god of abraham is a demon who came to trick mankind, and suddenly every story made sense!  Now it became clear why every act it takes is one of cruelty, and ignorance.  </p>

<p>Then I went to seek the truth.  And then I <em>found</em> the truth and I was utterly blown away by how utterly wonderful it truly is!  The truth isn&#39;t about fortune telling and future predicting or saving you from demons who want to devour you in hell or worshiping monsters or rules for how you can use your body or what you can eat.  The truth is about the adventure of life, about the exploration of reality, of yourself, of the celebration of living matter, of the math of the cosmos, of an understanding of the perfection and beauty of reality itself.  The truth is amazing, and enlightening.  Seek it and you will forever be free of these cobwebs of ignorance that cloud your sight and bind your mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God&#39;s prophecies are not hit or miss. One test of a prophet being from God was whether any prophecies failed. If so, they were not from God. Below read about passages in Isaiah fulfilled by JESUS, written hundreds of years before His coming and documented in the New Testament gospels. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to fulfill a prophecy when you know what is expected of you, isn&#39;t it?  Especially when you get to rewrite your own story to fit the facts.  I can make up a story of a man who lived 100 years ago just like the authors of the gospels did, and I can make it match perfectly any prophecy you have available.  But let&#39;s forget that.  Let&#39;s pretend the very people writing about Jesus saw him in the flesh.</p>

<p>Do you know how many religions have such prophecy that has been &quot;fulfilled&quot;?  The answer is ALL of them.  If prophecy coming true is your metric then all ancient religions are true.  ThatMs not how it works.  Why would the prophecy of the devil coming true mean anything about God?  The devil wrote the Bible, every word of it, so all you are saying is that the deception continues for more than just a single instant.  So what?  It is still deception.</p>

<p>Making predictions isn&#39;t a sign of goodness, it&#39;s just a sign that you can either calculate what is coming, or you can replicate what has been prophesied, and neither of those requires the power of God.  Physics makes predictions about the universe <em>billions</em> and even <em>trillions</em> of years into the future.  Are they using the power of God to do this?  In fact, science makes <em>exact</em> predictions, out to 18 decimal places, leaving no room for interpretation.  Can the Bible even come close to this?  No, it&#39;s all all poetry and guess work that must be interpreted to be applied.</p>

<p>Fortune telling isn&#39;t godly.  You&#39;ve been tricked into believing that it is by the dark one.  Turn away from mystical prophecy and seek the <em>immediate</em> truth.  Mystic hand waving is how the devil keeps you wandering in circles in the fog.  Seek the God who can tell you <em>now</em>, right now, everything you ever wanted to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main bit of knowledge is centered around human sacrifice and evolution.</p>

<p>Essentially there is a calculable formula that tells you the rate of global population expansion x societal restlessness. This formula will tell you that, say, 10% of the new growth must be culled each year to prevent disorder.</p>

<p>It will also tell you that through each interation of the species, we evolve and improve in some way. As we evolve, there will come a day when we no longer require idolatry to function, and many participate in rule &amp; order.</p>

<p>Lastly, the eventual state of man is to live as a global species. In harmony all over the world. On earth, as in heaven (shared knowledge). However this will bring an end to their power.</p>

<p>This can be witnessed in the Mayan calendar (IMO), who predicted the need to record time would stop in 2012.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t that was really that far off, as populations around the globe are able to create harmony and peace, globally, in ways which were simply not possible even just a few years before.</p>

<p>This global peace harmony and unity will essentially unlock the secrets to all creation, and destruction. The Big Bang will become replicatable. All understandings of matter and physics as today will be like that of the wheel &amp; papyrus. Matter will lose all its secrets.</p>

<p>The confusion of man, and the desire to be lead as a drone, are the enemies of advancing civilation and their tools of order. Human sacrifice (war) is the only way to trap man within this premitive state, of not evolving. The sacrifice will continue until one world government.</p>

<p>The mayans (I believe) witnessed this knowledge and calculated the billions of men that must be burned until we obtained the enlightenment, and it tortured their soul.</p>

<p>The secret of the elite is that each day you are closer to death. Each day is the sacrifice of one day on earth. Given society as a whole, some percent must be sacrificed to maintain order, or the primitive way. The eventual evolution of man is as a new species. We can not join them. The future is within the young.</p>

<p>We must die as barbarians. That is the secrets of the elite. That we are like apes to the dawning man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the knowledge they hold is so great , it serves no purpose hypothesizing what it is. We have to accept that our knowledge is limited by our experiences and those who run the world are limiting our experiences by distracting us with our everyday lives making us to believe we must live like this; go to school , get job make family die. </p>

<p>The knowledge they have is the true meaning of life, the goal , the origin. It can be that there are aliens or other creatures who have an interest in us or that things that we see as immoral is actual seen as good in gods or these creatures eyes.But in the end we cannot deny the idea of god since logic (human logic) always insists that there must be a point of origin from something and it becomes like a paradox with no solution using our brains which are limited in knowledge. AND there&#39;s no solution but to what? overthrow them and try to get the knowledge out of them? what happens if most people are content living in the facade? With the knowledge we have now it doesn&#39;t seem like we&#39;re missing out on much but we&#39;ll never know until we find out for our selves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should definitely check out Mark Passio&#39;s work.  He is a former priest in the church of satan that came to realize what that ideology was really all about (enslavement of humanity) and decided to serve Truth instead.  He is a WEALTH of esoteric, philosophical, etc info as it relates to the subject of the enslavement of humanity and puts out an enormous amount of information that will help you understand WHAT they are up to and WHY they do it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whatonearthishappening.com">www.whatonearthishappening.com</a>   (his website)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/WhatOnEarth93">https://www.youtube.com/user/WhatOnEarth93</a>  (his official YT channel)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnFHbmPeGjTDKLI-l7fhX0A2GGDtR1o6J">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnFHbmPeGjTDKLI-l7fhX0A2GGDtR1o6J</a>   (wonderful YT channel that has all Mark&#39;s podcasts with the slides)</p>

<p>If you are looking for a good conference to attend to really improve your understanding of the general subject you are studying (&quot;why?&quot;), you might want to look here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.freeyourmindconference.com/">http://www.freeyourmindconference.com/</a>   In past years, the conference has had many of the top tier researchers/teachers that others have suggested as speakers (Michael Tsarion is attending this year).  </p>

<p>Finally, here is my attempt at a brief explanation as to WHY the &quot;elites&quot; do what they do:</p>

<p>They recognize the existence of a creator/god/power greater than themselves but their ego is so dominant in their minds that they would rather reject the Love of the creator in favor of &quot;controlling&quot; and &quot;ruling&quot; here on Earth.  The human experience of life is essentially a vehicle for experiencing a form of consciousness and being given the opportunity to understand the higher Self and to raise our consciousness (become closer to Truth).  </p>

<p>The &quot;elites&quot; you seek to understand ARE in fact satanists/luciferians who have decided they would rather reign in hell than serve in heaven.  They reject ANY power as being greater than themselves and think they are entitled to act as they do.  They don&#39;t regard this life here on earth as an opportunity to become closer to the creator.  They see it as a prison/hell and are in fact so self loathing that they seek to destroy all that is good and to make everyone else buy into their warped cosmic view.  </p>

<p>One major problem with this is that due to their acceptance of the false belief that this place is hell they take actions to essentially manifest this here on Earth.  There is nothing that can come to exist in the world that does not first exist as a thought in the mind of man.  In other words, as we think, so we feel, and so we ACT (manifest or make real).  One of the facets of our  consciousness that most don&#39;t understand (although the &quot;elites&quot; understand this VERY well) is that we CO-CREATE our consciousness as a species.  That there is in fact, an epi-consciousness if you will.  </p>

<p>So, if you believe you are in hell on earth and wish to &quot;rule&quot; and you take actions to make this real.....well, guess what, eventually it will appear due to the conditions YOU CREATED OR MADE REAL that you are in fact living in hell on earth.  And that this is a terrible place with terrible people and you &quot;need&quot; to rule them.  See how it works?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, let&#39;s see. I guess I&#39;ll tell you, so that you and the rest in this thread can ignore what I&#39;ve said. Because the truth always gets ignored. The greatest occult secrets are the secrets in plain sight that nobody believes.</p>

<p>There are nonphysical intelligent beings who interact with human beings. They can be contacted. They can be influenced. They have the power to change the law of probablity. Jung called such changes &quot;synchronicity&quot; or &quot;meaningful coincidences.&quot; You can call it luck if you like.</p>

<p>When luck is with you, nothing can stop you, right? Synchronistic events violate the natural order of things, but they can be induced by these nonphysical intelligent beings. That&#39;s how Oprah got to be Oprah, how Bob Dylan got to be Bob Dylan.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t believe? Fine, be that way. Pearls before swine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo, you&#39;re really thinking and you&#39;ve hit the nail on the head with this part...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>groups of people with higher intelligence and knowledge have convened and networked with one another. Naturally, like any species, they do this to </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think to benefit themselves as much as they can. As for secret knowledge? Yes, definitely.</p>

<p>Imo, there are people who have knowledge that gives them an advantage over anyone who doesn&#39;t. They have a more accurate model of how society really works (group level knowledge) and what kind of different people there are, how to tell what type of person someone is by observing them, what makes them (each type) tick.</p>

<p>So they know body language and facial expressions to a very fine level. They can watch the way you act when you&#39;re talking to  other people. They know how to intimidate or guide you just by using combinations of facial expressions, body language and tone of voice. They can read you the same way an experienced fortune teller does. You think you&#39;re gonna put one over on them? They see you coming from a mile away.</p>

<p>If I had to use an analogy for such people, I&#39;d call them Lions. Why? Because they share many similar traits. They&#39;re aggressive, dominant predators. They always operate in family groups. Nobody who isn&#39;t a direct known relative is ever trusted or put in a position of real power.</p>

<p>Like you said, royalty and aristocracy. But that was in the past. After the political changes in Europe a couple of centuries ago, many of these people went underground. They re-emerged as today&#39;s financial, cultural and political elites.</p>

<p>The hereditary titles may not be there anymore. But the exceptionalism, the self-benefit at any cost, the aristocratic attitudes are all still there.</p>

The ones we don&#39;t know about are the ones with power and loyalists. Imagine if a prophet did exist, who is the basis of all religions. Now imagine that prophet having children and them being heavily guarded in order to keep that bloodline from spreading. Imagine if mortal men became terrified of that bloodline and its ability to evolve the human race rapidly. Fear has driven mankind to commit stupider acts. What I&#39;m trying to say is that there are two types of power, but we only see one, because one is hiding from the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My comments regarding the unchanged scriptures were in response to your claim the Bible was unreliable. Simply not true, the words recorded are the same as were revealed in ancient times as God&#39;s words. You seem to question that the messsge is unreliable. </p>

<p>You speak of an experience where you felt you were subjected to it&#39;s &quot;lies&quot;. There are many groups and evil men that misuse the Bible for their own agendas. Where ppl live hypocritically. The Bible is an epic with many different cultures and times. You have to educate yourself in these to better understand what is happening. </p>

<p>Some of the passages in the Old Testament belong to a different era in God&#39;s relationship to man.  He has been seeking to reunite us spiritually back to Himself. We are currently under Grace. Previously (before JESUS&#39; sacrifice) we were under the Law. These horrors were not God&#39;s preference but a result of man&#39;s free will, which he indulged (ate forbiddden fruit) and caused all mankind to die spiritually (to God) and physically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A general (however incomplete) overview of the grades within the A∴A∴:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Initiatory structure</p>

<p>The initiatory structure of A∴A∴ is based on the Qabalistic Tree Of Life, its grades following the sephira up the tree in reverse order. The A∴A∴ is sub-divided into three orders: The S.S., being the governing body (Third Order) and comprising those grades that are above the Abyss; The R.R. et A.C. (Second Order), comprising those degrees that are below the Abyss but above the Veil of Paroketh; and The Golden Dawn (First Order), comprising the grades below the Veil of Paroketh. A complete description of the tasks of the First Order is given in Liber XIII vel Graduum Montis Abiegni: a syllabus of the steps upon path, in The Equinox Volume 1.</p>

<p>Two additional &quot;grades&quot;, the Dwellers on the Thresholds, link the orders: Dominis Limnis in Paroketh, and Babe of the Abyss in the Abyss.</p>

<p>Members of the Third Order can generate their own variations of the First and Second Order teachings as reflections of their own Understanding, contemplating systems of attainment not compassed in the curriculum of the main system.</p>

<p>Student</p>

<p>A student&#39;s business is to acquire a general intellectual knowledge of all systems of attainment, as declared in the prescribed books. At the end of a fixed period, the Student takes a written examination to test his reading, after which he passes through a small ritual involving the reading of the History Lection (Liber LXI), and passes to the grade of Probationer.</p>

<p>The Order of the G∴D∴ (Golden Dawn)</p>

<p>Probationer</p>

<p>(0°=0□): The Probationer&#39;s principal business is to begin such practices as he or she may prefer, and to write a careful record of the same for one year.</p>

<p>Neophyte</p>

<p>(1°=10□): Has to acquire perfect control of the astral plane.</p>

<p>Zelator</p>

<p>(2°=9□): The Zelator&#39;s main work is to achieve complete success in asana and pranayama. The Zelator also begins to study the formula of the Rosy Cross.</p>

<p>Practicus</p>

<p>(3°=8□): Is expected to complete the intellectual training, and in particular to study Qabalah.</p>

<p>Philosophus</p>

<p>(4°=7□): Is expected to complete the moral training. Is tested in Devotion to the Order.</p>

<p>Dominus Liminis</p>

<p>(The Link): Is expected to show mastery of pratyahara and dharana.</p>

<p>The Order of the R∴C∴ (Rosy Cross)</p>

<p>Adeptus Minor (Without)</p>

<p>(5°=6□): Lesser Adept (Without). Is expected to perform the Great Work and to attain the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.</p>

<p>Adeptus Minor (Within)</p>

<p>(5°=6□): Lesser Adept (Within). Is admitted to the practice of the formula of the Rosy Cross on entering the College of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Adeptus Major</p>

<p>(6°=5□): Greater Adept. Obtains a general mastery of practical Magick, though without comprehension.</p>

<p>Adeptus Exemptus</p>

<p>(7°=4□): Exempt Adept. Completes in perfection all these matters. He then either (a) becomes a Brother of the Left Hand Path or, (b) is stripped of all his attainments and of himself as well, even of his Holy Guardian Angel, and becomes a Babe of the Abyss, who, having transcended the Reason, does nothing but grow in the womb of its mother. It then finds itself a Master of the Temple.</p>

<p>The Order of the S∴S∴ (Silver Star)</p>

<p>Magister Templi</p>

<p>or Master of the Temple (8°=3□): The principal business of this grade is to obtain a perfect understanding of the Universe. The essential Attainment is the perfect annihilation of that personality which limits and oppresses his true self[citation needed]. The Magister Templi is pre-eminently the Master of Mysticism, that is, his Understanding is entirely free from internal contradiction or external obscurity; his Word is to comprehend the existing Universe in accordance with his own Mind[citation needed]. This grade corresponds to Binah on the Tree of Life, and to the Secret Chiefs in the old Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn[citation needed]. Crowley also linked it with the experience he called &quot;Shivadarshana&quot; and with the Four Formless States of Buddhism, although he cautions against treating these criteria as sufficient for the grade.</p>

<p>Magus</p>

<p>(9°=2□): The Magus seeks to attain Wisdom, declares his law, and is a Master of all Magick in its greatest and highest sense. His will is entirely free from internal diversion or external opposition; His work is to create a new Universe in accordance with his Will. This grade corresponds to Chokmah on the Tree of Life. It also bears some resemblance to Nietzsche&#39;s &quot;new philosopher&quot; who creates values, although with more focus on self-transcendence according to Crowley biographer Lawrence Sutin.</p>

<p>Ipsissimus</p>

<p>(10°=1□): Beyond the comprehension of the lower degrees. An Ipsissimus is free from limitations and necessity and lives in perfect balance with the manifest universe. Essentially, the highest mode of attainment. This grade corresponds to Kether on the Tree of Life. Ipsissimus is quite hard to translate directly from Latin to English, but it is essentially the superlative of &quot;self&quot;, translating rather approximately to &quot;His most Selfness,&quot; or &quot;self-est.&quot; (c.f. generalissimo for the same superlative form in use for a grade from same Latin root.)</p>

<p>Crowley named as a condition of this grade the trance Nirodha-samapatti, which reduces heartbeat and other life functions to the bare minimum. Theravada Buddhist monks traditionally attain nirodha-samapatti by producing the aforementioned Formless States one after the other, and perceiving in each what they call the Three Characteristics of all existence: sorrow or tendency towards sorrow, change or unreliability, and insubstantiality or lack of self. Crowley and the A∴A∴ however seek to replace this threefold view with the quest for balance as both a motive for discipline and the means of achieving their end goal. In Liber B vel Magi they urge the Magus seeking further progress to identify the Buddhist Three Characteristics with the opposite states. &quot;Wherein Sorrow is Joy, and Change is Stability, and Selflessness is Self.&quot; Crowley&#39;s version of nirodha includes &quot;seeing first the truth and then the falsity of the Three Characteristics&quot; according to his published theory.</p>

<p>The Ipsissimus should keep the achievement of this final grade secret, even from the rest of the Order, and continue with the work of the Magus while expressing the nature of an Ipsissimus in word and deed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all has to do with evidence. Evidence needs to be obvious and it needs to be possible for everyone to be able to access it, so it essentially needs to be available to everyone. I am going to write a thread on this showing and explaining it in complete detail as to why this is absolutely the case, but the fact of the matter is that the obvious evidence for Atlantis is there in great quantities and the connections between everything need to made and logic needs to be used to sequence these connections in the correct order, which means the order in which things could possibly happen. The possibility of things happening comes from obvious evidence. There is obvious evidence for everything I have talked about regarding Atlantis, the elite, etc. The impossibility of things happening comes from the lack of obvious evidence. </p>

<p>There are so many different connections and factors to take into consideration that it is pointless at this tme to go into literally everything in detail. There will come a time for that, but not now. </p>

<p>Beliefs do not take everything into account (the obvious evidence, all of the connections, and the logic needed to order the connections correctly), and so are not based in reality. Reality is what is real and what exists, and the obvious evidence is the proof of what exists, but connections and logic are necessary in order to use that evidence to prove the existence of larger things, like Atlantis, without direct lots of direct obvious evidence of the thing itself (the majority of the ruins of Atlantis itself). </p>

<p>Those 3 things are objective and they do not take into consideration subjectivity. They have to do with reality itself, and while some perceptions of reality would have to be accurate perceptions of the way reality actually is, not all are accurate because perceptions change, therefore subjectivity ( perecptions,  beliefs, opinions, feelings, attitutudes) cannot be used to gauge reality. </p>

<p>Almost everyone in this sub uses subjectivity to gauge realiy and that is something that needs to, and ultimately will change because subjectivity changes, and if subjectivity determined reality, then reality would itself ultimately break because subjectivity can contradict itself, which would make reality contradict itself and when things like existence and non existence, or possibility and impossibility collide, reality breaks.</p>

<p>And this hasn&#39;t happened yet and isn&#39;t happening, so to use a logical shortcut (because it&#39;s pointless at this time to go into detail about this), it will never happen. So therefore subjectivity does not determine reality, so using subjectivity to gauge reality is essentially insanity, because it is positing that one&#39;s own subjectivity is the key to understanding reality. When you understand reality, you are determining what it is. Subjectivity changes all the time so that would mean that your understanding of reality would constantly change too.</p>

<p>Therefore you would be insane, because your grip on reality would be gone, because in order to have a grip on reality, reality needs to be solid and unchanging, because you need to be able to anchor your existence onto something that does not ultimately threaten your existence. Your existence, for the purposes of this post, is your life here on earth, and if reality is constantly changing, then your existence is unstable, and thus will itself change. Changes in your existence that stem from a changing reality will be continual and ultimately never ending because subjectivity is always changing. Continual change, when it comes to your existence here on earth, can never have a positive outcome and can only lead to negativity. And this negativity will continue until you stop trying to gauge reality with subjectivity. </p>

<p>This applies to almost every human on earth and this will inevitably happen. Atlantis will be rediscovered, this subreddit will be the heart behind its rediscovery, the system of the elite will be destroyed, we will be united as one civilization once again, and we will finally be united as one planet. </p>

<p>The stars are the limit from there, and I go into et&#39;s and their extremely important involvement in building a global civilization just like how Atlantis was, and then becoming interstellar. I haven&#39;t, and I won&#39;t go into what will happen after the et&#39;s help us reform and restructure civilization, because thst is jumping the gun and I honestly have no wish to find out right now. </p>

<p>My goal, and this sub&#39;s goal, is to change the world for the better, not to postulate on what&#39;s going to happen after we&#39;ve done that. </p>

<p>My sub goal, is to change this sub, and that goal will be achieved, so there are no worries and no worries means no pressure. Objectivity allows you to understand that subjectivity is just as important, and subjectivity includes prioritizing things beyond the absolutely essential, like keeping good relationships with your family if you live with them, or eating, or sleeping, etc.</p>

<p>So I get to prioritize my life and I understand that because reality is unchanging, my subjectivity does not determine it, therefore I am not panicked into trying to convince people of the insanity that I am stuck in by believing my subjectivity determines reality. </p>

<p>This is what every single person that believes this does, they all try to convince the others of their insanity, and some agree on some parts of a shared form of insanity, and most others disagree. In fact even those people that agree, will inevitably disagree because subjectivity is always changing, even if in tiny degrees. </p>

<p>Pretty much everyone on this sub is constantly doing this, and since everyone here is already heavily questioning what they&#39;ve been told reality is, they are even more susceptible to insanity because their subjectivity is being used to determine an already unstable reality, so it creates even more constant change in their existence, and this enhanced constant change multiplies the negativity in one&#39;s life.</p>

<p>But on the flip side since they&#39;re heavily questioning what they&#39;ve been told reality is, they are less entrenched in the narrative of reality of the elite and thus it is the ideal place (along with the fact that this is the most concentrated and organized place of people like this on the internet) to begin the process of changing the world. All that is needed is to change the sub itself first.</p>

<p>That is where you and the others who respond to my comments come in. You are directly interacting with me, so I know that you have at least read some of what I have read and have actually internalized it enough to form a response. That means that you&#39;re more likely to remember it than those who simply upvote. Since you&#39;re more likely to remember what I have written, you are more likely to think about it and possibly come back and reread it again. The more you think about it and reread it, the more you will be able to understand it and eventually you will understand it, and once you understand it, you&#39;ll be able to appreciate it. By seeing the evidence of this everywhere, you&#39;ll start to appreciate it and that is the key turning point.</p>

<p>Once you appreciate it <strong>that</strong> is when you will actually feel the desire to spread it and the things on Atlantis, and you&#39;ll feel the desire to post your own posts about these things in the same way thst I have, with the same points that I have made, because you will understand and appreciate that they are objective.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;re posting on Atlantis and these things, then you&#39;ll finally start to have the desire to get others to do so as well, and once others are at the same place you are, then everyone will then desire to and eventually get involved with rediscovering Atlantis in the ways I outline in my original thread on Atlantis. </p>

<p>That will be the beginning of the end of the system of the elite and all it takes is for you to reply, and then (which I&#39;m asking you to do now), think about what I&#39;ve wrote and reread it (preferably as many times as you can until you actually understand it).</p>

<p>So thank you for replying and contributing to changing the world (even before you actually start doing all of those things)!</p>

<p>I find the more nutsos of nutsos, the flat earthers, the &quot;mandela effect&quot; ones, the &quot;there is a global satanist conspiracy that uses pedophilia to become immortal&quot; ones, and then i find someone who is reasonable, who may have a grasp on how the world works, and then i find out he is also kinda nuts, just ness than the others</p>

<p>If natural selection exists, and a species come from others, why is the human case different than any other species on earth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why firmness and a heads on approach is absolutely necessary. The only reason someone wouldn&#39;t drink the water would be because of conditioning, and the only way to get rid of the conditioning is to first expose it for what it is, and expose every bit of it again and again because repetition breaks down any and all barriers and is one of the most crucial tools we have. </p>

<p>That means that I will not stop, and I will not ever stop, but of course dealing with outliers (particularly conditioned people), there is of course a limit, because it becomes unreasonable to scream and jump up any longer. Helping one person understand and appreciate these things does not matter, helping the entire sub is what matters.</p>

<p>But as I&#39;ve said in some of my other posts, when you actually objectively know the actual objective truth, then you will never stop, because you know the truth, and when you know the truth, you understand and appreciate that everyone else is under false pretenses and beliefs, and that repetition is the most crucial tool. </p>

<p>Posting numerous threads and comments, showing and explaining as much as you possibly can within reason (those outliers) to help as many people understand and appreciate what you are talking about. </p>

<p>So look for more of me, because I am going nowhere and this sub will be changed, and the world after that.</p>
