<p>We should all realize this guy makes bags of money to tell conspiracy theories, and if he cant find one, you can bet on him pulling one right out of his ass. </p>

<p>So my question is this, why would anyone believe this guy? how does he have any credibility?</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope this can be civil</p>

<p>maybe i should go through the other one and reevaluate this sub though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I remember Alex Jones steered into pizzagate for a couple days and then backed right off... Just like Milo... I&#39;m guessing anyone with any clout was asked to keep mum about it by the government... I don&#39;t think pizza = child sex slave... but there <em>is</em> rampant child molesting and sex trafficking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think thats definitely true. I just watched a documentary about the child molestation in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/5k6pnd/an_open_secret_2014_an_investigation_into_rampant/">hollywood</a> </p>

<p>but pizzagate is ridiculous. I saw a post on here talking about sacrificing children in a satanic ritual being involved in pizzagate and shit</p>

<p>As for pizzagate, I don&#39;t consider that an Alex Jones type conspiracy, but there are probably people here who disagree with me. However, I&#39;m curious what makes you say that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my defn of an Alex Jones conspiracy: I think an Alex Jones type conspiracy is one thats mostly motivated by politics/ an addiction to being angry (yes anger is addicting), that people believe just because they hate the side that the conspiracy flings mud on. </p>

<p>Pizzagate was just an easy and very lazy way to get people to hate Hillary (if remember correctly it was Podesta&#39;s emails that it derived from, saying Hillary was involved in a child abduction/sex/torture ring), I dont think there&#39;s any real proof of it. That guy shot up comet pingpong only to find out there wasn&#39;t even a basement to the building, and people still believe it. Why? Because they dont want to give up that hate for Hillary that they&#39;re addicted to</p>

<p>No politics intended. Just my theory on pizzagate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there were people who jumped on the pizzagate train simply because it fit their desire to demonize certain people or groups, but some of us have researched it deeply and don&#39;t fit that mold. However, I can see why you would label it an Alex Jones type conspiracy. Thanks for the reply</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. I will say right off the bat that I think Comet Ping Pong and Alefantis get too much attention. James seems like a creep, but i won&#39;t call him a pedophile without more evidence. For me, the compelling stuff is documented cases like the Franklin scandal, LtCol Michael Aquino, the Finders and their connections to the CIA, the Dutroux Affair, Laura Silsby and Monica Peterson, Cathy O&#39;Brien, and the massive coverups of pedophilia in places like the U.K. This is enough to make me suspect that something big is going on in elite circles</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive been looking into these and i currently cant see any connection between them.  </p>

<p>michael aquino the church of satan is probably not what you think. they dont believe in any magic or supernatural being, they practice psychology but call it magic for whatever reason. </p>

<p>cathy o&#39;brien recalled her memories through hypnosis, which has been shown to not actually make you recall memories other than the ones you are lead to &quot;discover&quot; by the person conducting the hypnosis.</p>

<p>Dutroux is weird, especially that the camera watching him was set to go off at 6pm and turn on at 8am, literally makes no sense. but that could also be explained as police fucking up and police inefficency, I dont really see police officers as the most intelligent (not to disrespect them, just that you dont have to be smart to get the job so they can screw up in stupid ways) and since it was such a long affair, i think he would have been killed long ago if higher ups were involved</p>

<p>Silsby is very strange, although Brock Turner proves just how fucked up our legal system is on letting people off the hook randomly. But 2 attorneys dropped out of representing her after she was cleared of federal (?) charges, and only had to deal with Idaho state which is suspicious.</p>

<p>These are the first time i&#39;ve come across these, took me a while to get through the reading for them. Im not sure if i see the connection between these and pizzagate or a greater connection between them. I think my thinking is i dont believe in humans on an individual level, I think people fuck up, and departments fuck up, but that doesn&#39;t mean the fuck ups are connected. </p>

<p>I just want to reiterate this is the first time ive come across these and i researched them all just now so theres probably a lot i missed tho lol</p>

<p>One that isn&#39;t, the elites have chosen Trump to bring in a new puritanical agenda. The popular/electoral split was by design, to further push &quot;divide &amp; conquer&quot;. It&#39;s very obvious Trump is controlled opposition.</p>
