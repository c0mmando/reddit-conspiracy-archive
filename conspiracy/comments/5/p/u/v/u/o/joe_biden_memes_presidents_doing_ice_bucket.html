        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">787</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/djklbd.html">djklbd</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The establishment uses the MSM, as well as social media, to shape the way the public sees people in positions of power, MAINLY being our Presidents, Vice Presidents. For their agenda to be successful, they HAVE to portray their puppets and frontmen as nice and likable people that we can relate to, in order to gain our trust. </p>

<p>They like to present these people as &quot;Everymen&quot;. In other words, they shape and craft a character for the person in the position of power to play that makes them appeal to us. We like honesty in people, eye contact. We respond well to people who are &quot;down to earth&quot; or &quot;real&quot;. We like people with a sense of humor and modesty, and we also are <strong>very</strong> interested in the relationship this person has with their wife/husband, (First man or lady).</p>

<p>People loved the type of relationship Michelle and Barrack Obama had together, because the media portrayed them to be this classic loving couple, and Obama of course as the ultimate gentleman. </p>

<p>The elite choose charismatic and charming  men and women to carry out positions of power, because they are more <strong>effective</strong> and <strong>productive</strong> and at producing results. This is because the people will trust a charming and charismatic person. </p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t think people are aware of how just sophisticated the means are in which they do this. This is a very big part of the process. Social media is a very big way in which they reach us, the millennial 18-28 generation In particular. They obviously use Internet memes and social platforms to push a certain impression of their candidates. </p>

<p>With Obama, I think they really tried to appeal to women in particular, by portraying him as a gentleman who has nothing but the upmost respect for his wife, Michelle. Several internet memes displayed and depicted them as a loving married couple. That kind of stuff resonates with people, it makes them feel good inside, that this person in charge of them is an upstanding gentleman, women in particular. Can you see how this positive portrayal of these people could be beneficial to the elite? </p>

<p>However, do you REALLY think these two are <em>actually</em> like this in real life? I mean, c&#39;mon...And regardless, how does that add credibility to how good of a job he is doing as president? </p>

<p>Does anybody remember the time Obama went on &quot;Between two Ferns&quot; for college humor? It was a hilarious comedy sketch with Obama as the guest on the show. That made him look funny and cool to anyone who watched it, and that he has a sense of humor. In this age of Internet comedy and viral videos, it&#39;s the perfect avenue that they can use, to reach the youth and drum up some trust for them. (Link below).</p>

<p>Do you see how they are able to get the people&#39;s trust and respect for their puppets? They know that the population is not very politically aware, and that they don&#39;t follow EVERY SINGLE ISSUE and they don&#39;t keep up with current events, so all they have to do is make this person appear to be trustworthy, and they will support them regardless. <strong>This is the reality, most people are not politically informed on anything at all, they vote based on character alone</strong></p>

<p>Does anybody remember the Biden and Barrack memes? They depicted the Obama presidency as this, &quot;fun group of dudes who are just a bunch of rascals that like to have a good time and get into a bunch of wacky hijinks&quot;.</p>

<p>You guys all know how memes can affect the way people think. They are trying to &quot;lighten up&quot; and &quot;soften&quot; Joe&#39;s Image. Are you aware that there is some pretty incriminating footage of this guy groping and touching young children on CSPAN? 
(Link Below).</p>

<p>Also, check out this clip of George W. Bush at the inauguration a few days ago. He was struggling a bit to put his poncho on. To me, it looked intentional. But look at those YouTube comments! </p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ntYZK9ZMCaA">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ntYZK9ZMCaA</a></p>

<p>This is a man who is wanted in several countries for war crimes. This guy had prior knowledge of 9/11. This is a full grown man who relishes in the evil things he has done, not some &quot;harmless goofy bimbo&quot; like they are trying to portray him. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at is, do you see how much effort goes into shaping these peoples characters, and trying to make them palatable to the people? Social media, Facebook, Google, SNL, you name it. </p>

<p><strong>The elite are creating a cult of personality with these presidents and politicians, so that even if you don&#39;t know what policies they implement, you don&#39;t care because they are so charming</strong>.</p>

<p>We need to be aware of this. I just wanted to shine a line on exactly how idiotic people can still support blatant criminals because they think they are &quot;such nice people&quot; or &quot;so down to earth&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I find the memes very concerning because they are effective. They give a witty, funny, but completely fabricated personality to these people. Biden is who you see it from most.</p>

<p>I am not sold on Trump, but I definitely see very few examples of it  he is mocked and painted as an unsupportive husband. The manly man route isn&#39;t exactly a big seller in current political climate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please name a President in which the populace held their judgement until a full term was served. Does your employer wait to judge your performance until four years of work has been accomplished? Your point, I think, is to hold off judgement until he&#39;s had more than two days in office.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting to me that nobody seems to understand that within even our government and our political parties and everything else, everything is bifurcated. There are competing factions on every side and within every house of influence, and I don&#39;t think people ever really think about how much happens in the background between people who are supposed to be on the same side but represent completely different interests. I guess I&#39;m just amazed that people actually think it could be so simple as duality....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer is simple. What do we have as conspiracy theorists that average people don&#39;t? We are able to seriously consider that authority is lying to us about (insert issue or event here). We need to study the self-interests of individuals in various positions of power. Self-serving people are predictable like machines. They have machine minds; seek gain, avoid loss, calculate risk, do not let emotions get in the way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really what I mean. My point is more that we need to work to keep the discussion on the argument, rather than focusing on the meta-structure of the argument itself.</p>

<p>Consider in this post: </p>

<p>4chan greentext about John Oliver  -&gt; user1 says &quot;you can&#39;t trust 4chan&quot; -&gt; user2 says &quot;oh that&#39;s a fallacy! Appeal to authority!&quot; -&gt; discussion about fallacies and rhetoric ensues</p>

<p>Do you see what happened? The discussion about the actual <strong>content</strong> is lost. User1 successfully shifted the discussion from <em>what</em> John Oliver is saying to <em>who</em> is allowed told hold opinions at all. By focusing on a call out rather than a &quot;call-in&quot;, user2 has helped make the conversation about rhetoric which is aimless and irrelevant to the actual content.</p>

<p>It&#39;s derailment. And recognizing the derailment as a fallacy doesn&#39;t really make a difference. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, how&#39;s about this then. What you are saying about the 4chan piece is itself a logical fallacy. That &#39;greentext&#39; or whatever you call it, which I saw linked here a while ago as well, only served to say &#39;this is what me and my friend think about john oliver&#39;s show and we are phd candidates psychologists&#39; or something similar in terms of their academic credentials. Disregarding the fact that the same people touting this on 4chan would be just as quick to disregard anyone because of their academic credentials with an excuse like &quot;cultural marxism&quot; or whatever. Even granting complete legitimacy to any of their &#39;expert&#39; claims it doesn&#39;t serve to say that the show was <em>designed</em> that way. Only that they noticed it had this <em>effect</em>.  You literally described it as jumping from joke to joke, so as a rational person in this discussion its hard to see how thats an inappropriate structure for a tv show. Have they observed that comedians don&#39;t achieve this effect in other non-tv situations such that perhaps this isn&#39;t a great conspiracy to trick you into believing oliver&#39;s weak arguments but more like he&#39;s just not that smart and only kinda funny.</p>

<p>I laid out tons of examples of how the media focuses on trivial things about our leaders, like their fucking relationships, their hobbies, putting them on talk shows, stupid internet sketches, making tons of memes that paint them in a positive light. They distract you from their <strong>policies</strong> and what kind of a job they are doing and the crimes they may be committing, and instead  you become drawn in by their charm! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see that connection. I see people who have opinions that would <em>align</em> with much of what Trump says regarding the media. Not the man himself though, from what I have seen here in this sub. Trump is an authoritarian just like any other political figure. </p>

<p>The folks here aren&#39;t that disillusioned about him. The only thing that helps your case is that Trump is a fucking madman and at least %20 of the subscribers to this sub probably got a screw or two loose. So maybe there is a tiny correlation.In the end though, the people who are here looking for answers to the frustration they see in the world are the majority of users here. You&#39;re gonna be so brash to call them* brainwashed? please...</p>

<p>I have hope that it won&#39;t be based on him saying many of the same things he campaigned on for decades.</p>

<p>If Trump is possibly what he presents himself as (unbought, for the people, time to give back, MAGA, etc.) couldn&#39;t the other obscenely rich people in his cabinet feel the same way. The revolutionary war wasn&#39;t started by poor people after all and globalism doesn&#39;t rise all boats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump fits quite nicely I think. If their game was really up, the Media would ignore the hell out of Trump, not give him more attention. They ignore every other candidate who wont play ball. Sanders and Paul are two recent ones. The media did literally everything to marginilize and outright ignore them. But Trump, he was never ignored. If he was really against them, why would they even talk about him? Those who aren&#39;t players are &quot;fringe&quot; and forgotten. Not one outlet could let Trump be forgotten.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its because during the inauguration trump left his wife to carry a box up the white house steps while he marched up by himself. previous presidents have waited for their wife ,including the obamas, to walk up in unison. also there were alot of fake smiles melania was giving when trump was looking at her. there are rumors that their marriage is a mirage so trump suporters are becoming deffensive and trying to attack other presidents for trumps shortfalls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you OP. We are fooled just like we think North Korea is fooled by their leader. I was thinking the same way when I first saw all of those Biden memes. Then I saw the segment on trevor noah&#39;s show about biden... HOLY SHIT. The dumb guest on the show told millions of Americans that &quot;it&#39;s OK that Biden is the way he is.. he&#39;s like a creepy uncle ok! Don&#39;t worry..&quot; all while showing the clips of him touching little girls... And the producers just played the laughing track the whole segment... </p>

<p>BRAINWASHING IS REAL and you hit the nail on the head with your post.  All the mis-information spreaders will dodge the real problem and talk about emotions and feelings toward the prez and unrelated bs... exactly what the P.C. agenda wants you to do!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You only need to consider your society&#39;s priorities and pressures and who and how it rewards for what they actually do in for that society at large. You also want to examine the priorities of the fields they work in and their individual priorities within those fields.</p>

<p>At the top of the heap in the US are any and all forms of entertainment that are quintessentially &quot;acts&quot; performed by &quot;actors&quot;... actors who are best and most widely known for the acts they present and perform in public or for the public. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a very small part of who and what they actually are as real people but it becomes larger than life with all the attention and enormous rewards that are at stake and results in what we commonly call a &quot;persona&quot; or stage personality that can and quite often does completely take over and suppress their real personality even when they&#39;re not in the spotlight. </p>

<p>In short they&#39;re basically &quot;fakes&quot; and &quot;faking it&quot; and in the end they are rewarded for just how well and convincingly they can in fact pretend and &quot;fake it&quot; and how enormously high the rewards are for doing just that and of course all the awards and award ceremonies in the entertainment field are all about doing that very thing.</p>

<p>Television is all about ratings and huge advertising revenues that are possible if they&#39;re high enough. Since it&#39;s a visual medium the first priority for anyone that&#39;s going to be on TV is that they either &quot;look the part&quot; or role they&#39;re going to play on camera or can be &quot;made to look the part&quot; so it&#39;s as convincing as possible and that applies to all TV programming including the news. </p>

<p>In radio it consists of having a voice with the right pitch that resonates over a microphone in a way that maintains or even improves the way it sounds over the radio. So it&#39;s not important to look the part but rather to sound like it instead.</p>

<p>Now about 80% of the cost of most things we buy actually goes into advertising and promoting it so we&#39;ll be psychologically motivated to buy them. In the jargon of that trade itself you &quot;sell the sizzle, not the steak&quot;. In short it&#39;s all about manipulation and a very sophisticated bit of fakery to tease, entice, and appeal to our senses, vanity, insecurities or desire to be identified in a certain way in public, not because we actually are that way, but because of the way we will be seen and treated if we can look or sound like that part convincingly enough for the social approval of others we&#39;d like to be like and liked by because of the way they happen to appear and sound to us and no knowledge of to what degree any of them are simply faking it too. </p>

<p>Now all of this spills into our everyday lives in other unexpected ways that also entails all kinds of fakery in pursuit of various forms of fame, acclaim, and, of course, the &quot;almighty dollar&quot; at the end of the rainbow. We see it in the form of new and stately looking homes that are actually nothing more than chipboard with an inch of brick or stone veneer over it that look the part and are certainly priced on that look rather than on what&#39;s actually below the surface or running through it&#39;s interior in the form of the cheapest wiring and plumbing with elegant looking fixtures that are actually no more that cheap foreign knock-offs of what used to be the &quot;real thing&quot;.</p>

<p>The more you look into all the artificiality and fakery that surrounds us the more of it you simply find. Even words like &quot;normal, natural&quot; or &quot;ordinary&quot; have all been co-opted to some degree and are more like what constitutes an acceptable and expected level of fakery rather than none at all.</p>

<p>We are susceptible because we are all unwittingly inculcated and conditioned from birth to do the very same thing and aping what is actually quite deliberately done to get us to do that without thinking about it or what the real consequence actually is... a status quo that was in place when we arrived and that will still be there long after we&#39;ve gone because all we&#39;ve ever managed to do is change the props, costumes and backdrops on this stage while the script for this old play has remained virtually unchanged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most of the people on this subreddit are already aware of this, which is why they already here. Posts like this need to reach people outside of this bubble.  Basically everyone agrees with you here. Otherwise,  why would be subbed to a conspiracy sub. Good information though but its common knowledge against already conspiracy readers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if they&#39;re gearing up for a showdown (a coup perhaps?) vs. Trump. The pattern I&#39;m seeing here is that all those people that the media are portraying to be ordinary relate-able persons, including the Republicans, did not want Trump to become president. </p>

<p>OTOH, majority of the media have been hating on Trump. Plus the protests (supposedly funded by Soros).</p>

<p>It&#39;s all too convenient.</p>
