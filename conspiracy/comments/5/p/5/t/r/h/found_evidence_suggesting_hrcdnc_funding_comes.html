<p>Haven&#39;t edited it, would take too long. If you&#39;re offended by my use of &#39;pede... well sorry, but i&#39;ve spent a long time on this. If there&#39;s a serious issue, mods, hit me up.</p>

<p>Good morning ‘Pedes </p>

<p><strong>A quick TL;DR:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are alledged connections between Trump and Dmitry Rybolovlev (Russian Oligarch).</p></li>
<li><p>Rybolovlev actually has no assets in Russian and has not lived there for many years.</p></li>
<li><p>The Oligarch who took over Rybolovlev&#39;s russian assets is a government official called Suleiman Kerimov. </p></li>
<li><p>Kerimov and his associates invested heavily in western financial institutions. So heavily that in 2008 when the markets were crashing the US treasury apparently called him and begged him not to sell. </p></li>
<li><p>So heavily that Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and likely others would fly representatives out to Russia to meet with him, including some CEO&#39;s. </p></li>
<li><p>These same banks have backed both Hillary and the DNC for <strong>years</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>This all suggests at least two factions are at work. One trying to use the US to overthrow Putin in order to reclaim Russia, another trying to stop them from doing so. </p></li>
<li><p>WE NEED TO DIG PEDES THIS COULD BE HUGE.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yesterday I was perusing a certain [redacted] subreddit some information was posted. In what may, or may not have been a coincidence Trumps jet and the jet of another man were parked at the same airport. That man was Dmitry Rybolovlev. Now naturally things cascaded a bit with the typical “omg how can t_D ignores Trumps ties to Russia it’s so obvious!” Naturally I found such massive assumptions a bit over-the-top, but I figured it’d be a great time to showcase was t_D does while we display our insanely HIGH ENERGY and memetic wizardry. </p>

<p>We actually bother to investigate shit. </p>

<p>===================== AND SO IT BEGINS =============================</p>

<p>Dmitry Rybolovlev.</p>

<p>A Russian billionaire, made an absolute fucking fortune during the more corrupt and dangerous times that preceded Putin taking complete power. Nowadays he no longer lives in Russia. He lives in Monaco, hasn&#39;t lived in Russia for quite some time. It was his private jet that was at the airport in Charlotte, NC at the same time that Trumps was. </p>

<p>Previously, in 2008, Rybolovlev had bought a mansion from Trump in a deal which netted Trump an <a href="http://archive.is/5xSgU">absolute fucking killing</a> made almost $60million profit in 4 years. What&#39;s a little strange is that Rybolovlev never lived in it at all. Peculiar perhaps?</p>

<p>So my next step was to see if Rybolovlev makes a habit of spending stupid quantities of money on property that he doesn&#39;t need or use. He bought an $88 million dollar apartment (15 Central West, PH20) off Joan Weill the wife of Sandy Weill from Citigroup (whom, after his departure got heavily involved with the Clintons). This occurred in 2012. Rybolovlev&#39;s daughter lives/lived in the apartment. So it seems like this guy has a thing for spending huge amounts of money on US property. </p>

<p>This leaves a big question: Is there something specific about Donald Trump (real estate extraordinaire; recently promoted to God Emperor) and Sandy Weill (The man who built up Citibank) that would make them particularly interesting to a man like Dmitry? [redacted] assumed it was Putin buying people out. </p>

<p><strong>But this centipede investigated</strong>.</p>

<p>The only major similarity I could find (aside from being stupidly rich) was that Trump in the time preceding the 2008 crash both predicted and expressed excitement at the impending property crash. He was also rather publicly pissed about the operations of some banks. In fact He filed a lawsuit against <a href="http://archive.is/i4FxN">Deutsche Bank</a>. So Trump didn&#39;t like how banks were handling business, and he also made his own money in property not finance. </p>

<p>Now Weill made his bank account bloom in the banking industry, but following his Apartment sail to Rybolovlev in 2012 he did a 180 on his opinions and <a href="http://archive.is/5e9cy">advocated against big banks</a>.</p>

<p>For this all to click into place we now need some more information. </p>

<p>In Russia Putin <em>owns</em> the oligarchs. We can bag on Putin about a lot of things, but he basically <a href="http://archive.is/KO7QF">turned up, grabbed the elite by the balls and took control</a>. Oligarchs thought Putin would be another figure head and even backed him to become President. In return he reach over and grabbed them all by the (metaphoric) pussy. Since then there&#39;s been a fairly consistent pattern, you toe the line or you better get out of the country before Putin makes sure you never see day again. The relevance of this?</p>

<p>Dmitry Rybolovlev, as far as I can tell, has <a href="http://archive.is/bu7gI">literally zero Russian assets</a>. Yes, that&#39;s right, this supposed &#39;link to Russia and Putin&#39; is referring to a Russian-born billionaire who owns nothing in Russia, hasn&#39;t lived in the country for quite some time AND assisted Georgi Bedjamov <a href="http://archive.is/1Oq57">(wiki)</a> in fleeing from Russian authorities, supposedly in exchange for financial information on his opponents. </p>

<p>But it gets better, Dmitry made his fortune with a company called Uralkali. During the more corrupt days of Russia the <a href="http://archive.is/KwoMj">Mafia was involved with Uralkali</a> following one guy getting killed Dmitry was jailed for organising his death. During this time he was allegedly pressured to sell his shares in Uralkali in exchange for his freedom. Dmitry declined and after a while was released. That really sets him up and being pretty attatched to this company. </p>

<p>Keeping that previous point in mind you might be surprised that he sold off his shares (a whole 53%) in Uralkali to <a href="http://archive.is/bcocm">Suleiman Kerimov</a> and his associates. That was in 2010 and by the looks of things was the last time he invested in Russia. Suleiman Kerimov is <em>literally</em> in the Russian government, he is an oligarch who came to power in the Medvedev era. We can be sure the Suleiman is under the boot of Putin because, after acquiring Uralkali Suleiman made a concerted effort to push into Belarus and establish a monopoly. He was aggressive enough that he pissed off both the governors of Belarus <a href="http://archive.is/RO1Ra"><em>and Putin</em></a> following which Kerimov sold all his shares to one of Putins circle: Vladimir Kogan. </p>

<p>So we&#39;ve got Dmitry Rybolovlev, who seems to have abandoned Russia completely in 2010 with no financial links remaining there and we have Suleiman Kerimov, an oligarch under Putins boot. </p>

<p>========================== Wall Street and Kerimov ================================</p>

<p>Oh yes, the good bits. </p>

<p>Now, these are fairly bright fellows we are dealing with. They know how to hide money. So they aren&#39;t the easiest to track down. But then I found <a href="http://archive.is/eMaeQ">this</a> wonderful little article. Here&#39;s a few tasty morsels:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Senior western bankers were impressed with Kerimov’s financial agility. They introduced him to the likes of Josef Ackermann, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, John Mack, the former Morgan Stanley boss, and, later, JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, and Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs who, according to one of them, has since visited Kerimov’s Moscow residence twice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kerimov invested so much money in wall street that the bankers would fly out to visit him in Russia. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The opacity of the investment figures exemplifies the veiled, ever-shifting world of Kerimov, where there is even talk of phone calls from the US Treasury after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, exhorting the Kerimov group and lender banks not to sell their stakes. “It was a big amount of money. It was in the banking system and it was a problem for the US Treasury,” said one banker with knowledge of the situation. The acting deputy assistant secretary of the US Treasury for Europe and Eurasia at the time, Eric Meyer, said he was unaware of these “specific circumstances”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact he had invested <em>so much fucking money</em> in these banks that the US treasury <strong>personally begged him not to sell during the crisis</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>But privately some have wondered whether there may be more to the mysterious Kerimov than meets the eye. Much speculation has rested on whether he sometimes invests funds for other silent partners – in particular, the Kremlin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well now... how ugly is that. </p>

<p>Gosh I wonder what stack these particular banks had in this current election:</p>

<p>Goldman Sachs - <a href="http://archive.is/8Ok6C">Banned employees from donating to Trump</a></p>

<p>Deutsche Bank - Sued by Trump as I mentioned earlier but apparently they still do business with him <a href="http://archive.is/zukwF">(source)</a> and even favoured him which is actually a pretty interesting situation. Not sure what to make of it, they didn&#39;t donate much to any particular party. However <a href="http://archive.is/d1D95">this</a> link makes me wonder WTF is going on Deutsche Bank. Needs more investigation. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley - Top 2 recipients of donations are <a href="http://archive.is/FKiAP">Hillary Clinton and the DNC</a>, of course than didn&#39;t stop them from riding <a href="http://archive.is/VGWPA">Trump&#39;s market rally</a>.</p>

<p>JP Morgan - Donated heavily to <a href="http://archive.is/KXBEi">Hillary Clinton and the DNC</a>. </p>

<p>And of course during her time as senator Hillary Clinton&#39;s top contributors included <a href="http://archive.is/cGf42">All of the above</a> also including Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch is now owned by the Bank of America. Merrill Lynch is relevant because thats where Kerimov favourite advisor - Allen Vine - comes from. And he was apparently even invited to the Whitehouse =). I can&#39;t find much on hi</p>

<p>Bank of America - Donated to <a href="http://archive.is/Frzwt">Hillary Clinton</a>.</p>

<p>Citigroup - Where Sandy Weill originally made his money also donated to <a href="http://archive.is/iWd9c">Hillary Clinton</a> not to mention that the CEO is the one who told Obama to put her in as SoS. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;ll stop there, because fuck it, we&#39;ve already covered the Axis of Evil. </p>

<p>The point here though, is that we know members of the <strong>RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT</strong> owned so much stock in Wall Street that (a) they had a personal relationship and (b) the US treasury called Kerimov to beg him not to sell during the crash. IMO if the Treasury had to do that then it makes me think they owned an absolute shitload. These very same businesses heavily finance Hillary <em>and have done so for more than a decade</em>. </p>

<p><strong>AND THEREFORE, I ASK TO YOU: IF YOU TAKE MONEY FROM BIG FINANCE AND LEGAL FIRMS, AND THOSE LEGAL FIRMS ARE SATURATED WITH MONEY FROM RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, IS THAT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST?</strong></p>

<p>============================ Back to Trump ===================================</p>

<p>What does this imply for Trump?</p>

<p>We need consider that Kerimov seems to be under Putins boot, appears to be an adversary of Dmitry Rybolovlev and lost <a href="http://archive.is/eMaeQ">**at least $14.4 billion dollars</a> during 2008. It would seem that there were opposing forces at work during that time. Dmitry clearly couldn&#39;t live in Russia and pressure had already been applied on him before, so it would seem to me that his best path forward was to work with whoever would damage his enemies the most. And it would appear his &#39;faction&#39; succeeded. Afterwards he was either forced or chose to sell his remaining assets in Russia. </p>

<p>Now who that faction consists of I do not know (if it even is a faction, or just a bunch of mutual interests acting individually) but it sure fucking looks like 2008 did incredible damage to individuals of the Russian government who were steadily increasing their grip on American financial institutions. For people like Donald Trump 2008 was an opportunity to make a lot of money, for people like Suleiman it was a disaster because they had investments (not assets)  and for him money == power. </p>

<p>Considering that so far the only link I&#39;ve found between Trump and Rybolovlev is that one bought a house from the other there isn&#39;t much evidence to go on for Trumps role (if there is one in all this) but even he is, he sure doesn&#39;t look like the bad guy from my perspective. </p>

<p>============================ Why invest in US finance? ============================</p>

<p>The Oligarchs are under Putin’s boot. I&#39;m sure most hate being there. Once they ruled by the gun and now they just get told what to do and where to do it. But they can&#39;t get rid of Putin domestically, he&#39;s heavily ingrained in the military, intelligence services and even the people. People might not like Putin entirely, but would they prefer to the murderous corruption of the 90&#39;s? probably not. </p>

<p>That means these Oligarchs need foreign intervention to get rid of Putin, something bad enough that it&#39;ll let them reclaim power just like they did in the 90&#39;s. </p>

<p>They cannot gain power easily in Russia anymore, so they have to go foreign. Investments are perfect for that, people notice if you buy all of their physical assets but stocks? shares? there&#39;s a million ways to hide those. Naturally the banking elite will be on their side considering that <a href="http://archive.is/JH0l5">Putin</a> evicted them from Russia. And, due to the American government allowing these interests to buy politicians and lobby, that affords these Oligarchs significant influence over the American government. </p>

<p>In this light Hillary&#39;s hostility towards Russian makes <em>perfect sense</em>. In Russia, Putin is strong, but if you could use the Americans to make him look weak enough, they could depose him and reclaim their throne. They would use the US as mercenaries to do their bidding. The absolute last thing they want is friendly relations between Putin and the US. </p>

<p>============================== UPDATED INFORMATION ===========================</p>

<p>SANCTIONS</p>

<p>Kerimov is <em>not</em> on the list of people sanctioned by the US according to the <a href="http://archive.is/pccdm">wiki</a>. Which is something I find pretty odd. </p>

<p>u/echopeus (original post here: <a href="http://archive.is/E8Qr7">http://archive.is/E8Qr7</a>) found that Putin has actively tried to stop <a href="http://archive.is/YdtIX">foreign investment by these Oligarchs</a> which Suleiman appears to be <a href="http://archive.is/Bpphk">actively avoiding</a></p>

<p>============================== Digging Required ================================</p>

<p>Kerimov - doesn&#39;t act alone, none of his ilk really do. Anything we can find on them is going to be extremely helpful. Nafta Moskva is apparently an investment company of his, maybe that&#39;ll spring some leads. </p>

<p>Allen Vine - Worked for Merrill Lynch, Kerimov&#39;s top western guy and was even invited to the Whitehouse. </p>

<p>The Bank of Cyprus - Rybolovlev was heavily invested in this, Kerimov invested too, actually shitloads of people invested in it at different times, fuckery is afoot. </p>

<p>Rybolovlev - His money isn&#39;t the easiest to track, it&#39;s difficult.</p>

<p>Russian Oligarchs - Especially the unsanctioned ones.</p>

<p>Obama - His signing of the NSA powers thing concern me. He&#39;s also the guy who bailed out banks. The banks the oligarchs hold sway over. </p>

<p>Media Companies - If the banks have been bought you can bet there&#39;s media bought and paid for. If we can find the money trails we can find who the fools are. </p>

<p>Kerimov Foundation</p>

<p><em>didnt Melania look smashing today .... those gloves! youcalled it how many months ago .......&quot;I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. It says a lot that I can&#39;t do that for Clinton.
I keep thinking we will have a fight that will last well after this election, but honestly, the more that comes to light right now, the more we resolve. Public opinion has already swayed against Clinton, even considering Trump. There&#39;s something in the air, and we all know it, even if few of us can imagine how this can end well&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, actually. </p>

<p>Something the oligarchs have forgotten is that when one does much better than the rest, it creates instability.  When all do well, then we secure our resources and future together.  Altruism is necessary for humankind&#39;s survival.  It is, for example, the only way we will stop global warming.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It says a lot that I can&#39;t do that for Clinton.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re wrong about that. This particular line of investigation was about me trying to find out what the relationship between Trump and Rybolovlev was. Surely if there had to be something better than &quot;oh they were in the same place and one bought a property almost a decade ago&quot;. </p>

<p>So I dug, found kerimov. Found kerimov&#39;s links to the banks. </p>

<p>Thats where Hillary&#39;s connections became relevant. I didn&#39;t start with Hillary and work backward. I started with Trump ended up with Hillary. </p>

<p>When the only links between two people are that they were in one area together and one property purchase almost 10 years ago I find it difficult to make strong claims. </p>

<p>When the links are large scale financial ties between Russian government officials and HRC it&#39;s hard to not be suspicious. </p>

<p>Of course the point of posting here is to get some back investigating. If you dislike my line of enquiry I suggest you take the info and start digging where ever you think I have missed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it had been widely stated by both the US DoD and Russian government that Hillary&#39;s NFZ would <em>require</em> war. Plus Trump had already stated he wasn&#39;t interested in being hyper-aggressive to Russia so obviously positive for them. </p>

<p>Hillary wanted to destabilise Russia. Obama wanted to as well, hence why the whole Ukrainian situation happened. Sure Yanukovich had managed to make people angry, but the violence exploded into war when both sides simultaneous started escalating with paramilitary. There&#39;s no way at all that the US wasn&#39;t involved in that. </p>

<p>The whole things a set up. Russia isn&#39;t stupid enough to want to rebuild the soviet union again, they aren&#39;t communists now they are capitalists. They&#39;d rather build economic power than try and hold countries who would fight them to the bitter end while also isolating Russia from world markets. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the veiled, ever-shifting world of Kerimov, where there is even talk of phone calls from the US Treasury after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, exhorting the Kerimov group and lender banks not to sell their stakes. “It was a big amount of money. It was in the banking system and it was a problem for the US Treasury,” said one banker with knowledge of the situation. The acting deputy assistant secretary of the US Treasury for Europe and Eurasia at the time, Eric Meyer, said he was unaware of these “specific circumstances”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part doesn&#39;t pass the smell test. Anonymous banker vs on-record Treasury official? </p>

<p>Even the unsourced speculation puts his stake at 3% - this is not a world-shattering amount, and remember Lehman Bros folded. It&#39;s much more likely that LB just stole his money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stake isn&#39;t really known. Karimov also works with a number of other similar guys so I&#39;d assume he wasn&#39;t the only one investigating. I agree there needs to be more dug up, unfortunately my time is severely limited hence why I posted this so others can get an idea of where to look.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh he&#39;s not clean at all. At the least he was in bed with the Russian mafia. AFAIK clean Russian oligarchs just don&#39;t exist. I just suspect that he&#39;ll take a pro western stance because the others seem out to get him and I suspect Putin doesn&#39;t like him much (because of him helping Georgi escape; and possibly other things)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of these guys had virtually unlimited power before Putin. They invested in bring him into power thinking he&#39;d be a lapdog but instead he put them on a leash. </p>

<p>They would love for Putin to fall off the map, then they could go back to their old unchecked ways. However, inside Russia he&#39;s too strong. The only way they can get rid of him is if he&#39;s weakened.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an x-post from t_d, because the post is also relevant here. Instead of going through the whole post and deleting every instance of &quot;pede&quot;, he left it. That was explained, and he said he hopes no one is offended by it.</p>

<p>Apologies if this came off as rude. I&#39;m just a bit frustrated that lately, anything that isn&#39;t explicitly painting Trump as the devil himself will always get comments complaining that this isn&#39;t t_d, no matter how relevant the information. So instead of actually discussing the information, it gets dismissed because it&#39;s not immediately critical of him specifically.</p>
