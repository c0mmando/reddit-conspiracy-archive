        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Project MKUltra – sometimes referred to as the CIA&#39;s mind control program – is the code name given to a program of experiments on human subjects, <strong>at times illegal</strong>, designed and undertaken by the United States Central Intelligence Agency.[1] Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations and torture, in order to weaken the individual to force confessions through mind control. Organized through the Scientific Intelligence Division of the CIA, the project coordinated with the Special Operations Division of the U.S. Army&#39;s Chemical Corps.[2]</p>

<p><strong>Airport Shooting Suspect Esteban Santiago Sought Help for Mental Problems: Brother</strong>
<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/airport-shooting-suspect-esteban-santiago-sought-help-mental-problems-brother-n704351">http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/airport-shooting-suspect-esteban-santiago-sought-help-mental-problems-brother-n704351</a></p>

<p>&quot;<em>But he said his brother later seemed to develop mental issues, and, during a visit to Alaska months ago, &quot;he told me about these things that he [was] hearing voices, seeing people following him, the CIA and the government are, you know, writing him secret codes on the website to him and to join a group.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>The operation began in the early 1950s, was officially sanctioned in 1953, was reduced in scope in 1964, further curtailed in 1967, and officially halted in 1973.[3] The program engaged in <strong>many illegal activities</strong>,[4][5][6] including the use of <strong>unwitting</strong> U.S. and Canadian citizens as its test subjects, which led to controversy regarding its legitimacy.[4](p74)[7][8][9] MKUltra used numerous methodologies to manipulate people&#39;s mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis,[10] sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of psychological torture.[11][12]</p>

<p>The scope of Project MKUltra was broad, with research undertaken at <strong>80 institutions, including 44 colleges and universities, as well as hospitals, prisons, and pharmaceutical companies.</strong>[13] The CIA operated through these institutions using front organizations, although sometimes top officials at these institutions were aware of the CIA&#39;s involvement.</p>

<p>Project MKUltra was first brought to public attention in 1975 by the Church Committee of the U.S. Congress, and a Gerald Ford commission to investigate CIA activities within the United States. <strong>Investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKUltra files destroyed in 1973</strong>; the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms&#39; destruction order.[16]
In 1977, a Freedom of Information Act request uncovered a cache of 20,000 documents relating to project MKUltra, which led to Senate hearings later that same year.[4][17] In July 2001, some surviving information regarding MKUltra was declassified.</p>

<p>In another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, a former United States Marshal, after hearing about the project&#39;s existence in 1990, <strong>alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest.</strong> While the government admitted it was, at that time, drugging people without their consent, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel found Ritchie could not prove he was one of the victims of MKUltra or that LSD caused his robbery attempt and dismissed the case in 2007.[80]</p>

<p>That is just ONE project they have done. There are many more. Imagine the technology they have today. </p>

<p>I think this is still going on.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve given up hope with this specific issue cuz it&#39;s rarely ever mentioned and they do a good job at brigading I don&#39;t see it reaching a lot of people anytime soon at least.

<p>If it were me and I felt that this was happening then I would probably calmly move my life style towards a more rural area.

<p>I would want to do make that transition to prove to myself what the truth is.

<p>It certainly would be a kind of illness. You would have radio wave sickness if you were attacked by EMF DEW. Several times, I have asked you to ask an environmental medicine practitioner to order biomarkers of radio wave sickness. See the RWS: biomarkers wiki in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a>. Submit a report of your lab tests. Also ask for thermal imaging and upload your thermal images.</p>

<p>Whether or not you have psychosis, ask your environmental medicine practitioner or an orthomolecular psychiatrist to order biochemistry tests for paranoia and schizophrenia. Submit a report of your lab tests.

<p><a href="/u/peanutwrath66">/u/peanutwrath66</a>, you are correct. I myself have successfully eluded and relocated many times. I have researched how I have been tracked afterwards.

<p>False. It is easy to distinguish between a benign headache from an EMF DEW attack. Thermal imaging of head. Meter measurements next to head. Mild concussion biomarkers caused by brain zapping. See the brain zapping: biomarkers wiki in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a>. Radio wave sickness biomarker lab tests. Brain shielding, bed shielding and room shielding would protect from headaches.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why you comment in numerous posts in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that you are being attacked, yet give no information on technologies. Conduct research before commenting. There is ample information on EMF DEW and ultrasound weapons in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>. Since you don&#39;t know of any other sources, please refer these.</p>

<p>A more rural area if off the grid would prevent dirty electricity attacks via electrical wiring in homes. Off the grid would prevent cell tower attacks. It is unknown whether radio free zones would prevent over the horizon radar attacks and satellite attacks.</p>

<p>Sparse population areas would make no difference as stalking is not by foot or by vehicle unless the target is a high value target or the perps procured knowledge that the target will be eluding and relocating.  </p>

<p>In my opinion his side of the story needs to be told, at the very least in front a judge, so his claims can at least be assessed. If he is bonkers, at least he has had a fair shot. </p>

<p>It&#39;s wishful thinking though. Any story that even has a whiff of MK-Ultra/Mind-Conrol is very quickly swept away. The rabbit hole is huge with this subject. Maybe even as big as the pedo conspiricy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it could also be an FBI entrapment scheme.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know, the FBI admits to providing material goods to people who they think are predisposed to commit terrorist acts only to swoop in at the last minute to save the day once the person tries to carry out an attack.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a little like minority report.</p>

<p>The government has on the record tried to convince people to carry out terrorist acts so Santiago&#39;s claims aren&#39;t really that crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found it interesting that this happened <em>48 Hours</em> after the disabled Trump supporter in Chicago got tied and abused on the facebook live video. Four days later Obama gave his final speech in Chicago. My theory is the Ft. Lauderdale airport  shooting was arranged to whitewash the Chicago incident and to finish the week/newscycle with the &#39;immigrant gun violence&#39; narrative instead of &#39;hate crime in Obamas hometown Chicago&#39; . A difinitive part of his speech was him noting how much better relations white+black people are after his term.</p>

<p>Santiago contacted the Anchorage FBI office in November, telling them that the government controlled his mind and forced him to watch ISIS videos.</p>

<p>The FBI turned him over to local police, who took him to a hospital for a mental evaluation. After a series of mental health checks, the case was closed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Case closed.  Give this guy a gun and put him on the next plane to Ft Lauderdale!  Isn&#39;t this type of instability and &#39;terrorist sympathizing&quot; EXACTLY what the FBI is spending so much counter-terrorism money on investigating.  I&#39;m just saying- if I were counter intelligence and that guy came across my desk, he&#39;d be the perfect patsy:  if not for me then for someone else looking to cause problems.  I&#39;d want to keep him close regardless.</p>

<p>Witnesses said the gunman shouted &quot;I&#39;m not Jewish,&quot; repeatedly, as he held a &quot;long gun&quot; and opened fire indiscriminately. </p>
