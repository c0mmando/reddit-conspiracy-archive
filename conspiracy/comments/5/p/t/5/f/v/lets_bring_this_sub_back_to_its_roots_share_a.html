       well here it is wall of text What if aliens came to earth to mix and match genes and make a warrior class. They created hundreds if not thousands of species of humanoids and left until only the strongest species survived. Then they come back at the start of civilization and hand down only enough knowledge to guide us towards war and combat. Once we master combat at the end of world war 2 the creation of the atom bomb they come back yet again to help us reach out our full potential as spirit warriors. We are designed to be the perfect Jedi. Humans have the capabities to master mind body and spirit.

       Here's my fairly down to earth conspiracy lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combat MOS's in the military train you to use firearms in a combat situation pretty well, right? And the globalists love using US soldiers in their stupid fucking endless wars for money and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most US soldiers are conservative. It's an undeniable fact. And the modern breed of newer conservative leans libertarian, towards a smaller government (ESPECIALLY in the US Army infantry, can't take three steps without stepping on a dozen libertarians ironically).
      </p>
      <p>
       So what happens when you have trained soldiers retire to a private life? Where they are both patriotic AND oppose the encroaching of big government policies/NWO shit? They would be the first to resist any armed insurrection by globalist/totalitarianist forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what do they do?
      </p>
      <p>
       They diagnose every fucking combat vet with PTSD and encourage them to voluntarily seek hospice treatment for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, FOID cards ask you two questions, one of which was "were you ever in a mental hospital", not asking whether or not you went voluntarily or involuntarily.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you can't get a FOID card, not a lot you can do when the NWO soldiers decide to come and take your country.

       I fully believe they are intentionally fucking with our soldiers. I was married to a marine. He did his 20 and retired. Shit fucked up his brain and he now is in therapy. I've seen it happen to many soldiers. They just go looney out of no where. No wartime, PTSD,etc. lock them in a metal ward for a while then let them go. They also give them fucked up vaccinations that are mandatory. My ex SIL was on the receiving end of that. Every person in her platoon died except her. She was paralyzed for 3 some odd years from it, almost died. I feel really bad for what they do to those that serve our country. It's sad.

       It's the theory proposed by Ralph Ellis and it's quite a nice theory in my opinion. It takes the story out of Israel where we really see no evidence of biblical events and puts it up north towards the Bosporus straight which becomes the river Jordan and the Hagia Sofia becomes Solomons temple etc.

       Well being in touch with nature is the main thing.

       We work best when we are connected to our natural environment. I like to eat dandelions that grow naturally near where I live, I also meditate outdoors sometimes too.

       I believe this too, but I think it happens more on an energetic level. I don't think there is a literal demon sat somewhere whispering in someones ear. More like perhaps a negative energy field that people can be channelled.

       I believe the chakra system is real, and anybody with enough motivation can experience the beginnings of psychic abilities with enough meditative exploration. I also think this is dangerous territory to pursue alone, and one can attract attention to themselves by certain government forces, and energetic forces (both positive and negative). However, i firmly believe that understanding how each chakra interacts with various aspects of our lives is crucial to evolving as a species.

       There are certain abilities you can gain and use without really knowing the full reaching effects of them. For example, stimulating the third eye can give you glimpses, even full sight of the astral realm. You will begin to see subtle energetic forces like spirits and memory echos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way. The majority of people have no idea the astral world exists, and even if they do they don't recognize the signs of its existence. If you were a spirit or astral force and you noticed that one human out of 10,000 (im making up a number) was conscious of the spirit world, wouldn't you take interest in that person? The problem is that most people don't know how to be cautious about this stuff untill they either trip and fall on their face or get some proper guidance.

       A theme throughout the movie is that multiple split personalities in one body can have different skills, they mention a therapist's patient who was blind, but one of her split personalities had vision etc. and it goes back to believing hard enough to push the limits of the human brain and ability. I like your theory, it reminds me of the film

       I see your concern and like others I want Trump to stay with his word and be accountable for what he promised during the campaign. I guess only time will tell how he goes down in histor. However I beleve Trumo when he says that he will make us all proud to be Americans once again

       I'm glad someone gets it. There are narratives being pushed into our subconscious literally everywhere. I posted this with the intention of a haven for some open minded discussion about anything and everything this sub is made for. ACTUAL CONSPIRACIES. Ive always been a lurker on reddit until now. Now I want to get involved. Now I want to make a difference by bringing open minds together

       It's important to foster open dialogue, and this is a great place to do that. Free thinkers with open minds and respect for one another's opinions. And... it's always fun to talk about conspiracies with like minded people without judgement. I love it here and hate all the influx of left vs. right arguments of late. I have my opinions on them, but I'm not going to let it get me into a tizzy. 
Let's talk aliens, dark forces, secret societies, and any other subject that needs a closer look.

       I'm not sure. I stay out of threads that get super argumentative or are clearly posted looking for a fight. Sometimes will jump into the fray if I feel like bitch slapping some assholes, but that's not super often. 
I don't know what caused it, maybe the shut down of the pg sub, maybe the leaks. I have no way of knowing, so I just adjust my sails and keep moving along my path.

       I absolutely believe in multi-universe/alt- reality..
Strange story of my own. When I was about 10, I clearly remember my parents owning a green minivan when I was around 5-6.. like vivid memories of the car. 
My parents never have owned a minivan, let alone a car that was green. 
My parents for a few years thought it was funny at first, but I was very adament. It was past off as a dream that I remembered very well.

       White genocide is real. Those behind it generally try to veil their true purposes, but the signs are everywhere to read with those who have eyes.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The increase in self-hatred by whites.
       </li>
       <li>
        Unwillingness to celebrate white achievements.
       </li>
       <li>
        Excessive emphasis on the bad things white societies have done.
       </li>
       <li>
        Falling white birth rates.
       </li>
       <li>
        Breakdown of white family structure.
       </li>
       <li>
        Attack on Christianity, the white religion.
       </li>
       <li>
        Increased use of abortion on white babies.
       </li>
       <li>
        Less frequent white marrages.
       </li>
       <li>
        More frequent white divorces.
       </li>
       <li>
        Encouragement of inter-racial sex by the media.
       </li>
       <li>
        Portrayal of white males in media as stupid and evil.
       </li>
       <li>
        Encouragment of massive non-white immigration into white nations (and only white nations).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You might argue, "But blacks have high abortion rates and broken marrages, too." Yes, but this is collateral damage. The target is whites. The purpose is to destroy white power in the world, and to take over white nations.
