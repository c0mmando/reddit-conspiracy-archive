<p>-I&#39;ve thought of writing and expanding on this idea and might in the future. This is a rare Highdea plz don&#39;t steal. </p>

<p>Any and all thoughts and opinions are welcome. Express yo self </p>

<p>well here it is wall of text What if aliens came to earth to mix and match genes and make a warrior class. They created hundreds if not thousands of species of humanoids and left until only the strongest species survived. Then they come back at the start of civilization and hand down only enough knowledge to guide us towards war and combat. Once we master combat at the end of world war 2 the creation of the atom bomb they come back yet again to help us reach out our full potential as spirit warriors. We are designed to be the perfect Jedi. Humans have the capabities to master mind body and spirit.</p>

<p>Everyone has their own spin. What&#39;s your conspiracy theory</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my fairly down to earth conspiracy lol. </p>

<p>Combat MOS&#39;s in the military train you to use firearms in a combat situation pretty well, right? And the globalists love using US soldiers in their stupid fucking endless wars for money and power. </p>

<p>But most US soldiers are conservative. It&#39;s an undeniable fact. And the modern breed of newer conservative leans libertarian, towards a smaller government (ESPECIALLY in the US Army infantry, can&#39;t take three steps without stepping on a dozen libertarians ironically). </p>

<p>So what happens when you have trained soldiers retire to a private life? Where they are both patriotic AND oppose the encroaching of big government policies/NWO shit? They would be the first to resist any armed insurrection by globalist/totalitarianist forces.</p>

<p>So what do they do? </p>

<p>They diagnose every fucking combat vet with PTSD and encourage them to voluntarily seek hospice treatment for it.</p>

<p>So yeah, FOID cards ask you two questions, one of which was &quot;were you ever in a mental hospital&quot;, not asking whether or not you went voluntarily or involuntarily.</p>

<p>So if you can&#39;t get a FOID card, not a lot you can do when the NWO soldiers decide to come and take your country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully believe they are intentionally fucking with our soldiers. I was married to a marine. He did his 20 and retired. Shit fucked up his brain and he now is in therapy. I&#39;ve seen it happen to many soldiers. They just go looney out of no where. No wartime, PTSD,etc. lock them in a metal ward for a while then let them go. They also give them fucked up vaccinations that are mandatory. My ex SIL was on the receiving end of that. Every person in her platoon died except her. She was paralyzed for 3 some odd years from it, almost died. I feel really bad for what they do to those that serve our country. It&#39;s sad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the theory proposed by Ralph Ellis and it&#39;s quite a nice theory in my opinion. It takes the story out of Israel where we really see no evidence of biblical events and puts it up north towards the Bosporus straight which becomes the river Jordan and the Hagia Sofia becomes Solomons temple etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the chakra system is real, and anybody with enough motivation can experience the beginnings of psychic abilities with enough meditative exploration. I also think this is dangerous territory to pursue alone, and one can attract attention to themselves by certain government forces, and energetic forces (both positive and negative). However, i firmly believe that understanding how each chakra interacts with various aspects of our lives is crucial to evolving as a species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are certain abilities you can gain and use without really knowing the full reaching effects of them. For example, stimulating the third eye can give you glimpses, even full sight of the astral realm. You will begin to see subtle energetic forces like spirits and memory echos.</p>

<p>Think of it this way. The majority of people have no idea the astral world exists, and even if they do they don&#39;t recognize the signs of its existence. If you were a spirit or astral force and you noticed that one human out of 10,000 (im making up a number) was conscious of the spirit world, wouldn&#39;t you take interest in that person? The problem is that most people don&#39;t know how to be cautious about this stuff untill they either trip and fall on their face or get some proper guidance. </p>
