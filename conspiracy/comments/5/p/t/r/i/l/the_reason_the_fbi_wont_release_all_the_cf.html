       They can't have it both ways.

      <p>
       They can either disclose because not doing so is a violation of the Public Records Act and Freedom of information Act

      <p>
       OR
      </p>
      <p>
       They can come forward and say, "Guys, Google is CIA.  It started out as a CIA program called INQTEL, then became GOOGLE then became ALPHABET (kind of to mock you btw, hehe sorry about that), and now it's used to spy on you and everything you do and to integrate with every device you have and to continue invade not only your informationscape but also your mind by shaping the news and search results in favor of hillary and blocking pizzagate investagations and blocking pedo results--oops, sorry about that also"

       They can't have it both ways

       We will NEVER EVER trust them again.  AND..... some of us will run from you as fast as we can when alternatives are there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, we will be making financial instruments, new types of business entities, and bulletproof EULAs and other legal mechanisms to ensure that the US Government can never be allowed entry into our private affairs and if they are we will be enabled to name a price on asset forfeiture of our own, using microstates and ad-hoc hacktivist collectives to asymmetrically defund your donors and supporters in stociastic and absolutely indefeatable way, funnelling all seizures through multiple ad-hoc proxy networks over numerous different currencies, fungible formats at a tightly integrated and lightning pace so that it would take lifetimes to ever figure out where the  money went.

        Gilman Louie is a former CEO of In-Q-Tel — the CIA firm investing especially in start-ups developing data mining technology. In-Q-Tel was founded in 1999 by the CIA’s Directorate of Science and Technology, under which the Office of Research and Development (ORD) — which was part of the Google-funding MDSS program — had operated. The idea was to essentially replace the functions once performed by the ORD, by mobilizing the private sector to develop information technology solutions for the entire intelligence community.

       I understand what you're saying, and I realize that Google is under control.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I suspect that the information on the server contained high level national secrets. There are rumors that the server was planted there to mislead foreign intelligence, but that she also put actual intelligence on the server to sell to foreign powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it would require disclosing the whole move. The fact that the stolen documents were fake, and that some of the stuff on there really was very top secret, and was being sold.

       Neil Stephenson bored me to death with Cryptonomicon. One of very few books I didn't finish after starting. Diamond Age which had an interesting take on nano technology but story wise didn't really get me either.

       Can people stop posting searches as proof? Google does it for literally anyone. Try searching "Trump rape"  or "Trump grab them by the " and you get no predictive searches mentioning the topics even tho it was a huge thing during the elections

       I was there for the election.  I remember seeing Google block damaging autocompletes for Clinton while leaving them up for Trump.  I remember when Trump's face came up next to Hitler's in the search results page.  I remember when Trump didn't show up in a result for presidential candidates.  I even have screenshots of their misdeeds saved on a hard drive somewhere (admittedly, I'm not sure which one at this point).
      </p>

       Anyone who comes along after the fact and suggests that Google "does it for literally anyone" is either being disingenuous or wasn't paying attention at the time and subsequently bought into some bull$#!+ someone else told them.

       I'll give it to you that they didn't list him as a candidate at one point, however, when the whole thing about clinton search result came up, I remember trying it out myself and not getting anything negative for any of the other candidates (Trump, Bernie, ...).

       Yeah I went through the privacy settings and luckily I had most stuff turned off in terms of collecting my data (I'm sure they do anyways). But even still they had every single YouTube video I had watched while signed into chrome with my gmail account going back over 5 years. I deleted everything and try and make a habit of using incognito and never signing into to anything google related if I don't have to

       Thank you for posting this. This excerpt tells the reality of today's political climate:
 "The received wisdom in advanced capitalist societies is that there still exists an organic “civil society sector” in which institutions form autonomously and come together to manifest the interests and will of citizens. The fable has it that the boundaries of this sector are respected by actors from government and the “private sector,” leaving a safe space for NGOs and nonprofits to advocate for things like human rights, free speech, and accountable government.
        This sounds like a great idea. But if it was ever true, it has not been for decades. Since at least the 1970s, authentic actors like unions and churches have folded under a sustained assault by free-market statism, transforming “civil society” into a buyer’s market for political factions and corporate interests looking to exert influence at arm’s length. The last forty years has seen a huge proliferation of think tanks and political NGOs whose purpose, beneath all the verbiage, is to execute political agendas by proxy.

       In case you feel like nothing ever makes a difference in the world, I just wanted to let you know that this post was the thing that pushed me over the edge on using Android/Gmail.  I already was not using Play Services on my AOSP Nexus 5X, and had fielded a cheap iPhone 5s as a second line, and have moved away from Google search as much as possible...but yeah, today was the day.  Soon as my iPhone SE comes, I'm retiring all my Android stuff and am going to systematically close down my Gmail accounts.

       Not saying Microsoft and Apple are that much better, but...man, just...f--k Google.  And Schmidt especially.  It's a shame that Gboard and Maps are the best virtual keyboard and nav software on Apple, but you don't have to log into them, or even let Gboard talk to the Internet, so...

       Anyway, just wanted to say thanks for that final shove.

       We've been sold out since the Fed was created.  They sealed it after the CIA was created.
