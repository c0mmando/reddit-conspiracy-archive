       Unfortunately, he might be as bad as Obama when it comes to whistleblowers and secrets. He proclaimed himself the "law and order candidate" and wrote a series of tweets condemning apple for not providing the FBI with the means to unlock the phone of the San Bernardino "shooter".

       The San Bernidino incident was very strange. Lots of conflicting reports. CNN et all crashed the suspects house only hours after it happened, tainting/destroying evidence. Hillary set up a "CT dinner" at a restaurant in Cali with Saban and Mossad/other int agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all you know they wanted that phone for evidence against her and her radical actors. Without knowing which players were doing what u are in the dark. Meaning "muh rights" and "muh freedom" is irrelevant. Look at the state of the US. The supposed protections of the people are of zero consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people in play can make the most noble sounding law or "protection" work against u. And because a narrative of "qui bono" does not exist. By the time u figure it out it's irrelevant - as the next evolution of their game has already begun.

       He's the kind of president that has 3 Goldman Sach buddies in his cabinet. He's the kind of president that says he's gonna drain the swamp but in reality he seems to have filled it up more.

       I believe its up to 5 GS execs. Don't forget to add on the former Exxon CEO connected to Cheney and appointing Bush's former Deputy Homeland Security Advisor for the same job in his administration. Thats how you drain the swamp alright lol.

       If u follow conspiracies u know the take over happened in the early 1900s. It's probably not even possible for someone to "drain the swamp". He might realign it to a different power group that hasn't been as active.

       The Matrix 2 explains it well: in order to control the revolution, you have to channel it. so they gave the people the choice between Hillary (the bitch Clinton) or the rebel the elite didn't want, guess who they chose
      </p>
      <p>
       and the rebel will deliver, he'll be the black sheep, the altar on which to sacrifice the Dollar. it's been dying since the US went off the Gold standard in 1970, he's the popular choice that will drive home the nail, as agreed with China/Russia/EU/Japan, compliments of their two-monthly top secret meetings in Switzerland at the BIS (all employees have diplomatic immunity, could get away with murder and police can't touch them. even governments don't know what their central bankers talk about at those meetings, because no notes are taken...)
      </p>
      <p>
       controlled demolition, and we're told it's terrorists/global warming, because that's the do whatever you want free card for governments. "don't you touch our liberties!" "it's terrorists/global warming" "oh in that case take all you want, anything else my lord?"

       I think Trump already has enough opposition and a slate of practical changes and developments he wants to get underway that are going to be a hard enough sell as it is. Stepping into and unveiling the whole UFO controversy isn't another can of worms he needs to contend with because there's going to be a serious backlash about how and why the US government would keep anything of such immense importance from it's own citizens as well as the rest of a world that's going to be asking that very same question.
