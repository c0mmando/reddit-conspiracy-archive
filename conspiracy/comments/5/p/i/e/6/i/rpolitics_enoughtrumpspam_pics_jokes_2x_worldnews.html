<p><strong>edit:</strong> Thanks for proving my point better than I ever could. Using the exact same logic that is constantly used against the_donald, then I can conclude that this very thread is being brigaded by anti-Trump accounts. </p>

<p>Which is interesting because 95% of the threads on this website perfectly fit this narrative. Say anything other than &quot;I hate Trump&quot; and your opinion is downvoted into oblivion.  </p>

<p>While completely ridiculous and sensationalist claims like &quot;He was caught on tape bragging about sexual assault&quot; are upvoted. I&#39;m sorry but I read those transcripts and if you truly believe that conclusion, then I cannot take any of your conclusions seriously. </p>

<p>This is exactly what people should be afraid of, a media-driven majority that blindly repeats sensationalist conclusions and outright lies because they have been triggered (not even by Trump but by the media demonization of him) and don&#39;t give a damn about fact or source checking.</p>

<p>The best thing I ever did was move from the US, I feel very sorry for what is going to happen to my once-great country if this behavior continues unchecked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Right now, the world reserve currency is the US Dollar. This is mainly because OPEC requires all oil deals to be done in the US dollar. Why? Because</p>

<p>2) We don&#39;t just sell our weapons to (just) anyone. Since you are doing us a favor and creating artificial demand for US dollars thanks to #1, we will sell you our weapons at a great discount thereby getting subsidized for gaining US dollars which of course, they plow into US treasuries as part of the deal.</p>

<p>3) With all of these US dollars, they can buy raw material easily and manufacture first world goods to sell tariff free in US markets to demanding consumers at high margins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well just think about the current alliances. It&#39;s Russia, Iran, and Syria vs. NATO and Sunni oil countries.</p>

<p>NATO all has Rothschild banks. Russia doesn&#39;t and it backs Iran and Syria which also do not.</p>

<p>Libya wanted a Pan-Afracanist gold-backed currency. This would have severely undermined the petro-dollar so we transformed Libya into an anarchist state and stole everything.</p>

<p>We tried to do the same in Syria. Qatar wanted to build a pipeline through Syria to Europe, which would directly undermine Russia&#39;s oil dealings with their ally Syria. But Russia and Iran couldn&#39;t let this happen, Syria was basically the last stand against Western and Sunni-funded jihadist mercenaries, and it would have taken away a majority of their markets.</p>

<p>So clearly these are all alliances of economic convenience.</p>

<p>i watch cnn, russia today, breitbart, fox news etc. all the propagandistic bullcrap because it&#39;s a very interesting case study of how manipulation is attempted</p>

<p>you on the other hand, seem very close minded and, besides considering everything anti trump as shilling and propaganda, probably believe that trump is going to kill soros, isis and the media with 2 ak47&#39;s in both of his hands.wake up call, he&#39;s part of the elite, just another snake in the swamp, despite his nice boy talk.</p>

<li><p>Ask yourself what you think the US would look like if the US elected a genuinely incredibly unpopular, controversial candidate with a significant majority opposing him ideologically</p></li>

<p>Which one of these two most accurately reflects the world today?</p>

<p>The MSM is corrupt as all hell and we should remain skeptical however the vast majority of reporting on Trump that I see center around what Trump says himself.

<p>He claims to be an individual who is antiglobalism, refuses to be politically correct, seems to be pushing forward initiatives to bring back jobs to America, and has a very tough stance on illegal immigration.</p>

<p>Europe is in the middle of a crisis at the moment due to the failing EU. Many countries are overrun by illegal immigrants who are an increasing burden on the economies, industry has been lost to outsourcing, we suffer from burdening EU policy that we are forced to accept even when it works against us, big banks have benefited tremendously, while our cultural strength, infrastructure, and identities crumble.</p>

<p>Many of us would love to have politicians like Trump who are ready and willing to fight back for the people.</p>

<p>Whether it will happen remains to be seen, but (much like Brexit) he is an inspiration to us that we still have the power to fight and take back our rights and our countries.</p>

<p>Many of us who are not American want Trump to succeed, and it is so sad to see that many Americans would rather see him fail as the nation divides itself.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t immediately jump to trust the &quot;Non-Americans are anti-trump&quot; narrative anymore than anything else that the media is claiming.</p>

<p>Except for the 60 million people who voted for him. Only a small percentage more voted for Clinton.</p>

<p>Except for the 60 million people who voted for him. And the millions of undecideds who are waiting to see what happens.</p>

<p>Probably, likely, NOPE, DEFINITELY NO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that is correct, but it was not Clinton. It was the entire political structure. </p>

<p>Obama&#39;s  hope was just meaningless words, things did  change, for the worse. </p>

<p>Race relations got dramatically worse, war theaters were exponentially expanded.</p>

<p>He even somehow prevented the normal post recession economic GDP bounce that happens after every deep recession. </p>

<p>Less than 3% a year for 8 years is horrible for a post recession growth. After the Great Depression we had some 20% growth years in the mid 30&#39;s, before war investment started.</p>

<p>Trump is a bombastic totally flawed guy. But he will be a change agent.</p>

But then when we come to find out what it is we hate about trump, all we can really think of is, &#39;he said some stuff that sounds mean&#39;.</p>

<p>Cause and effect, think hard about what Trump physically did that makes him steaming dog shit? Toupee? What overtly racist thing has he said? </p>

It&#39;s not the first time he put a woman in charge because she was <strong>actually fucking qualified to do the job</strong>... imagine that...</p>

<p>You&#39;ve never joked about grabbing a girls tits?  The reason why men joke about it is because you can&#39;t/don&#39;t actually do it.  So it&#39;s ironic to say so, thus the joke.</p>

<p>Get outta here with that feminist shame crap too.  The vast majority of men never assault women in their lives, and while some men do, feminism is all about politically inflating the significance of the problem.  Get right outta here.</p>

<p>&quot;Said some stuff that sounds mean&quot; is a funny way of saying &quot;Openly bragged about sexually assaulting women on tape&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also a funny way to say &quot;Openly pandered to racists by saying that all that Mexico sends is drugs, crime, and rape, which is not corroborated by <em>literally any</em> available evidence&quot;. </p>

<p>Also a funny way to say &quot;Literally wanted to ban people from the country solely because of their religion, which goes directly against the values for which this nation was founded in the first place&quot;.</p>

<p>Also a funny way to say &quot;Hounded the first black president with accusations that he was a secret Muslim born in Kenya who &#39;literally founded ISIS&#39;, despite having no evidence to corroborate his claims&quot;</p>

<p>Also a funny way to say &quot;Promised to take away the health insurance of 20 million people, many of whom <em>literally could not get healthcare under any circumstance before the ACA</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Also a funny way to say &quot;Promised on live television never to raise the minimum wage, and has a tax plan where the hyper-wealthy will benefit <em>substantially</em> more than anyone else possibly could&quot;</p>

<p>Try the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault$">literal definition of sexual assault</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sexual assault is any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think that president Trump asked and got explicit consent before he did the things he was bragging about? For some reason I doubt it. The statement &quot;they let you do it&quot; directly implies that he didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>And even if you argue that the consent was implied, that doesn&#39;t make any sense either. Unless the women he said he did these things to, by virtue of being around him, were giving implicit consent to be groped. </p>

<p>Ah, the all caps single statement. I see you get your ability to form clear, well thought out arguments from dear leader himself. </p>

<p>Why do you think the women he &quot;grabbed by the pussy&quot; &quot;let him do it&quot;? Was it because they were inviting this insanely attractive 60 year old man they secretly liked a lot to grope them? That they were fawning over the opportunity to get their pussy grabbed by this alpha male?</p>

<p>Who, by the by, was married with a pregnant wife at the time. </p>

<p>&quot;Letting him do it&quot; does not necessarily mean &quot;wanting him to do it&quot;. And &quot;wanting him to do it&quot; is kinda a key part of that whole &quot;consent&quot; thing you care so little about.

<p>That&#39;s literally not what he said. His exact words were &quot;The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese&quot;</p>

<p>Those are his <em>exact words</em>, verbatim. He didn&#39;t say &quot;parts of what people commonly believe about global warming are false&quot;. He didn&#39;t say &quot;China promotes the global warming narrative to hurt the US.</p>

<p>He said that the concept of global warming was created by the Chinese. Stop changing the exact words directly from Trump to make them more palatable.</p>

<p>If you hold a gun to someone&#39;s head, and as a result they let you do something, is this consent?</p>

<p>If not, why is it not consent?</p>

<p>Or, are you implying that it is impossible for literally anyone in the world to hold a gun to someone&#39;s head, and therefore alluding to the fact that such a situation can possibly exist in the world is necessarily &quot;fan fiction&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I notice how you refuse to make a statement on whether or not Truml was wrong when he propose revoking the citizenship of people who burn the flag. </p>

<p>Just as how you refused to provide a citation for children who got autism as a direct result of getting vaccinated. </p>

<p>Just as how you refused to comment on Trump stating that China created global warming, after it was pointed out that your defense of this statement literally was just saying he said something entirely different from his exact words.</p>

<p>This is a cool strategy you have here. &quot;Whenever they bring up anything about Trump that is difficult to defend, I&#39;m just going to pretend that they didn&#39;t say it at all&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re so reluctant to disagree with Trump on <em>anything</em> that your partisanship and bias blind you both to reality and critical thinking. Or thinking at all.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s words are your reality, and they are always necessarily right, in your eyes. And if they aren&#39;t, if you are capable of the barest of independent thought, then I defy you to name <em>literally anything</em> Trump has said or done that you disagree with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it&#39;s a hate thats hard to justify. There&#39;s a whole lot of hypocrisy there when compared to the Clintons. The hate for him seems to be based on people who think he&#39;s rude or un-PC, and this has only multiplied by the liberal echo-chamber that is the MSM. The rants of racism or bigotry just don&#39;t hold up under the spotlight.</p>

<p>And especially undeserved when you look at what the Clintons have done in their time in office. All of the scandals going back to Arkansas, the middle east in ruins, Hillary cheating in the election with the press, bff&#39;s with terror nation Saudi Arabia, all of Bill&#39;s rape allegations.</p>

<p>And now it&#39;s become more apparent that the Clinton Foundation is up to their eyeballs in shady activity in Haiti. The worst has yet to be revealed it seems... all of this makes the Trump hate a little hard to understand when you attempt to be unbiased.</p>

<p>Of course the average liberal wouldn&#39;t be aware of most of the things wrong with this picture if they get their news from NYTimes, WaPo, HuffPo, Slate, Atlantic, or Daily Beast... They have a narrative, and any criticism of the establishment is not part of it.</p>

<p>Real propaganda is when you lie to people to convince them a foreign country is their enemy without showing any proof, and trying to start wars without proof. Like most preceding presidencies. Lots of hate for them too?</p>

<p>There&#39;s your problem, you don&#39;t think anything outside of that definition is propaganda?  Or are you just using hyperbole like I was when I said I hated him for it, you&#39;re right to say that is too heavy handed.

    <div class="md"><p>But what was the propaganda? You&#39;re saying he told a lie and that was propaganda? I really don&#39;t even know what the lie was so feel free to clue me in. </p>

<p>Propaganda is psychological tactics used against the masses to enact large scale action. Brainwashing... if you&#39;re outraged that you found a lie in politics, then you are definitely not seeing the whole picture.</p>

<p>You&#39;re using the word hate and I can&#39;t figure out why... and yes hitler references seem to come up quite often when liberals justify their hate. Sorry to assume you&#39;d do the same, wasn&#39;t trying to deflect. I&#39;m really trying to understand the Great Hate point of view.</p>

<p>I am not a mindless Trump drone, and will be skeptical of everything he does. I know that he has Zionist ties which I do like at all... I voted for Obama twice and have been liberal my whole life... I support peace with Russia and that does not make me anything but sane and rational.</p>

<p>It sounds like you&#39;re talking about the photo that was taken before the inauguration began that people are arguing over how many people where there.

He hired Manafort as his campaign manager despite Manafort&#39;s scandal in Ukraine, and continued to let him live in Trump tower and take advice from him after firing him over the summer. He has disrespected and stereotyped women, pows, people with disabilities as well as religious and ethnic minorities. He has refused to release his tax returns and has yet to separate himself from his business interests. He also bullies journalists and has no respect for free press. I could go on and on and on really. There is so much to hate about Trump and his entire stinking cabinet, and as we speak they are working on more reasons like repealing the ACA and weakening NATO. </p>

<p>At some point you Trump supporters are going to have to face the fact that you are a small extremely unpopular minority, and this is not going to be a quiet presidency. Liberals are going to flip their shit more loudly and visibly than ever before. But enjoy your victory.</p>

<p>Okay, there is a rule for every political sub on reddit, that includes Bernie&#39;s and Hillary&#39;s where you aren&#39;t allowed to post dissent. It&#39;s <em>supposed</em> to be a cheer leader sub. That&#39;s what every pro-candidate sub on reddit is for and they all say it in their side-bar rules.</p>

<p>Can you tell me some real news organizations?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no such thing as a &quot;real&quot; new organization. There&#39;s two ways of looking at it: </p>

<p>A) The r/conspiracy way. News is controlled by tptb that promote a marxist, pro corp agenda. Evidence would be Operation Mockingbird.</p>

<p>B) All news sources information that they put out is restricted by their bias, therefore you should never take their word for it. You should go to the actors the news org is reporting on and listen to what they have to say, and then base your opinion on what they say and the context around it. </p>

<p>Also, you can&#39;t add that he&#39;s protecting jobs to the list... He really isn&#39;t. Ford was already keeping one plant and scrapping the oth r. Carrier moved 
More jobs than they kept!</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m not a fan of tpp, but the reason is completely different. I think it gives too much power to corporations over sovereignty of nations and allows abuses of the planet.  Somehow I doubt trump cares about that part.</p>

<li>good. I also doubt it will happen</li>
<li>and lose the republican party a huge revenue stream? not happening</li>
<li>you act like border security was somehow lax under obama. There is no evidence of this. unless you believe propaganda (Fox news, breitbart, red state etc. cnn, msnbc etc are all propaganda too, of course)</li>
<li>I&#39;m highly skeptical of this. He&#39;s only very recently become president, so there is plenty of time to prove me wrong. But the case I&#39;m informed on, with Carrier, was a sham. We have no Idea if the jobs that stayed in the US were going to leave or stay, but 2/3rds or more still left, and the company got a huge subsidy from the state. Trump said he&#39;d threaten tariffs, not give subsidies. You&#39;ve been fooled.</li>

<p>If you post pro Trump things in any of those subreddits, your post won&#39;t be removed. It just won&#39;t get very far, because Trump is wildly unpopular on this website outside of the Trump subreddit. It isn&#39;t because the mods of these subreddits are biased against Trump, it is because the userbase is.</p>

<p>Why do you think <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> has some of the most strictly enforced rules found on the entirety of this website when it comes to straying from the narrative?</p>

<p>Because the mods their know that allowing anything remotely like dissenting opinions is allowing their subreddit to be overrun with people who dislike Trump, because most people on this website dislike Trump. </p>

<p>Alright, that&#39;s the crux of where we disagree. Even though the mods of the defaults are liberal, the admins who work for reddit are liberal, the owners of reddit are liberal, and their BOSSES are liberal, you still think they don&#39;t restrict anti-liberal content on this site.

<p>Same as politics, SRS and reddit_relationships? What makes the_Donald so special compared to those subs with the safe space argument?</p>

<p>A good example of a sub is theredpill by comparison, bans and timeouts only come along for those that blatantly breach the rules of that sub (one example is asking personal questions in the main sub, those belong in one of their other subs called asktrp).</p>

<p>Moderation is not done in that sub from a position of bias but purely on those that would disrupt the constructive discussion that occurs within that sub, something I think many other places could learn by example (lurk for a month, and read the sidebar along with the top 100 posts of all time to get a feel of the sub before you weigh up how moderation affects the subs performance).</p>

<p>Only major thing I see missing in the sidebar there is a link to &#39;the gentlepersons... guide&#39;, as linked on the conspiracy sub sidebar, though the shaming tactics link over there is a good substitute.</p>

<p>T_D was also the <em>only</em> place on this entire website that would make <em>hundreds</em> of sticky posts a day in a very explicit attempt to get posts to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> by taking advantage of Reddit&#39;a voting algorithm.</p>

<p>They would sticky brand new posts so they would get lots of upvotes early on, and getting votes early substantially increases your chances of getting to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. The votes you get in the first five minutes matter more than all the votes you&#39;d get in the next 30.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the mods would even tell users to delete their post and resubmit it, just so they could sticky it and make sure it got to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.</p>

<p>T_D was literally the only place on this entire website abusing this feature like this. If any other sub does something similar, they should get the same treatment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They also can only have 2 (I think) posts reach /all at any given time, though this often doesn&#39;t work because of the subs upvote conditioning. Another rule that only applies to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is <em>objectively false</em>.</p>

<p>What is true is that the admins changed the voting algorithm so that <em>no single subreddit</em>, not just T_D, could dominate r/all as easily. Basically, the more posts <strong>any</strong> subreddit has on r/all, the harder it is for other posts to get on r/all.</p>

<p>It applies to everyone, not just T_D. And they made this change because, back when T_D was allowed to abuse stickies, <em>literally 80% of r/all</em> would be from T_D at some times. And <em>most</em> Reddit users would rather not have r/all be that dominated by <em>any</em> subreddit.</p>

<p>Especially a political one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Three things.</p>

<p>One, that&#39;s not true. We made a whole subreddit entirely devoted to making fun of how spammy the Bernie community got, and that community had a significant amount of subscribers.</p>

<p>Two, the Bernie subreddit <strong>never</strong> abused Reddit&#39;s stickies the way T_D did as common practice, <em>hundreds</em> of times every single day.</p>

<p>And three, even at the height of Bernie&#39;s popularity on Reddit, the Bernie subreddit was not on r/all nearly as much as T_D. The day after the Pulse nightclub shooting, the frontpage of r/all was <em>literally indistinguishable</em> from the front page of T_D.</p>

<p>You have to understand that it even being <em>possible</em> for your general purpose page to be indistinguishable from a political community is not something that most of your users will not like. That&#39;s why they changed it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, in hindsight I should have done a straight libertarian ticket on the senators and everyone else as well, because I&#39;m naturally libertarian-leaning. But I was just so caught up in the bullshit that I voted for Trump in spite of the media and everyone else who was telling me not to. The phony polls were also an obvious attempt to discourage people from voting and that really pissed me off, I felt like I had to stick it to them. Kind of regret not voting third party now.</p>

<p>To be honest, I was almost going to vote for him at some point in time.  But it really did become increasingly clear to me that the guy is very untrustworthy.</p>

<p>Plus, posters on here point out vote manipulation on Reddit.  I thank them for that.</p>

<p>With Trump, I think the general consensus on the sub is that Hilary is a criminal of epic proportions and that Trump does have stances that seem to be anti-establishment.  I think most on here are hoping he carries through with those things but we wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he is just another puppet.  Actions speak louder than words.  We shall see.</p>

<p>Reddit has been on the backward slide into MSM for years. We are the boiling frogs, and I&#39;m pretty sure r/conspiracy is the current pot on the burner. Too many subscribers not to. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember all of the specifics but when Digg sold out and everyone migrated to reddit (self included), there were constant outage issues. Many people gave up thinking reddit sucked only to come back later and find it working. </p>

<p>I find it astounding that his supporters are surprised by this. Even if you support him you should not be surprised by the large amount of backlash he is facing.</p>

<p>Just take a step back for a second and maybe consider that he is not perceived in the same way by a majority of the world as he is by his supporters. </p>

<p>You will also hand-wave this away as with the link above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know when someone is looking to re-enforce and push their own views instead of having a good-faith argument. </p>

<p>I provided you some examples which in my mind, a reasonable impartial person would see as CLEAR evidence of manipulation and brigading.</p>

<p>But here have a thread titled <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/59ykl1/when_they_go_downvote_we_go_upvote/">WHEN THEY GO DOWNVOTE WE GO UPVOTE</a> and clearly pointing to a post. </p>

<p>But no, you won&#39;t accept this either because reasons.</p>

<p>And you refused to answer whether the other examples were clear evidence of social media manipulation, because you know the answer is &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<p>Have a good one, just know that people with 2 brain cells to rub together know exactly what you&#39;re doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did you respond to the same question twice?  Are you that eager for conflict?</p>

<p>It would be hard to provide proof, since brigading is against the rules of the site, and any public display results in the immediate ban of the user.</p>

<p>But every post about #Pizzagate before the ban was accompanied by extreme brigading, as well as the public support of spreading and upvoting the infographics wherever possible.  I think plenty of people here will remember that, without needing me to link proof.</p>

<p>I&#39;d wager that there was a considerable amount of overlap between Pizzagate and the donald too, especially since it was a politically biased conspiracy theory aimed against Hillary and her staff.</p>

<p>You see, their mistake is this <em>aristocratic entitlement syndrome</em> where they think everyone else who went through public school are 100% under their spell, but they forget the fact that we have drugs and that drugs break mind control.  LOL  no really.  We go through a very real sophomoric phase of believing in the illuminati as &#39;shadowy figures&#39;, then we emerge from plato&#39;s cave and realize not only is the illuminati very real, we can actually name them and yet we can nonetheless do nothing about it without any real power</p>

<p>This is where we find ourselves in the panopticon, the matrix.  We get redpilled but we don&#39;t get our phone call just yet.  We don&#39;t know where the phone is.</p>

<p>We&#39;re stuck in Neo&#39;s apartment with an ID saying 9/11/2001 and being told to follow the white rabbit, which basically means more drugs.  Only don&#39;t follow their advice, drugs aren&#39;t the answer, only mushrooms.  The mushroom is the key to all this.  It will help you find Jesus within and what role you are to play, and will give you roadmaps for the way out</p>

<p>This can all be won with the stroke of a pen, and with your pen, which in the modern age means video--strangely enough--and so keep piling on dissenting opinion until the social pressure breaks the bough of the status quo and lets the truth wash away all our collective bullshit, creating a clean space, a <em>mise en place</em> from which we can create a new future</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, downvoted, not censored. There&#39;s a huge fucking difference between the two. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve got a false impression that what goes on in t_d can&#39;t be refuted because it&#39;s censored. Post in an uncensored sub, the argument you&#39;re pushing gets completely destroyed. That&#39;s why it&#39;s downvote. </p>

<p>I challenge you to a game. I&#39;ll post something in t_d that&#39;s completely false and wrong and easily disproveable. You use a throwaway (or your main if you&#39;re brave enough) to refute me. See how quick you&#39;re banned. I&#39;ll bet less than 30 mins and I won&#39;t even report you. </p>

<p>There&#39;s some genuinely good and important discussion in there but it&#39;s drowned out by lies, doublethink and hypocrisy. So when you exit the bubble and that easy to demolish lie you believe is threatened, it&#39;s a shock. And you end up with threads like this. </p>

<p>The exact fucking shit we have Clinton, rightfully, hell for. </p>

<p>We spent 8 years complaining about the mainstream media ignoring corruption and then when they wake up and start covering it, it&#39;s a fucking conspiracy? </p>

<p>Trump fanatics scare the shit out of me for blindly accepting his shit because most of them were the sceptics before he arrived. Now they&#39;re drones. </p>

<p>For the sub that&#39;s in it, here&#39;s my theory which I&#39;ll probably put into its own thread... </p>

<p>The elites want to control the world. The sceptics and free thinkers are poking and prodding. Solution, install a puppet that the sceptics and trolls will rally around so as to discredit any legitimate investigation that they&#39;re known for. Sound about right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The left lost badly this year.  Part of the reason for that is because they cannot control social media like they do with legacy media (newspaper, tv).  They will not allow that to happen again.  Their goal is to suppress all non-sanctioned opinion from social media, through either outright censorship or a barrage of propaganda across all platforms.  We have already seen the censorship on google, twitter, facebook, and reddit.  And, as you say, we can also see the massive propaganda effort being pushed even on non-political subs.  </p>

<p>Anyone who has read wikileaks should recognize what&#39;s happening.  Podesta&#39;s buddies talked about keeping people uninformed and compliant, and pushing people into strong echo chambers so that they could control the messaging.  What we are seeing now is this strategy being taken to the extreme out of desperation.  </p>

Just today I&#39;ve discovered one shill who&#39;s account is 2 months old and his post history is literally all anti-Trump shit in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. Then I experimented a few times with what is and isn&#39;t allowed to be said. </p>

<p>I discovered that anything about Seth Rich or Clinton cheating her way through the primaries is automatically hidden. They have algorithms in place to detect and block it. I&#39;m sure there are dozens if not hundreds of other topics/key words that they filter out as well. The only subs I don&#39;t think are infiltrated are the non-politics and non-news subs, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>The moderators more than likely get paid a fat chunk of cash to implement these policies by a variety of interests and corporations with similar or the same goals. This site has gone completely off the charts and is now censored on a daily basis, free speech is shunned, and any non-MSM sources are immediately labeled fake news.</p>

<p>Only reason I keep coming back is for this sub (until it too becomes compromised) and a few others like <a href="/r/nootropics">/r/nootropics</a> whose communities are dead on Voat. Really is a sad state of affairs.</p>

<li>Disagree and you end up being shown as evidence supporting the argument.</li>
</ul>

<p>My answer to this is simply that people on both sides feel oppressed. Conservatives on the social media side (Their thoughts, opinions, and protests get downvoted to oblivion), and Liberals on the federal side (Their thoughts, opinions, and protests are essentially unable to ever make a big difference). I&#39;ll leave it at that for this moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is president of the United States. Have you forgotten? &quot;It isn&#39;t who gets elected, it&#39;s who gets selected&quot;. Reverse psychology does exist, just because MSM &quot;hates&quot; Trump, doesn&#39;t mean he is on our side. You can&#39;t possibly be that gullible. and what you said about pushing one-sided narratives, look at yourself!!! You&#39;re doing the same fucking thing. Why the fuck should we trust him? Huh? Because he says some shit you like and he makes a few promises?? Hmmm sounds like EVERY fucking president before him. I mean seriously, you people are stuck in a cycle; &quot;Oh THIS TIME it&#39;ll be different! He promised!!!&quot;.... makes me sad. They&#39;ve got the masses stuck in that endless loop, believing that just voting another man in a suit into office will fix our problems. Have we not learned?? We should ALWAYS remain skeptical of people in power, WHOEVER they may be, because even IF Trump was on our side, people DO switch teams and change their minds or accept bribes or become corrupt, ect. Blind faith and patience will not get our freedom back. If you believe that, you must be full of naivety or very, VERY ignorant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does no one remember PoGate? Aaron Swartz?</p>

<p>Reddit has been on the backward slide into MSM for years. We are the boiling frogs, and I&#39;m pretty sure r/conspiracy is the current pot on the burner. Too many subscribers not to. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve started dabbling on Voat, but it feels like leaving Reddit completely would be like leaving the war for the circle-jerk. Don&#39;t get me wrong, we need the work being done over there and Chan and anywhere else - I just feel my shitposting is still needed here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. There has not been a single time where someone else telling me bad things about him made me dislike him for something.</p>

<p>It has ALWAYS been videos of himself and tweets of himself etc..</p>

<p>Why is it soooooo hard to believe for some of his supporters that he is seen in a negative light because of HIS OWN ACTIONS?</p>

<p>And it gets even weirder when people try to paint this picture of him being such a saint MSM &quot;changing the narrative&quot;.</p>

<p>Like &quot;he did not mock a disabled reporter, just mocks people all the time and this is is way of mocking people!&quot; Oh okay...NOW I feel better about our preisdent acting like an overgrown toddler...</p>

<p>Can his supporters not just accept that <strong>maybe</strong> doing this things makes him look horrible by his own doing?</p>
