Just because I&#39;m not normal doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m insane. I hit the ripe age and got diagnosed. 19 years old. That&#39;s a prime time for such developments. I am aware of this. I choose to rule over my life, and only occasionally do my delusions get bad enough that I see things. I&#39;m okay without the meds.

I ask because I have seen various things that i feel certain if I told a &#39;medical professional&#39;, that they would immediately attempt to prescribe some kind of zombie pill for me to take.

    <div class="md"><p>I started off just hearing things. Not even hearing. My thoughts would overlap. They&#39;d be too much. My mind would always be racing. </p>

<p>Then I saw blood. Lots of it. Everywhere. I thought violent things that didn&#39;t make me feel upset until I gained control again. I saw my family dying. My friends dying. This was almost a vision. That landed me in a psyche ward for four days. I got passed those thoughts. That was a buildup of stress and negative energy. </p>

<p>Now I see things that kind of vary. I snap my fingers and then extend my palm and a flame appears. It won&#39;t actually light my cigarette, but it&#39;s beautiful. I see colors sometimes. Just a hue of purple or blue. Not sure why yet. I&#39;ve seen people. People that &quot;don&#39;t exist&quot; but I firmly believe I&#39;m observing spirits or entities of some kind. </p>
