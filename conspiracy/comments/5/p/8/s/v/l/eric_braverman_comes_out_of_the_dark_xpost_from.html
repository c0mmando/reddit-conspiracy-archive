    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t know the story, in the Podesta Emails, Neera Tanden emailed Podesta about who told Ron Fournier to &quot;Follow the money&quot; regarding his investigation into the Clinton Foundation. She told Podesta that they should keep an eye on Doug Brand. responded with two words &quot;ERIC BRAVERMAN&quot;. That email came to light on October 7th. On October 12th, Braverman fell off the face of the Earth. A story came out that Braverman was hiding at the Russian Embassy seeking emergency asylum. Implication was, he was supposedly on the run from a Killary Kill Squad. HAHAHA For my original post:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started to watch one of his Braverman Videos. Couldn&#39;t finish watching. My problem with George Webb is that if he doesn&#39;t take the time to get names right(which is easy), then how can I trust any of his <strong>REAL</strong> research. I am referring to a video where he calls &quot;Debbie Wasserman Schultz&quot; &quot;DIANNE WASHINGTON SCHULTZ&quot;, and just before that, he says &quot;the DNC Hacks&quot; and couldn&#39;t even remember when the fuck they happened. I had to go watch a bigfoot video for more reality. lulz</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t post a ton here, so y&#39;all likely don&#39;t know JUST HOW fucking weird this is. I have access to some skip tracing sites and software. I got everything I could find for Braverman and his husband Neil Brown. I have about a dozen emails and several phone numbers. I have a bunch of his relatives as well.</p>

<p>I started by emailing several of the addresses I had. <strong>NOTHING</strong>. I then emailed three separate people in Yale&#39;s Human Resources Dept. <strong>NOT ONE REPLY.</strong> I then emailed the Office of Dr. Salovey (President of Yale). His Chief of Staff responded asking <strong>&quot;In what capacity was I asking about Prof Braverman&#39;s Situation?</strong> I explained the &quot;Podesta Email..then darkness&quot;, and said I didn&#39;t personally know Prof Braverman, and this wasn&#39;t official, but any assistance she could give would be greatly appreciated. It took about a week for her to reply--- <strong>&quot;Everything is completely in order regarding Mr. Braverman and his class at Yale.&quot;</strong> I thought &quot;WOW, that said a lot of nothing. But it didn&#39;t show any kind of worry about him, so I let it drop. In the meantime, I emailed his mom, and explained, asking if she had any input. <strong>Nothing but crickets chirping.</strong> It had been about four days, and yesterday he started tweeting again. </p>

<p>The funny thing about his tweets is that he only ever tweeted about once every two or three months. On the 19th, he started tweeting like mad. Actually, he only tweeted once about the new job, but retweeted a bunch.</p>

<p>Very unusual indeed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Working for Schmidt?  That&#39;s certainly a weird coincidence.</p>

<p>I suppose I knew that Schmidt and Thiel now both work for the CIA.  If Braverman is leaking info to hurt the DNC, then we can assume that the CIA was running the election campaign and put their weight behind Trump through both Thiel and Schmidt.  If that&#39;s the case, then we ended up with the intelligence community version of the NWO.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible that he caught wind of the conspiracy regarding his disappearance and is just making his presence known.  That&#39;s probably the simplest answer.</p>
