       "I believe the key to a better world is the transparency of those in power. Whether it is through financial or political means those who seek power from the people must remain accoutable to those they represent. In our current system those in power are allowed to be the most secretive and as we know with more power the pressure to corrupt becomes stronger. To help ourselves we must help dissuade those in power from the temptations of corruption by making them completely transparent and accountable to the people who elected them as representatives of their beliefs, who all know in their hearts what is right and wrong. That is why I would like to put the power back into the hands of the common righteous men and women by requiring all politicians to wear body cameras or be video recorded at all times to ensure we the people are in fact being represented truthfully. Part of volunteering for a political position should be the sacrifice of freedom by that politician for as long as they are in power, because if they truly are in it for good reasons they have nothing to hide. End secrecy of authority. Give power back to the people, where it belongs. Every signature share or like is one step closer to a real solution and peaceful political revolution"

       i dig this idea.  as a general design it sucks (expecting others to meet expectations we cannot meet - introduces a Hero Slope design.  the birth of bigotry).  but from a functional transparency perspective it's a really interesting temporary burden whose benefit scales hugely.

       Could you elaborate on what you mean by general design? As I see it this petition is simply proposing the idea and not offering an actual design. How a system like this would work legally and technically I assume would be figured out at a later date, if the idea could actually catch on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If in fact, that's what you were referring to by general design.

       If they have to redact 25 year old documents to avoid releasing information to the public that could cause difficulties... I'm sure that live streaming the President would be much more damaging.

       Well if elect officials were forced to wear body cams 24/7 then obviously it couldn't be live streamed... just like cops don't live stream... so you'd run into the same issues with post event censoring. It just don't work stop being silly.

       I know you REALLY want everyone to trust the FBI but until they prove they can be trusted why should we? They have literally helped cover up the stuff you claim they are getting ready to expose. Give one good reason they deserve the people's trust without a fundamental change in transparency.

       Anything short of this and it will remain business as usual and some alphabet agency throws the people a bone by strategically throwing someone under the bus once in a while to earn back their trust. All the while continuing the cover up for their croney capitalist, neo con, globalist handlers.

       Until I see the real conspirators in cuffs I will continue to assume that the FBI is in their pockets still. When did they suddenly gain credibility amongst the skeptics of authority? I appreciate what your doing in attempting to show that there are in fact still good guys fighting in the shadows for good, but at this point I have seen nothing whatsoever to come to that conclusion myself. The FBI was compromised to evil interests long ago and I've seen nothing to suggest thats changed. Please enlighten me on how they are any different than the other alphabets.

       On a more serious note, we
       <em>

       require all politicians without exception to take a lie detector test while under an MRI and to swear alliegance to people and to america as well.

       I'm not being pedantic, Hollywood has instilled in a lot of people the idea that polygraphs can actually detect lies. They can't, they detect physiological changes which are then interpreted through the power of pseudoscience.

       You're right. People can train to beat a polygraph, but I say why not. Throw in there too for the hell of it.

       We must install 'heart plugs' as soon as we can . As requested by Baron Hakonnen . nobody would accept a heart plug voluntarily, but apparently for both Harkonnens and their slaves it is mandatory. I assume they give you no options.

       Sounds fair to me...any way to weed out the crooks who only volunteer for public office to take advantage for selfish reasons. Public service should be a righteous self sacrifice for the betterment of everyone. Not a con job.

       I'd be happy to just see his tax returns! 
Plus he might forget to turn the camera off when he takes a piss (or gets pissed on)...and neither is something I'd want to risk seeing.
