       I hate to go there, but this is my ultimate conclusion as well.  There's a parasitic mutation of humans that live to decieve and have a long term plan to enslave global humanity.  That's how they can continue generation after generation without needing to see the end goal themselves, how multiple groups can all be in on it, how they can all keep it secret.  And I'm not religious, but everything in the Bible isn't necessarily religious, it's just ancient wisdom.  And it tells us "the devil" works here on Earth through deception and "God" sits back and requires us to figure it out on our own.

       For someone not religious you seem to have a pretty good grasp on the general concept. Even a lot of Christians don't understand this point. They ask why God let's bad things a happen. Well God gave us dominion and authority in this world, and gave us an advisary. Then he stepped back and is letting us prove that we are worthy of greater gifts. We have the tools to free this world, we just need to will and righteousness to use them. Recognition of the enemy is the first step.

       There is an alternate version of the Book of Genesis which was banned by the church, in the Nag Hammadi scrolls called "On The Origin Of The World".
      </p>
      <p>
       It starts by saying: I know the stories you have been told. I am telling you they are incorrect. Here is the true story.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this version, God is a blind and jealous god. He thinks he is the only god, but he is wrong; there are many greater gods before him. He creates the immortal Adam and Eve, and then recognizes that they have the ability to become gods themselves. This makes him afraid and jealous, so he bans them from eating from the Tree of Knowledge, and tells them they will die if they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no Satan in this story; there is a different character, the Beast. The Beast is the wisest of all creatures. He teaches Adam and Eve many things. He tells Adam and Eve the truth; God is jealous. If you eat from the tree, it will not kill you; you will become as wise and powerful as the gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they eat; God becomes afraid and jealous. In his jealousy he casts them out of Paradise and curses them with mortality.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read some of these banned books, my understanding is that your soul is banned to hell; however exceptions may be made for scholars.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this sub, at least some of us are scholars. As scholars, everything is on the table; no idea, thought or knowledge is forbidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Bibles, there is story after story about how God strikes down men in anger; wipes out entire cities, or floods the entire planet destroying 99% of living men and creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is our job to ask: how many wars are fought, how many people are killed in the name of God or Allah; how many wars are fought, how many people are killed in the name of Satan?
      </p>
      <p>
       Me? I believe these bibles are a way for mankind to pass down knowledge and morality like any other myth; they become combined, translated, and sometimes twisted along the way as men change the stories to suit their needs. Then they are translated, and translated again. The stories are often held up as an example of the Truth, and used by those who would have you believe they are Righteous, in order to have the weak minded do their bidding. There are no words of god here; only the words of men.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only evil that exists on earth is the evil in the hearts of men. There is no heaven; there is no hell. There is only here and now. All of us have only one life, one chance: do with it what you will. Make it count.

       Oh I'm very aware of that. I simply think that if we "believe" that narrative, we must give recognition to the possibility that the great deceiver is god. Why else would blind faith be required, unless the purpose is deception?

       The thing about faith. Once you have it, it stops being blind. If anything, it is very much eye opening, speaking from experience. You start seeing the patterns and movements and then there are the gifts of the spirit.

       I was raised by a former nun, in a Roman Catholic household, in a province that I believe may possibly have the highest per capita priest to pedophile ratio on the entire planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking from experience, the thing about faith is that it makes people blind to pedophiles who seek out positions and institutions of trust in order to fuck children. I see lots of patterns and movements and "gifts of the spirit", for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was one of the lucky ones; the indiscretions I witnessed and was part of were fairly small, relatively speaking, but even so no one in my community would ever have believed a word of it, not even my own sister.
      </p>
      <p>
       The human mind is a pattern recognition machine. It sees patterns, where there are none. This is how the  mind virus of religion gains entry and control over the weak minded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faith does help in some ways, in dealing with fear. In many ways it's similar to telling a child a bed time story so that they sleep at night. It really makes you feel better, but faith doesn't actually do much when the monsters you're fighting are real, they are pillars of your community.

       You are a member of the Cult of Christ. In reality, there probably was no individual man "Jesus" which all of these myths describe. Rather, many myths became combined over time to create a single identity. Your "relationship with Jesus" is fictional; it exists only in your mind. You are having a "relationship" with your own mind.

       I prefer the truth, or as close as I can get, with it's cracks, imperfections and pimples; I don't believe in the Truth.

This is the main reason why there is so much atrocity and lack in this world. They are produced by cabal members (on the surface) and negative entities (on the etheric and astral planes) to keep us/our consciousness in this low frequency 3D matrix.
