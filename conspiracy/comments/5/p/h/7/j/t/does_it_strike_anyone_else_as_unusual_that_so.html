       All 3 of the guys in rural mississippi? No, I doubt anyone is worried about a nonexistent threat. Even if it was actionary, investigations always prove that neo-nazi's are usually jewish kids self hating...the KKK always turn up to be some black troll burning down black churches, etc..etc..etc..

       The news exists quite literally to tell you that hate is around us and the boogey man is real.  It reinforces in us that we need them and politics to save us from each other.  At some point in your awakening (and maybe it's already happened) it'll click and you'll realize that we people are light and that the darkness is used to control us.  We are good,  we are one,  and you are me.

       The conspiracy is why tf do you think white racial awareness means KKK and Nazis? No one here is invading Poland.

       Try to figure out why broke white dudes from nowhere Kansas get the muzzle when they learn they have to join the identity wars while they still can, and why a buck toothed clock making wahabbist gets the megaphone.

       IT just strikes me as odd that they (White power groups) are suddenly so vocal like who fucking cares who they support? They didn't come out like this when Bush ran in 2000. Just kinda stinks to me that the MSM and whoever else is painting him as a white supremacist/Nazi/what have you and I just don't see it. But maybe I just don't know. Everyone is convinced that he is suddenly going to run everyone out of the country or stick them in internment camps if they aren't white, which any sane person knows is ridiculous. This election has shown just how insane people can truly be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know I was just thinking out loud. There is no proof of any conspiracy it's just a theory that came to me. More like a showerthought to be honest.

       I just assumed it is groups with waning relevance and power, flexing their social media skills to get hits and views.  I don't care what they say any more than if they said the KKK loves to eat rice.  Indians, asians, and me will still eat rice regardless to the face that KKK people love to eat rice too.

       You perhaps need to revisit the original definition of fascism.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.

       My point is there is no evidence that Trump's regime has any plans to take over business interests for the US government.
      </p>
      <p>
       And fascism for the US which is a pretty diverse melting pot would be what? European ancestry? Native American?

       Fascism has a specific definition that doesn't apply to the US.

       according to the Anti-Defamation League, first of all.  If you think they matter in the least, you've been lied to/you've fallen for the exact false narrative they wanted you to.  It'd be nice if overt racists didn't exist, but they do (in the VAST minority btw). They always endorse someone, and it obviously wasn't going to be HRC no matter who was opposing.  What's your point?

       Stephen Bannon, the chairman of Breitbart Media was head of Trump's election campaign. Breitbart calls themselves "The Voice of the Alt Right". You can check out the alt-right subreddit here, they are neo-nazis and they barely try to hide it.

       This is how the hate groups are attracted to Trump. His campaign generaly avoids overt racism but uses a lot of dog-whistle terms like "inner-city" and "law and order" which lets these people know that he is aligned with their views.

       Nazi/KKK/White Supremacists are capable of holding political beleifs like any othet person. Trump won them over when he bad mouthed Mexico and started talking about the border wall. It makes perfect sense that those groups would choose Trump over Clinton. No conspiracy theories needed.

       We ran into some during the campaign. Had to kick some infiltrators out of our group for trying to get everyone into "white nationalism" (which is funny, because white nationalists don't talk like this).

       I don't find it strange. Someone comes along that represents some ideas or maybe a lot of ideas, that's similar to the klans and what not, so they root on him and vocally support him. They might see him as a free "get out of jail card" in terms of what you are allowed to say out in the open

       They're shill groups paid for by leftists.  The REAL KKK anyway is so cuckolded that they now allow LGBT and other races.

       No I wanted non biased views about this. I realize that people will be biased anyway but at least here you wont get banned for having an anti trump view.

       IT just strikes me as odd that they (White power groups) are suddenly so vocal like who fucking cares who they support? They didn't come out like this when Bush ran in 2000. Just kinda stinks to me that the MSM and whoever else is painting him as a white supremacist/Nazi/what have you and I just don't see it. But maybe I just don't know. Everyone is convinced that he is suddenly going to run everyone out of the country or stick them in internment camps if they aren't white, which any sane person knows is ridiculous. This election has shown just how insane people can truly be.

       I don't know I was just thinking out loud. There is no proof of any conspiracy it's just a theory that came to me. More like a showerthought to be honest.
