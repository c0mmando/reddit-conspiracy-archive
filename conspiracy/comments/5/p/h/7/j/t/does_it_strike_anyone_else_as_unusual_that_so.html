    <div class="md"><p>IT just strikes me as odd that they (White power groups) are suddenly so vocal like who fucking cares who they support? They didn&#39;t come out like this when Bush ran in 2000. Just kinda stinks to me that the MSM and whoever else is painting him as a white supremacist/Nazi/what have you and I just don&#39;t see it. But maybe I just don&#39;t know. Everyone is convinced that he is suddenly going to run everyone out of the country or stick them in internment camps if they aren&#39;t white, which any sane person knows is ridiculous. This election has shown just how insane people can truly be. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know I was just thinking out loud. There is no proof of any conspiracy it&#39;s just a theory that came to me. More like a showerthought to be honest. </p>

<p>You perhaps need to revisit the original definition of fascism.</p>

<p>A political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like why is Trump being labeled a Nazi by the left? People claiming he is racist and kkk and nazi and if you support him you are too. It&#39;s like what the fuck is going on with people?  like that guy said, a tiny insignificant group pledged support for Trump so that makes Trump a white supremacist? It isn&#39;t like he can control who supports him right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stephen Bannon, the chairman of Breitbart Media was head of Trump&#39;s election campaign. Breitbart calls themselves &quot;The Voice of the Alt Right&quot;. You can check out the alt-right subreddit here, they are neo-nazis and they barely try to hide it.</p>

<p>This is how the hate groups are attracted to Trump. His campaign generaly avoids overt racism but uses a lot of dog-whistle terms like &quot;inner-city&quot; and &quot;law and order&quot; which lets these people know that he is aligned with their views.</p>

Trump won them over when he bad mouthed Mexico and started talking about the border wall. It makes perfect sense that those groups would choose Trump over Clinton. No conspiracy theories needed.</p>

<p>We ran into some during the campaign. Had to kick some infiltrators out of our group for trying to get everyone into &quot;white nationalism&quot; (which is funny, because white nationalists don&#39;t talk like this).</p>

Someone comes along that represents some ideas or maybe a lot of ideas, that&#39;s similar to the klans and what not, so they root on him and vocally support him.

    <div class="md"><p>IT just strikes me as odd that they (White power groups) are suddenly so vocal like who fucking cares who they support? They didn&#39;t come out like this when Bush ran in 2000. Just kinda stinks to me that the MSM and whoever else is painting him as a white supremacist/Nazi/what have you and I just don&#39;t see it. But maybe I just don&#39;t know. Everyone is convinced that he is suddenly going to run everyone out of the country or stick them in internment camps if they aren&#39;t white, which any sane person knows is ridiculous. This election has shown just how insane people can truly be. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know I was just thinking out loud. There is no proof of any conspiracy it&#39;s just a theory that came to me. More like a showerthought to be honest. </p>
