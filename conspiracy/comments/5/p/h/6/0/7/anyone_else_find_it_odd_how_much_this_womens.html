    <div class="md"><p>I do think social media shapes how things like this get covered now, though. I&#39;m not saying you are wrong here, but the fact that millions of people marched, and almost all of them had their phones and were sending out multiple videos, tweets, photos, snaps, Facebook posts, Instagram posts, etc, the kind of forced coverage is a little different now isn&#39;t it? The media tends to follow the social media craze these days for the most part. I actually attended the march, and a person behind me commented, &quot;this is going to be one of the most documented protests of all time&quot; in reference to how many people were walking around with their cell phones in the air the entire time. </p>

<p>So, I think what you are most likely seeing is just a change in how the media operates now due to the influence of the documentation of the people as opposed to how big the protests were for the Iraq war in opposition to this one. </p>

Holding it the day after he took office may not have been the best marketing move if they wanted to stay focused on rights and respect of marginalized groups. </p>

<p>But at the same time, it was intended to send a message to Trump, so I can see both sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s what happens when you have that many people participating.  Also, the fact that it was the day after Trump took office probably led people to believe that was the primary agenda.  However, on the organizers&#39; website, the values and principles were very much centered around equality of rights and respect for all marginalized groups. I think most people know the issues came about long before Trump ran for president. I can also say first hand that equality was by far the loudest presence.  The vehement anti-Trump people were peppered throughout though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a journalist and I got a press release in my inbox about the women&#39;s march in LA and all the celebrities that will be speaking from a hired huge PR company. This was a PR event for actresses (most of the &quot;speakers&quot; at the LA protest were TV actresses on current shows) and while it made a lot of women feel good to be a part of something, it ultimately was an opportunity for women in the entertainment industry to post lots of photos of themselves and livestream themselves at the event for social media points. It was a safe and entertaining protest, at least in LA, so very media-friendly and fun and completely pointless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin totally called it when he said the same forces that led the uprising in the Ukraine (and other color revolutions) were going to use the same tactics in the USA. His words were:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Putin noted that an internal political struggle is underway in the United States despite the fact that the presidential election is over.</p>

<p>&quot;In my opinion, there are several goals, some are obvious. The first is to undermine the legitimacy of the elected president of the United States. Incidentally, in this connection I would like to note that — whether people who do it want it or don&#39;t want — they greatly damage US interests.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems that they trained for this in Kiev and now are ready to organize a &#39;Maidan&#39; in Washington not to let Trump assume office,&quot; Putin said during a news conference with his Moldovan counterpart Igor Dodon in Moscow</p>

<p>&quot;The second goal is to tie the hands of legs of the newly-elect president related to the implementation of his pre-election campaign&#39;s promises to the American people and the international community,&quot; he added</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you can trust the numbers reported for the anti-war protests in 2003. There was almost zero media coverage, and I know from friends in NYC the march went on for blocks and blocks. </p>

<p>The National Park Service numbers were low, I&#39;ve little doubt. The turnout was politicized and played down and the media fell in line, just like it did across the board for Bush/Cheney&#39;s war. </p>

<p>Yesterday&#39;s media coverage focused on the most divisive visuals and speeches, compared to what I saw at the march I attended yesterday, which was largely benevolent and unified. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe a lot of women have been mislead as I believe there is an agenda behind the organization that put this march together.  I believe the march was used as a warning to congress.</p>

<p>Since the organisation who initiated this march uninvited certain women&#39;s organizations from marching, I would wonder why they did this.  Wasnt this march about all womens rights?  Or was this a march of womens rights as defined by the organization? </p>

<p>The partners they univited were anti abortion view points.  But these woman wanted to march even though they held a different belief than others.  They were under the assumption that the march was about all women being united beyond differences of opinion.  And yet their partnership support was removed from the website.</p>

<p>Which makes me wonder if this march isn&#39;t more about the upcoming non support Planned Parenthood gathers every time their funding comes up in Congress?  Are we really watching a political move to keep planned Parenthood in power and funded without cuts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeing that popular media in recent years has taken women&#39;s rights very serious, I don&#39;t find this odd at all.</p>

<p>For example, if you look at the larger newspapers, they often post guest articles about women&#39;s rights and feminism, some of them even have a number of outright feminist writers and bloggers hired - and often claim it&#39;s their stance to support the fight for women&#39;s rights. But the truth is probably more along the lines of it being the perfect click bait; Women are victimized, men are criminalized -- a lot of women click and read, because the can usually agree in part with some of what&#39;s written -- men click it, because they see themselves criminalized and will attempt their best to defend themselves in the comment section. It&#39;s an ad-revenue newspapers dream.</p>

<p>In turn, this affects a lot of the general line of the paper - and promotes narratives and stories like this.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it&#39;s being toted on social media - because many of the keyboard activists finally went out and did a thing. &quot;I&#39;ve been victimized, I&#39;m fighting back - hear me roar!&quot; -- the social egocentrical narrative.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying that any of this is the case all of the time - but this is surely what you&#39;ll experience because these voices are the loudest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can sit here all day and argue the semantics of where the threshold for &quot;wildly unpopular&quot; is, but the fact is that Trump&#39;s approval ratings are abysmal.  </p>

<p>And he&#39;s such a sensitive snowflake about it that his administration&#39;s first &#39;press conference&#39; (where they didn&#39;t take questions, mind you) consisted of arguing with the media about inauguration attendance numbers.   </p>

<p>Pathetic.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, in almost every conversation I had that the Hillary voters voted for her because they wanted her, and the Donald voters voted for him because they wanted anyone but Hilary. Only a few actually liked him, but they wanted her gone forever. If Hilary won, she would have been the most unpopular president in history as well, but the media would have never portrayed it that way; imagine CNN running a headline about the first female president being the least popular ever in history. Yeah right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not propaganda, it&#39;s an interesting and highly conspiracy-relevant breakdown of the deep state civil war underpinning the 2016 US presidential election.
