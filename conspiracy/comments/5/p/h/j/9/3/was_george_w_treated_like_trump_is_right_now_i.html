I just think the real difference is the level to which &quot;they,&quot; have been able to take the left-right paradigm since then.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually their was quite a few reasons to impeach him, but let&#39;s see what I can remember off the top of my head and then you are welcome to research this yourself( this is conspiracy after all) </p>

<p>So during the 2000 election while Bush II was a candidate for presidency his brother  John Ellis (Jeb) Bush Sr. was governor for the state of Florida and the Secretary of state for Florida (the person who runs and certifies the election for that state) was Katherine Harris. She also happen to be the Chair of the George Bush II Florida campaign and the night before the election &quot;guaranteed&quot;  Bush II the win. The election was decided by less than a thousand votes in Florida. and impeached only means to be bought up on formal charges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a reason why bush unconstitutionally went to the supreme court to stop the Florida recount vs. following the constitution and letting it go to the house. The democrats controlled the house and probably would have thrown the election Gore. Even after the election the Democrats controlled congress and then like now thought that the president was illegitimate. 9/11 solidified the Bush regime&#39;s grip on power and the 2002 mid-terms took away the Democrats control of the House (where impeachment has to take place)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How old are you? I ask because I need to know if you were  child when this went down and were you politically aware? this issue wasn&#39;t just a little unsatisfactory, there was a widespread belief held among Democrats that he STOLE the election, with many editorials and talking points coming from elected democrats to that effect. 
Secondly you might of heard of a little thing called the Monica Lewinsky affair. when the republicans SUCCESSFULLY impeached (again that means to bring an official up on charges, it does not mean to force the abdication of office) President Clinton. which I think was more of a driving force for it then the actual charges themselves</p>

<p>Now do I think they would have been successful themselves? I don&#39;t know. But I AM certain had 9/11 not happened and the country not rallied behind the President to solidify his position, he would have been impeached</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 45...I know what impeach means. You said he would <em>&quot;probably&quot;</em> have been impeached if not for 9/11. You can be &quot;certain&quot; all you like, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that there was no legitimate basis to even bring impeachment proceedings, let alone be successful. Clinton was impeached for knowingly lying under oath. A completely different situation. I voted in that election, and lived through it as an adult... You may want to do more research on the matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry about that dig at your age, I just needed to know who I am talking to before I went deeper. So what was the legitimate reason for Impeaching Clinton?

    <div class="md"><p>When you lie under sworn oath as POTUS, (no matter what it is for) that is an impeachable offense...You would need proof of Bush&#39;s <em>&quot;collusion&quot;</em>, that was not found...Clinton lied under oath.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually , I am not minimizing it at all, I am putting it into perspective,  Because the section of the constitution you are looking for is &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; which has NEVER been put to the test until Clinton came along. Does the President have the right to lie to a special prosecutor? Can they pardon themselves for  crimes while committed in office? Nixon would have been the test case for that, had he not resigned and been pardoned by ford.</p>

<p>And the &quot;proof&quot; was Katherine Harris in her dual role as fl. Sec of State and Bush campaign chair for that state &quot;guaranteeing&quot; Bush the win</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol...Your <em>&quot;proof&quot;</em> is not evidence of collusion by Bush.

    <div class="md"><p>and no matter how you try to unsee the fact that Clinton&#39;s Impeachment was politically motivated (which is what I was getting at) it was, I mean they spent nearly $80 million in taxpayer money, looked into damn near every aspect of his life, and the only thing they could get him on is lying about a blow job, and had the Democrats controlled the house, there would have been no impeachment. Stop trying to make this a left right debate. I don&#39;t like neither of them. But the facts that i am pretty sure we can agree on is A) there was WIDESPREAD discontent on the left due to the Florida election results. B) the recount was suspect ( I still don&#39;t know who won because of so many conflicting stories out there) and lastly C) the democrats controlled congress. Even if it wasn&#39;t over the election, I HAVEN&#39;T  met  person yet who hasn&#39;t broken a single law. So i stand by my statement that had 9/11 not happened Bush II would have been Impeached</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. still where I am at. Bill Clinton&#39;s Impeachment is most of the reason I think Bush would have been Impeached. The rest of it is the election, And we are both engaging in revisionist history since 9/11 did happen, and while I have brought up several points of why I think they would have impeached him (the election itself, the political climate of the country that time, payback for the Impeachment of Clinton, Bush&#39;s perceived illegitimacy by the left) I had to read back and notice you don&#39;t actually refute any of what i said, never answered what i asked about Clinton&#39;s Impeachment, so I have to conclude you are more interested in proving me wrong then engaging in a healthy debate. that&#39;s cool</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talking out of your ass. There was absolutely no talk of Bush being impeached before 9/11. Gore conceded and the election was awarded to Bush. You could say many saw his presidency as illegitimate because of how the election went down, but its just revisionist history to say that overall there was a chance he could have been impeached. You just straight up made that up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>would Bush have bounced back without 9/11? was there no calls for his Impeachment from NO sitting Member of congress? Would the democrats not have used his Impeachment proceedings during the 2002 mid-terms to bolster their own chances? So somebody conceding ends all questions on elections? And During his presidency were there not any actions taken to impeach Bush? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only issue the Bush administration was having before 9/11 was that they hadn&#39;t done anything. Bush Jr. probably has the lease effective first 100 days in office than any other president. People were concerned that he wasn&#39;t really doing the job and was just sort of coasting through it.</p>

<p>And yes, when somebody concedes an election that means the election is over and it is awarded to the person who did not concede. Now you can have theories about why Gore did it. Maybe he was paid off, etc. </p>

<p>Furthermore, there are efforts to impeach every president. There&#39;s always going to be people that down right hate the president and resent that their choice candidate didn&#39;t get in. So there will always be people filling out petitions and organizing rallies, etc. But there were absolutely, no legitimate calls or reasons for Bush to be impeached. After 9/11 and its a completely different story...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t quite the same since W basically stole the election and was appointed. Look up old videos, you can see people pelting his car with eggs on his way to the White House, they had to cut the progression short. I remember marching and protesting the war back in high school at the time. But that was a cause. It doesn&#39;t seem like these people protesting now are for a real cause, they&#39;ve been swayed into it with false fears. And they&#39;re dividing the country with their identity politics. Those are some of my &#39;member berries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>W was ridiculed massively, but he didn&#39;t pick unnecessary fights like Trump does. </p>

<p>Trump does two things which intensify the mockery he receives. First of all he blows up any time any one makes fun of him. Second, and more importantly, he seeks fights with the press, with the intelligence agencies, and with his political rivals. Often completely unnecessary ones. Look at how he had his press secretary claim that Trump&#39;s inauguration was the largest ever, despite this being demonstrably untrue, and that if they did not report this there would be repercussions. Why would you pick a fight like that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One indicator of crowd size — although it doesn’t tell the whole story — is the number of trips taken on D.C.’s Metro system.</p>

<p>As of 11 a.m. on Inauguration Day, Metro said it had recorded 193,000 trips. That’s about on par with the number of trips taken for President George W. Bush’s second inauguration in 2005. In 2013 during Obama’s second inauguration, the system had recorded about 317,000 trips. During Obama’s record-setting 2009 inauguration, the system had recorded 513,000 Metro trips by 11 a.m.</p>

<pre><code>TL;DR Trump had same crowd size as Bush.
</code></pre>

<p>It was a cruddy rainy day. DC has the highest unemployment rate in the country for blacks so the Jobless had all the time in the world to show up during a morning with nice weather for the inauguration of the first black president. Most of the people who went to the Trump inauguration would have been people from out of town while most people who went to Obamas were the local blacks.</p>
