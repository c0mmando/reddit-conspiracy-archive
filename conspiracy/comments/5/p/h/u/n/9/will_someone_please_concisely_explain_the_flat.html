       It comes from the fact that the earth looks flat. That's pretty much it.

       No, we would not be able to feel it. If you were on a train undergoing constant acceleration and could not see outside the carriage, you'd have no idea if you were moving or standing still in relation to the outside world.

       I use to believe this too, but in actual fact the earth is moving in a circle, which means that we are accelerating.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any other scenario we are able to feel acceleration, but according to NASA, we don't feel the acceleration around the sun due to the atmosphere. This explanation is pretty weak in my opinion.

      <p>
       Nope. Hence my example of the train. If the train was accelerating forward at a constant rate (say 1g) and the carriage was designed appropriately, you would not be able to tell if the train was moving or you were just standing still.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compared to the outside world you would be standing on the wall, but you would not know that unless you could see outside the carriage.

       Yet you don''t feel gravity when you're undergoing the constant acceleration of free fall. You only feel gravity when something blocks your fall, stopping the constant acceleration.

       The surface of earth slowing you down is what you feel, not the constant acceleration of gravity.

       Are you referring to

        terminal velocity?

       Terminal velocity is reached when the net force acting on the object is zero, so acceleration is zero.

       It's a great thought exercise if you ask me. FE theory makes you think about how little we actually know about our world and our place in this universe. FE raises some great questions even if you don't think the Earth is flat.

       It's only a thought excercise for a few minutes, or hours, if you're really thorough.  It's more of a thought test.  If you can't spot the gaping logical and observational holes in this "theory", then you're not qualified for intellectual conversation with...  pretty much anyone.  It takes some insane logical fallacies and denial of all observable reality to make it sorta-kinda-almost-but-still-not-really work.  I'll give a lot of "crazy" ideas the benefit of the doubt.  I did the same with flat earth a few years ago.  But it falls apart under very slight scrutiny.  Flat earth nonsense is 100% falsifiable, with a variety of easy ways to do it.

       The idea was the basis of all ancient cultures.  They believed the Earth was a disc with the magnetic north pole in the center and the ice mass known as Antarctica ringing the outer edge holding the oceans in.  Covering this plate was a dome that reached it's zentith above the center as was designated with the polaris north star which never moves, while the other stars rotate around it.

       The recent revival in Flat Earth theory was started by Eric Dubay in October 2014.  I'll link to some videos even though you said you don't want  to watch any:

       Flat Earth is a
       <em>
        complete
       </em>
       waste of time. Somebody urged me to look into, and believing in the importance of having an open mind, I did. Afterwards I wanted to shoot him in the face for wasting so much of my time. The typical Flat Earth argument goes something like this (and I shit you not): if the Earth is spinning at something like 1,000 MPH west to east, how come when we jump off the ground, the Earth doesn't suddenly spin underneath us and we end up far to the west of where we started?
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat Earth psyopers rarely come out and tell you that they believe in Flat Earth. Instead they will say things like 'it's interesting to think about.' Or, 'well I don't know about flat earth but ball earth doesn't make a lot of sense.' They portray themselves as "Flat-Earth curious." They also try to take advantage of (well-deserved) distrust of mainstream science and phony NASA imagery to sell you on the idea. As if we ever needed NASA to tell us the Earth is round. As if we needed establishment scientists to prove the Earth is round. They tell you to trust your senses, except when your senses and common sense tell you the Earth is round.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the basic "why" idea behind flat Earth. I believe this is a direct quote from the guru of Flat Earth, Eric Dubay:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        modern atheist Big Bang heliocentric globe Earth chance evolution paradigm spiritually controls humanity by removing God or any sort of intelligent design and replace purposeful divine creation with haphazard random cosmic coincidence. And so by removing Earth from the motionless center of the universe, the Masons have moved us physically and metaphysically from a place of supreme importance to one of complete nihilistic indifference. If the Earth is the center of the universe then the ideas of God, creation, and a purpose for human existence are resplendent but if the Earth is but one of billions of planets revolving around billions of stars and billions of galaxies, then the ideas of God, creation, and a specific purpose for Earth and human existence become highly implausible. So by surreptitiously indoctrinating us into their scientific materialist Sun worship, not only do we lose faith in anything beyond the material, we gain absolute faith in materiality, superficiality, status, selfishness, hedonism and consumerism. If there's not God and everyone's just an accident and all that really matters is me me me. So they've turned Madonna, the mother of god, into a material girl living in a material world. Their rich, powerful corporations with their slick sun cult logos sell us idols to worship, slowly taking over the world while we tacitly believe their science and vote for their politicians, buy their products, listen to their music, watch their movies -- all sacrificing our souls at the altar of materialism.
       </p>
       <p>
        If flat Earth is true, then it elevates Man (human beings) to supreme importance. Where every life, human or otherwise, is significant and sacred.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course this last statement is a complete non-sequitur. But the whole premise here is totally illogical.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, in order to explain things like the seasons (changing sunrise/sunset times, weather, etc.), sunsets, the coriolis effect, all of the different things that have been pointed out as disconfirming flat earth, they have to come up with new and ever-more convoluted explanations. There have been so many that FE theory at this point resembles a jerry-rigged Rube Goldberg contraption. The Globe Earth model, on the other hand, explains all of this with rather eloquent parsimony (not to say it is flawless).
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take a moment to consider this, because it really blows up the whole logic behind Flat Earth. If the Earth is flat, it supposedly means human beings are special. We're at the center of the universe (which again, doesn't follow but whatever). And yet, somehow, this Flat Earth was constructed in an extremely elaborate manner so that it would be
       <em>
        wholly consistent
       </em>
       with the theory that we live on a spinning globe. So let's say you believe that God created the Flat Earth. Well that means that God must have created it
       <em>
        purposely to make it seem as if it's a spinning globe.
       </em>
       That means it's part of God's plan. Why would he do that to us? If we're so significant and so much at the center of the universe, then why wouldn't God create the flat earth in a way that is transparently flat. Is he in cahoots with the Masons?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I suggest you don't waste any more of your time with this nonsense. It is a psyop meant to discredit conspiracy theorists and waste our time. Don't fall for it.

       I don't know if all NASA and other space agencies' imagery is fake, but I have been convinced that some of it is. But even if
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of it is, humans have known the Earth is round for a couple thousand years. The ancient Greeks knew it. And we don't need
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       NASA imagery to prove to ourselves the Earth is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, it's not an issue in the sense that it is irrelevant to the issue of whether the Earth is round or not.

       Well Pythagoras put the idea forward 2500 years ago but it was more of a thought experiment, which is also how Copernicus described his work 2,000 years later. The Heliocentric model really only took hold after the Church of England accepted it and began including it in its school curriculum in the 1600s. It wasn't until the 1950s that human beings had the technology to determine the shape is the earth experientially instead of though theory. Interestingly it was in the late 50s that the Antarctic treaty was signed making it off limits, high altitude nuclear testing began and quickly ended, satellites became a declared reality, and the van allen radiation belts were "discovered" which at the time were said to make space travel impossible. In fact most of this occurred in the I.G.Y. The International Geophysical Year of 1958, when the cold war was put on hold to focus on these scientific investigations. Then NASA was created, mostly to monopolize and militarized space exploration to prohibit private initiatives. I agree with you that the pictures of Earth are composites or in the case of the one that's claimed to be a real photo, staged from low earth orbit using windows. The fact that we don't have any real photos of Earth is suspicious but circumstantial on its own. The main problem I have with Flat Earth theory generally is that both sides are circumstantial and theoretical (assuming NASA is fraudulent) when it's clearly a question that cries out for a experiential answer. But how to perform such an experiment and who do we trust to do so?

       So many lies and misinformation in your comment it's hard to know where to begin. First, whether out of a deliberate attempt to confuse or out of ignorance, you are conflating the idea that the Earth is round with the heliocentric model. The heliocentric model was the idea that the Earth revolved around the sun and not the other way around. But the notion that the earth was round was not new and not a part of the heliocentric model.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that the theory that the Earth was round was only a theory to the Greeks is wrong. They confirmed it by ships slowly going down over the horizon and lots of other observations. As for needing to do an experiment to prove the Earth is a spinning sphere, there are plenty of ways you can confirm it yourself. But teaching remedial physics to credulous flat earth cretins is not my lot in life. Learn how to use google. And your brain.

       I started looking into it with an open but skeptical mind, as with all things. I expected some halfway decent arguments. I expected something that would make me pause, scratch my head and think a bit. I found nothing like that. So now I am biased against it. I am also biased against anyone who have been suckered into it, because they are clearly not the brightest bulb in the bunch.

       Basically the theory is that instead of the sun being 150 million KM away from earth, it's only about 3000~KM.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun rotates around the north pole and somehow is being held up, possibly by the same thing all compasses point to. If we don't live on a sphere the north pole is now something special because we have no idea why it would be there. I'll throw in a theory some flat earthers have here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically they take scripture and say that the COMPASS is really a hint to us saying "Come pass."
      </p>
      <p>
       So the sun spins around, based on the season it is closer or farther from the equator.
      </p>
      <p>
       To add to this if you change your perception of the globe because we really have no idea. I've seen some pretty interesting ideas of flat earth maps.

       I think we live in a holographic universe and our thoughts and consciousness create our reality.

       I believe The flat earth psyop was introduced as a self defense measure(controlled opposition). That means NASA and "Science" are losing the narrative to some degree.

      <p>
       On the flip side, the FE theory could also be a "cry for help" or "reflex" manifestation... and not a psyop at all. A direct result of the overload of lies forced on us peasants from the "scientific community".

       So many lies and misinformation in your comment it's hard to know where to begin. First, whether out of a deliberate attempt to confuse or out of ignorance, you are conflating the idea that the Earth is round with the heliocentric model. The heliocentric model was the idea that the Earth revolved around the sun and not the other way around. But the notion that the earth was round was not new and not a part of the heliocentric model.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that the theory that the Earth was round was only a theory to the Greeks is wrong. They confirmed it by ships slowly going down over the horizon and lots of other observations. As for needing to do an experiment to prove the Earth is a spinning sphere, there are plenty of ways you can confirm it yourself. But teaching remedial physics to credulous flat earth cretins is not my lot in life. Learn how to use google. And your brain.
