       Trump pledged to 'drain the swamp', the swamp being career politicians. I ask you, how else would you see his cabinet, other than filled with highly successful non politicians, like himself? Can someone give an alternative list that would satisfy the philosophies he ran his campaign on?

       Well no I agree. I mean, that's the problem. The swamp was made of people who are qualified for the jobs. You can't drain the swamp. The swamp is made of people who are capable. So, who are those people? Generals, scientists, professors, bundlers, members of congress, governors, etc. That amount of wealth bothers me for other reasons than just how it defy's the swamp expression, though.

       Qualification shouldn't be the only requirement for the job. The revolving door was established by corporations to feed their people into government roles. The previous administration maintained the facade.

       In his speech he stated he would be giving power back to the people. Does filling your cabinet with billionaires (or the 1%) who have made their fortune exploiting people and the environment count as giving power back to the people?

       Hillary Clinton was rightly criticised for being too close to Goldman during the campaign, now Trump has ex-Goldman employees in his cabinet but he seems to have escaped widespread criticism

       Hillary was criticized for pay for play, benghazi, and a slew of other (at bare minimum) shady activity as secretary of state.  Her goldman sachs relations are just another little dash of pepper in the disaster recipe that she is.  Trump doesn't have the same history that she has.  Trump still has a chance to prove that he is terrible or quality.  And for the record, goldman sachs veterans could equally be perfect people for understanding how to level the economic table as they could possibly be the worst people for the job.  At least give them 60-90 days to show us what they got.  Im tired of people saying "yup!  He has people who worked for goldman sachs!  We're fuked!"  Enough of that already

       Trump may not have the same history, but there is still a lot of distasteful stuff he has done in the past, enough to get a handle on the type of person he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       In political terms, I don't think he has handled his ownership of the Trump Organization very well and there are still questions to be answered over links to Russia. But you are right, he should get a chance. I'm just not that hopeful, so far anyway.

       Are you willfully ignoring all the conflict of interests a Trump presidency will have with his business ventures?

       The man is in position to expand his wealth and influence, not only for himself, but for his family and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest issue people would be complaining about if Hillary one is the Clinton foundation. But because Trump entertains and distracts, the criticism isn't there from those tired of all the Trump headlines.

       There has been nothing BUT negative attention towards Trump, his personality and his business ventures/cohorts for the best year and a half.  I'm tired of hearing it.  I'm not duped. I'm just willing to give him a chance instead of acting like I know everything with a pretty sparse data set.

       You are literally putting your head in the sand. It seems extremely hypocritical given that Democrats did the same for Clinton. They didn't care about speeches, emails, and cozy bank relationships. They didn't worry about the CF or Benghazi.
      </p>

       Why? Because they were tired of hearing about it and wanted to give her a shot.

       His whole agenda is to remove the barriers to profits for corporations. So, that means upping your taxes to fuck your water, your food, your air and drive up inflation and interest rates.

       The one thing that has become overwhelmingly apparent to me in the last 6 months is the majority of redditors do not remember the 80s, or even what it meant economically post-9/11.

       Was talking to a friend who knew a guy that worked for GS. He said he was ashamed to tell his family where he worked. After a year he got called in for an interview and asked where he saw himself going in the business. He gave his reply that he thought investment was an important part of raising the living standards for the world etc. The manager said "nope, wrong answer. If you're not here to make as much money for yourself then you shouldn't be here."

       Seriously though, say you are being sued and for some reason, there's a shortage of lawyers. Your choices are: A paralegal, a first year law student, a shady lawyer who's been practicing for years and might be about to be disbarred, but is on good terms with every judge in town, OR, the best real estate salesman in town?

       On the flip side of that though is the ability of individuals to influence government officials via 'donations'. I'm not saying Trump couldn't potentially be suspect, but his cabinet is far from run of the mill people who have engaged in those sort of things.

       The money isn't that important, it is what they believe and what they will do. Watch Steve Mnuchin's opening statement and you can see how he will fight statism and over-regulation. He explains how government forced him to foreclose when he didn't want to. Government is a wet blanket on the economy.
