       So by having corporate ladders and such, one person elevates themselves over the next. It leads to obvious animosity and class divisions. The New World Order then craft media campaigns, books and so on through CIA culture department. Look at shows like the Office or what have you. They made it to seem like they we're aiming at unity, but you see how they played in when the blue collar became white color and started fat catting it. Bad message, bad media. Bad world. They create this system to be enslavement. The college system, just, yeah. Going through it now. I had marketing class yesterday, which I dropped. The Dean of Student Affairs teaches the class. She literally had to ask me what "guerilla marketing was"  Class control. To keep the Mob/Cia/war machine rollin'. Crazy, thoughts anybody?  I know I gotta earn more respect before you'll take my posts seriously. And I will be paying my respects and or gold to those who earn it, have no fear

       Yeah. This is my proof the systems rigged, tangible proof. The head of marketing for my school, and marketing teacher picks a textbook that has no mention of guerilla marketing. It sticks to the Elites approved outlets. She was shocked when I said why can't we have school ads on peoples cars. .. Yet spends 15k on buses. Limiting it to lower income areas when it comes to my area. What do you call corruption that's built out of ignorance and not willfully malice?

       Also I asked why we couldn't get reduced fairs for lunch for having a sticker on our cars, she said because we use third party vendors. When I asked why business can't advertise in her school and we in their stores, she said because stores can't make money of schools unless they provide jobs to us. However the aforementioned italians running the lunch room and who knows what else don't hire ANY student workers. So yeah. Dropped that class.

       Titles keep workers in check , you got your Indians and you got your chiefs , an old phrase on jobs is "too many chiefs, not enough Indians , simply means not everyone can be the / a boss . For example I own a company ! I hire guys and pay them based on experience , everyone I hire has a role and said roll has a title , laborer , skilled laborer , journeyman , and then the owner(s) , someone has to take responsibly, and a laborer getting paid bottom tier wages most likely won't know everything and can't handle the responsibility, as an owner of my company I am also a journeyman so I have skills to get the job and do the job as well and having laborers telling me or any owner or boss what's what just can't happens , so titles get brought in to mix.

       Unions are fucked been on union jobs, and production is crap , because in most union setting your job is one thing and one thing only so you can't touch something not involved in your trade or you may get canned from the job , I personally pay above scale because I expect high production and quality  and find when you give a man a truly fair wage he will most likely work his ass off to prove his worth ,and actually show up to work

       The whole society is designed for us to fight each other in competitions. We need to readjust this so that we excel through cooperation which means adjusting our systems and media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media is full of poison though. If you feel slightly uncomfortable when watching tv, it is because there are hidden elements in the media that is designed to poison your mind. Comedies are really jam packed with these poisons.

       "Comedies are really jam packed with these poisons"
      </p>
      <p>
       Comedy is the sugar that helps the medicine go down.  Look at how easily people mock instead of defend their facts.  It's like the easy way to "appear smart" by cleverly playing to people's sense of humor.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like the number one "quality" that makes one sociable and amicable.  It's because it's a cover.  It comforts people and makes them fee at ease and then they are manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most comedy is complete garbage because I end up making fun of it and being funnier than the source script usually.  Not hard.  It's Barely creative when they just want to push their raunchy and low brow agenda by going after quick appeals of humor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gag me and everyone else.

       Lol, if you pay attention, there are hidden insults in almost every statement made on prime time tv comedies. There are all kinds of manipulations happening at the same time. This is being presented to the American people as an appropriate and effective way of behavior. The presenters know that this kind of behavior is dysfunctional in the real world and they know the people would mimic what they saw over the decades of mental conditioning via dysfunctional media. This would lead to a broken and dysfunctional public because when people get used to being passive aggressive and insulting towards each other, they will also develop anomosities and hatred for each other. This division between people strengthens the Cabal since it is hard for a disunited people to stand up for themselves.

       I get hung up on motive. I don't want to believe it. And can't even explain it without getting tongue tied. Okay so getting to the quintessence of an issue, that's reductionism? So what is deconstuctionism? Not to digress, but I find myself obsessed with asking why until I get to ultimate answers, or gray murky shit that makes me question me sanity.

       I try to think of reductionism as reducing the complexity of a huge concept to a simple system.  All systems are relatable to each other and each have similar payouts and signs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil is always more complex because it adds variables to cheat the system and deceive it.   Solving crimes is finding those variables.

       I had this sense that nearly every higher minded concept can be spoken of beyond metaphor and culture. So in a sense to deconstruct and find the parallels. Like comparitive religion applied to the entire gestalt of a given situation. Very cool. THanks

       ive spent the better part of the decade trying to wake people up. some will get it,some wont. at this point ive realized that, like morpheous said on the matrix, some are so hopelessly enslaved by it that they will fight to protect it. its gonna go down however it goes down.

       I'm glad i'm not the only one.  Older individuals tell me the same thing "I've been trying for years". There's more than enough "woke"  people to get the ball moving.  We need to refocus efforts from raising awareness to taking action.
