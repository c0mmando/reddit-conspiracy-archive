       That pretty much the whole front page lately is pro-obama and pro-biden with anti-trump post thrown in? Posts from subs like

       Your front page is only subs you are subscribed to, so you can just unsubscribe from anything annoying you. Also after spez's boondoggle with editing t_d comments you now have the ability to filter

       I think what he's saying is that even subs that have nothing to do with politics are becoming politicized, and I agree with him. Theres not really a way to filter that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really aggravating getting drawn in to political arguments in subs that don't have anything to do with it.  I've been called a dumbass for supporting Trump in the walking dead sub. No one was even talking about politics, the dude just dug through my post history and decided that was a good time to bring that up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care about being called a dumbass on reddit, the frustrating thing is conversations getting de-railed and the mods allowing it for the most part.

       The toxicity of
       <a href="/r/politics">

       is starting to leak all over reddit, and if the admins aren't actively supporting it, they sure as hell don't care about it.

       It seems at this point the ultimate goal is for all of reddit to turn in to a liberal echo chamber, and if you go against the circle jerk, then GTFO.

       Yeah, so that's why there are constant posts that are pro-obama from superfluous subreddits. Posts that make it to 40k+ votes in an hour or two, and are the youngest posts on the front page by 3-4 hours?
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile posts on
       <a href="/r/t_d">
        /r/t_d
       </a>
       have been brought down to 0 artificially. If you think this is organic, or because "people don't like trump" then you are shit at noticing manipulation. Doesn't matter how much people dislike trump, all the Obama jerking is getting ridiculous. I'm not even from the US. I feel really really bad for you personally, being this deluded in the era we live in.

       Ah.  I'm not saying any of the post numbers are organic. I was saying that futurama, simpsons, etc have made fun of the type of politician that trump is and it only makes sense that people on those subs would post memes making fun of trump on the day he's sworn in.

       Yep, but that is the majority opinion of the demographic that uses reddit. Yes, it is boring, yes, it is partisan, but it shows how the people out there (not from r/conspiracy) think and feel. The mods are not subverted, they were always against Trump in most subs. And again, look at reddit's demographic and you'll realise there is no conspiracy - other than that people actually believe that it makes any difference who is in charge.
