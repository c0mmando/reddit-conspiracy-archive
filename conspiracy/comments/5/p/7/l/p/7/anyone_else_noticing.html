    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, so that&#39;s why there are constant posts that are pro-obama from superfluous subreddits. Posts that make it to 40k+ votes in an hour or two, and are the youngest posts on the front page by 3-4 hours? </p>

<p>Meanwhile posts on <a href="/r/t_d">/r/t_d</a> have been brought down to 0 artificially. If you think this is organic, or because &quot;people don&#39;t like trump&quot; then you are shit at noticing manipulation. Doesn&#39;t matter how much people dislike trump, all the Obama jerking is getting ridiculous. I&#39;m not even from the US. I feel really really bad for you personally, being this deluded in the era we live in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, but that is the majority opinion of the demographic that uses reddit. Yes, it is boring, yes, it is partisan, but it shows how the people out there (not from r/conspiracy) think and feel. The mods are not subverted, they were always against Trump in most subs. And again, look at reddit&#39;s demographic and you&#39;ll realise there is no conspiracy - other than that people actually believe that it makes any difference who is in charge.</p>
