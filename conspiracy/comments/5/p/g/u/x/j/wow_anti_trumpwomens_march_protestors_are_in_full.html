       The question is, why. Someone is getting paid, black mailed, etc. Sure some of those women protesting are fighting for a good cause, but something is definitely up.

       Look at his cabinet picks and how the Republicans are already setting up to fuck with the aca.  The woman's March is coming from the attack of birth control and abortions.  Hell I work at a nursing home in Cleveland and one lady's sister is a nun.  She was talking about her and a few other nuns driving down to DC for the March.  We are talking nuns in their 50s-60s choosing to protest.

       Social unrest in America takes away the agency of citizens. It prevents us from standing up against the system and pointing out legitimate flaws in our politicians (like how Bill's Lewinsky scandal prevented anyone from going after Chinagate)
      </p>
      <p>
       It also allows for ideologies to sink in that otherwise would have no place here. (BLM and socialism, this women's march and Sharia Law)

       So you are saying the act of protesting, also known as standing up against the system and pointing out legitimate flaws, is not the same as standing up against the system and pointing out legitimate flaws?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, I get that you perhaps
       <em>
        don't agree
       </em>
       with the protestors. However, what sort of world are we going to live in when people have to pretend to themselves that the only way someone could ever actually manage to disagree with them is by being paid to do so?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree with your assertion, and I don't agree with your perspective... but do I think it's only possible that you came to your conclusions by being paid to do so? No, that's idiotic. It's called occams fucking razor, and if you ever spent 5 minutes outside of whatever podunk town you live in, you'd realize most women are actually pretty pissed about the whole damn thing... that's why they are marching on washington in record numbers. The fact that people think the more logical reason for this occurrence is that george soros is trying to implement sharia law (via feminists?) speaks
       <em>
        volumes
       </em>
       about the sort of critical thinking employed to get to that conclusion.

       Some protests are productive, some are not. For a protest to be effective it has to have a strong message and agreement amongst the protestors. These protests have neither.

       I never said it was illegitimate. The goal of a protest is to produce an effect that is favorable to the people. If you look at past successful social movements, you'll notice that this one is missing some very important characteristics that will lead to its success.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm slightly ignorant about it though, so can you tell me what exactly these womens protests want?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand they're worried that their right to abortion might be taken away, but what else is there?

       Well, if a protest is not productive what is your point? That it's a waste of time? That it's expressing a political notion not worth expressing? How is that not at least tangential to legitimacy? You are certainly suggesting that this protest is apparently not expressing a widely held political notion... despite the number of people actually protesting and expressing the political notion in question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what you know of past successful social movements and what made them so and how these protests don't have such elements. Amusingly enough you fail to include any of these elements in your suggestion, but I'm sure it's because you are someone well versed in the american history of political dissidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, it's not my responsibility to inform you just because I was pointing out that common sense shows you to be short sighted in thought. These people literally hold up signs with words that express their sentiments... and you sit here and say "i can't figure out what they are protesting about" makes you just seem lazy and ignorant as opposed to actually trying to engage despite not agreeing.

       Frankly, it's not a matter of proof. It's an opinion, and yours is a laughably shitty one best evidenced by my first response to you which gets at the heart of your notion about you approving of the protests and their messages... who gives a shit???

       He asked you like 5 times to provide examples. You avoided to answers on all times and resorted to snarky comments. I was hoping you'd prove him wrong but you didn't,  therefore you helped reinforce my view stronger. Do you wonder why I started taking his side and people like his? Because it's people like you wanting to make a big disruption of democracy and pretend to call it peacefully protests that keep exposing yourselves. Keep exposing yourself and hopefully it'll wake other as well.

       Funny how you are getting all up in arms about what Madonna said, when frankly I don't care what celebrities think about. I know a bunch of people that went to protest... none of them have mentioned Madonna to me, yet people on here can't get over it. I suggest that you go outside, get some fresh air, and stop reading CNN.

       CNN is the one trying to normalize it. I'm pointing out that it's not normal. Perhaps you're the one who should not listen to CNN? I must correct you because deflection seems to be a thing you folks love to use.

       There is a theory that George Soros funds protests that are strongly antiTrump. He was the one who paid for the violence at Trump Rallies.

      <p>
       Here is where the theory comes in, he destabilizes regions and markets to line his own pocket. He uses political divisiveness to make money.

       You really just have to look at who's organizing the movements and who's funding them, and try to deduce their motives.

       I also suggest reading up on ideological warfare, perhaps watch the interview with ex-KGB propagandist Yuri Benzemov.
      </p>
      <p>
       Benzemov and other Intelligence Operatives would have called these protestors "useful idiots". They cheer on the movement without knowing its true motives. It's happened many times in recent history.

      <p>
       George Soros has made his fortune off sparking social unrest in countries and basically betting on the direction the government will take.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also worth noting that, as I said, one of the organizers is a proponent of Sharia Law, and that another is a CIA agent:

       Ok... so people fund protests... how are these protestors advancing sharia law???
      </p>
      <p>
       It's your suggestion, not mine. So far your evidence is that people fund movements and they can have motives that the protestors are unaware of. Ok... how are these protests advancing sharia law? You provide nothing logical to link the fact that this can happen to reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand occam's razor would tell us that all of these people are protesting because they don't like Trump. Maybe you live in a red state, but I live in a blue state and there is no shortage of people who don't like trump and are happy to express as much. So I don't really have any trouble believing what is the most rational and simple logical explanation for this occurrence as opposed to this connection to sharia law that you are apparently unable to even substantiate in their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, we should be suspicious... of anything that doesn't make sense. Yes, it makes sense that someone like soros would fund protests and have his own personal motivations. No it doesn't make sense that he is a proponent of sharia law (being a massive jew after all) and that these protestors are in any way advancing sharia law. If you have an explanation for how this protest is actually advancing sharia law... I'd really love to hear it, but be aware the possibility that soros could isn't evidence... it's a possibility.

       I don't like Trump either, I'm not speaking with any political motivation. Regardless, I live in Boston and all my friends are very liberal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please stop being angry and just take notice of the strategies employed.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like George Soros who fund these movements obviously do not desire Sharia Law; it'd be silly to say they did. But from a strategic point of view, how will they maximize the social unrest?
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump made crass remarks about Islam, and America's foreign policy has been nothing but genocidal to Islam, so there's potential in making an Islamic angle to the protests.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then what happens when slightly Islamaphobic people see these protests? They get even angrier at Islamic people. There's videos of white, American protesters in DC chanting "Allahu Akbar".
      </p>
      <p>
       To them this is 'standing in solidarity with Islam; to others it's a threat to America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't you see how these strategies of tension would produce social unrest, and fill the pockets of people like Soros?

       Perhaps you are illiterate. But I've expressed about half a dozen times that while yes, some of the notions you put forth are

       Since yesterday the MSM has been trying to spin a story as to why they protested. As of this morning its solidarity. Yesterday was everything under the sun. Maddonna is prolly gonna be investigated for saying burn down the white house. The whole protest seemed more like bitch fest by listening to some of them. They make it sound like they lost rights, when in reality nothings changed.

       I would like to think that a conspiracy subreddit would be against the literal fascist rhetoric on the White House website. I would like to think that you all would be against the idea that (and I quote) "the anti-police atmosphere in America is wrong and dangerous." Forget the idea that it was a march created by women, as it's been made clear this subreddit is overwhelmingly mysocinistic. But you all really aren't concerned that the trump administration has already put out a public stance against protesting police corruption? I was there, I am educated, I am a woman, and yeah, liberals are fucking cringey as fuck sometimes. But you cannot deny the fact that this was a worldwide movement uniting those together who are afraid of a trump administration and the effects that could and probably will come from it.
      </p>

       I've said it before, but fuck this subreddit. The only reason I don't unsub is because I love to see what the crazy basement dwellers are getting their sweaty balls in a twist about.

       This is what I have said to people before and will probably say 1000 more times in the next 4 years. You shouldn't be protesting Trump...you should be protesting the system that only let you choose between Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump....THAT SYSTEM is the problem. Trump to a lot of people is the lesser of two evils to a lot of people.

       This allows them to maximize social unrest by getting people convinced Sharia Law is a threat, and also by getting SJW's convinced that they need to defend Islam from 'islamaphobes' such as Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       People such as Soros make enormous profits off sparking social unrest, and it allows the deep state to control us much more easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how we're spending all this time arguing about the protests rather than taking down the deep state.

       But who is getting convinced sharia law is a threat? Would actually be naive enough to believe that? It's what doesn't make sense to me, the people protesting are not the ones falling for such an idea, it seems to be the ones who are against these protests stating that the protestors are fighting FOR sharia law.

       Many of the organizers of these protests do state they want Sharia Law. Obviously a majority of the protestors do not want this, but it's useful to employ extremists who will take the protests to the next level. (same thing we do in the middle east, we always seek out the most extremist groups to fight for us)
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Trump makes anti-Islamic statements which his supporters like but others think are oppressive
       </li>
       <li>
        Protests 'stand in solidarity with islam,' chant "allahu akbar"
       </li>
       <li>
        Makes Trump supporters even angrier, and lose trust in their fellow Americans
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It's just a circle of anger and fighting against each other. These strategies of tension are what prevent the people from rising up against the real threat: the deep state. So the deep state employs all these tactics to divert our efforts against them.

       There is a theory that George Soros funds protests that are strongly antiTrump. He was the one who paid for the violence at Trump Rallies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is where the theory comes in, he destabilizes regions and markets to line his own pocket. He uses political divisiveness to make money.

        People like George Soros who fund these movements obviously do not desire Sharia Law; it'd be silly to say they did. But from a strategic point of view, how will they maximize the social unrest?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You tell me... it's your point you are trying to make...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Donald Trump made crass remarks about Islam, and America's foreign policy has been nothing but genocidal to Islam, so there's potential in making an Islamic angle to the protests.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ok... show me the islamic angle in the protests...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And then what happens when slightly Islamaphobic people see these protests? They get even angrier at Islamic people. There's videos of white, American protesters in DC chanting "Allahu Akbar".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ok... show me this happening. I don't see it happening, you are saying this is the reason for the protests so therefore this must be happening.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Can't you see how these strategies of tension would produce social unrest, and fill the pockets of people like Soros?

       Perhaps you are illiterate. But I've expressed about half a dozen times that while yes, some of the notions you put forth are
       <em>
        conceivable
       </em>
       , the actual point you are trying to make completely defies the observable world around us.
