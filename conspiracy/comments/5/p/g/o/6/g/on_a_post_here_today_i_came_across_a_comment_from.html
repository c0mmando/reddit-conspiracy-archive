       The fossil record is biased towards things that died in conditions that favor preservation and the fossil itself has to consist of materials that are readily preserved. That's why we don't find as many fossils as we'd like. I took an entire class on just invertebrate fossils so I could tell you more if you want.

       Also the "missing link" has been found a few times. It's just not what creationists want to see.

       Then let me reformulate my argument: it is utterly remarkable that things only seem to have died in conditions favorable towards preservation when their transition from one kind to another was complete.

       Please. The whole thread is about "And these conclusions were not drawn on religious grounds", so don't give us that "what you don't believe in macroevolution so you must be a religious zealot" bullshit. There are good reasons why a Socratic, skeptic and objective approach based on the scientific method should be allowed to entertain the thought that maybe, just maybe the current state of speculation is not going to be the last word ever spoken.

       Then do so honestly, instead of resorting to insults to my intelligence. The premise of this whole thread is that it is completely fair and logical to doubt the prevalent theory/theories of evolution without being a "creationist" or doing so on religious grounds.

       So if you please, back to Prof. Farnsworth's argument. When he arrived at
       <em>
        Australopithecus
       </em>
       , any Dr. Banjo worth his salt would have interjected "excuse me, Professor". The gap between
       <em>
        Australopithecus
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Homo
       </em>
       has never really been bridged, to my knowledge.

       That's the whole point of the argument Futurama made.  A 'link' is found and then people say "well, we haven't found the link between THAT and humans!".  A new one is found and then people once again say "well, you found that one, but where's the link between THAT and humans?!"

       I am not a creationist. I merely reserve some healthy, scientific skepticism towards some aspects of evolutionary theory, as is my right and holy duty as a thinking person. So don't call me a creationist. Don't lump me together with creationists. Don't use arguments against creationists. It's not that hard. It's the whole point of this thread. Why some people doubt evolution without being creationists. I am not attracted to fat, ugly women, that does not mean I am gay. Get it?

      <p>
       That does not address the whole point
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       am making. The link has NOT been found. The gap between Homo and Australopithecus remains unbridged. You, Farnsworth and Banjo pretending otherwise is utterly dishonest.

       Now you may find supposed "links" on either side of the gap until there are no bones under the surface of the planet anymore. But that won't close the gap.

       And before the gap of

       and
       <em>
        Homo habilis

       were more gaps between humans and apes that people wanted filled.  Those gaps have now been filled and now people are just moving on to the smaller gaps to attempt to disprove evolution.  It's true there's no bonafide accepted link between
       <em>
        Australopithecus
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Homo habilis
       </em>
       , but the evidence as of now points towards it being true.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've found a
       <em>
        Homo
       </em>
       fossil that dates to be
       <a href="https://www.newscientist.com//article/dn27079-oldest-known-member-of-human-family-found-in-ethiopia#.VPrw7vmsXId">
        2.8 million years old
       </a>
       and the abstract from the paper that article cites states:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Our understanding of the origin of the genus Homo has been hampered by a limited fossil record in eastern Africa between 2.0 and 3.0 million years ago (Ma). Here we report the discovery of a partial hominin mandible with teeth from the Ledi-Geraru research area, Afar Regional State, Ethiopia, that establishes the presence of Homo at 2.80 to 2.75 Ma.
        <strong>
         This specimen combines primitive traits seen in early Australopithecus with derived morphology observed in later Homo
        </strong>
        , confirming that dentognathic departures from the australopith pattern occurred early in the Homo lineage. The Ledi-Geraru discovery has implications for hypotheses about the timing and place of origin of the genus Homo.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So hopefully we can find something more complete but things look good in that area.

       I am merely trying to put the discussion from its head on its feet. It would be dishonest of you to seriously expect me to discuss the finding of a
       <strong>
        homo
       </strong>
       mandible based on an abstract of another paper speculatively pushing the advent of humans
       <em>
        even further
       </em>
       into the past which you dared not link me directly to, which would have been useless anyway because it is inaccessible to me as it is paywalled and I am not afforded the luxury of being an USAmerican citizen who can just roll into a public library to download it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence I asked you whether you have an idea what the gap I am talking about might be, because I think - I openly admit I am only a layman and will surely not use the words right - it is even more fundamental than the features of mandibles, and allows even to the completely untrained eye to discern monkey and human.

       But we already know that shared characteristics are not evidence for transitional forms. Otherwise, one might cite the platypus as proof that birds evolved from mammals (or vice versa).

       There is no missing link. Fossils are very rare and so no, there shouldn't necessarily be a "whole zoo" of them.

       We can trace our lineage via DNA. We know we are closely related to chimpanzees and a little further diverged from gorillas. We know we are more distantly related to other mammals, and far more distantly related to reptiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fossil record is patchy and incomplete, but the genetic record is not. For us to share genes with so many divergent species can mean only one thing - evolution.

       And that's all that evolutionary theory is good for.  Ad hoc hand waving, which supposedly "explains" stuff, but only after the fact.  Evolution explains none of those things you mentioned.  It's only tacked on at the end.  Evolution has literally No predictive value of any sort.

       Biology books have been using falsified embryo comparisons of animals to link creatures for over a hundred years. This has been known and discussed, but the textbooks proceed to use them anyways, saying the truth would confuse students.

       Now, I don't claim to know one way or the other. But what we often find is an ideological push for something to be true. It tends to be a push that does no good for mankind and so you have to wonder what is behind it.

       Believing in evolution requires you to believe in things that have never been seen, something that is usually the domain of 'conspiracy theorists'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beneficial mutations have never been seen. Antibiotic resistance was once thought to be an example of a beneficial mutation. On closer inspection antibiotic resistance does not involve new
       <a href="http://cmr.asm.org/content/26/2/185.full">
        genetic information.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Overall, the data suggest that acquisition of penicillin resistance in pneumococci is associated with loss of virulence in different models of infection.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Going even deeper into the technical fine print of this study, you find  a tradeoff between virulence and resistance, which the bacteria can balance by changing the expression of genes. No new genetic information is produced.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In this example, resistance and virulence are
        <strong>
         chromosomally regulated
        </strong>
        , showing how the multiplicity of ampD genes may constitute a regulatory mechanism for the ampC gene (β-lactam resistance) and maintenance of the cell wall (thus affecting virulence).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Even mainstream science acknowledges the role played by

       <p>
        The biological functions of proteins are governed by their three-dimensional fold. Protein folding, maintenance of proteome integrity, and protein homeostasis (proteostasis) critically depend on a complex network of molecular chaperones.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is no current theoretical mechanism for proteins to be influenced to drive evolution...
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet proteins are a key part of expressing the phenotype, as they rearrange the coding sections of DNA (according to mainstream science).

      <p>
       DNA itself is highly suspicious, even assuming it exists, it is probably not a molecule of inheritance...

       This particular mutation confers resistance to HIV and other infections.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact you do not know of this and other well known beneficial mutations (lactose tolerance for example) tells me that despite your apparent knowledge, you really have no idea what you're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no current theoretical mechanism for proteins to be influenced to drive evolution...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The genetic mutation that confers HIV resistance results in a change to a protein that acts as a receptor on the cell wall. This change means that the HIV virus can not bind to the cell.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how proteins can be influenced to drive evolution.

       I looked at the study which assessed how long ago the
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9466996">
        mutation arose.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        95% of the Delta ccr5 chromosomes carried the IRI3.1-0 allele, while 88% carried the IRI3.2-0 allele. These alleles were found respectively in only 2 or 1.5% of the chromosomes carrying a wild-type CCR5 gene. From these data, it was inferred that most, if not all Delta ccr5 alleles originate from a single mutation event, and that this mutation event probably took place a few thousand years ago in Northeastern Europe.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They essentially said that due to the frequency of the allele, they can infer the date at which the mutation appeared. Maybe I am misunderstanding something, but I don't see how this is an example of a beneficial mutation.

       If you would like, you could expose yourself to some ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation carries enough energy to remove electrons from atoms, and in doing so damages DNA. This can(and has) caused errors in the cell's replication process, which causes the cell to replicate indefinitely and at an accelerated rate. Furthermore, chemicals/materials called
       <em>
        carcinogens
       </em>
       can interact with DNA, which also causes errors in the replication process. As you may have guessed,
       <em>
        this error causes all cancer.

       The Chinese government are similar to Hitler with their views on racial superiority. It is compulsory teaching from primary school that not only did the Han Chinese evolve independently, but that they are superior to all other humans in every way. They are different than Hitler in that they don't just teach hatred against one religious group, they teach hatred and mistrust against everybody that is non-Han Chinese.

       If what many of us believe about the mysteries surrounding Antarctica end up true, that there are Egypt-like structures and pyramids on Antarctica, and especially when everyone knows that the pyramids weren't just tombs, our understanding of the human race will shift dramatically. If
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       man made is on Antarctica, which it looks like there are, that fact already extends the "human race" from 200,00 years old, to over 15 million years because 15 million years ago was when Antarctica is said to have covered in ice caps. Extending the human race that old would basically shatter the theory that we came from monkeys.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you study spirituality and consciousness, a popular topic in ancient Egypt, the formation of our consciousness is much more complicated than evolution. There's
       <em>
        something else
       </em>
       that give structure and meaning to everything. Evolution may be a result of the structure, but there's something special about humans that I don't think anyone can deny.

       My theory is essentially this. I'm very convinced species have evolved over time. But the jump from a single cell in the ocean to the way my brain works, and the way I have a muscle that pumps blood without getting tired, and the fact have this complex microscopic exoskeleton protected by muscles and everything that makes us "advanced" - we had to have some major help somewhere along the way to get where we are today.

       That's a good view. If you look at the universe as a whole, modern physics does not fully explain the universe. The structure and order we see in everything in nature is not explained by modern physics. There is another force that is hidden from us and disguised as simple gravity that is the "help" I think. It's in everything and manifests itself in consciousness.

       There is an absurd amount of false information in this thread and it's starting to cause me to despair in my hope for humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Darwins theory of Evolution
       <em>
        by natural selection
       </em>
       is the process by which organisms change over time as a result of changes in heritable physical or behavioral traits. Changes that allow an organism to better adapt to its environment will help it survive and have more offspring.
      </p>
      <p>
       A single creature in an entire species may have a small mutation. Perhaps something like small change of a bone structure, such as a certain appendage having more movement capabilities. That mutation ends up giving that creature an advantage over others in his species. It reproduces, and it's offspring have the same mutation. Eventually, since this mutation was beneficial, it spreads throughout the entire species (in maybe 10k-100k years). Then other mutations occur, and the same thing happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a mutation occurs that is disadvantageous to the creature. That creature may not be able to reproduce before it dies, and if it does, it's offspring die at some point. This effectively weeds out disadvantageous genes and only allows(for the most part) genes that are helpful to the species.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a note: Macro evolution is the accumulation of micro evolution.

But the jump from a single cell in the ocean to the way my brain works, and the way I have a muscle that pumps blood without getting tired, and the fact have this complex microscopic exoskeleton protected by muscles and everything that makes us "advanced" - we had to have some major help somewhere along the way to get where we are today. I think.
