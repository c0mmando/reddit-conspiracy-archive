    <div class="md"><p>Because the system of hynotization and control WORKS.  This is the proof.</p>

<p>We buy shit (almost literal shit) made in China by children and people desperate to feed their families.  We buy products from places all over the world like this.  Our TV&#39;s, our phones, our clothes... all of it.  Everything that mark us as &quot;successful&quot; or &quot;wealthy...&quot;  It&#39;s all made by what amounts to essentially slaves.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t care.  We don&#39;t notice.  We just figure that&#39;s their lot in life, ours is different.  We&#39;re AMERICANS.  We are FREE.  We can MARCH AGAINST TRUMP!</p>

<p>In reality, we&#39;re spoiled little 12 year olds (at least, our knowledge of the world at large is on par with a 12 year old).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not speaking seriously, but I am speaking sincerely.  We are spoiled and we can&#39;t see past our own noses to figure out what true injustice really looks like.</p>

<p>What do you expect?  You talk down to them, yet what are you up to that saves the women in the middle east?  It&#39;s easy to point a finger and mock, but it&#39;s much harder to see that you&#39;re just as hypnotized as they are, albeit by different things.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what the world is.  That&#39;s how this works.</p>

By all means if you want to protest protest.  But I have a right to mock your protest.  I&#39;m pointing out the hypocrisy in this protest.

<p>Lost people with no direction or sense of self doing anything and everything to create a superior image for themselves. The image is irrelevant, because it is only projected for other to see. You yourself still cannot see this projection. Only a reflection of it, as you are the source. That projection constantly changes based off of what is reflecting it back.</p>

<p>People try desperately to see themselves this way. The trick is that, like a funhouse mirror, you can manipulate your &quot;reflective surface&quot; to twist that source into whatever it is you want the source to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just wanna say that some of your facts are way off. You said 5% say election was fair? No they didn&#39;t! You then claim most of the 113 victims were killed by the state. Nope. There is a lot of evidence which points to the fact that the bullets pulled from the bodies on both sides are from the same gun. There is also video evidence which alludes to this.  The Ukraine was a fully democratic government which was overthrown by wankers such as this. They even said they would have an election if the people want it, but it wasn&#39;t what soros and the CIA wanted. Do your home work!</p>

<p>The article which wikipedia linked to for the 5% number is elusive, but considering Ukraines political history, it seems reasonable. I have no idea what you mean that the bullets pulled from the bodies on each side is from the same gun, unless you think one gunman with one gun shot everyone who had been shot, and reports of government forces using live ammo are false. The Ukrainian government wasn&#39;t even overthrown. Yanukovych was impeached after violently cracking down on extended protests and trying to align with Russia. He then fled to Russia and new elections were held. It was all legal, according to the Ukrainian constitution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would protesting in front of the Saudi embassy do anything what so ever?  Noone here lives under their laws, so protesting against laws on us soil that dont apply to us citizens is 1000x less effective than demonstrating against a leader the day after he was elected in the same exact place in the same country he governs. </p>

<p>Your idea sounds pretty stupid when i put it like that doesnt it?  You are seriously trying to suggest protesting a foreign countries laws would be a better use of these peoples time?  Do you even understand what theyre protesting?  </p>

<p>Im just astonished right now, you criticize them for wasting their time then suggest an objectively much worse waste of time as a better alternative. At least use a better argument next time. With some logic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s OK, I just haven&#39;t slept in 30 hours or so, which is probably causing some logic issues.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just explain what I meant.</p>

<p>Protesting for women&#39;s rights in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan while on american soil could urge Trump to attempt to take some sort of notice(Same could be said for what they are doing now, so I guess it&#39;s not wasted time). He wouldn&#39;t(and shouldn&#39;t) do more than state his opinion about it on live TV, or perhaps use some form of leverage that I can&#39;t think of right now in an attempt to loosen laws over there.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right though, it wouldn&#39;t do much. My point was women&#39;s rights are non-existent over there and nobody&#39;s outraged about that. They don&#39;t feel the need to though since it doesn&#39;t affect their daily lives. I wouldn&#39;t either.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m not mistaken, there were some protests just hating on Donald, while others have something to do with abortion, feminine hygiene, child support, etc? I&#39;ve seen all of that mentioned in one or more of the protests. If you would like to explain or point me somewhere to read about it, I wouldn&#39;t mind.</p>

<p>This is the first time I&#39;ve heard that and I&#39;ve been on this sub since I made my account and lurking long before that. I&#39;ve not heard even a single whisper of trump and anything to do with abortion in forever. A quick search here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> shows literally a single relevant self post asking &quot;Is Trump Trying To Throw The Election By Trying To Ban Abortion?&quot;. That is the only mention of it. I can&#39;t find any shit like this on duckduckgo that didn&#39;t come from the anal cavities of CNN, huffingtonpost, nytimes, TheHill, bbc, etc.</p>

<p>Aside from that, abortion is advocating for murder, however normal people can make it seem. After googling it, it sounds like he wanted to treat it as murder rather than the removal of a parasitic tumor. He didn&#39;t bring it up again after he was attacked by literally everyone about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You dodged/ignored the meat and potatoes of the original post and my response and tried to attack the context.</p>

<p>Let me be more specific: what are your thoughts on whether the March should have targeted the Saudi Embassy?</p>

<p>Your half-assed response doesn&#39;t hold water either:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lmao! Please!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which part of the context are you incredulous about?  That they are women and men?  That they stood up?  That it was peaceful?  That the moms and sisters and fathers and brothers who went were bringing attention to a littany of issues?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where the fuck were they the last 8 years then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this logic if someone didn&#39;t take action last year they should never take action ever?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a much bigger argument than what a bunch of old men think. </p>

<p>Maybe some people aren&#39;t necessarily against &quot;choice&quot;, but against their tax dollars going to abortions. I know PP does some good work, and if those protesting had actually done some digging, they would know that Our President has said as much in prior interviews. Regardless, if people cared enough, they would fund PP through donations, and no one would be forced to do so. If you disagree, I can give you a little civics lesson on what a <strong>right</strong> is. </p>

<p>BTW, this is r/conspiracy, I&#39;ll give a little inside baseball from a friend of mine who works at P.P. The allegations of them selling body parts from still-alive fetus are true. They are deeply tied to the Deep State, so much so that HRC visited during her campaign. The majority of the children they abort are also black, i bet hispanics are next... They are quite possibly a <em>eugenics</em> operation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, you&#39;re over thinking this way too much.  I didn&#39;t say whether they were right or wrong, I didn&#39;t even say my opinion.</p>

<p>I said they were worried about it, which is a fair enough reason to protest changes.  Don&#39;t project your insecurities/personal beliefs on me, I just gave an answer as to where they were.</p>

<p>So it could be a eugenics lab funded by the devil himself, staffed by paranoid schizophrenics in an attempt to only undermine the constitution, or it could be a public health organization where a majority of under privileged women get their healthcare.... either way, if you asked why they were just now protesting instead of the 8 years where it was never in jeopardy of being closed, I would have answered the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, if your friend &quot;who works at planned parenthood&quot; who&#39;s passing you this insider information, tell him to get solid proof of it and leak it somewhere, or stop selling infant parts.</p>

<p>And the allegations, and proof that have previously been put out about that, was literally just  propaganda and the woman responsible was charged and convicted for it.</p>

<p>And hete is where my sarcasm stops, because I really don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m being condescending here.  Maybe you should look into some mental health programs, if you cant afford it theres legitimately helpful organizations that will work with you. Sincerely, I don&#39;t mean to sound like I&#39;m bashing you, because mental health is a serious issue, but from what you&#39;ve said, it seems like you may need some help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because people are allowed to march for whatever causes they want?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not unusual in any way for people to stand up for things that effect them most personally. A group of women in Asia or the US or South America simply isn&#39;t going to be as directly effect by the actions of a handful of Middle Eastern groups as they would be by their own local policies.</p>

<p>On top of that, the march was in support of all women globally and against any organization or person who would seek to treat them differently simply because they are women. Under the umbrella of their mission statement would fall support for women who are unjustly treated by authoritarian regimes.</p>

<p>TL;DR - The physical location of the march is irrelevant in this case because their mission statement encompasses the unjust actions against women in the middle East. It&#39;s simply not feasible fiscally to get this large and this diverse of a turnout in a single spot on the globe.</p>
