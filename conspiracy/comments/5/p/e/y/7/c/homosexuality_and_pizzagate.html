       With pedophilia "allegedly" rampant throughout the power structure, I wasn't surprised, but still found it alarming the overall number of homosexuals "unofficially" implicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personal beliefs aside, is the conditioning to accept homosexuality, among other things, as being completely normal a stepping stone, if you will, to the full unraveling of morality as we know it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now common place, homosexuality was once as taboo as, say, pedophilia.

       Pedophilia was recently less taboo.  We are at the peak of intolerance for pedalphiles.  People used to get very little to no jail time for abusing kids.  Elsewise more people have met and had positive encounters with people who are LGBT and have been awoken to the fact that they are just people.  I don't know why people care so much about it.

       Pedophiles have been riding the coattails of the homosexual movement and it is disgusting. Violating innocence, especially children is most definitely a crime against humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Defense of any pedophile is shameful and you should re-evaluate yourself. Most of you have never been abused as a kid or had to see how much it fucks a person up. It fucks them up so much they grow up to be pedophiles as well in most cases.

       Bingo is his name-o. They believe what they do is natural and should not be looked down upon. Also a lot of them unfortunately were brought up that way. Being abused as a child then continuing it as they grow up.

       Homo=/=pedo. For most of the creatures involved I'd assume it is more of a power thing then a homosexual thing. From my understanding of what's been put out there they might have a personal preference but will use either. Kind of like how you hear about men being raped by other men as a degradation thing, not so much an attraction.

       This is one of the oldest accusations made by conservatives involving homosexuality.

       Don't say "personal beliefs aside" when this is based entirely on personal belief and anti-gay propaganda.

       Pizzagate isn't a stand alone conspiracy. The Franklin Cover Up, Hampstead Cover up, Jeffrey Epstein, Jimmy Savile, Dennis Hastert, etc., prove pedophilia to be the norm among powerful people. Does Pizzagate involve powerful people?

       The evidence is damning to me. When I see that Instagram or band websites being touted as evidence of pedophilia, I realize how many do not understand the gay or arts scene. What is seen as offensive to some is camp to others.

       And also, people are NOT converted to being gay. They come to acceptance within themselves. There are PLENTY of heterosexual men that have a homosexual experience and don't "become" gay.  And it isn't "caused" by sexual abuse either. This thread is repressed as fuck.

       No, I don't. And that's a shitty accusation to throw at someone who doesn't agree with your moral view. I would say you actually lack morals, by condemning behavior that doesn't effect your daily living or right to do si.

       I'm gay and would never look twice at a child. These types of posts are why nobody takes this seriously, you're actively doing damage to the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, it's not about being open-minded or not- homosexuality is seen across the animal kingdom. And as far as I'm concerned, the Native Americans see us as two spirits, which is awesome. The biggest homophobes in history were from Islam and Christianity, whose practitioners arr well known for their knack for secretly diddling little boys while stoning gay men to death. Talk about hypocrisy.

       The Army should accept homosexuals because it's a volunteer Army. That my two dads crap is because people like you force your moral revisionist version of libido onto public spaces. Islam or Scientology also agrees with you btw.
