        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is part 1 of the story of the biggest scam ever pulled on humanity.</p>

<p>Mayer Amschel Rothschild was a German businessman who inherited a money-changing business from his dad who died in 1755, when Mayer was just 11. Mayer transformed it in to a bullion and coin business, and traveled abroad to master his craft when he was in his 20s, studying under Oppenheimer. It grew to the point where he was handling payments for princes and kings including WIlhelm IX, who was said to inherit the largest fortune in Europe when he rose to power in 1785. Although they had been acquainted since 1775, William IX did not formally designate Rothschild as his overseer until 1801. His overseer.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayer_Amschel_Rothschild">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayer_Amschel_Rothschild</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Mayer Amschel Rothschild&#39;s banking and coin business expanded <em>even further</em> after the French Revolution, when he was handling Britain&#39;s hiring of Hessian (a place in Germany) mercenaries during the Napoleonic wars, to shut down Napoleon&#39;s quickly expanding empire. Here&#39;s an animated map showing the rapid growth of the French Empire in this era, it&#39;s easy to see why the Brits were afraid:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKN-NcyV4oI&amp;t=1m31s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKN-NcyV4oI&amp;t=1m31s</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Mayer Amschel Rothschild died in 1812, but had five sons who were well trained in the business. The Rothschilds take the passing down of the heritage and purpose of the family <em>very</em> seriously, as shown in their family crest. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Great_coat_of_arms_of_Rothschild_family.svg/2000px-Great_coat_of_arms_of_Rothschild_family.svg.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Great_coat_of_arms_of_Rothschild_family.svg/2000px-Great_coat_of_arms_of_Rothschild_family.svg.png</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolizing the five dynasties established by the five sons of Mayer Rothschild, in a reference to Psalm 127: &quot;Like arrows in the hands of a warrior, so are the children of one&#39;s youth.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the sons ended up being the richest man in the world, Nathan. </p>

<p>From London in 1813 to 1815, Mayer&#39;s son Nathan Mayer Rothschild was instrumental in almost single-handedly financing the British war effort, organizing the shipment of bullion to the Duke of Wellington&#39;s armies across Europe, as well as arranging the payment of British financial subsidies to their continental allies. In 1815 alone, the Rothschilds provided £9.8 million (approx US$869 million today). Nathan died in 1836 at the age of 58. </p>

<p>While Nathan had left Frankfurt to go to London and became a central banking power there, Mayer&#39;s other sons did a similar thing, but went to other locations:</p>

<p>Salomon Mayer Rothschild (1774–1855): Became the central banking power in Vienna, Austria.</p>

<p>Calmann Mayer Rothschild (1788–1855): Became the Central Banking power in Naples, Italy.</p>

<p>Jakob Mayer Rothschild (1792–1868): Became the Central Banking power in Paris, France after the Naponelonic wars. </p>

<p>Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1773–1855): Remained in Frankfurt, Germany and took over where his dad Mayer Amschel left off (That&#39;s right, Mayer just swapped his first and middle names when he named his first son who took over the Frankfurt business) but this son Amschel died childless, and passed his part of the Empire back to the sons of his siblings Salomon and Calmann. So it stayed within the family. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So now we&#39;re up to 1855, just 160 years ago. Five of the largest European countries and their entire governments are now completely funded (and thus completely owned) by a single family. This is all well-known, well-understood history. This is all straight from wikipedia. </p>

<p>So what happened when 3 of them (representing the central banks of 4 countries) died in 1855? </p>

<p>To be continued soon in part 2!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because magnora 1-6 got shadowbanned from reddit for saying things that certain mods didn&#39;t want said (mainly about the JIDF influencing comment sections), who then went digging for dirt and shut down all the accounts by reporting that dirt (minor rule violations from the last 2 years) to reddit admins. </p>

<p>Same reason the <a href="/u/magnora8">/u/magnora8</a> doesn&#39;t exist anymore. I stepped on some mod&#39;s toes on twox and they went digging for dirt and found a time I used that account to get around a subreddit ban and post a comment. So they shutdown that account, and magnora7 was suspended for 3 days. It&#39;s just funny it didn&#39;t matter the other dozens of times I had done it months or years in the past, until I pissed off that one mod, then suddenly they threw the rulebook at me. </p>

<p>Lesson is, if you step on the wrong toes, they will throw the reddit rulebook at you as hard as they can, regardless of how minor the infractions are. </p>
