    <div class="md"><p>Because the fight isn&#39;t over yet for the left. They aren&#39;t taking this whole losing the White House, Supreme Court, and retaining their minority in Congress thing too well. My guess is they had something big planned to happen in the next 4 years and it took them 8 years to get ready for whatever move they were gonna make in this next term. And now it&#39;s all fucked because they overplayed their hand during the primaries and people started seeing at face value the corruption in the DNC. Only plan now is to ensure there&#39;s a lot of unrest and the country divided. These trolls still have their purpose here. Has anyone else noticed that every thread in this sub is now no longer conspiracy, but just a giant left vs right shitfest. This is what they want people, they want us to hate each other. Want us to fight among ourselves instead of pay attention to things they will likely try to do as silently as possible. Of all fucking subreddits <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> should be the last where people are taking sides with one half the Government or the other. Yet as soon as someone mentions anything about Clinton that isn&#39;t condemning her, people just have a kneejerk reaction and start having a pissing match about shit that doesn&#39;t even frankly belong on this sub most the time. Someone mentions Trump positively and someone pops in to argue it so it degenerates the thread to nothing other than a petty fight rather than whatever conspiracy we normally would be having rational conversations about, presenting evidence to each other instead of dismissing each other as a cuck or a faglord or whatever the fuck. Can we all just please listen to each others&#39; goddamned side of the story before downvoting someone to oblivion. I saw a guy ask a question the other day in a thread and he had 20 downvotes. For being inquisitive! It&#39;s not just this sub either it&#39;s all social media, I guess I just expected a bit more from you guys than other people because this is the type of thing we warn people against. Both sides are the same side and they&#39;re playing as all like fiddles, we keep at it like this and we already lost.</p>

<p>Well, first, Hillary is nothing like &quot;the left&quot;.  How Americans somehow think a pro-Wall Street, pro-surveillance, pro-war, pro-free-trade, anti-gay-rights (look at the Defense of Marriage Act - and Kaine!), anti-welfare, pro-incarceration candidate is somehow &quot;left&quot; is just beyond me.  There is basically no difference between Hillary politics and Nixon&#39;s, FFS!</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume you meant, &quot;the Democratic Party&quot;.</p>

<p>The Democrats?  Plan something?  Do you not watch the news?  Are you seeing signs of intelligent life from these people I have missed?  </p>

<p>They want power - pure and simple. There is no &quot;plan&quot;.  If they had some sort of plan, they wouldn&#39;t be such losers.  They wouldn&#39;t have run a campaign whose sole slogan seemed to be, &quot;We are not the Republicans&quot; aka &quot;Republican lite&quot;.</p>

<p>Look at the Obama administration.  Forget about the charisma and the nice-sounding speeches.  Is there any evidence of a &quot;plan&quot; there?  </p>

<p>They are pissed <em>because they lost the election.</em>  No need for some obscure &quot;plan&quot; - that&#39;s all you need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take what you said under advisement and rethink things a bit. Also when I said left you&#39;re correct that the Democratic Party would is much more fitting. Although I still think you&#39;re being too dismissive of the Democratic Party by saying they&#39;re idiots and losers who can&#39;t think ahead. That&#39;s what the elite want from you. They don&#39;t care which side you pick as long as you pick a side and contribute to the dividing of the country. The only reason Republicans taking Washington is a setback is they can&#39;t have them finish stripping away what&#39;s left of our rights. The Democrats are here to strip away freedoms the people leaning left don&#39;t care to see go, as the Republicans are only here to strip the rights that people who lean right don&#39;t care about. My guess is they would have liked to disarm the country before the next GOP president finished our Govt. off.</p>

<p>And that is why he won.  Look around at the special snowflakes that are in this country anymore.  They care more about Jersey Shore than any political stance they could have.  Add that to the fact that the people who are paying even a slight bit of attention have finally figured out that politicians give zero fucks about the general population and this gives us Trump.  We voted for him,  we get to deal with him for 4 or 8 years good or bad.  And you are part of the &quot;system&quot; that got him there whether you like it or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this us part of it too.  So many women I know voted for HRC because she is a woman.  Same as I have heard from a lot of Black Americans about Obama.  It sucks so much that our first woman candidate was that evil woman.  That we couldn&#39;t have been offered someone worthy.  Someone who didn&#39;t betray her sex throughout her political career when she retaliated against her husband&#39;s alleged rape victims that came forward.  Her smug attitude and laughter at her own cleverness getting that child rapist off the charges will haunt me until the day she dies.  I listened to the entire interview.  She is soulless.  Sometimes I joke her strange fits are her demon coming out when it wasn&#39;t his scheduled time... or maybe he was in control and she wanted to say something. =)</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say I have much hope with Trump. His contract with is looks promising and his inability to rub shoulders with the elite of DC.  But his hand just keeps making that conductors movement and supposed satanist hand signals aside I find something very disconcerting about watching him talk.</p>

<p>My only hope is that people would wake up after the DNC fraud stole the voter&#39;s choice away same as the RNC did to us Ron Paul supporters.  But they are excellent at this mag8c show and have most Americans arguing over Russia hacking the election instead of the crimes exposed within the emails.  So easily they are duped. Again and again.</p>

<p>Took a look at r/politics too and what a cesspool.  No one can stop parroting MSM rhetoric long enough to really discuss any issue.</p>

<p>And my fellow women... where is your outrage and sorrow for all the women and children Obama and Bush and Clinton have bombed?  The last two with drones?  You whine about wage gaps (mostly an issue of the types of jobs women prefer not paying as well) but don&#39;t even have one sign protesting the rape and enslavement of women all over the world.  And countries where women aren&#39;t even allowed o attend school or drive or have a job at all.  We aren&#39;t victims here so quit playing victim and start working towards improving our world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because American&#39;s are angry. They know shit is fucked up. They know there are all sorts of problems, and they see a narrative projected that constantly blames: a sex, a race, a religion, democrats, republicans, etc.</p>

<p>Its true that Trump objectified women (many &quot;powerful men&quot; do this), and its true that women get fucked by the system often. Its also true that african americans, asian americans, and native americans get fucked by the system. It is even true that the above peoples now are even starting to discriminate against white men and white women- labeling all whites as racist by reflex, all men sexist by relfex, all muslims as terrorists until proven otherwise, etc.</p>

<p>But really, these are symptoms. The real issue in this world is one of <em>class.</em> The vast majority of wealth in this world is held in very few hands, and the scraps are what most of us must fight for in order to survive. Watch the Twilight Zone episode &quot;The Shelter-&quot; this is what happens when people get desperate- they <em>find rationalizations</em> to justify their suffering, <em>find</em> an &quot;other&quot; that is depriving them of a reasonable means of living, etc. Ultimately, human perception is all about <em>justifying whatever mentality</em> is needed to afford one the means to survive, social relevance, and <em>power</em> to effect the sphere of society. </p>

<p>The greatest shortcoming of our collective understanding at the moment- the great blind spot of the public eye- is believing that current wealth inequality is perfectly fine, that those at the top <em>deserve</em> what they have while others starve, and not realizing that corporate collusion with government has instantiated policies that leave 90% of the world&#39;s population powerless to effect policy... unless they assemble collectively in mass.</p>

<p>So, again, people <em>sense</em> this reality- but they dont have a single defining narrative to guide their actions or their protests. They assemble, but they are marching against symptoms instead of causes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And some people hate them for it, thus they get fucked socially. It may be social, or it may be financial, but each group pits itself against other groups in a struggle to survive. There is a contingent (not all or even most, but some) who would see immigrants deported [because it cuts into the chunk available]. This applies to Mexican (traditionally less skilled in terms of education) immigrants as well as Asian [traditionally more skilled in terms of education] immigrants; perhaps this is why Trump&#39;s &quot;wall&quot; rhetoric and general dislike towards immigration engendered <em>some</em> passionate support among groups in the US. Less immigrants around to take jobs --&gt; lower supply of labor --&gt; labor is paid more --&gt; easier to survive.</p>

<p>Do you see what I mean here? Even if you disagree about Asians, the central point still stands: if a larger share of total wealth is available for all people, there is less incentive for people to band together in tribal groups as a strategy for competitive survival.</p>

<p><em>I believe</em> (so please, do not take any offense) that on the surface you are correct in what set them off... but that ultimately the ideas of racism/sexism/religionism remain issues <em>because things are hard- because of wealth inequality.</em> I went into more details on this in my referenced post.</p>

You spin an argument like after 8 years or more of all the injustice you mention being done, the people just decided to march by coincidence when Trump came in. No. They are marching because of a comment about women he made years ago.</p>

<p>Would they be marching if Hillary had won? No. Would the problems you list have existed if Hillary won? Yes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, but I suppose I should expand on one aspect of the tension not mentioned in my initial reply.</p>

<p>There is actually a sizeable contingent of women today who believe their biggest enemy is discrimination set in place by <em>men.</em> While to be fair they do realize it is not <em>all men,</em> the &quot;patriarchy&quot; is still considered their #1 enemy. But the biggest enemy- far more than the remaining patriarchy- is <em>wealth inequality</em> and those who instantiate its existence. Ironically, a male-dominated patriarchy that oppresses <em>99% of all men and women in this world.</em></p>

<p>The patriarchy that exists now is an equal-opportunity hater- it doesnt care what your gender is (or your skin color), so long as it dominates the vast majority of resources on this planet for itself.</p>

<p>And so, as things get more and more difficult, men and women and african americans and and and look into society trying to find out <em>WHY</em> things are getting harder. African americans see the racism in history, the fact that a disproportionate of their numbers are poor, that a disproportionate of their numbers are in jail, that a disproportionate number of their numbers are shot by police officers out of suspicion, and thus draw the conclusion of racism as the biggest problem. <em>Some</em> white people (like white supremacists) see the same details as african-americans, but see it as a justification of their hatred.</p>

<p>Women see a man who said &quot;grab them by the pussies&quot;- a man they clearly see as part of the &quot;patriarchy&quot;- get elected President. That is a <em>spark</em> that reinforces their patriarchy worldview... And so they march...</p>

<p>These groups are all pointing the finger at each other, but noone recognizes the greatest perpetuator of struggle on this planet today is wealth inequality. The real enemy is not the black man or white man or woman or native american next to you- the real enemy is the small group of those at the very top who fight on behalf of exorbitant wealth inequality, and the <em>answer is to unite with those around you instead of condemning them.</em></p>

<p>And as a final note, I want to say that their ARE unfortunately racists and sexists and those who hate homosexuals and and and... but wealth inequality <em>feeds it all</em>. You can stomp the ants by going after individual racists, sexists, etc... or you can <em>solve the problem by killing the ant-spawning ant-hill of wealth-inequality.</em>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People do not know how to make their anger constructive. We shouldn&#39;t tell people that their anger is invalid. but they needn&#39;t be glorified just for being angry.</p>

<p>However people in general have been drawn into their own egos due to many factors ( Facebook, extreme division within society, collapse of community, collapse of family to name a few). They feel compelled to express their egos because that is the only thing they place  value upon. This is why they march.</p>

<p>Now to make anger constructive the ego must be balanced with the id. A productive march would incorporate real community action rather than just yelling</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Found this elsewhere on Reddit. </p>

<p>To my friends who voted for him: I think less of you now. I think less of you because you watched an adult mock a disabled person in front of a crowd and still supported him. I think less of you because you saw a man spouting clear racism and backed him. I think less of you because you watched him equate a woman’s worth to her breast size and you got on board. I think less of you because when he attacked a veteran’s family that gave the ultimate sacrifice, you said nothing. I think less of you because you watched him brag about assaulting women, then you sheepishly looked away. It isn’t your politics that I find repulsive. It is your personal willingness to support racism, sexism, and cruelty. You sided with a bully when it mattered, and that is something I will never forget. So, no… you and I won’t be “coming together” to move forward or whatever. Trump disgusts me, but it is the fact that he doesn’t disgust you that will stick with me long after this election.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I thought too! I feel like I, myself, have said worse than &quot;grab em by the pussy.&quot; I kinda understand it but I still still think it&#39;s ridiculous when you could be marching against human trafficking and stuff like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, please tell me more about how I hate myself, wise angry one. Why do I hate myself? Because I&#39;m a single female with a good job and my own home? Or is it because one day I may want to have children and I should abort the fetus, because it was half made with a man? How dare I succumb to procreating and be ing a mother, that&#39;s doing the mans bidding! I must hate myself, clearly that is the answer. I&#39;m the one that&#39;s been brainwashed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how either candidate even got true support. They are both atrocious for different reasons. They are both probably pretty corrupt (one for sure). Bernie is such an obvious winner, after the election what does he do? keeps advocating for a better america the way he envisions it and he will keep doing that. He&#39;s a passionate person who would be an asset in a leadership position. Where is hillary now? she isn&#39;t doing shit all, did she ever do anything outside of shill her way to the top?</p>

<p>Sure Trump is no great candidate but at least he has shown he&#39;s intelligent via his business empire. It&#39;s a shame that he&#39;s perceived (and maybe he is) the way he is in the sense of regression on a social level but people act like social regression is somehow worse than effectively the most obvious corrupt candidate of cabal of the deep state. The fact that her attitude was &quot;it&#39;s my turn&quot;. Mother fucker. The future of a society is not based on your personal egostroke for power. </p>

<p>Trump might be a terrible candidate, however I think he is also willing to listen. He will listen to the people at least and if we have a big enough honest public outcry about a real issue. He is too focused on economics and country organization, I don&#39;t think he cares about social issues. Maybe he shouldn&#39;t, maybe it&#39;s just what the USA needs is to bolster it&#39;s economy. The military industrial complex is starting to get outted for what it is and what it&#39;s doing on a public scale. </p>

<p>The only options for the survival is to either double down on war or try to fix current war situations while slowly making a transition away from a war based economy. Unfortunately the choice not to double down is also to give up a level of global control. The world may change drastically and unpredictably if that happens. </p>

Dear protesters, people in general don&#39;t care about Hillary Clinton. She was in no way a viable option for 4 years of presidency, still you had to push her and her agenda. 
LBG rights - WTF, it&#39;s equal rights. nobody cares about your sexual orientation, unless you make it obvious and in their face, at which point people begin to appreciate you less.
Reproductive rights - if you&#39;re a lesbian, you shouldn&#39;t be too concerned with abortions, birth control and other such nonsense.Am I right?
Ah, and Trump said to grab women by the pussy. He said it 20 years ago. It&#39;s not like he said it in the campaign. Obviously, the women who were grabbed enjoyed it. Celebrity or not. See what happened to Cosby? Even as a celebrity, he got tried for rape. That didn&#39;t happen to Donald because it was all consensual.
So now back home and stop crying, you have another shot in four years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A belief that we live in a democracy is a failure of our schools to teach basic Civics. &quot;I pledge allegiance to the flag,  and to the Republic for which it stands.&quot; Acient Rome was a republic in which the Senate elected the emporer.  In our world, it is the electoral college that elects the President.  I dont know of any pure democracies on a national level (but I could be wrong). The bottom line is, you may not like the result, but the model of a Republic has been widely accepted, well received, and hugely successful.  You may not like Trump, but HRC was not cheated.  She, in fact, tried to do the same thing that Trump did: earn enough electoral votes (not popular votes) to win the Presidency.  The election was hers to lose, and she did just that.</p>
