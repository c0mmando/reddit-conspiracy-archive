       All self-congratulating war criminals are there. Most have never produced a single ounce of wealth in their life. Their contribution to this universe is wholly negative; looting wealth from virtuous humans and using it to advance their nefarious, pathetic goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now citing Jesus. The hubris is suffocating. The hypocrisity is overwhelming. The fakeness is debilitating. Their evil is malodorous.

       And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standingÂ in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. Matthew 6:5 in case anyone didn't know what you were referencing. Now feel free to be angry at your cousins for pissing both you and his god off with his 5 minute Thanksgiving prayer lol.

       He possibly could be, but he'd never publicly say. In America for now Christianity is the majority religion. For a candidate to come out and say they're atheist or possibly with things going in the Middle East a Muslim than that would be political suicide. Especially for Trump who's main voter demographic was more Christians than any other group of people.

       From what I've researched about what he's said publicly is when he goes to church sometimes. I personally believe he's agnostic by the way he lives his personal life. I also know many better Christians than myself say he definitely isn't a Christian. Especially after he said he's never asked God for forgiveness because he's never done anything to ask for forgiveness. Anyways I'm not trying to preach about anything. That's just my opinion on his personal religious views.

       Yea haha. Basically just proves his narcissism. Yea man thanks for respecting my views especially on Reddit. I always try and respect others views on things if they aren't trying to harm me in some way. I don't understand the type of people who can't get along because of opposing opinions on stuff. I'd never try and force my views and opinions on others and I expect others to do the same, but that doesn't happen a lot of times.

       Exactly, it is a good thing if someone can take the ideals of a peaceful religion and consult those ideals when forming policy. It is the preaching of the religion and the use of God as the justification for passing legislation that should be kept out of politics.

       Separation of church and state means there is a new church representing the state: a hermetic, mechanist, materialist cult of knowledge that practices human sacrifices, seeks to destroy everything that is beautiful, distorts every virtuous value in nature. That's the "secret" state religion now.

       I don't like this word, it is a Marxist term. Is a fat usurer banker who produces no wealth and bribes politicians a capitalist? If so I join you in the criticism. Neoliberalism is a better word IMO. The foundation of that evil system comes from the counterfeit currency we are coerced to rely on in place of honest money.

       The evil is when the state steals land from the collective commons and privatizes all of it, thus forcing every person thereafter to be born into a state of de facto slavery unto the owners of land.

       It's not in name only. Neoliberal policies deliberately open new markets in other countries by slashing regulation and taxes and allowing Western investors to flood in and buy up all the assets therein.

       I agree with you in principle. The "left" officially advocates for many individual freedoms. It is against the the carceral society, the war on drugs, or the capital punishment. The "right" officially advocates for other kinds of individual liberties. But both agree the State shall initiate violence to impose its goals; they may disagree on the goals, and be more or less subtle in their advocacy for aggression.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about we respect all individual human rights, and stop initiating public violence against free individuals? Only there's no real vocabulary for that; it is either caricatured (libertarian) or distorted (liberal).
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I care anyone should be free to form or join any collectivist utopia they desire, whether fascist or communist (two types of socialism). I sincerely wish any such utopia to be successful and make everyone happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem comes from coercion; don't use violence to impose your utopia on me.

       OK, the first speech after Trump's is a sort of rabbi ranting about the beauty of Zion and what not. Bodes well.

       Yeah all this God shit pisses me off. I believe in some sort of god, but that's a personal thing. I don't need people reading verses from a specific religion pamphlet (badly translated and made additions to at that) that talks about beggating witches like its real shit. It is insulting.

       I don't think OP understands what Statism is and isn't.  This is populism.  Not statism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama was statist, only he was globalist-statist.  He was trying (and Clinton aspired to be also) to become the God-Emperor of the planet.  So coordinating with Angela Merkel types and other supranational statists, trying to pull these NATO toppling maneuvers with the CIA all over the planet to bring about a one world govenment and a techno neofeudalism (orwellianism) by mass surveillance and drone armies and depleting rights and perennial warfare
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is going to be trying to reverse that.
      </p>
      <p>
       We found out NATO generals and Clintons private armies gassed civilians in Syria in order to put in pipelines into turkey and then to greece.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's going to fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is going to end that shit, hopefully, or he'll work with Putin to clean up the mess and "make it right".  That's what he says he'll do.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Now about all the other words OP used.  He's right that a lot of these OIL igarchs didn't make their own money, and but were from the right families, went to ivy leagues and shook the right hands, and had the right 'world domination' entitlement attitudes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is not a part of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes Trump had a lot of help to get the money he had, but he DID earn his money.  It's just he started WITH money.  And anyone who can't make money with lots of money is a clod.   If you gave me 1M today, I'd buy a subway franchise and then within 3 yrs, I'd have 1.5M, and then do it again with 2, then 4, then 8, 32 64, etc.    And be a regional manager with multiple streams of income.  This seems really lame, to be running a bunch of fast food restaurants but it's a biz that's figured out.  Similarly, Trump did this.  He flipped real estate.  He did casinos, hotels.  Very understandable, safe businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       He proved he's an outsider.  He's already doing things very differently and this is good.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have is so broken, you need a big shrewd asshole type to come in and smash it all to fuck, so Trumps our guy
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you are afraid.  I say give him a chance.  We'll see very quickly if the truly is on our side.  Firstly if he starts dismantling all the Clinton horseshit and going after the bad elements in the CIA and fucking them a new asshole

       There's no need to summarize the Trump campaign to me. I get it. Nationalist collectivism versus internationalist collectivism. Both are statist ideologies; the group is supreme, the individual is subordinate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed international collectivism is by definition the most noxious one, as there's much more power involved for those at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether Trump is a sincere "nationalist" or not, I won't get into. I hope he is. It would would mean the end of the "new world order" project. I

       </a>
       , because of the campaign. We'll see soon enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point was mostly that (apart from the Trump family) all the salivating war criminals were there; Clinton1, Clinton2, Obama, Bush, Pelosi. Trump isn't a war criminal (yet). All the others are. All self-congratulating, laughing, feeling essential. The decorum was martial, trumpets, fucking robot salutes, all for the glory of the Empire. It was despicable.

       I'm not here to enlighten you at all, I've also never argued the point that his picks aren't "establishment picks" so I don't know why you're asking me to do that for you.

       I think the way the  positions in this administration are being filled with Goldman Sachs Zionist bankers, Big GOP donors, Monsanto and Big Pharma executives. There are even supremely unqualified people put in charge of departments that are on the record as advocating for their abolishment, is telling.
       <em>
        These appointments are the actions that speak much louder than the words
       </em>
       so many people bought into from Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every appointment so far is being filled with GOP establishmentarians, many are billionaires. This is a far far cry from draining the swamp.

       Exactly, it is a good thing if someone can take the ideals of a peaceful religion and consult those ideals when forming policy. It is the preaching of the religion and the use of God as the justification for passing legislation that should be kept out of politics.
