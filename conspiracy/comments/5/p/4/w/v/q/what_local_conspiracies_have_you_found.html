       Little bit of a change of pace. I know this sub likes to focus on the "big picture" but I'm wondering if anyone has stumbled onto smaller conspiracies within their community.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give an example, the town that borders where I grew up has a mayor that owns two liquor stores. Other than bars no other store can sell liquor (there's a Walmart that doesn't when most do). It's pretty much an open secret the mayor does this so he can make money from his liquor stores.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I ask, what small time conspiracy/corruption have you found where you are from?

       The big picture is the little picture. They all start somewhere. Some guy happens to kiss his neighbor's ass a little bit--goes to his head, he becomes Controller or Treasurer of his little bullshit county of 30k residents. Gets a country club membership, pays off the wife's Toyota SUV--gets a side bitch. The cash starts rolling in the back door, so he then runs for a seat at the state capitol.. and on and on it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       To play the big boy game, though, requires a special breed of corrupt. Most of them learn on the way up while they make friends/enemies at the same time. If enough backs are scratched, enough money is made, the sky is then the limit..and that's why we get this bullshit coin phrase "rising star".

       Nothing to apologize for. I'm just venting about the whole shit show. Matter of fact, it would be nice to get some details on local conspiracies. It could result in some interesting comparisons. I simply don't have any. My locality is rather new to me right now. I'm sure there's shady dealings (particularly regarding natural gas), I'm just not aware of them.

       I've often gotten lost in thought imagining mandatory conscription into politics. Members of the highest levels of academia, medicine, finance, etc, all of whom have little interest in politics, being forced into government positions because they would be the best fit, not because they want the position. Terms would end when the representative brought forth some forms of positive contribution to society, however small. I don't know why, but I find this thought absolutely hilarious.

       It is precisely how it
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be. It makes the most sense. Career politics should not exist in any form. A old-boy lawyer should not be deciding whether NASA is allocated money for legit science. An investment banker should not be dictating foreign policy. I feel the same way about any and all local positions, including police (with physical standards).

       TLDR:  Dead cop was signing traffic camera tickets.  They claimed it was glitch.  Cops were most likely not showing up at all to the contractor's office at all to review the tickets.

       I live in Northern Virginia and it's widely known or suspected that the cops out here are drug traffikers. Now I've smoked some weed in my day and met some interesting dealers. But apparently a guy got busted in NJ his product and cell numbers were all 703 based. NORTHERN VA. When the cops looked deeper the case was suddenly frozen and closed. So  fast forward a couple years to 2016 and 40 random drug busts happen in my little suburban town. Raids not for meth or coke but for weed. So we all asked how and why. The police stated they received leads on numbers. Come to find out the NJ dealer has family in VA who lives in Nova and whose brother happens to be a Fairfax County Police officer. I could go into more detail but it's very weird.

       So on Dec 22 a close friend was murdered inside his house. His name was Henok Yohannes. That being said if you Google him you will see the case and how disturbing it is. OKAY so with that news and the drugs new running rampant in my County the police have issued statements saying it was drug related. BUT nothing new to report. A Young Ethiopian girl around the same age was murdered and nobody knows how or why. I think she saw something. THE COPS AREN'T EVEN LOOKING FOR ANYONE AS THERE HASN'T EVEN BEEN A PROFILE MADE OF THE MURDERER YET. Keep in mind I live in Fairfax county. MAYBE 1 murder every 5 years here. I think the cops no more about it then they want to release or they did it. SERIOUSLY. The girl was left dead posted up on a tree. No one knows how she got there.

       I live beside a motel that was hurt by a new highway which bypassed it. Over the years business got slower and slower until they only rented it out to the management staff. This year it was closed and no one lived there, it had the power cut, and the mail box was full of unopened letters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The place burned down. It was a windy day and the only thing that separated our house from the massive inferno was 200 feet of forest. Thankfully, the fire department performed admirably and contained it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Months later it is ruled suspicious but no suspects are identified. As far as I know the owners had solid alibis and no one could be placed at the scene of the crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know insurance fraud is not much of a conspiracy but it would have taken a group effort to pull this off. Most likely the owners hired someone to do this, but many things could have happened. One thing I do know though, is a building disconnected from electricity on a day with no lightning is unlikely to catch fire by itself.

       Tacoma Washington. Heard stories of course about the opium tunnels. Not a common knowledge thing but we kicked out all the Chinese in the 20's I think, may have been earlier, never found em. Officially.
      </p>
      <p>
       In those days you didn't go to Chinese bars because you could be drugged, forced to sign a document of servitude, led down the tunnels to the port, and now you're working on a ship for 30 years.

       Prob not. While also built pretty heavily by the Chinese, the Seattle underground is the remnants of rubble after a city fire that they built the modern city on top of. Think old new York from futurama.

       My high school district in Illinois was gerrymandered in such a way to segregate all the white kids from the rich suburb in one nice school while the older school is populated by the more diverse kids from other less affluent suburbs.

       I have been doing a lot of research into local water departments. It is surprising which local departments will choose to fluoridate and which do not. Look up your local water department and check the fluoridation level! It is usually included in the annual water report which can have other helpful info.

       In 1986, a high school boy in my hometown was "accidentally" shot in his home.  The official story never made sense -- for one thing, there were
       <em>
        two
       </em>
       shotgun blasts.  But it was ruled accidental, and that was that.  Until 24 years later, when I'm watching CNN and there has been a mass shooting in Alabama:  three dead, three wounded, and the shooter was the boy's sister.
Turns out, 24 years before, the boy's mother --a local politician and supporter of the police chief--got the chief to cover up the murder.  Even though the sister used the loaded shotgun to try to carjack a car after she shot her brother.
