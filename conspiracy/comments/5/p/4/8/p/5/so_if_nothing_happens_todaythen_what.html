    <div class="md"><p>Deceived? For what though? Because if the &quot;elite&quot; were after martial law and a one world government, wouldn&#39;t <em>this day</em> be the day to do it? And so if they don&#39;t do it, does that mean that maybe the conspiracy is, that there <em>is</em> no conspiracy? I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just asking. When is this martial law, new world order thing supposed to happen if it doesn&#39;t happen today?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya. Like maybe the conspiracy - THE ONLY conspiracy, is a plan to keep people thinking there are conspiracies so we don&#39;t meddle in the very real, but mundane, day-to-day ops of the government. Creating self-serving bills, passing self-serving legislation. Wars.</p>

<p>All that is very real, but maybe they<sup>TM</sup> have spun this artificial mystery to keep the common man out of politics and rule making.</p>

<p>Just a random thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are on to something here. Have you seen the &quot;Eric Braverman&quot; series by George Webb? He details conspiracies to do with oil, drugs, and human trafficking. Problem is it&#39;s on the surface &quot;boring&quot; in its filled with detail, people we havent heard of, corporations we dont know. It&#39;s not as sensational and theatrical as an attempt on Trump at inaugration. And yet this is how we can uncover their truly heinous deeds. They try and bury it in a pile of mind numbing beaurocracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they assassinated Trump today it would, in my eyes, confirm the reality that he was opposed by a massive conspiracy that involved the MSM, the current administration, members of the GOP and various other international players. If that happens, then all cards are off the table and I truly think we&#39;ll descend into massive unrest and possibly see another civil war. </p>

<p>If they want to stop Trump it has to be done through manipulation and propaganda, which have already failed as no one is willing to trust what the MSM has to say about Trump.</p>

<p>Nothing is happening to him. The fearmongering is just marketing to make him seem &quot;anti establishment&quot;, and to increase the division amongst people. It&#39;s the old divide and conquer strategy. The real elite is keeping you divided, distracting you, so that you&#39;re busy fighting amongst yourselves, instead of taking aim at the elite itself. </p>

<p>No. The MSM has all this &quot;let&#39;s assassinate him&quot; or &quot;he is not legitimate&quot; or &quot;russia hacked the election&quot; nonsense not to convince anyone, but to force Trump supporters (and Hillarybots) deeper into their existing cognitive/identity biais.</p>

<p>Think of Michael Moore, he was fairly righteous during Bush 2, then turned full-retard under Obama; in 8 years never called him a war criminal, when that&#39;s obviously what he is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sad to predict many Trump supporters will cheer when their candidate will sign the US into a new multilateral monetary order (=globalisation ad nauseam). He&#39;ll say he got a great deal, and they will believe him.</p>

<p>If you want to prosecute as many wars as Obama did, you need a nobel peace prize winner. If you want to make the final push towards a NWO, you need someone who pretends to be against globalisation. That&#39;s how you stifle opposition, that&#39;s how you avoid civil war. Identity politics. The Trump campaign was a psyop.</p>
