Has nothing to do with nwo.  It doesn&#39;t matter what republican was there; it would have still been a showdown between &quot;the racists, ant-lgbt, religious fanatics&quot; vs the ultra-leaning neo-dems.  The fact that Trump has a big mouth and he was able to power through all of the accusations just made it all blow up even worse.  But the only reason he was able to power through was that enough people were tired of being shit on</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, Trump may be the most divisive man to hold that office in modern times. </p>

<p>He attacks Americans regularly on Twitter. Hes ales us talking about his &quot;enemies.&quot; He attacked a civil rights icon ffs. That alone is more divisive than anything Obama ever did. </p>

<p>He has made his entire campaign about identity politics from top to bottom. That&#39;s incredibly divisive. He can&#39;t sincerely speak about uniting America. </p>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t think he&#39;s divisive, the majority of voters who voted against him do. The majority of Americans who currently disapprove of him do. </p>
