       Actually, the climate of heavy division was mostly formed throughout Obama's 8 years - Trump, as a character, was the straw that broke the camel's back. Has nothing to do with nwo.  It doesn't matter what republican was there; it would have still been a showdown between "the racists, ant-lgbt, religious fanatics" vs the ultra-leaning neo-dems.  The fact that Trump has a big mouth and he was able to power through all of the accusations just made it all blow up even worse.  But the only reason he was able to power through was that enough people were tired of being shit on

       Sure, the media can make him out to be that, but he isn't if you actually listen to him. He's a nationalist. I have my own thoughts on the matter, but that is the truth. He's more inclusive than Obama, that's for sure... What does that mean, going forward? No idea. But, he is not divisive. Obama was...

       They are carrying out this divisiveness, not Trump. They are carrying out the will of people like Soros trying to keep it going. Extending the division because HRC didn't get the job. Just look at all the protests happening as we speak. That is not of Trumps doing.

       Are you living in a cave? He's been divisive as shit across nearly ever social platform. People are constantly fighting and arguing about him, which is exactly what the people in charge want, a divided populace. It's no coincidence that two highly divisive candidates arose as favorites for this election. They would get a divided America no matter who was elected.

       Dude, Trump may be the most divisive man to hold that office in modern times.
      </p>
      <p>
       He attacks Americans regularly on Twitter. Hes ales us talking about his "enemies." He attacked a civil rights icon ffs. That alone is more divisive than anything Obama ever did.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has made his entire campaign about identity politics from top to bottom. That's incredibly divisive. He can't sincerely speak about uniting America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you don't think he's divisive, the majority of voters who voted against him do. The majority of Americans who currently disapprove of him do.

       No, Trump did not attack Lewis. Lewis called him an illegitimate president, to which Trump fired back about the job Lewis is doing in his own district. 
And right now Lewis is calling for

       He's not the one creating the divisions though. I honestly can't fathom why people think 90% of the hateful shit they do about him. The media has created this seperate reality that is almost entirely fiction, and it's a travesty. He's actually kind of boring and shallow.

       For some time he was speaking truth, in a most divisive way, though. So , some people don't like what they hear. Especially MSM doesn't know how to deal with it. Now, THEY were divisive in their entirety allthrough the primary and presidential campaign. They didn't drop an inch, as seen on inauguration. Did you see people on streets booing MSM report cars in inauguration? Ofcourse you didn't.

       The NWO refers to the New World Order,unless your taking about the rap group or wrestling.

       Trump is not in favour of this Establishment World Order or The Globalist agenda.This is clear.

       The election of Trump combined with Brexit leaves the NWO plans in tatters.
