        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Globalism makes sense.  </p>

<p>There are certain issues that affect the entire world that can only be adequately addressed in a global fashion.  To deal with global trade, environmental protection and sustainability; to create a place where dialogue can be used to address disputes instead of war just makes sense.  Have we not forgotten the mistakes of our past generations?  The millions and millions who have died senselessly over disputes that could have been better resolved if there were better mechanisms to resolve them than war?</p>

<p>Of course there are some trying to take advantage for their own personal agendas but that can be said for any institution.  Checks and balances are important, and they can be applied and upheld if we make the effort to do so.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this anti-globalist movement is more paranoid speculation and fear of impending changes that render old, outdated modes of thought and organization obsolete.  I don&#39;t see it having any credibility.</p>

<p>It seems like many are missing how technological, economic and social changes are making a global society inevitable, but then assume these changes are due to malignant conspiratorial forces.  Of course there are powerful people who want more power.  Of course there are people trying to capitalize on these trends for their benefit, but there are also organic developments that propel change as well.  Globalization would happen without conspiracy, because it is a completely logical and inevitable consequence of technological, economic and social evolution.</p>

<p>This trend toward nationalism away from internationalism seems to be the death throws of obsolete beliefs, values, prejudices and modes of thought and behavior.  It seems completely illegitimate to me. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to hear some thoughts on this, because I&#39;ve always considered nationalism to be an absurd value system, no different than any other form of racism, sexism or identity politics.  It is a superficial division between one people who all share this planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are these incompatible?  The only things that shouldn&#39;t be choices are choices that negatively impact others.  Polluting for example.  You&#39;re poisoning other people, plants and animals.  Spewing poisons into the air and water, giving people cancer is limiting others&#39; freedom and choice.  Particulate matter in the air and toxins in the water don&#39;t stop at borders and go through customs.  A global governing body is the only entity that can effectively deal with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can&#39;t even make sure our own government works for us at this point.  Same goes for the vast majority of the other countries out there.  I always see the same thing:  optimists with rosy glasses talking about the potential benefits of globalization/one world government without considering the very real dangers.  And considering the history that people have of being awful to each other, the dangers are far, far more likely to happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have we not forgotten the mistakes of our past generations? The millions and millions who have died senselessly over disputes that could have been better resolved if there were better mechanisms to resolve them than war?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see your point here.  You make it sound like in the past war was the only option but things are somehow different now.  People haven&#39;t changed.  Shit don&#39;t change.  Technology is better but people are more stubborn than ever and all that means is that we have more effective ways to slaughter each other.  Technology has evolved but people have not.  We are still proud, selfish, greedy, stupid animals who can&#39;t put aside our differences.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course there are some trying to take advantage for their own personal agendas but that can be said for any institution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds like an argument for limiting the size and power of institutions to me.  Or you want one of these institutions of questionable motive to have a global influence where no one can escape its influence on any country??</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Globalization would happen without conspiracy, because it is a completely logical and inevitable consequence of technological, economic and social evolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes but people aren&#39;t debating the origins of globalization.  They are debating the potential outcomes.  You seem to be looking at a global society ran like golden age america.  It seems like you are not imagining the very real possibility that it devolves into some hellish nightmare scenario and at that point then what?  There will be no foreign army to swoop in and save the day.  You will be at the mercy of the world government.</p>

For example, more elaborate panopticons, or systems that extract wealth from the many for the benefit of the few.

Principally a monitoring device.   Economic changes are consistent with that (see above, <em>top 0.1% are freer and wealthier.

    <div class="md"><p>Another example, though on a smaller scale, would be the CCCP, or USSR (depending on how you want to phrase it).  On paper, the idea was to have a group of nations who each had their own internal governments, who also had a representative in a larger central government which oversaw the smaller ones.  This larger government would provide a place where each nation could present their grievances against the other nations, and in turn the government could consolidate each nation&#39;s laws into a concise and comprehensive set of laws that would apply to everyone.</p>

<p>In practice, the nations lost all their independence, and fell under the totalitarian control of the few who were selected (not elected) to the positions held within the main central government.  Those selected served not to push the agendas raised by each partner nation, but instead to their own gains; all of which was oversaw by a leader with near on dictatorial power.</p>

<p>People fear the same thing happening in a globalist type scenario.  Nations lose their independence in favor of having a single overlording government telling them how to rule their countries...or else.</p>

No war = no revenue for the biggest industry in the world. While globalization is in the best interest for humanity, the small percentage of people/corporations that control most of the current institutions would lose huge amounts of money in the event that war was no longer accepted, and therefore spend much of their influence creating nationalist sentiments and fear, which in turn creates more war and more profit. With the majority of each countries population being sheep that react to fear mongering in a way that profits war economy, there will always be a divide amongst nations and globalization will never be possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really just a matter of wealth distribution and rates of growth. China, India, Mexico etc made great advances over the last thirty years as capital inflows and trade balances increased. Wealthy nations enjoy benefits (cheaper iPhones say) but have given up jobs/wages and capital formation (factories) to do so. In theory this is most efficient as extra profits can be reinvested and it benefits everyone. We are the point however where people are saying &quot;We&#39;d really like those jobs to stay nearby actually so can you please not make it so easy for capital and goods to flow everywhere?&quot; Implicitly they are saying they are willing to pay higher prices and accept slower growth as a consequence. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s a bit of a matter of choice. The globalists are interested in highest growth and income levels for everyone across the world. Nice ideal but go talk to a family who&#39;s standard of living has decreased over two generations because it&#39;s cheaper to produce a truck in Mexico than it is in Michigan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the central problems with globalization right now is free flow of capital while labor remains locked behind borders and immigration policy. This creates arbitrage opportunity for the wealthy. They can move their money to places with low wages, such as China or India, but the people there can&#39;t migrate here nor can we migrate there. So no capital / wage equilibrium can form. And further, those investing in low wage labor and importing finished goods simply can&#39;t lose money - and create a positive feedback loop for offshoring jobs - because of price differentials between locally produced and offshored produced goods and services. </p>

<p>Globalism policy, as currently implemented, is an inherent moral hazard. There&#39;s no risk to investment. And it&#39;s impoverishing everyone. Even those working for slave wages abroad (because it drives up prices there while sustaining lower wages). </p>
