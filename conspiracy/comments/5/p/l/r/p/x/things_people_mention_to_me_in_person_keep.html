       So, this has happened several times. I was suspicious the first time it happened, but kind of brushed it off. Here are some specific examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple months ago I go to a friends house. She shows me this super cute jacket, I ask where she got it, and she said a sight from China,and it took a couple months. That evening I was browsing on my Facebook, and the jacket pops up in a shopping ad for a company based out of China. I had never heard of it, so I text my friend, and sure enough, same random site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, I am at a work meeting. My coworker talks about how she is buying an inflatable movie screen, which I had never really heard of. Sure enough, I am browsing FB, and it pops up on my feed!
      </p>
      <p>
       Both instances my phone was on, in my purse or pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do I do? Get a new phone, delete all history? Also please tell me I am not crazy in freaking out over this.

       Use the search function the sidebar. Lots of people here have reported that the Facebook app listens to everything and serves advertisements based on what it hears. A few people have proven this by placing a phone near a Spanish radio station and then receiving advertisements in Spanish afterwards.

       Do you have FB messenger installed on your phone?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed similar tendencies with Google and my phone.  In my job, I work with a lot of Indian people and regularly refer to Indian names/cities while I'm working.  My phone is beside me on my desk as I work.  I do not use my phone for any work related activities and nothing in my personal life relates.
      </p>
      <p>
       After I started this new position, I began to notice that my Google news feed has numerous Indian news articles without ever having read any thing related.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm absolutely positive that these major companies use phones to eavesdrop on their customers.

       I do, but I installed it maybe a week ago. The only reason I did was because my phone internet browser would not let me open messages without installing it. Fishy in itself.

       My SO and I were in Target a while back, looking at coffee pods. My phone buzzed and I'd just been emailed coffee pod coupons. It would probably be best practice to turn our phones off, or block the mic when we aren't using them, but who am I kidding? I'm too lazy to actually do that.

       True.  Except the dreaded messenger part doesn't work in mobile safari any longer.  Also the notification counters don't update.   It's a frustrating experience for the most part but I refuse to install their FB and Messenger apps.

       Does the person you are talking to have the FB app? Don't forget you don't have to have it installed to pin you to the same location as another user.  Like you are signed in from the same IP.
       <br/>
       I was at a super bowl party a few years ago and people who were there were suggested friends the next day.  We weren't tagged in any pics together so it I figured it was due to all of is being signed in to the same wifi.

       no. It has happened several times, but the most significant and eye-opening time was when standing at a marina in norway with my boyfriend and I mention on the off chance that to drive a speed boat in Norway, one now has to take a boat licensing course. I have no interest in boats and have never typed anything about boats into google. My phone was in the pocket at the time, but for some reason I had turned it on, but gotten distracted and not typed my password so it was basically not even logged in. About 15 min afterwards, I log in and enter my fb through chrome and the first ad in my fb feed was boat licensing courses. crazy...

      </p>
      <p>
       Now there are also crossover effects that are surveillance mediated, for example if your phone us listening and hears a brand name and then it shows up in an amazon carousel.  That's from tight integration of WOT listeners, super cookies, ad networks, filter bubbles, CIA/NSA profiling, IP and browscap, and AI data mining algorithms

       Yes, I had this happen with Amazon. My GF inherited a lizard. I had never owned a lizard before. We were discussing getting a heated pad to go under the terrarium. I opened up Amazon and what was on the suggestions? A heated pad for reptile tanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a cat person.  But Amazon knew, out of the blue, that we had a reptile.

       When you were online, at any point and on any device, did you search for these things to find out about them?  Facebook tracks your internet usage, whether or not you're a user.  They also track everything else, and possibly use your phone's mic like you seem to be suggesting.  I've heard they even have the ad stuff set up so they can predict what you'll be interested in based upon how you fast you scroll through your feed.
      </p>

       Here's an idea; delete Facebook.

       They are actively building a marketing profile of you. It doesn't really matter if it's Facebook or Google. Any smartphone/computer/smart device with a microphone is now listening 24/7. You're getting targeted advertising on a whole new level and it will only get worse.

       I had something similar happen to me but I started receiving ads on Pinterest.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day I went to a friend's house and mentioned how I loved the quote on her shirt. The next day I went to my mom's house and mentioned the quote on my friend's shirt. That night I started receiving ads on Pinterest for artwork that had the same quote. I never looked up the quote on my phone or computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if this is possible, but I was wondering if it has anything to do with connecting to my friend's internet. I have her wifi password saved to my phone from previous visits. Maybe she ordered her shirt online and once my phone connected to her wifi it somehow started sending me ads based on previous purchases?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm was paranoid before this happened and thought I already went through and reviewed my microphone/privacy settings, but maybe I missed something.

       Your phones mic is always on, not just after saying "Ok, Google" or "Hey Siri". You can confirm this by googling your voice search history. You can hear a recording of every voice search you have ever done.  You will hear yourself saying "Ok, Google" first. How would it catch that unless the mic was already on?

       Actually this reminds me of something. When you use Siri, it records your conversation and Apple stores it. They then listen to them to 'improve' Siri.

       The reason the FB app uses more battery than just about any other app, is because it is constantly listening listening to you via the microphone. As far as we know, it's just listening for advertising data, but I'm sure its uses go far deeper than that. I left FB almost 5 years ago after I found them manipulating my posts- I encourage everyone else to do the same.
      </p>

       There's too many other choices for social networks to be locked into a service which constantly drains your cellphone battery listening to your conversations all day.

       I've experienced this too. Me and my brother were sitting outside and his phone went. It was the garage his car had been MOT'd and he needed a very specific part for it to pass. My brother hung up and put the phone on the table. He mentioned the name of the part a few times. After talking about it for about five minutes he unlocked his phone and went on facebook. Advert right in the middle of his news feed advertising the part that he needed. He hadn't googled it and didn't know he needed the part until the phone call.

       They are very sneaky. I don't have the app (and mysteriously my battery life wasn't an issue after I removed it) but they've stopped you using the mobile site to send / receive messages. You need their messenger app now. They've also started messing with the mobile site to try and get you to download their app.

       They manipulate the news feed. I always try to sort it by most recent, but it always puts them in a random order with posts sometimes days old appearing at the top even though most recent is selected. The other day I had posts from days ago even though it was set to most recent. Sandwiched inbetween them was a post from about 20 minutes ago by a friend. I selected most recent again and it did seem to order them chronologically except the post from 20 minutes ago was nowhere to be seen. The latest one I could find was 30 minutes ago. I knew who posted it so went on their profile to see if it had been deleted, but nope still there yet it had vanished from my news feed. They must do this to manipulate you

       I don't know why you are freaking out. I'm assuming you didn't read any of the terms and conditions documents etc. but its all explained there. There are also warnings that pop up when you start apps that have you grant access to your microphone, contacts, storage, etc.

       youre not crazy, they monitor your email, your facebook and other social accounts. They know who your friends are too, etc, scary but not paranormal. Dont use facebook, is a door opened for them to get into our privacy. Use ad blockers, and delete your social accounts if you feel like to. :)

       I am shocked that targeted advertisements aren't common knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've ever installed about any major social media app you have to give it permissions to basically your whole phone; mic and cameras included.
      </p>
      <p>
       They record sound bytes that they openly sell to ad agencies. The speed at which you can be targeted by ads is pretty scary and would freak any paranoid person out but has long been the norm.

       More worrying is if this is the technology corporations have imagine your own government.

       It baffles me that this has been well known and documented for years now that tech companies like FB, Google, and their subsidiaries do in fact spy on their users, and people STILL use them. I'm not innocent either, I've still got a gmail account, but I've deleted Facebook/Instagram last year and taped over my cameras. At some point in time, someone out there has in fact watched you all through your cameras and listened through your mic. The more of this you eliminate the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another plus side to this is I got to go through the 2016 election without social media. Almost gave me an outsider perspective on the whole process.

       Something also worth mentioning. They gather data and 'recommend' you people/users. For example, on Twitter. You can put 'hunting' in your bio. You will get people who practically dedicate their account to posting hunting stuff. It has also had an epidemic of 'models' following accounts after that user has seen those kinds of things. They're listening. And its going to be a rough ride.

       get rid of the google OS off your phone completely. 
google has access to your microphone and you cannot turn it off.

      <p>
       you want the spying to stop, you have to get rid off google altogether.

       I don't blame you, and I do believe you. This is why I deleted my FB 2 years ago and refuse to own a smartphone. FB has VERY sophisticated tracking software and seems to be in bed with a great many other companies and news outlets as well now. This IS the biggest spy ring in our country right now and yet you still have people worrying the CIA and whatnot, all those tired tropes, meanwhile missing what is right under their noses.  I don't know if the extent of this collusion will EVER come out, they are very sophisticated and so many companies are in on it now, but it would be fascinating to hear how deep it goes if it ever should. I think many people would be shocked.

       Because Facebook knows you were both in the same bar by GPS, and decided you had enough in common (age, demographic, maybe school or college etc) that you might know her....

       no. It has happened several times, but the most significant and eye-opening time was when standing at a marina in norway with my boyfriend and I mention on the off chance that to drive a speed boat in Norway, one now has to take a boat licensing course. I have no interest in boats and have never typed anything about boats into google. My phone was in the pocket at the time, but for some reason I had turned it on, but gotten distracted and not typed my password so it was basically not even logged in. About 15 min afterwards, I log in and enter my fb through chrome and the first ad in my fb feed was boat licensing courses. crazy...
