The only subject I can think of that would fit is History because it&#39;s written by the victor and there are obviously conflicts that have multiple viewpoints and there&#39;s not enough time to go through all of them. </p>

<p>I&#39;d imagine a lot of it depends on the teacher though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason science was made was because people wanted to find <em>truth</em> -- not what they saw or people told them but the basic objective facts, and people made a system to try to find out facts that were as pure and away from the influence of anything and anyone else as they could possibly get them. </p>

<p>If a science teacher teaches science like gospel then he&#39;s an idiot. A lot of things people are pretty sure about but new discoveries are being made all the time that refine even long-existing theories. </p>

<p>But anyways yeah there are the things people are pretty sure about (because they&#39;ve been tested over and over, both directly and indirectly by assuming these things are true in other experiments) and those things get taught. There are alternative beliefs to what is being taught but I&#39;d bet there is some kind of mandate or requirement to teach things that were borne out by most experiments and most textbooks usually have things that passed the most experiments in them. If this is indeed what happens, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with any of this, although I&#39;m not any kind of expert on education so I can&#39;t be completely sure it does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! I did have some really good teachers as well, along the way. The thing I think is worst, and I hope they don&#39;t still do it, was insisting on righthandedness. I was a lefty and in kindergarten, they started taking the crayon, scissors, pencil, whatever, out of my left hand and putting it in my right dozens of times every day until I started using my right hand consistently. So weird. I hope they don&#39;t do that to kids anymore. </p>

<p>Ideological subversion. He does a good job of explaining how people get so brainwashed, they won&#39;t believe solid facts, even if they&#39;re right in their face. It takes a military boot up their ass to believe it. The indoctrinating makes them think they&#39;re so smart, they could never be duped. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indoctrination is performed on a comprehensive level. In public school the student is only required to memorize facts and regurgitate the answers out, forgetting the memorized information to prepare for the next memorized test. Public schools do not equip students with the skills necessary to engage in critical thought. Public schools have standardized the curriculum to ensure uniformity and to eliminate nuance. Teachers are bound to this curriculum which limits any really chance of actual teaching. </p>

<p>You have to ask yourself why kids in this nation complete over a decade of schooling and can&#39;t  even balance a checkbook. Why don&#39;t schools offer classes where the student can take the skills learned and apply it directly to real life? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Teachers teach students lies, and then punish them if the students point out that they are lies. Students are forced to quietly accept the lies, and with enough repetition they cease to question them any longer. Repetition is the key. It works in advertising, and it works when brainwashing America&#39;s youth, particularly when it is completely supported and reinforced in the popular media.</p>
