       You realize that reddit is built around showing you what you want to see though, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm fairly liberal in my beliefs, and the majority of what I see is liberal leaning posts, unless I go looking.   If you think that reddit is mostly a conservative base, then I have to say that's not what I've seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I despise seeing though is this huge influx of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       being labeled as 'conservative'.  This isn't a place for liberal/conservative agendas.  All these politicians are corrupt and should be scrutinized.

       This is absolutely bullshit, we should do nothing but hope he does his best job, he is our president. We should treat him with respect and not shit on him for being honest.

       All these things that he said that are "offensive" or "bigot like" have truth to them. He speaks his mind which is what we need. After being in this country for 20+ years allowed to vote, he is the first one I've voted for. I've seen all of the lying politicians. They never brought good. We need someone where if the middle class is struggling, they'll step up and speak the truth. If the country is in a place where they are completely looked down on (right now) he needs to tell the Americans this.

      <p>
       The problem with the US nowadays is that nobody can take criticism. Instead of saying to a 300 pound woman "You're beautiful don't change" we should be saying, "that's completely unhealthy and you should do something about it" 30 years ago we could say that. But nobody was because nobody was 300 pounds. If you were you were a freak of nature. I'm not saying it a bad thing but that's off topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that we need the truth. This country shouldn't be based off of lies and scandals, period.

       Clearly thats not accurate or he wouldnt have won. Also most of the people bashing him are basing their opinions on media spin, not facts. When the media colludes together to bash someone for a year+ with never a kind word to say, some people get brainwashed.

       As long the DNC keeps associating with David Brock, then I will continue to call out his astroturf. Why ignore it when he openly brags about his shill efforts?

        A top Democratic super PAC is launching a war room that promises to make President-elect Donald Trump’s life miserable as he prepares to enter the White House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Liberal political operative David Brock, a close ally of former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, told reporters on Tuesday that his super PAC, American Bridge, has established a war room that will act as an aggressor and a watchdog for the Trump transition team and his incoming administration.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         American Bridge has established a rapid response team that will fact-check Trump’s claims in real time.
        </strong>
        Experts are said to be combing through Trump’s domestic and foreign business interests, his personal life, his charitable foundation and those he has associated with, using Freedom of Information Act requests to uncover new details.
