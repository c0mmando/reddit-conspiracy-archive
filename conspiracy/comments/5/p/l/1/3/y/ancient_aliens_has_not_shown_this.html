       Do people forget pangea? That the earth was once one giant land mass? It's not that hard to imagine that people were once united under a similar belief system. Whether a right or wrong belief.

       Yes, and even those earth charts showing how all the pyramids that have been found so far are lined after, and those charts are after the land mass break up, though some few are  underwater the dates assigned are also after the break up from a single land mass.

       One interesting thing is what we end up locating after areas dry up, or when surveying bodies of water turns up things we've either forgotten about or didn't know about.  I recall hearing about villages being found just off the coast of places, one being populated by people when it was above the water.  Kind of makes Atlantis seem a little more plausible.

       Atlantis was real. Graham Hancock has some good stuff on this.

       I don't think they had flying cars, but there was definitely a fairly advanced civilization.

       Atlantis was far more advanced than anyone can imagine. Flying cars is a silly term, but advanced craft capable of travelling through the sky in ways that break the "laws" of physics? They absolutely would have.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is obvious evidence of extremely advanced et's visiting earth every day in the skies all around the world, and they have been visiting for far longer than just the 1940's, or even 3000 bc which is when many ancient aliens theorists believe they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, they were once in constant open contact and communication with humanity because Atlantis was where humanity was centered. I don't want to write everything out because I have already gone into all of this in many posts of mine, including my original thread about Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key to actually objectively knowing the actual objective truth is obvious evidence. I will not go into why evidence has to be obvious or what consists of obvious evidence in this thread, but in short, evidence cannot be hidden, secret, or kept away from everyone, like what "science" does. What they claim as fact is pure conjecture and they claim they have evidence to prove this "fact", but in reality, what they have is not evidence. They come up with their conclusions through illusory correlations, and incomplete and inaccurate information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obvious evidence tells us what is objectively possible, and there are so many many connections between everything, including the obvious evidence, and all of these connections need to be made and logic needs to be used to order these connections in the correct sequence to know the objective truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to know the correct sequence is by what is objectively possible, and what we know what is objectively possible through the obvious evidence. These 3 things (obvious evidence, making connections, and using logic) are equally important and equally necessary to being able to know the actual objective truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Objective comes from reality, what actually exists, and we can see what exists all around us, even if what exists isn't a physical tangible thing. Existence itself exists, possibility exists. Nonexistence also exists, as does impossibility. You cannot say existence does not exist because we wouldn't be here if that were the case. So there is a logical order to everything and reality is based on connections and logic. Obvious evidence is something that  proves to us that something exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is is that obvious evidence itself can be hidden. This seems like a contradiction, doesn't it? I just said up there that evidence cannot be hidden or secret or kept from the public. What differentiates obvious evidence from the "evidence" that "science" claims it has is
       <em>
        the possibility
       </em>
       of anyone, and thus everyone, being able to access it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the key because as long as its possible for everyone to access and see it, then it is still actual evidence, because evidence is only important if people everywhere have the chance, even if not immediately, to see the evidence themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pyramids around the world are obvious evidence. Anyone can possibly get on the internet and see pictures of these magnificent structures for themselves, and many can even go see them in person. This is obvious evidence, and it is obvious evidence of Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I don't need to address this notion that a comet is what destroyed Atlantis, because I have already done so in another post that I will link you to. But first and foremost I will say that Graham Hancock, while looking in the right direction, has come to a completely false conclusion that Atlantis was destroyed by a comet, and has used illusory correlations based on incomplete and inaccurate information to do so. He has used conjecture as the springboard for his ridiculous theory. He has not taken into account all of the obvious evidence, he has not made all of the connections between everything (including our world today and the elite the control it), and he has not used logic to order these connections in the correct sequence, and he could not do so anyways because he is ignoring much of the obvious evidence and has not made anywhere near all of the connections needed to be made.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will link you my post on why this (Atlantis being destroyed by a comet or meteor) simply could not and would not have been the case, but first you need to read all of my other links first in order to understand and appreciate why this would be so. All of the necessary connections between everything need to be made and logic needs to be used to order these connections in the correct sequence, and you will see these 2 things being done throughout the linked posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pay particular attention to what is written about the key to defeating the elite, destroying their system of control, and changing the world, and
       <em>
        what you and everyone can and should do to accomplish that goal
       </em>
       .

       A little late to the party but dragons can easily be jet fighters. Spitting fire from the mouth, front mounted guns. Flying in the sky, self explanatory. It would be simple for them to draw it as a majestic fictional creature because they had no concept of what jets were.
Hell, maybe one day people will laugh at us for drawing UFOs as small sombrero looking objects, when they have the real one to compare it to....

       This isn't the first time the world was global. The Pygmies talk about a time that they were global. (Stanley Turbill's The Forrest People.) The chief said that they were not happy. So they opted to be local again.

       These 2 things are essentially exactly alike because both of these civilizations stem from a common civilization that was so incredibly advanced that much of what it was able to do is considered "impossible" today.
      </p>
      <p>
       That civilization is Atlantis and Atlantis is the key to everything regarding changing the world and destroying the negative system of control, domination, and oppression that the elite have created over millennia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite themselves, as a group, stem from Atlantis and have done everything they can over the millennia to hide and keep secret everything about Atlantis, most importantly its existence, and they have done everything they can to debunk, discredit, devalue, and ultimately fictionalize it because they are aware of what its rediscovery will do to their system.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will be rediscovered and this sub will be the heart of its rediscovery. Not only that, but this sub will also be the heart of its dissemination throughout the internet and everywhere else as well. That is what will destroy the narrative of reality, including history, that the elite have created over millennia that allows their system of control to continue. Destroy the narrative, and the system will be destroyed as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have made a thread going into detail about Atlantis and its connection/paramount importance to defeating the elite and their global control system

        This
       </a>
       comment goes into Atlantis, the elite, secret societies, and spiritual initiates, all things that are important to understand Atlantis, and how there is a lie that the elite are somehow "spiritually" minded.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nmxg4/mysterious_10000_year_old_underwater_ruins_in/dcdga4q/">
        This
       </a>
       comment explains why the "comet" theory of Atlantis' destruction is false and it explains how Atlantis absolutely would have been destroyed, and it also goes into why cyclical rising and lowering of human consciousness is false as well.

       Read everything in detail and reread it so you can truly understand and appreciate all of it.

        share and spread these links to everyone you know who is questioning the narrative and/or system of the elite, and/or who is interested in Atlantis or ancient civilizations.

       Still blows my mind that we're meant to believe an ancient primitive (compared to modern history) were able to build the pyramids themselves, and were able to gather millions of people (almost the entire world population at the time) and build these pyramids. The sheer weight of each block used makes it incredibly hard to believe there was no outside help from something else
