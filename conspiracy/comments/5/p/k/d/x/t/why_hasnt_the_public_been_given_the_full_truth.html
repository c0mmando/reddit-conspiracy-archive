    <div class="md"><p>There is the possibility that aliens just cannot reach us. If you read deeply on the subject of space-time and the distances involved, it seems really improbable if you&#39;re a pessimist. What if there is no extreme high tech stuff such as zero point energy? What if we had to rely solely on combustibles? Time dilation would separate you from your original planet forever, not to mention just exactly how we could be found to begin with. We are so small and in such a large space. Though I don&#39;t doubt aliens exist. The NASA videos and the other UFO videos are convincing, but could that not be a conspiracy to give our existence some meaning? If we could not leave our planet in a realistic way or receive alien guests ever... How would you view your life? Sometimes I hope that there is higher meaning, that planets will awaken and connect like a net to other planets and such. We shall see...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite simply because the elite will never, ever allow it. They won&#39;t ever allow it because it would destroy the narrative of reality they have built up over millennia (the elite, as a group, go back even before &quot;recorded&quot; history), and that in turn would destroy their system of control, domination, and oppression that is based entirely around negativity. This system runs very deep through every aspect of life here on earth and aspects of this system are government, economics, &quot;science&quot;, religion, education, technology, military, law enforcement, etc. and this system runs incredibly deep in entertainment and food as well. </p>

<p>The narrative is the heart of the system and is what allows it to exist, because people believe the narrative so they continue participating in the system. The narrative and system have many, many contradictory elements, but all aspects of these 2 things serve a single purpose: To keep the elite in control of the world and to spread, propagate, and create as much negativity as possible without destroying humanity and the planet. This is because the elite feed and thrive off of continual negativity, and negativity can only be continual if there is a large enough population to do negative things to. </p>

<p>So they will never allow anything to happen that threatens their narrative and system, except they can only do this within the confines of their narrative and system, because to overtly go outside of those things would also lead to their collapse. So that means that they can&#39;t use their advanced tech they received from negative et&#39;s, out in public, and it also means that they can&#39;t immediately enforce marshal law and just oppress everyone. They need to maintain balance to maintain control, and they need to maintain control to maintain the negativity. They do, however, want to up the ante as much as they can, and they still have much more room to maneuver. But they have to do it slowly and incrementally, because anything too sudden and drastic would cause gigantic cracks to appear in their narrative and system. </p>

<p>So that means that they can&#39;t shut down places like reddit, and they will never be able to, because their system will be destroyed before they ever get the chance to, and reddit will be the key to its destruction. In fact, <strong>this sub</strong> will be the key to its destruction, because this sub is the largest and most organized concentration of people who actively question the narrative and system of the elite. </p>

<p>The only problem is that the only way this will happen is if this subreddit itself changes. This subreddit will change, and this subreddit will change the world, but first, its content needs to change.</p>

<p>There is one topic, one thing, above all else, that is what this entire subreddit needs to focus on. It is something that is very much related to extraterrestrials, but even more important, because it has to do with humanity itself, and to get to the point, humanity&#39;s history.</p>

<p>Humanity&#39;s history is the core of the elite&#39;s narrative, and everything about their narrative is revolved around fabricating and distorting history. They have done this to a remarkable degree and have managed to keep the heart, and most important part, of humanity&#39;s history a complete secret from essentially all of humanity. They have used all of their resources and all of their influence to debunk, discredit, devalue, and fictionalize it. Even mentioning it in the &quot;academic&quot; world gets you extreme scorn and ridicule, that is how effective the elite have been at convincing humanity that it never existed.</p>

<p>This most important part of humanity&#39;s history is Atlantis.</p>

<p>The elite, as a group, have known throughout the millennia that Atlantis is the most dangerous thing in existence to them, even more so than the existence of et&#39;s. That is because Atlantis was unlike anything we could ever dream of. It makes our current civilization absolutely pale and shrink to the size of a mouse in comparison. It was, in the purest sense of the word, a utopia. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not even the most important reason why it is the most dangerous thing to the elite. The most important reason is because the elite rose to power there and were involved in its destruction. They are the ones who created the circumstances that allowed for its destruction, because before they had rose to power, Atlantis had never been destroyed. </p>

<p>This then takes me to the point that Atlantis will indeed be rediscovered, and this will couple with the fact that humanity will also learn that the same, continually changing group of elite, were involved in its destruction, to once and for all destroy their system and allow the world to once again return to that state. </p>

<p>But so many things need to happen before that happens, and chief among them is that this sub needs to know many things about Atlantis. There is only 1 way of finding the objective truth about Atlantis and that is through the use of 3 things. Those 3 things are: obvious evidence, connections, and logic. </p>

<p>One needs to take into account all of the obvious evidence, one needs to make all of the connections between everything, even if those things seem unrelated, and one needs to use logic to order these connections in the correct sequence to find the actual objective truth. </p>

<p>The only way to know the correct order is by knowing what is objectively possible and what can objectively possibly happen. </p>

<p>The only way to know that is by obvious evidence. So all of these things themselves are connected and logic needs to be used to sequence these things in the correct order. So there are so many factors to take into consideration, but luckily no one here has to do it alone. </p>

<p>I have made a thread and comments in that thread, as well as outside of it, that have laid out, in extreme detail, everything that is necessary to know about Atlantis, and more importantly, everything we can actually objectively know. I have shown and explained as much as i possibly can within reason everything about Atlantis in order to help everyone understand and appreciate it and its importance to changing the world, and I will continue to do this until this sub is changed and the world is changed.</p>

<p>In order to be able to fully understand and appreciate all of this, however, you must read all of these links in the order that I have linked them, since they build off of one another. This is the correct sequence of these posts, and is thus an example of logic. Those 3 things (taking into account all the obvious evidence, making all of the connections between everything, and using logic to sequence those connections in the correct order) need to be kept in mind when reading because they are the core foundations of <strong>actual, objective, truth</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">Here</a> is the main thread going into detail about Atlantis and its connection/importance to defeating the elite and their global control system, as well as how advanced it was, and why and how it was so advanced.

These comments continue what is discussed in the main body of text and are crucial to understanding and appreciating why at comet could not and would not have destroyed Atlantis. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbkbysz/">This</a> comment goes into Atlantis, the elite, secret societies, and spiritual initiates, all things that are important to understand Atlantis, and how there is a lie that the elite are somehow &quot;spiritually&quot; minded. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nmxg4/mysterious_10000_year_old_underwater_ruins_in/dcdga4q/">This</a> is the comment that explains why the &quot;comet&quot; theory of Atlantis&#39; destruction is false and it explains how Atlantis absolutely would have been destroyed, and it also goes into why cyclical rising and lowering of human consciousness is false as well.</p>
