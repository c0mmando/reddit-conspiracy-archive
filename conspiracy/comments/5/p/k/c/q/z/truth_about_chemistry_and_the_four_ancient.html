      <p>
       I've been thinking about how computer graphics are done.  Polygons, right?  Millions of little polygons, all fitted together to make up a greater whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       These graphics have become so real, that they're almost like real life.  Just look at videogames and movies these days!  Then I thought, what if that really is the formula to reality?  To what we percieve?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I learned about what Plato thought.  If you read the 'platonic solids' article, you'll find that he, going off the idea that the world was made up of four elements, that each element was composed of solid polygons.  Polygons were what made up structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       It began with square polygons for architecture, and then the greeks figured out how to construct archways by shaping those polygons precisely, and fitting them together.  The egyptians did it too - as you know, in the pyramids.  As we also know, the egyptians were one of the most advanced civilizations ever known.  Super smooth floors of polygonal perfection, polygons cut to perfect shapes for stacking into pyramids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I ask this question: How are our bodies, and the matter around us, composed of atoms?  What is keeping those things together?  How are they constantly moving without falling apart?  Just, some unseen force?  Like, we just have to take the scientist's word for it?  I still believe that atoms exist, but there must be some sort of smaller structure keeping them together.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we know all of that isn't simply imagined by scientists, trying to justify further govt funding and more taxpayer money?  It's a big deception, but we know that they'll do anything to justify the funding.  And we know that the govt has lied before about all kinds of things.  9/11, the federal reserve, vaccinations, etc.  It's possible that scientists are hiding key pieces of information, so that they aren't out of a job.  It could be just another one of the special interests out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe that it's possible for the whole entire world to be one big simulation, rendered by a computer - then it's also possible that the world really is made up of just four elements.  Earth, Fire, Water, and Air.  Even if you don't believe that, it still doesn't explain why there's an invisible force that's keeping atoms together, and yet atoms are called 'elements' by the scientists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term 'element' means fundamental.  The base building block of matter.  And it can also include energy (as energy interacts with atoms as well), but for some reason, scientists don't include energy in their periodic table.  If something is to be an element, it has to be observed as the smallest thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just what the heck is fire?  Isn't that simply heat?  Isn't that how car engines work?  Isn't that how the human body works?  It creates heat, loses some of it, but uses the rest.  Heat is fundamental, it exists everywhere.  It even explains why atoms move.  That tells me that heat is more fundamental than atoms, that heat is a true element, unlike the atomic middleman, if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, guys.  It's all just a theory, but so was what Plato did.  In the end, all 'science' is just theory, including evolution.  It wasn't until the 'enlightenment' suddenly happened, that Plato was 'disproven', right?

       The "elements" are just aspects of god. Going up,  atoms make up cells, which make up life and non-life, which make up the earth, which, along with other planets, space objects and space itself make up the universe

       But what tools did God use to make the universe?  Even the greeks, who believed in gods (false, obviously, but nonetheless) realized that they needed tools to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, if you were going to make something as confoundingly complex as a universe, wouldn't you want tools that were simple and reliable?  Air, Earth, Fire and Water.

       we do not know what the building blocks are.
       <br/>
       My idea personally is that everything ( at the smallest level ) what u call the building blocks.
       <br/>
       Is the same thing.
       <br/>
       It empty or what ever u wanne call it.
       <br/>
       Then wen u combine those things that are the same in different configurations / vibration u create different things that also effect those things around em ( they create gravity vibration and so on )
       <br/>
       This then all ends up creating more and more different items trough the effect they have on there surroundings.

       Yes exactly to the first part. Every piece is the completeness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that, the only building block so to speak is that completeness. We only see what we see, and we see separateness where there is none

       would like to echo your 'what is fire' question. because yes it seems that it is not a 'thing' but merely the light and heat byproduct of a process we cannot see and don't comprehend. spitballing a little but i'm reminded of the prometheus stealing fire for humans because, alone, we did not have it/ metaphorically could not
       <em>
        create
       </em>
       . with fire it's clear from comparison that something changes but the light and heat shield it mostly from close examination. to tie this in with what you are saying about platonic solids, i wonder if sacred geometry has something to say about fire/ other elements, maybe that would help pin down its thingness.

       Fire is what happens when a gas gets so hot in turns into the next state of matter, which is called Plasma. Lots of types of matter can turn into Plasma, fire is a type of plasma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma.

       thank you, that makes a lot of sense-- how does gas become plasma? or simply, what is the term for that process so i can research more?
      </p>
      <p>
       there seems to be a lot more variety in behavior of different plasma instances than with solid/ liquid/ gas, would you say that's a fair assessment?

       Theres no discrete point when a gas becomes a plasma.  But the transition is due to heat causing electrons to collectively unbind from their atomic location and freely distribute through space.
      </p>
      <p>
       This creates a highly conductive gaseous material (perhaps a rough definition for "Plasma")
      </p>
      <p>
       One may always associate accelerating electrons with radiation; heat and light.  The greater the acceleration, the more radiation.  There is some law which correlates power output to an electrons acceleration but I forget the name.

       is there a name for the state change process though, akin to for example evaporation?
      </p>
      <p>
       so you're saying plasma is essentially a more efficient vector for energy transference than any of the other matter states? is anything more efficient than plasma?

      <p>
       varied behavior such as, the difference between lightning and fire or something. like solids/ liquids/ gases generally all move pretty similarly to others in their class

       Yea @PISS_PRESIDENT probably used the term for "electrons to collectively unbind from their atomic location"

        Ionization.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I go with plasma having a loose definition because ionization happens discretely over billions of whatever we call electrons.  Heat transfer is a statistically process so there is no guarantee a gas is 100% ionized.
      </p>
      <p>
       They call it another form of matter because at some point, the behavior of the super-heated gas is so much different than it's cooler counterpart; apparently we've just labeled it differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer to your questions are complicated because there is also density to plasma, which highly contributes to overall energy transference.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I suppose one needs to define what they mean by efficient when using that word.  Things have usually 3 ways to transfer energy.  Radiation, convection and conduction.  Density affects them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plasma radiates intensely and convects strongly; probably more so than anything else.  It probably won't conduct faster than solid metal.

       thanks! i really appreciate the subtleties you've defined. if this question makes sense, how does the ionization process initiate? it's clear that it 'catches' quickly onto surrounding matter with the proper energetic potential but is it just a matter of initially breaking the bonds of something volatile? how do we really do this? it seems like a cycle, i.e. there is no fire / ionization without previous fire/ ionization and the energy is just moving location. i suppose that's the law of thermodynamics, huh? :P

       There's so many levels to "how does the ionization process initiate."  There's the scientific explanation from observation and repeated experiment / analysis.  That would be mostly related to the concept of exothermic reactions, ones which release energy, as opposed to endothermic reactions, ones that consume energy.  Burning is the act of a chain reaction of exothermic reactions; you did a great job explaining it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A kind of cycling of sorts.  But there is the "spark," the trigger which is needed to begin unlocking the energy of that which burns.

       There's a famous brilliantly beautiful quote that I'm struggling to remember.   It went something like "Fire is [can be] plant matter's stored solar energy (gathered for many years) being released nearly instantaneously"  I promise it was more wonderful than how I butchered it.  Your comment on thermodynamics made me think of this!

       yes, this spark / trigger is very elusive.. because, if all is energy, the process seems simple-- concentrate enough energy in a particular location to spark an explosive exothermic chain (or, who knows, an endothermic chain along the 'edges'-- same result right?) and yet there's no precise universal process to do this that doesn't tautologically describe itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       another thing that trips me up is electrons jumping valence levels (if that's what they're called... it's been a while since chemistry..), which is, like you said, the molecular aspect of the combustion process and just as GD mysterious.
       <em>
        where
       </em>
       do they
       <em>
        go

       in between??
      </p>
      <p>
       that is fascinating about fire being the release of solar energy, and totally makes sense. also seems to account for all the elements, in a way, they're all just different permutations/ distillations of the sun's energy (assuming they can all burn at some temperature), and energy always behaves in the same way at its core, which is how they're all able to coexist and interact with each other ... hm. thanks for that to chew on!

       Take a read of the classic experiments described in an introductory Chemistry textbook, or Isaac Asimov's "History of Chemistry" (might be wrong on the exact title). 
Sounds like you're trying to understand chemistry/physics thru thought alone without considering evidence/classic experimental results. Lay off the weed and read a science book.

        What is keeping those things together? How are they constantly moving without falling apart? Just, some unseen force?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well there are covalent bonds, VanDer Wall's (anI think some more ones) keeping the molecules together. The weak and strong nuclear forces keep the atoms together. The atoms are made out of weird things like quarks, leptons and bosons, and the weird things are thought to be made out of stings that vibrate in 20 dimensional space.

        scientists don't include energy in their periodic table.

      <p>
       Well they kind of do, the table is ordered by energy level. Each row goes up one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, once you start talking about energy and subatomic particles, you are moving into the realm of physics, not chemistry, so it's kind of an awkward point to discuss without good background knowledge. Like I studied both chemistry and physics as a kid, but I've been told by people who have done postgraduate physics that all the simplified, clear cut differences break down as you look at things closer.

       You can repeat their experiments and see if the results hold true.
