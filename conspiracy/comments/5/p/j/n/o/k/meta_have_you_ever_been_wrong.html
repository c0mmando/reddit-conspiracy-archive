What sometimes happens is that instead of changing a belief to match the evidence,  false evidence is  sought to sustain the belief.<br/>

<p>All those  big cycles of &quot;anti-crime,&quot; propaganda drives when more activities are made illegal, existing crimes are enhanced to felonies, mandatory sentencing and enhanced sentencing are increased and all that right along with privatizing the tax money to a for profit(from the taxes) law and penal system.</p>

<p>For at least 20 years beginning in the 80s, you couldn&#39;t run for office unless you were, &quot;tough on crime.&quot;</p>

<p>The truth is they were busy reducing the pay of the working class and that also meant keeping more people in jail to stop voting booth rebellions and all those untidy things.
After the working class was mostly jailed and replaced by even lower paid illegal immigrant workers   they began on the middle class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believed in Pizzagate fully. Then I went to voat when PG was banned, and every single day numerous people would completely 100% fabricate stories and claim they were true. Then I would see the same people link their own posts or the posts of others who agreed with them as &#39;proof&#39; of newer, faker claims. I saw hundreds of posters here and on voat declare that people need to stop talking about Trump, the election, Trump&#39;s policies, Trump&#39;s cabinets etc. and focus 100% on their fake lies.</p>

<p>I slowly began to realize what a blatantly biased lie pizzagate was, and felt stupid. I was banned forf being a &quot;new shill intent on destroying PG&quot; on voat for pointing this out, my voat account is older than their subverse. </p>
