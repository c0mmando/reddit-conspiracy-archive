       Something bad did happen. The people angry on the right are likely placated for a little bit, the elites that lean right are going to have a field day, the liberals put on etsy hats, rammed their heads even further up their own asses at a soros parade then hit up target and chipotle on the way home driving alone in their hybrid SUVs before going back to their jobs on monday.

       It's not easy to admit, but I have been wrong.  I made a questionable choice when I was a very young woman about my health care, and it almost cost me my life.  I used to be a liberal, but when the Democrats stopped being anti-war, they lost me for good.  It's not an easy thing to admit when I am wrong, but I make efforts to regularly check in with myself and see if I'm being an idiot.

       The Democratic Party was never anti-war. 
That is just one of the many lies the conservatives, who have controlled the national dialog since 1963 have told you.

       I'm wrong quite often.  I try to always admit when I am and thank whatever corrected me.  I feel it is important to take the emotional element out of discussions with the exception of strong spiritual feelings.

       To change, required  a desire to be correct. 
What sometimes happens is that instead of changing a belief to match the evidence,  false evidence is  sought to sustain the belief.
       <br/>
       For example, for some only finding others who agree is enough evidence.

       To change, required a willingness to not know what the outcome will be during the learning curve or willingness to accept the risk that

       I'm wrong all the time. It doesn't usually take much because I don't hold many positions to such high esteem that I can't accept conflicting information.

       If you can build a basic  framework  based on facts,you soon discover that much of what we are told can be understood as meant only for manipulation.  For example
      </p>
      <p>
       All those  big cycles of "anti-crime," propaganda drives when more activities are made illegal, existing crimes are enhanced to felonies, mandatory sentencing and enhanced sentencing are increased and all that right along with privatizing the tax money to a for profit(from the taxes) law and penal system.
      </p>
      <p>
       For at least 20 years beginning in the 80s, you couldn't run for office unless you were, "tough on crime."
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is they were busy reducing the pay of the working class and that also meant keeping more people in jail to stop voting booth rebellions and all those untidy things.
After the working class was mostly jailed and replaced by even lower paid illegal immigrant workers   they began on the middle class.

       I believed in Pizzagate fully. Then I went to voat when PG was banned, and every single day numerous people would completely 100% fabricate stories and claim they were true. Then I would see the same people link their own posts or the posts of others who agreed with them as 'proof' of newer, faker claims. I saw hundreds of posters here and on voat declare that people need to stop talking about Trump, the election, Trump's policies, Trump's cabinets etc. and focus 100% on their fake lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I slowly began to realize what a blatantly biased lie pizzagate was, and felt stupid. I was banned forf being a "new shill intent on destroying PG" on voat for pointing this out, my voat account is older than their subverse.

       That's the problem with these conspiracy sites in general, to find the kernals of truth you need to dig through ton of purposely sensationalist bullshit made only to capitalize on clicks and page views for ad dollars. I still think there is something very shady with the pasta code words but I wouldn't trust anyone that refers to themselves as an "investigator"

       Thanks for the giggle.  I hate admitting I am wrong even as it is a regular occurrence. Since I haven't found a way to avoid being wrong all the time, I decided to at least buy some good wine to help swallow the sometimes necessary crow fest.

       One really easy way to avoid having to admit errors is to not make 'absolute' statements. Of course, I may be wrong about that.

       The group of people saying they're open-minded are kidding themselves because they only see truth based on what was provided to them as truth when going through our censored and mediocre education systems. If they knew truth as it is they wouldn't be on these conspiracy forums.

       Uncertainty is superior to an imaginary based certainty but don't you need some kind of standardized accepted as facts frame to lend some support for the beliefs that we need to function as part of our societies?

       I admit I'm wrong all the time. Only a weak, arrogant person doubles down on being wrong. My favorite quote is "All I know is that I know nothing" for that very reason
