       These are the same people who killed JFK and brought down the towers.  There was a countercoup in the letter agencies, but thats about it.  They control all things why are they seemingly unable to rig elections?

       Ive never heard a politician, and I would bet if you look at all 45 or 44 or whatever presidents inauguration speeches none but trump lambasted the establishment and politicians as liars.  Said there were forgotten americans.  And that we need to focus on our own and take care of our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive never heard anything like that.  Politicians dont talk like that, and haven't.

      <p>
       Im not saying he's what he says he is, or what trump supporters think he is, but when speaking on the government being hijacked by people who dont have our interest in mind, he's absolutely right.  And what politician has ever said this?

       Anti-establishment ideals have been consistently on the rise. So how do they combat that? They get someone willing to be vocally anti-establishment that in the end will play along. His cabinet picks should be more than enough indication of this.

       I personally believe that while they're incredibly influential, they don't have absolute power or even full control.  I also believe there are many groups with different objectives too, not some Simpsons cartoonized masonic cult.

       They're not unable to rig elections, it's been done countless times throughout history. However, they were unable to rig the most recent one to Hillary because WikiLeaks basically destroyed her and it would have been too obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Failing rigging it for Hillary, they got Trump to play the part of the establishment outsider and ride the wave of anti-establishment sentiment among the public. They aren't stupid. Trump was their only way of holding on to power.

       Yeah, I might be too, but I'm not in any connection with the ruling/rich class. DJT is, and adds one more to the number of US presidents descended from King John, as John of Gaunt is the great-great-great-grandson of him.

       It's the military that's made the difference. They are sick and fucking tired of taking the CIA's shit and sending off their guys to die in wars instigated by civilians.

       A LOT of ex- and current military is fully aware of what went down with the 9/11 shit show and they're done with it. They're also a lot more aware of the kid-fucking.

       he's another ringer like Obama was. first they used Obama to catch everyone off guard when the country was sick of government and on the verge or revolt, so they threw in "first black president" to get everyone to think things would be different this time. they're doing the same with Trump, with the media spin that he's an "outsider" and "for the people" ,"anti establishment" blah blah blah. and the elites and media are pretending to freak out about it to get our guard down yet again. but in all reality, its business as usual. it isn't whos in the white house thats the problem, its government itself thats the problem
