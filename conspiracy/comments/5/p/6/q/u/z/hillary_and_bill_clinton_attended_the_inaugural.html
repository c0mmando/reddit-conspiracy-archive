    <div class="md"><p>correct, in my humble opinion.  a russian agent is not the president.</p>

<p>what&#39;s really happening is hillary is vulnerable to usdoj actions.  the clinton&#39;s cannot come empty-handed and ask for mercy.  nor is that their style.  they have to create poker chips to be used in the give-and-take at the table.</p>

<p>so strange to see the residue of these schemes left on the minds of the american public.  yesterday&#39;s women&#39;s march in my city had 10% of the signs saying trump is a russian agent.  and all it is, is the clintons generating poker chips.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really think Trump is a Russian puppet? C&#39;mon man, I refuse to believe anyone that hangs out here is a complete moron.</p>

<p>Israeli pawn? Sure. Rothschild&#39;s baby? Maybe that too. But this whole nonsense about Russia was cooked up so that when that retarded ass &quot;dossier&quot; was dropped people would have a context to believe Trump was entangled with Russia. Furthermore, the obvious, and clumsy imho, objective of TPTB right now is to incite war with Russia.</p>

<p>So, maybe ask yourself why they want to go after Russia so bad?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Becoming President of the US puts you into an exclusive little club in which there are only a few others that have also made the grade and are still alive and kicking. </p>

<p>There is also something called &quot;history&quot; as well as &quot;&#39;history in the making&quot; that applies to each of them far more than it does to anyone else and no one is more aware of that and emphasizing their own individual roles in that still ongoing story as they themselves all are.</p>

<p>Moreover, unless there&#39;s some very serious reasons why they can&#39;t, it&#39;s customary and traditional for those remaining members of the club to attend the inauguration of any new incoming ones as well as the funerals of any former ones.</p>

<p>Like it or not, Trump is obliged to defend and uphold the office of the President as well as all those who&#39;ve sat in it before him whether he personally agrees with what any of them have done in that capacity or not. </p>

<p>Similarly you won&#39;t find any of the others levelling any criticism at Trump that isn&#39;t couched in the most gentle and subtle terms now that he&#39;s a genuine member of that little club himself. They will distance themselves by talking only in terms of policies and policy failures of the current &quot;administration&quot; without levelling any direct blame.</p>

<p>Now Trump has won and it&#39;s his way or the highway. He can afford to be generous and magnanimous in that victory and he doesn&#39;t need any more opposition coming from within the US than he&#39;s already stirred up to have to deal with as he finally gets down to business. </p>

<p>In short he has bigger fish to fry than Bill or Hillary who&#39;ve both fittingly and finally done themselves in far more than anyone else has and although Trump could very well go after them it&#39;s far better to hold that possibility in abeyance in case they give him no other choice but to somewhere down the line or to pressure them to push someone in a certain direction that they may still have more influence over than he himself does.</p>

<p>To be sure it can all be likened to a game that Trump has won on our level and has now advanced to the next where entirely new tactics have to be used against a very different set of challenges, trips and traps that are all ahead of him now and that he has to stay completely focussed on if he&#39;s ever going to get through them. </p>

<p>In the meantime we&#39;re pretty much stuck where we are until he makes some meaningful progress at that level. </p>
