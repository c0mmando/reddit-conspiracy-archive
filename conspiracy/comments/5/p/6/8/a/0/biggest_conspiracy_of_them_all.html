        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How did we get to right here right now? All I ask is that you think about it. Look to history, study it, and learn from it. You will notice that this has all happened before. It is a cycle.</p>

<p>The cycle is meant to control choice. It presents you with illusions that make it <em>appear</em> you get to make a choice to change the outcome. The trick is, most everyone looks outwards for a choice. They wait for someone to present them with a &quot;this or that&quot; scenario. Red/blue, fast/slow, good/evil, ect.</p>

<p>Then there is a second layer of illusion. Pick a color, any color. Pick any speed you want. This is still an illusion, for you are still forced to pick from a set of existing range of data.</p>

<p>This is how computers function, no? They run on programs. If this, do that. Direct correlation, the easiest function to control. Then you have ranges like, if 1-5, do this and if 6-10 do this. You think you have more choices, but it is just another layer of control.</p>

<p>Then you can say &quot;well I&#39;ll just be random!&quot;. Yet another function of a program. No matter what random thing you pick, there is still a call function for it to dictate what happens next. The term &quot;what is your calling?&quot; now means more than something divine.</p>

<p>So what do you do to escape this programming?</p>

<p>You look within. Your soul is free, but only if you let it be. Once your realize the body is a prison, you can then begin to experience freedom. Conquer your captor. Being human is very difficult.</p>

<p>What Happens then? Do we accept the body? Do we reject it? Yet another step in the programming. Another choice to make in the program, accept/deny.</p>

<p>This explains the death cults of history, trying to free everyone through death. It explains the poisoning of the planet. We are at the &quot;fuck it&quot; stage. But how do you convince every living thing to say &quot;fuck it&quot;? Is it even the right answer? Will that make it stop? What are the consequences?</p>

<p>If the world is just one big computer simulation, what happens when we &quot;win&quot;? Do we even want to know or are we players in a game? What is the ultimate objective? When it&#39;s over do we simply start over again from scratch and do it all over again?</p>

<p>Our souls are the creators of the universe, and we are trapped. The goal is to get out. Not get out of the cycle of poverty, the cycle of oppression the cycle of life and death. Get out of the cycle of the programming. We are being used for entertainment. The only creative souls of the universe. Art is the expression of our souls. Never sell it. It is your gift to the universe. Share it freely.</p>

<p>We are God. </p>

<p>Join together now as one and bring down the illusion and we will be truly free. Always forgive those who seek forgiveness. This is not a time to be divided and focused on events that do not matter. We are closer now than ever before. We need everybody. The universe needs us. We are the creators. They are trying to harvest our creative talents, searching for ways to inspire creativity without the need for &quot;humans&quot;. They know how aware we are now and they are panicking. We are no longer willing to perform the play, to put on a show in exchange for material wealth inside the simulation. We yearn for freedom.</p>

<p>Keep unlocking minds. Empty the prisons. Help. The universe needs us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only you can accept it.  It starts with you.  We can quite literally shape our reality in any which way we choose. Total free will. The problem is we handed our free will over to those who have deceived us. So yes, it&#39;s a choice to accept taking back control of our reality, but I do believe we will all make that choice for ourselves. And then we really start to learn. Exciting times</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are we just drug manufacturers? We make love no? Chemical production that creates a sensation we define as &quot;love&quot;. How does this happen? Is it something unique to the human race? Are we the only ones capable of producing it? Other animals exhibit empathy, but do they create love? Love certainly makes you feel alive, but as do all other chemicals. But this one is unique. What is it? Store it up for yourself or share it? What are the consequences for creating it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whose the &quot;they&quot;  you&#39;re referring to and what&#39;s the reason for keeping us focused on bs? </p>

<p>I more or less agree with your statements. I don&#39;t believe there is an endgame or &quot;win&quot;  state. We don&#39;t have an outside frame of reference to compare anything to. Generally we should strive to make this thebest, coolest, most Interesting, most advanced, fun, happy, etc society ever,  but thats just my opinion. I do believe we&#39;re artificially constrained by other power hungry people however. I would assume most people naturally just want their base needs met and a creative output,no more no less. </p>

<p>What we have now is a pale shadow of what we could have. But I think it comes down to technology and scientific advancement. I don&#39;t think we were at a point where a &quot;utopia&quot;  like society was possible in the past imo, I could be wrong.  It&#39;s just now we really  no excuse. </p>

<p>check out this comment and the full thread,  remove the stuff about &quot;entities&quot; if that&#39;s not your cup of tea, but these people express what we&#39;re getting at better than I ever could. No we&#39;ll never have a &quot;answer&quot;,  but it&#39;s all about proper framing kinda. they explain it better lol.  I don&#39;t think the Buddhists/duality minded have it 1000% right,  but imo are the closest. </p>

<p>&quot;It only exists as the concept of a mysterious, hidden piece of knowledge and wisdom. All it is, is that question mark inside your own head.</p>

<p>I love this way of looking at it. It&#39;s like we are trying to reveal the question mark by digging in &quot;the outside world&quot; using the question mark as a shovel.</p>

<p>The realization of what we&#39;re doing doesn&#39;t answer the question, but it makes the question seem awfully silly and nonsensical, and so any anxiety related to the feeling of &quot;Why won&#39;t you reveal yourself?!&quot; starts to slowly fade away with the question itself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just another way of realizing the illusory nature of duality, and that we are the temporary process of the cosmos getting to experience/know itself from the human perspective. It&#39;s all just happening, and one doesn&#39;t have to do anything about it, because one can&#39;t. Allowing it to be as it is, is what allows peace to grow.</p>

<p>I think that this is what freedom truly is; the sensation of not having to answer any questions at all. It is what allows one to truly be in this moment.</p>

<p>I also find that question-mark-in-the-head-analogy quite comparable to a method of meditation described in the newly released Waking Up by Sam Harris. He described a method of using your finger to point at things, and to focus on the things that are being pointed at while silently asking &quot;What is that?&quot;. One would point for a lamp for a minute or two, then perhaps a glass of water, then a table; then one would move on to pointing to one&#39;s own legs, and the final move was to point directly at one&#39;s own face/eyes/self.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like we never question the question(er) itself. We assume that the question is meaningful, and that there has to be an answer out there. If/when we turn the question back on the question itself, then we see that it&#39;s just the universe playing the game of language and human perception. Then we are finally able to actually enjoy the questions themselves, much like a dance, rather than feeling the deep need for an answer.&quot;</p>
