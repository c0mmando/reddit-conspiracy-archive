        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The following is a partial list of a large number of persons who who are presumed to be “Casualties” of the various Clinton scandals. A “Casualty” is defined as anyone threatened with harm or actually harmed because of their knowledge of and/or involvement in one or more of the Clinton Scandals.  President Clinton had promised his political supporters in Arkansas he will devote a lot of time going after detractors who pursued him on Whitewater and other ethical questions. (USA Today, November 8, 1996). It is a partial list because new additions are added regularly as the Clinton’s consider themselves above the law and the full extent of being associated with Bill and Hillary Clinton is not completely known.</p>

<p>The accounting of these mysterious deaths began in 1994 when in a letter to congressional leaders, former Rep. William Dannemeyer listed 24 people with some connection to Clinton who had died “under other than natural circumstances” and called for hearings on the matter. Dannemeyer’s list of “suspicious deaths” was largely taken from one compiled by Linda Thompson, an Indianapolis lawyer, containing the names of 34 people she believed died suspiciously and who had ties to the Clinton family.</p>

<p>Some of the “Casualties” were openly murdered, but many were killed in such a way so that their deaths could be ruled accidents or suicides. This was especially true if they died in Arkansas where the medical examiners routinely ruled apparent murders as either accidents or suicides when it suited political purposes. In fact, this was so common that it was often referred to as “Arkancide” or “Arkansas Suicide”.</p>

<p><strong>“An apparent pattern of violence and intimidation has befallen a number of men and women with ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, their partners in business, law and politics, and people investigating their affairs…”</strong> (The Arizona Republic, June 7, 1994)</p>

<p>There was a rumor that back when bill got busted in some sex stuff one of the times, shill was gonna leave him but had someone from a power group convince her it was in best interest to stay and clean up the mess. </p>

<p>This explains why she covered and attacked his accusers. </p>

<p>trump is a warlock too but like lvl 4 useful idiot who put all his stats into luck and starting gold</p>

<p>now he sold his soul to demigods to maintain his ascent</p>

<p>but demigods only use their puppets as humab sacrifices once they are built up for their fall</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google it, last year FBI found evidence about a Shadow gov, they called themself The 7th floor group. They even name a few people including Hilary C.</p>

<p>After these elections nobody can claim Trump is a dumbass. He played most of his cards right. The whole election was rigged, the media finaly showed their true colors and millions of americans lost trust in them. I think it was pure coincidence Trump won, Hilary got more votes than Obama 2008 (i might be wrong, havent seen the stats) and her PizzaParty expected it will be enough. It is no secret she bought a lot of votes by importing people to vote for her, they played it safe and didnt import enough votes. Trump won by baiting them into insults and false accusations. Oh, dont forget the memes. Trump won a lot of young voters over and i doubt the memes werent the reason. We cant judge about Trump until we get a credible leak (NOT WIKILEAKS) about some fresh conspiracy, or at least until he makes a couple of mistakes. Dont kid yourself, the war is not over. 7th floor group is being investigated, Hilary is being investigated as a spy. They wont back down until Trump is gone because he is a threat to them.</p>

<p>You can call Trump dumb as much as you want but the fact is he won against all odds. Trump fucking won and i blows my mind how he did it. He has my support because he fought the devil himself and survived, for now. This election was a true biblical fight, good vs evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>yah he even killed some kids</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phrasing is no good. Bill is complicit in the crimes at Mena because as governor he facilitated their coverup and he profited from them by funneling some of the proceeds through ADFA. He was neither neither killing kids like Kevin Ives nor leading the drug smuggling operation that did kill them—that was the CIA, of which Bill is a mere pawn, or &quot;asset&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i can&#39;t seem to find his age, but i don&#39;t see what that has to do with an unexplained plane crash</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/08/clinton-death-list-33-most-intriguing-cases/">Dr. Stanley Heard – Sept. 10, 1993</a></p>

<p>Dr. Stanley Heard of Hot Springs, Arkansas, had treated Bill Clinton’s mother, stepfather and brother and served as chairman of Clinton’s National Chiropractic Health Care Advisory Committee. He was killed, along with his attorney, Steve Dickson, of Topeka, Kansas, in a plane crash 50 miles west of Washington.</p>

<p>The plane radioed to Dulles that there was a fire before it crashed. That aircraft was the second one to cause problems for Dickson on the trip.</p>

<p>In 1993, the Washington Post reported, “Dickson flew his own plane from Topeka, but on the way to Washington it developed problems in St. Louis. There, he left his plane for repair and rented another plane.”</p>

<p>The National Transportation and Security Board said the crash was due to ” an inadequate annual inspection of the airplane and non-compliance with airworthiness directives by company maintenance personnel.”</p>

<p>also</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/another-clinton-associate-found-dead-bill-hillarys-body-count-increases/">Stanley Heard</a>, Chairman, National Chiropractic Health Care Advisory Committee and Steve Dickson, – Counsel to Mr. Heard-died: 9/10/93 Both died in a plane crash outside Dulles airport, after their aircraft, rented after Heard’s personal craft developed troubles, crashed while attempting an emergency landing after reporting a fire on board. Let’s repeat that. They took off in a plane. It developed problems. They got it back to the airport. They rented a new plane. They took off in the new rented plane and IT developed a problem. On the way back to the airport it crashed. – Heard, in addition to serving on Clinton’s advisory council, also personally treated Clinton’s mother, stepfather, and brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had read elsewhere he had died of old age. I stand corrected on that. Still though, what possible point is there to assassinating his mom&#39;s chiropractor? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Given he flew his plane, had problems, landed and rented another plane, then had the same problem, that&#39;s a problem with some plane part. Even if a crash was arranged for his own, original plane, there&#39;s no conceivable way to immediately &quot;try again, we&#39;ll get him <em>this</em> time&quot; with another plane unexpectedly rented on the way.</p>

<p>Just because someone vaguely knew Clinton (maybe, I mean, I can&#39;t say my son knows my chiro), it doesn&#39;t make their death a part of any &quot;body count.&quot;</p>
