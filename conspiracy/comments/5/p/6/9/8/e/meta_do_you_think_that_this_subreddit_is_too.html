    <div class="md"><p>Certainly. Look at the media for example. And the pharma industry. There are A LOT of rich, powerful, and influential Zionist Jews. A disproportionate amount. I&#39;m not being racist and saying that their being Jewish is wrong, but historically, Zionist Jews are known manipulators and have an agenda that is detrimental to the normal population. George soros is a Hungarian Zionist jew if I&#39;m not mistaken. Do some research. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It did have rules for persecuting non-Jews who were committing capital offenses, but that was in the Old Testament.   And that was only for the Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think these are all valid and good questions.  Some of which are hard to answer simply.  </p>

<p>From what I understand though the stonings and such were commanded in the OT for capital offenses (like the death penalty today).  Same goes for the massacres of entire cities.  </p>

<p>When Christ arrives on the scene however, the OT laws aren&#39;t abrogated, but fulfilled.  </p>

<p>Fulfilled in a most unusual way.  </p>

<p>Instead of the individual transgressors paying the ultimate penalty for their having transgressed God&#39;s law, Jesus willingly took the death penalty on himself, receiving in his own self the penalty on our behalf, though he himself had done nothing to transgress the law.</p>

<p>From a Christian perspective, the Old Testament paved the way for the New.</p>

<p>The OT law though has historically been divided into three categories ~ civil law, ceremonial law, and moral law.  </p>

<p>Civil law governed ancient Israel while it was a theocracy. </p>

<p>Ceremonial law dealt with how people should interact with and worship God, and pointed to Christ (typology is fulfilled in Christ). While these were initially applicable to ancient Israel, some of them also crossed over into the Church after the time of Christ.</p>

<p>The moral law (ie - Ten Commandments) pertain to the immutable character of God. All people in all times and places are obligation to follow them since they reflect God’s character and represent best design for human flourishing and salvation.  No civil society really functions, wittingly or unwittingly, without them.  To the extent that a society jettisons these, that society become barbaric. Far from being abolished, Jesus clarified and strengthened the basis of the moral law in the NT beatitudes, in addition to fulfilling it himself.</p>

<p>There are prohibitions against homosexuality in the New Testament.</p>

<p>Some Jews DO accept and have accepted Jesus as the Messiah who was prophecied about in the OT.  In fact most of the first early Christians were Jews.   Today, many Jewish Christians like to call themselves &#39;completed Jews&#39; insofar as they believe that they have finally reconciled the mysteries of OT prophecy and Scripture in the person of Christ in their lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, that is a very concise, well thought out answer.  I am not a Christian, though, but I can tell you have studied these issues extensively.  Do you meditate?  </p>

<p><em>I think these are all valid and good questions. Some of which are hard to answer simply.</em>  Yes, I agree.  If they were easy to answer, there would be a lot less conflict.    </p>

<p><em>From what I understand though the stonings and such were commanded in the OT for capital offenses (like the death penalty today). Same goes for the massacres of entire cities.</em>  Yes, I do recall reading that.  I have always wondered why god does not take the life of the guilty.  Why is it left to humans to do it instead?  After all, god will not make a mistake in carrying this out.  </p>

<p><em>When Christ arrives on the scene however, the OT laws aren&#39;t abrogated, but fulfilled.</em>  I have heard this before.  </p>

<p><em>Instead of the individual transgressors paying the ultimate penalty for their having transgressed God&#39;s law, Jesus willingly took the death penalty on himself, receiving in his own self the penalty on our behalf, though he himself had done nothing to transgress the law.</em>  Yes...  </p>

<p><em>From a Christian perspective, the Old Testament paved the way for the New.</em>  Yes, from a Christian perspective.  </p>

<p><em>The OT law though has historically been divided into three categories ~ civil law, ceremonial law, and moral law.  Civil law governed ancient Israel while it was a theocracy.</em>  Where does the Talmud come into play?  Have you read it?  If so, what are your thoughts?</p>

<p><em>The moral law (ie - Ten Commandments) pertain to the immutable character of God.

Have you read much about pre-Christian history, like Confucius?  I would hardly call their society barbaric.  </p>

<p><em>There are prohibitions against homosexuality in the New Testament.</em>  Yes, read about it after I posted.  There are a lot of prohibitions in the New Testament that people ignore.  Do you believe that Lot is a righteous man?  </p>

<p><em>Some Jews DO accept and have accepted Jesus as the Messiah who was prophecied about in the OT. In fact most of the first early Christians were Jews.

    <div class="md"><p>Hi again! You are asking a lot of questions (all good ones!).  But again, some of these are &#39;questions of the ages&#39; and I&#39;m not sure how adequately one can address them in reddit! :)  That said, I will do my level best.</p>

<p>I do meditate -- but in the Christian fashion (fill the mind with Christ) rather than the eastern fashion (so-called emptying of the mind).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it left to humans to do it instead?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this also may be a thread of the larger question &#39;why did God make humans in the first place?&#39;  The answer, as far as I can tell, has to do with the role and extent to which God desires to have people co-operate and participate in redemptive work on earth.  In a sense, it shows God giving a long leash (free will) and hope and trust that humankind will do the right thing, participating on earth as it is in heaven.   </p>

<p>I think the question  -- why is it left for humans to do -- also has to do with &#39;why does God allow evil in the first place&#39;?  The closest insight I can get on that (why doesn&#39;t God just wipe out evil automatically?) is found in Matthew 13:24: a farmer planting seeds in the earth.  Next to the good plants grow horrible weeds (tares), so extensively planted next to the wheat that they threaten the crop. The farmer&#39;s staff asks him if he wants them to go get rid of the weeds.  And the farmer replies: ‘No; for in gathering the weeds you would uproot the wheat along with them.&#39;  So in some mysterious way (from a human perspective, I&#39;m sure it makes perfect sense from the divine) to uproot evil immediately would threaten everyone.  This may have to do with the fact that each one of us has one evil at some point, and so if God &#39;got rid of evil&#39;, we would all be wiped out.  Instead, God is merciful, and wants each of us to repent and be saved.</p>

<p>You asked next about the Talmud.  I have not read it in its entirety, only portions, and believe it to be one of the wickedest, if not the most wicked, books in existence.  The Talmud is a written compilation of the oral rabbinical &#39;interpretations&#39; of Torah (or OT in general)&#39;, however since these rabbis and their interpretations of scripture ultimate rejected the Christ, the interpretations subsequently become more perverse, pointing further and further away from truth.  In other words, Judaism (in terms of the OT religion) is not the same as talmudism.  They are not the same religion. And Talmudism is anathema from a Christian perspective.</p>

<p>Our Lord spoke to those who would reject him even at the time he was on earth: &quot;I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars...&quot; Revelation 3:9.</p>

<p>To answer your question, Jews who follow Jesus emphatically <em>do not</em> follow the Talmud.  See Brother Nathanel Kapner (online) for more on this topic.  He is a former Orthodox Jew, now Orthodox Christian. His style is a bit brusque, but his message regarding the talmud is exactly as I am telling you here.  Again, the talmud is <em>anathema</em> from a Christian perspective.</p>

<p>&lt;the Ten Commandments are in the OT, which has been fulfilled</p>

<p>The Ten Commandments have been <em>fulfilled in Christ</em>, however they have not yet been perfectly fulfilled in <em>us</em> (this gets back to the content at the beginning of my post).  God wants us to become imitators of Christ, Christlike, and to fulfill the commandments by the power of Christ in us in our lives.  Because they reveal the character of God, the need for them is never abrogated.  </p>

<p>With regard to the pre-Christian history. I have not read that much on Confucius, but he did promote virtue ethics (a good thing), which would have largely lined up with Ten Commandments.  From what I know, he essentially taught &#39;natural law&#39; which ends up being pretty much the non-codified version of the Big 10.  He also was a proponent of the Silver Rule (negative version of Golden Rule).  The Ten Commandments were given to Moses a looong time ago, well before the time of Christ and so they themselves are &#39;pre-Christian&#39; from an historical perspective.</p>

<p>The Scriptures say Lot was credited as being a righteous man.  This too is a rather &#39;large&#39; question, and I&#39;ve probably said enough for one post.  I do not see the Scriptures as saying he was without sin, and he certainly did things which from a certain vantage point raise eyebrows. But again, that&#39;s probably to much to go into here and I&#39;ve rambled on for quite enough time now.   </p>

<p>Hope this was in some way useful?  And blessings.</p>
