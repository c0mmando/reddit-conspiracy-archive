    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty much how I&#39;ve felt ever since getting into conspiracy theories. However, I remember when I still had the wool pulled over my eyes and I thought one of my friends was crazy for challenging the gov&#39;t when we were building up for the invasion of Iraq. I always keep that in mind when trying to understand many people&#39;s cognitive dissonance. The good news is that people are waking up at an astonishing rate, and it feels as if we&#39;re nearing a tipping point. Keep being patient and vigilant, and more people will come around when they&#39;re ready for it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Politics has a really strong liberal bias, Conspiracy now has a strong Trump bias, and Altright is just terrible. People compare this sub to altright because of the influx of Trump supporters and the amount of coverage the leaked emails got here. It&#39;s a lazy comparison in my opinion. Unfortunately though, this sub isn&#39;t even hiding it&#39;s political leaning anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As soon as Trump was the nominee, this sub was flooded with racists, bigots, and trump shills posting how Trump was some how the next savior of humanity and there is no way a rich ass hole who spent his entire life looking out for number one and stepping on the little guy on his way to the top could be bad for America.  </p>

<p>Now they&#39;ve largely disappeared and we are back to normal discourse in which if I say I don&#39;t like trump, six people don&#39;t jump in with hyperbole and ad hominem attacks.  With any luck we are going to start getting back to the point where it was.  When we can have disagreements without people being assholes to each other.  It was so bad I left for a few months. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason a lot of Trump supporters are here is the Trump candidacy exposed many people to the NWO/globalists take over. Until this election a lot of people thought it was Republicans vs Democrats, they found out that they are all the same.</p>

<p>Trump also was very vocal about Obamas shaky bio. Let&#39;s get real there are some holes and the fact the president of the United States has some less than transparent beginnings is a conspiracy. </p>

<p>In one of the first debates Trump points out that the twin towers came down on Bushs watch. He didn&#39;t protect us as they claim which again the government stand down on 9/11 is considered a conspiracy. </p>

<p>For months there has been speculation that Hillary was sick. Her campaign and MSM downplayed and called it a crazy conspiracy theory. Then she loses control of her legs and gets chunked into a van. </p>

<p>Every conspiracy theorist knows about the Clinton Body County. This summer DNC emails get leaked and a DNC staffer is murdered in strange circumstances again another conspiracy. </p>

<p>This was the election of the conspiracy theory that is why Trump supporters are here. </p>
