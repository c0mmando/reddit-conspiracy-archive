        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So today should be a revealing day of what the real Trump presidency will be looking like. As many of you know, Trump has been deciding on who to appoint as the chairman of the FCC, and he has now made a pick. Arguably the most anti net neutrality member of the FCC, Ajit Pai, has now been selected as the next chairman of the FCC. What does that mean? Well he plans on taking down all net neutrality policies we&#39;ve set in place to allow Internet Providers to have their way with our privacy, giving them the ability to censor what we see and watch, and being able to monitor what we are using their internet for.</p>

<p>If this wasn&#39;t enough, Trump is now pushing forward with new executive actions to allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to continue its building, halting the progress that was made from months of protests in North Dakota. He will also be signing an executive action to allow the Keystone XL pipeline to continue its building across the country in an effort for us to hoard more unnecessary oil that we do not need. His reasoning behind these plans are apparently (in his own words) because environmentalism has become &quot;out of control&quot;, and plans to stop their out of control waves. </p>

<p>It looks like his strategy was good, first order is sign executive orders for a popular stance that many agreed should be scrapped (TPP), but now begins the attack on our privacy and the country&#39;s well being. What more is to come from him? What other regressive policies is he going to be signing executive orders over? I was also under the assumption trump didn&#39;t believe executive orders were the right actions to use... yet here we stand today. Seems fishy how he&#39;s changing the more he gets settled, looks like his advising team is really solidifying the establishment in his presidency!</p>

<p>Disappointing excerpt about Ajit Pai:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chief among Paiâ€™s targets will be the net neutrality online traffic rules the FCC adopted on a partisan 3-2 vote in 2015. The regulations are designed to ensure the free flow of online data by barring Internet service providers from discriminating against legal content flowing through their networks. </p>

<p>EDIT1: New information has come out about Canadian oil pipeline has spilled over 200,000 liters of crude oil onto aboriginal lands. Sad to hear indeed and another reason these oil pipelines are inefficient and dangerous for the lands they can spill on. Think of the possibility of the BP oil spill but on land near farms and rural areas that could devastate small populations in the regions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a tiny piece. And maybe think about it like this. The moment he gives America more power to employ, that&#39;s the moment that more of his followers love him 2x what they did before. You&#39;re just being duped. He&#39;s buying people like you off for a penny when you&#39;re worth a great deal more. Think about it for a while.</p>

<p>Remember in Braveheart when the Scottish upper class were being bought off by Longshanks? All he had to do was give them some land and gold, and then they were in his pocket. Trump is paying less for your support.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that killing the TPP is bad. But it&#39;s a part of a much larger plan that is transparent if you know how to play that kind of game.</p>

<p>The congressmen flat out said they want to ditch title two, but pass laws protecting neutrality of traffic. The two aren&#39;t mutually exclusive. They just don&#39;t want to deal with all the regulations surrounding treating the internet like a utility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like they&#39;re trying to cover themselves for what he has actually pushed for, which I linked in the post. I don&#39;t mind that they want to reduce the regulations, but them pushing for more power for internet providers is what is worrying. Regarding the pipeline, yes you&#39;re right 200,000 liters is not significant like other spills we&#39;ve had, but they still occur too common, and we really don&#39;t need these pipelines. We haven&#39;t needed them for decades and we still don&#39;t now. Without them gas prices have been steady and low for years, it&#39;s time to push for better energy policies than just continuing to be oil barons like the bush&#39;s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The internet is already censored to some extent, not by the service providers but by what data company&#39;s like google and facebook decide to send back to the service providers. The winds of change are blowing for the web and have been for a while now. last year being online had more of a feeling of how I imagine people out west felt back in the day when the open, raw, and free lands were as they watched it all slowly get fenced in, roped off and dotted with towns, city&#39;s and roads. It is already a far cry from where it was in the 90&#39;s. </p>

<p>It is ironic to me because what little freedom you still have online was a big help in getting him elected. How many votes would he have lost if there wasn&#39;t a medium separate from main stream media? A place you can go to click and watch the full speeches without the added commentary of talking heads telling you what you should think about it. How many people went to that medium to hear what he had to say and because of it then went out to vote last November? Who will win the next election if that medium gets removed?</p>
