        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump is a rich man and all his appointees are rich men. This is obvious that we are watching the first real American plutocracy forming. Everyone is panicked that Trump is going to destroy America. I personally didn&#39;t support any candidate I just watch it all happen. Obama was a corporate puppet just like every president since Regan. The major corporations control political parties with funding and lobbyists control a lot of congress. This is pretty common knowledge to most people who watch politics. We all know that the major News media is owned by the corporations. Nearly all News Media is in the hands of 6 corporations. They control America by controlling the news and focusing the attention and setting the agenda. These News Media stations have for the most part hidden the things that the establishment in government has been doing. They never talk about NDAA 12-16, they never talked about TPP, etc. They would do fluff pieces that make it appear to look as if they are being critical of the government but they avoid any serious reporting on the hidden laws being passed and the constant drone bombings, etc.</p>

<p>It has only been a small amount of time but Already the Corporate News Media stations are attacking Trump acting like they never attacked Obama. They are acting like we would want them to if a bad president was in office but Obama did much worse and his stories were never covered.</p>

<p>Now Today Trump has pulled America out of the Trans Pacific Partnership which is something Obama worked really hard to try to get passed through during his Time in office. The bill is so corrupt that they tried to keep what it said secret from the public while Corporate lobbyists wrote it to their liking. It allowed the MultiNational Corporations to have legal authority over countries governments and allowed them to sue the governments to recoup imagined losses that might have occurred. This would have let them take over countries and sue them into submission without the countries being able to do anything. Stopping the TPP is a huge win for America and the rest of the countries involved. The evil Trump just did a great thing for America. I&#39;m also reading rumored reports now that Trump is considering dropping the federal reserve and going to a silver or gold standard currency. This is literally throwing off chains that have been on this country for over a hundred years. Every president since the Federal reserve was created hasn&#39;t even hinted at getting rid of the shackles that is the federal reserve. If you aren&#39;t familiar with the federal reserve just google it really quick.</p>

<p>Trump just undid something the Corporations have been trying to get through for a while now. If the rumors of the Federal reserve are true then he is completely changing who is in control of the government and getting rid of the shadow puppet masters that have been messing with this country for a very long time.</p>

<p>If he gets rid of the federal reserve then it almost appears that we are watching two plutocracies battle over for control of the American government and that would explain why the corporate news which never covered NDAA&#39;s or the drone bombings or any of the stuff Obama did is now attacking Trump. The News Media is owned by the shadow organization that was in control who used the media to hide their actions and is now using it to attack Trump. George Sorros was just discovered to have funded the Woman&#39;s March Against Trump.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true. I have no evidence but it&#39;s fun to think that there are two wealth groups of men fighting each other in secret for control of the country while the rest of America is completely unaware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to be annoying and picky because I agree with you in spirit however technically, some of your points are incorrect and don&#39;t quite hit the nail on the head. Blaming corporations for evil as such is a tough sell because they are somewhat empty of intent. Corporations exist for whatever purpose they are created. More of the evil comes from things like being listed on the stock market, operating for the sole purpose of profit and of course too much contact with the state. The CIA has deeply infected the MSM for example with people like Anderson Cooper who is a direct asset. Many of the bigger corporations are perhaps evil but most are not, they might be soulless but being a corporation does not make one evil in of itself. The TPP is way of concentrating power <em>under the guise</em> of corporate interest. Corporations can actually do good things in the world, which may not justify their existence entirely but may be that expecting more from them is a simple step toward reform of the system. It&#39;s an important caveat because I want to suggest that nuking the world&#39;s economy is just one of many possibilities. </p>

<p>Aristocrats are classist assholes who feel they are superior due to their <em>heritage</em>. Corporations cut across class and it sounds a little odd to link them with the aristocracy as such. It&#39;s much more about various mafias and cabals - criminal organizations. Perhaps aristocracies are back there pulling strings but if anything Trump represents a different cabal from the one that has been operating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The key is what will Trump do when the economic/monetary calamity arrives. </p>

<p>If he defaults on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odious_debt">odious</a> US public debt, confiscates foreign gold at the NY Fed (as a fee for services rendered), dissolves the Federal Reserve System, institutes a gold-backed dollar 2.0 (with a preferential exchange rate for Americans and fuck the Chinese), he&#39;s a real nationalist/populist. </p>

<p>This would plunge the world into a short-lived depression, but America would be thus leading the 21st century, and the NWO would be gone.</p>

<p>If he signs the US into a new, improved, benevolent, multipolar (global) money system (Bretton Woods 2.0), he&#39;s a sell-out globalist. </p>

<p>If so, question remains how many will believe him when he&#39;ll say &quot;I negotiated a great deal&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think that Big Oil and Big Coal are allies when it comes to selling their product into the power companies?  No.  They are fundamentally at odds because they are selling completely different products and anyone buying one has no need for the other.  Yet, when it comes to lobbying for the EPA to be neutered and regulations to be lifted, they are aligned for a time.</p>

<p>The same can be said of all of our corporate monoliths, from the banking industry to pharmaceuticals.  If they sell a competing product, they are enemies for profit reasons.  But if they can band together in the short term to guarantee higher profits in the long term, they often times will do so.  Where this falls apart, though, is with large corporations versus small corporations, big business versus small business or often in old money versus new money.  And that&#39;s why we get this appearance that something like the TPP and the other trade treaties were heavily supported by Politician A but not Politician B, even when both are funded by Corporations.  </p>

<p>Big Pharma, Big Oil, etc. don&#39;t actually want the gov&#39;t to deregulate their industries.  They want them to deregulate the top end of those industries.  They want them to deregulate the &quot;good guys&quot;, ie. themselves.  But they want their competitors, foreign and domestic, to be regulated.  They want permitting to be required because permit cost keeps small businesses out of the market, but allows large businesses to easily stay in the market.  The same goes for trade partnerships.  If the trade partnership is structured to charge percentage based tariffs, especially those that would increase with increased trade, it hurts large volume business but helps small volume business compete.  That means it&#39;s absolutely poisonous to large corporations.  If a trade partnership is brokered with a country that has a lower threshold to enter the market, it hurts large corporations.  So, of course it&#39;s a &quot;<strong>horrible partnership</strong>&quot; to a large corporation.</p>

<p>And all of that is not even touching on the fact that the TPP was heavily supported by corporations that are in constant litigation over their products, such as the Tobacco industry, because the TPP was going to force the foreign legal systems to accept American legal statutes for American based companies...the same American based companies that are actually Irish based companies for Tax benefits...the same Irish based companies that are actually Bahamian based companies for asset liquidity reasons...ad infinitum.  These are multi-national corporations fighting solely for the most profit by bribing or threatening our judicial, legislative, and executive branches.  Some of them see TPP as a help, some a hinderance.  </p>

<p>So too do &quot;the rich&quot;, by which I actually assume you meant &quot;the powerful&quot;.  The Soros&#39;s, Murdoch&#39;s, and Adelson&#39;s of the world are not all on the same page anymore so than the Phillip-Morris&#39;s, BP&#39;s, and Goldman-Sach&#39;s of the world.  They do want power to remain in the hands of the powerful and wealth in the hands of the wealthy.  But they have different ideas of how to use that power and who should be considered wealthy.  So you see one funding &quot;conservative&quot; values and supporting &quot;conservative&quot; rhetoric, while another funds &quot;liberal&quot; values and &quot;liberal&quot; rhetoric.  In reality, even if they are at odds, they do agree on one thing: a divided populace is an ignorant one.  So when we neatly divide along these party lines, or racial, or gender, or any number of other reasons, we are ignoring the actual power plays which lead ever more firmly into a world where we are slaves to these and other wealthy, powerful individuals.  </p>

<p>Is there any other reason why those same individuals, and those same corporations, constantly complain about tighter regulations hurting their expansion, hurting their profits, etc., and yet we are seeing wealth and power concentrated ever more tightly in a smaller and smaller percentage of individuals?  If regulation is that detrimental to them, then they would be busy losing money, not making it ever more easily.  <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/11-28-11pov_rev7-29-16-f3.png">In half a century, in fact, we&#39;ve seen a fairly steady rise in wealth concentration in the top echelons of power in America.</a>  Likewise, in the last 20+ years we&#39;ve seen <a href="http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/4bbcaeb47f8b9a812b5a0100/wealth-and-inequality.gif">corporate executive incomes and corporate profit far outpace production worker incomes</a> even under cries of &quot;regulation hurting profits&quot;.  It&#39;s a con, a ploy, and they have used it for over a century in America to strong arm politicians and justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI, it&#39;s the same here in Europe. The biggest news sites have their first 8 or more articles filled with Trump hate. And it continues on. If you look at pages like welt.de, faz.net and spiegel.de, few of the biggest news sites here in Germany, they are filled with anti Trump articles. Just looking at welt.de you might think you live in the US because you have to scroll way down to find actual national news.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this is just CNN trying to make it look real. I think that there are two extremely powerful forces fighting each other right now. The Woman&#39;s march clearly had some help getting off the ground. I&#39;m supposed to believe that one woman in like Hawaii just suggested it and then just a little while later that sort of protest happened?</p>

<p>It is probably going to get worse as the days go by.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What was the goal of TTIP, TPP, and TISA? </p>

<p>To exclude China and Russia from a western common market. They&#39;d gained entry to WTO and began filing motions to their advantage at WTO rounds. So the US tried to negotiate treaty packs with as many nations as possible to exclude Russia and China from a new common market. </p>

<p>Much of TTIP, TPP, and TISA had to do with enforcing IP rights for media and pharmaceuticals. Also, imports. And a new secret legal process for resolving international corporate and national governing disputes.</p>

<p>Look at who Trump appointed to his cabinet. Oil and Finance. Who has he turned his back to? Media, technology, and pharmaceuticals. </p>

<p>There&#39;s your oligarchical rift. In this election, oil and finance won. Companies dependent on IP rights lost.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the part regarding the TPP that I&#39;ve wondered about.  While I agree that most of the deals and shenanigans aren&#39;t great for the people; how would a company gain more power than a country/government?  As you stated it would allow companies to sue them into submission.   </p>

<p>In what courts would the lawsuit take place? I am sure a judge in another country could be bought off to rule in their favor, but what exactly would force compliance?  </p>

<p>I mean the TTP was meant to be a big deal with Asian countries and unless we manufacture some new bullshit and decide to invade, what guarantees these other countries live up to their end?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand. I read a article about it rather than the actual legislation. It established laws that allowed the corporations to sue governments and their cities to repay them for the money that the corporations lost from potential business deals. Imaginary deals that didn&#39;t actually exist but could have existed the TPP made the government responsible for paying it.</p>

<p>It created a legal framework with laws that gave multinational corporations the ability to sue the governments in ways that would force the governments to change to appease the corporations.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I think I remember at least. I&#39;ve been up for three days and I&#39;m having trouble thinking .</p>

<p>Right, but let&#39;s say they chose to sue Rome. And it went before a court locally there and it was ruled in favor of the corporations. </p>

<p>A) who is responsible for enforcing the ruling?</p>

<p>Does Italy send in a military? Does the US government? Or would the corporation have to hire private militia?</p>
