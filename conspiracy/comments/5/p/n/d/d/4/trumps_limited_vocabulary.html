       President Trump does not have a small vocabulary, during his campaign he chose to use simple language inorder to make his message better appeal to under-educated Americans.

       i think that was a play/joke on his campaign call of "you're going to have so much winning you'll say please mr. president we can't take anymore". Something along those lines. The code was the talk about the "columns" built in the room they were in.

       dude he won the presidency. there was a plan all along, look at his cabinet. He is surrounding himself with military for a reason, it was essentially a soft coup. Information would have been dumped had hillary been successfully in brainwashing the country and winning with help of the media.

       no, i agree, hes got some moves, but i just haven't ever seen any evidence of him being able to speak above a jr. high school level.  obviously he won the presidency, he's no dummy, and that's my point: why does he speak like he is a dummy?  you can say he does it on purpose because he is talking down to his audience but why talk soooo far doooown if you are actually capable of speaking like an adult? im sorry, it just doesn't make sense to me.

       well like i pretty much said, i think he's boiling it down to simplicity and that's pretty much it. People are able to perceive him talking to them as if he was a normal guy at the bar - the complete oppositive of obama and hillary projecting their fake commentator voice and and speaking with an agenda.

       yes, and to be honest i like that, but i just think he takes it too far if it is in fact intentional.  I cant stand that fake as bullshit from the other side (either). :)

       he is very sneaky at it. another example of his proress is when he was talking about his chuck shumer and his cabinet appointess taking a long time at the little speech before the inauguration. He brought up a private talk with schumer, in public with schumer in the room, and joked about his cabinet appointment taking so long. Essentially putting schumer in the spot light and putting pressure on him while doing a seeming less and simple worded joke. 8 Dimensional chess is happening right now .

       subreddit, you sure are combative of the actual theories going on around. shadow government has been known to be referred to as the 5th column of government.

       Was there any meaning to the 30-35-39 thing? I didn't know about the 5th column thing, but I felt like he was speaking in code a bit... interesting.

       i'd have to watch again and research, i'm not sure on that one. But the column one is definitely a thing floating out there. Wouldn't put it past him though, he was literally talking to all of the intelligence agents. I think most have a fundamental knowledge of what's really going on behind the scenes and he's there to reassure he's with them (the good ones, not the shadow faction working with Brennon - obama appointed and the group that is in constant contact with the old presidential team.

       Yeah the 5th column thing is really interesting... I hadn't heard it before... he said he was feeling like a young man... aged like 30... 35... 39 which also struck me as odd.

       I just did a quick random search and the first option was a calculator - 30-35-39 = -44 (president obama is the 44th president. Not sure if its coincidence or anything to do with what your saying. Again, I'll have to go back and listen to him say it in context.

       If you have ever taken a speaking class, they do emphasize that your word choices should be adjusted for the topic and the audience.  Sometimes a person's need to sound intelligent works against him and he uses the wrong words for the job.

       if you follow his whole campaign too, you'll notice he refined and worked on the things he said, even with simple vocab. he almost honed what he was saying like a stand up comedian - keeping things that engaged the crowd successfully, tossing out stuff that didn't get attention.
