    <div class="md"><p>Hey there. I have been doing this all day. It has taken up my entire day. Therefore if I cannot present enough on one subject to get people to come forward and get involved, so be it. 90 percent Trump posts do not really help us understand reality, and how to change it if possible.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... most people ignore the Trump topics too... Write up a big post with your opinion on the overall &quot;story&quot; the various videos are portraying... write it from your perspective... emphasis what you like or find interesting...  ask questions about parts you don&#39;t understand or want to know more about... then sprinkle the youtube videos or websites into the post as reference material. People come here to engage in a conversation about a topic... not to blindly click youtube videos. You will have a much better time if you play that way...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simulation theory has been around much longer than Elon Musk. He&#39;s just one of the first &quot;mega rich&quot; people to talk about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve thought about it a lot, and believe we absolutely are in a simulation, however, at the end of the day, it doesn&#39;t matter at all.</p>

<p>What if someone told you you were absolutely living in a simulation? What would you change? Nothing, you would say you would change something, but you wouldn&#39;t. It doesn&#39;t change anything for you whether you think it does or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. I disagree. The &quot;Laws Of Physics&quot; are merely Computer Code. Matter does not exist. Understanding this brings forth the theory that it is all merely &quot;thought&quot;.  Thought can shape and change reality. So yes.. It can definitely change things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so, name some things that you&#39;ve changed because of it? I&#39;ve focused on things and made them happen, things that I&#39;ve really wanted, and they&#39;ve all come true. So what? I would&#39;ve really wanted them anyway, I just focused on them more and realized that I was focusing on them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to &quot;think&quot; millions of dollars into your bank account, the code is designed to give you things that you want, but not things that are completely absurd to obtain without any work. </p>

<p>Not to mention, when you know all of the game&#39;s rules, it gets stale. </p>

<p>Also you&#39;re thinking way too far into it, you think you&#39;re uncovering something groundbreaking, but instead you&#39;re just realizing that something exists that you didn&#39;t consciously know about in the past, you&#39;ve subconsciously always known, now you consciously known, and you won&#39;t change anything  because of it because you&#39;ve always known.</p>

<p>You&#39;re wasting brainpower, I went down this road years ago, then came to the realization that I wasn&#39;t learning anything new and it was just a waste of time. </p>

<p>Live life and be happy, it&#39;s still the motto of life, simulation or not, whether you consciously know that your thoughts manipulate the world around you or not, it makes absolutely no difference and is a waste of brainpower, I wasted many days/weeks/months researching this when I could&#39;ve been doing something productive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the idea of these Archon people has been around for ages. </p>

<p>Yet, there&#39;s happy people everywhere, the world is happier, healthier, more fed, has more access to clean waters, more wealthy, etc, than any time in history. </p>

<p>I used to think like you when I was constantly depressed, so I understand where you&#39;re coming from. I used to look up all the bullshit about the archons, chimeras, saturn, orion, etc just because I felt like SOMETHING was holding me down, but then I got happier and realized that maybe this life is just what you make it, and blaming others is just a mechanism to cope with extreme sadness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unfortunate that you&#39;re stuck in that hole. I was stuck there many years ago.</p>

<p>Hope you find your way out, I enjoy life, I enjoy being able to socialize, love, touch, feel, see, hear, fuck, watch people do stupid things across the world through the beauty of the internet, live vicariously through video game characters and live many adventurous lives, I love eating pizza and partying with friends every once and a while.</p>

<p>Your &quot;ideal&quot; reality is here, you say you&#39;ve found out that you can manipulate your reality with your thoughts, yet here you are manipulating it for the worse, no? </p>

<p>This reality is created for you, yet you make excuses to say it&#39;s not, which makes your reality dark and depressed. Use your supposed knowledge of the simulation to get yourself out of the rut, not to dig yourself deeper.</p>

I am not sure about everyone, but david Icke basically puts everything he makes back into his work. He is a pretty old guy and tirelessly does 10 hours lectures around the world. In actuality he is doing it for for almost nothing. He lives in a small apartmant and drives a used car. Still, he constantly does 10 hour lectures and wakes people up around the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. I disagree. The &quot;Laws Of Physics&quot; are merely Computer Code. Matter does not exist. Understanding this brings forth the theory that it is all merely &quot;thought&quot;.  Thought can shape and change reality. So yes.. It can definitely change things.</p>
