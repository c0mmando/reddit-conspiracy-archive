       Let this be a lesson.  If something sounds too ridiculous and partisan to be true, it is.  I know there were 100's of you on here that said he was the anti christ, he was going to take our guns, he was a secret Muslim, he was going to put us in FEMA camps, and tons of other batshit crazy things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we're not in term 3 of Obama, I'm going to assume we're out of the woods as far as our guns and FEMA camps go.

       It's not like he didn't try his hardest to regulate guns. He was born a muslim, so he's a muslim. Hundreds of fema detention camps were established to house illegal immigrant families...so if you were one of those, he did lock you up in fema camps. American presidents only get 2 terms.

       And here you can see how they always backpeddle until they're kind of right and then they say they were right all along.  Moving the goalposts like this is always their first defense.  They can't just admit they were wrong right away, it takes time.

       Is that so?  Ok. So when did he make an attempt to seize everyone's firearms?  What bill, law or executive order did congress prevent that would have taken everyone's guns?  When did he say "I'm going to take everyone's guns"?

       Yes, most people agree they were wrong.  But those calls to arms got people to stock up on arms, ammo, food stores.  Maybe that prep got tptb to not follow through on Obama term 3?  :)

       His point is that the people who most loudly told you to PANIC, "be READY because Obama is coming to put you away" also made huge, huge amounts of money selling overpriced supplies to preppers.

      <p>
       That's the exact sort of situation r/conspiracy folks would normally (and
       <em>
        should

       ) zero right in on, but for whatever reason it was a blind spot for a lot of people. I guess as long as they were being told what they wanted to hear - I'm convinced a lot of people

       to be in fear mode - they'd ignore the sketchiness of the situation.

       This applies equally to the left wing right now. Calm your tits. Trump will not be allowed to do anything. The changes good or bad will be decided by the house and senate and alternatively the money brokers, not Trump. He is as big a puppet as all the rest of the US presidents have been since the 1900's. 
The pendulum swings, is all.
