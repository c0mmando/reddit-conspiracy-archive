<p>That&#39;s the primary motivation of many of the members.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is all lodge dependent, and some will be more focused than others. But things like trying to steer business, getting out of speeding tickets, etc. is quite common, although officially discouraged.</p>

<p>Really depends on the lodge and the level of involvement. For many it&#39;s a place to get away from their wife.</p>

<p>But if you look in the right places, their symbols go back to Egypt. Why do you suppose that is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A mason is a stone worker. Freemasons were stone workers that formed a guild, or trade union, a few hundred years ago. They claimed their ancient origins as the hired stone workers, not slaves, that built Solomon&#39;s temple in Jerusalem. Freemasons hold the Bible as an authoritative text. The connection between Solomon&#39;s temple and Egypt is within the text of the Bible, as in the Israelites escaped the bondage of the Egyptian overlords who sought to diminish their reproductive activities by slaughtering their newborn males.  They claim to know the secrets of Solomon&#39;s temple, and perhaps by by extension, also the secrets of the pyramids. They seem to identify with stone buildings in general. Many notable individuals in American history were very public Freemasons, yet this fact never raised an eyebrow amongst the people. In regard to global conspiracies I hold that Freemasonry is a red herring. China is the one to watch :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. My method of cracking symbolism open is to reduce the esoteric to the exoteric. In regard to symbols I propose that all symbols are merely graphical representations of empirically observable objects or phenomena; meaning is then left up to the observer. I agree that many powerful men, but not women, were members of Freemasonry, and this is not a coincidence. The American constitution was born in the Freemasonry lodges of France after their revolution, and this is not necessarily a bad thing. I imagine that these individuals saw the christian church as largely useless for building political platforms so sought an alternative collection point to discuss and foment their ideas, whilst also keeping the notion of the value of the biblical text in the background. The only platforms the christian churches built were the pulpit and the gallows. Freemasonry&#39;s secrets are no longer secret. They are a spent force. No one in power identifies with them any longer. </p>

<p>This is off a bit. Understandable, because a lot has been intentionally covered up. The French Revolution and American Revolution were started by different factions.</p>

<p>Check out George Washington&#39;s letters. He&#39;s not who he pretended to be. He is the greatest spymaster in the history of the world (besides God).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t go that far. Some have been exposed, but the good info has been covered up by bullshit. Most people believe myths about freemasonry, including freemasons.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lots of people do. And there are many others outside the blue lodge.</p>

<p>True. But I think they shared a common goal: the deposing of monarchy. I hold that this was also a core purpose of WWII.</p>

<p>I have not read Washington&#39;s letters, but will take a look. Indeed, the All Knowing One knows all, and no human knows all, but some know a lot, and I would suggest that George was one of these. It probably goes without saying that even in the most honourable of governments there are things spoken and done in secret, although not necessarily malicious.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Perhaps so, but would any of these acquiesce to being photographed in their regalia? Washington seemed to be proud of his Freemasonry.</p>

<p>My personal research, if I dare call it that, has led me straight to Beijing as the capital of global conspiracies. No hard proof, of course, but a little intuition, a lot of reading and a few hard facts. That&#39;s why I think that Freemasons, Illuminati, Bilderbergs, etc., etc... are all red herrings. None of these have the sheer fire power, money, control of the masses and population that China has. Any aspiring dictator trapped in the niceties of democracy would slather at the prospect of having China on their team.</p>

<p>he is taught about frequencies and the hidden aspects on reality </p>

<p>this is correct . worship none about me saith the lord .</p>

<p>as a 32rd degree mason if you worship Jesus you do not make it to 33..</p>

<p>its God or nothing . they do not care of your own belief who or what God is . to you it may be the devil . they do not care . you must worship God </p>
