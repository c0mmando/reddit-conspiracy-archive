       I see things for Freemasonry, subtle signs and bumper stickers. I know that it's very secretive and you have to know somebody to get in, but what is the big about Freemasonry? Are they like the Illuminati? And if so what do they actually do/control?

       From my understanding is a brotherhood network. You have to be asked by another mason to join and being a member consists of pooling connections and resources to help further the endeavours of other masons? That's the understanding I had at least

       You don't have to know one to be one.  You just have to ask.

       However, they are selective of the character of individuals they admit into the fraternity and will therefore want to get to know you before you officially join.

       they do have power indeed most of them are rich and since its a brotherhood they help each other.  A lot of politician in there and actors too... Its secretive because they have deep knowledge that they dont want to share

       My lodge is on the mainstreet of town.  Not really all that secretive if you ask me.  There also is a very fluid structure at the top.  The leadership of the fraternity changes on a yearly basis due to progressive lines.(although progression is not guaranteed, votes are taken and challenges to the post are made)

       For most blue lodge masons, this is absolutely true. It's a fraternal organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is much, much more than that, in so many ways. To start with, it has origins rooted well before its nominal origin in craft masonry.

       If you are liked by the fraternity and give it all your energy, does that guarantee a successful life in general? I guess if it were easy, we'd all be doing it, so I guess there's alot to it.

       It depends on what you mean. Members tend to help each other out, if that's what you're asking.

       I guess I meant success in the general term, the way most people see it (which isn't mine). Materialistically. Like do masons hook their brothers up with high paying jobs? Positions of power?

       Oh, yeah. All the time.

      <p>
       That's the primary motivation of many of the members.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, this is all lodge dependent, and some will be more focused than others. But things like trying to steer business, getting out of speeding tickets, etc. is quite common, although officially discouraged.

       Late to reply here. In general it is heavily discouraged. Not to say it doesn't happen, but most lodges look down on it.  If you go into the Masons for business contacts or to get a better job you'll be heavily disappointed.

       Definitely makes sense, otherwise the lodges would just fill up with elites and elite wannabes, rather than the brotherhood.

       They have more influence than power I would say. The zionist media, oil, telecom, etc corporations and the CIA Clinton foundation cabal have the real control and power.

       The idea to meet and work together as equals with those of other religions is pretty heretical in a number of religions.  Seeing the Catholic Church's history of exterminating those of different faiths(inquisition, crusades, etc) its unsurprising that Jews, Christians and Muslims working together as brothers would be viewed unfavorably.

       Maybe it was just their branch, but my god is it far more boring than you'd think.   Its basically a social club for old folks, and its just a ton of formailites, hours of reading minutes and voting on meaningless stuff, and then some bizzare prayers.

       Freemasonry is an old boys penis measuring club. They wear an apron: this is the apron of the book of Genesis, which covers their private parts. The divider: this measures distance, or length. The square: this measures a right angle, the approximate angle between the torso and an erect penis.

       Really depends on the lodge and the level of involvement. For many it's a place to get away from their wife.

       But if you look in the right places, their symbols go back to Egypt. Why do you suppose that is?

       A mason is a stone worker. Freemasons were stone workers that formed a guild, or trade union, a few hundred years ago. They claimed their ancient origins as the hired stone workers, not slaves, that built Solomon's temple in Jerusalem. Freemasons hold the Bible as an authoritative text. The connection between Solomon's temple and Egypt is within the text of the Bible, as in the Israelites escaped the bondage of the Egyptian overlords who sought to diminish their reproductive activities by slaughtering their newborn males.  They claim to know the secrets of Solomon's temple, and perhaps by by extension, also the secrets of the pyramids. They seem to identify with stone buildings in general. Many notable individuals in American history were very public Freemasons, yet this fact never raised an eyebrow amongst the people. In regard to global conspiracies I hold that Freemasonry is a red herring. China is the one to watch :-)

       It sounds like everything you know about freemasonry is the "exoteric" understanding. But there is much, much more to this than the surface reading. There are many layers of "esoteric" hidden meanings.

       Just think about what you already know. The organization has their symbols all over buildings, and many of the most powerful men in history were members. Yet you conclude this is all a coincidence...

       Good point. My method of cracking symbolism open is to reduce the esoteric to the exoteric. In regard to symbols I propose that all symbols are merely graphical representations of empirically observable objects or phenomena; meaning is then left up to the observer. I agree that many powerful men, but not women, were members of Freemasonry, and this is not a coincidence. The American constitution was born in the Freemasonry lodges of France after their revolution, and this is not necessarily a bad thing. I imagine that these individuals saw the christian church as largely useless for building political platforms so sought an alternative collection point to discuss and foment their ideas, whilst also keeping the notion of the value of the biblical text in the background. The only platforms the christian churches built were the pulpit and the gallows. Freemasonry's secrets are no longer secret. They are a spent force. No one in power identifies with them any longer.

       True. But I think they shared a common goal: the deposing of monarchy. I hold that this was also a core purpose of WWII.

       I have not read Washington's letters, but will take a look. Indeed, the All Knowing One knows all, and no human knows all, but some know a lot, and I would suggest that George was one of these. It probably goes without saying that even in the most honourable of governments there are things spoken and done in secret, although not necessarily malicious.

       Perhaps so, but would any of these acquiesce to being photographed in their regalia? Washington seemed to be proud of his Freemasonry.

      <p>
       My personal research, if I dare call it that, has led me straight to Beijing as the capital of global conspiracies. No hard proof, of course, but a little intuition, a lot of reading and a few hard facts. That's why I think that Freemasons, Illuminati, Bilderbergs, etc., etc... are all red herrings. None of these have the sheer fire power, money, control of the masses and population that China has. Any aspiring dictator trapped in the niceties of democracy would slather at the prospect of having China on their team.

       he is taught about frequencies and the hidden aspects on reality
