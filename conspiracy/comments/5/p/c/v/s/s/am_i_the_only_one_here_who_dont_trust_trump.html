       For me, its not that I trust him but more that his message has made me hopeful. I'm willing to give him a chance and see where he goes with his administration. True, I gave Obama the same chance and he completely fucked it all up in less than a year, but call me an optimist...

       Obama has an opportunity to lay charges on every banker that completely fucked the global economy. Instead he was all like " it's ok... It was an oopsie!"
      </p>
      <p>
       So then we had to sit back and watch Iceland charge and sentance every banker that fucked the Icelandic economy, then watch Iceland bounce back twice as fast as everyone else.

       So if Trump doesn't "lay charges on every banker that completely fucked the global economy" within his first year, he would "completely fuck up"? (btw I'm not defending Obama and not disagreeing with regulating the bankers)

       Keep an eye on the DOJ press releases... the media kinda glosses it over but there are big moves being made against the banks right now... it'll only ramp up as they go for criminal charges in addition to the fines and repatriation of funds.

       Well obviously Goldman Sachs is gonna be left untouched as all these other banks are litigated into a tizzy... but I only support Trump as much as I support the joker... he scares the shit out of everybody... good and bad... and it has been a while since the bad guys have been scared.

       Well, no, the banking issue isn't a problem he needs to deal with right now. For me, if he stymies investigation into Clinton, or Clinton Foundation...yes thats a fuck up. If he fails to keep his promises, yes thats a fuck up.

       Yes. It would actually apply justice to people who broke the law and made thousands homeless. Also it would serve as a warning to future bankers
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to pull the same bullshit a second time. It seems to have worked fabulously in Iceland which was pretty much the only country to hold their bankers accountable.

       Of course the bankers did not break criminal law, and the businesses were fined a lot of money for being possibly negligent. Oh, and Iceland needed a bailout, financed in part by the US, after its banks went under, so I guess they have their own problems. The whole jailing bankers thing is cute, but it didn't make the crisis any better for them.

      <p>
       Some google searching will reveal the specific laws I'm sure but I can't be bothered to follow up a 7 year old crime. I'm not a financial accountant, nor have I really stayed on top of the banking issues around the melt down either. What I know is that Obama administration had a chance to pursue and prosecute and didn't. The choice not to go after these bankers was framed under the lie that prosecution would create financial instability. That's unforgivable.

       All the president can do is order an investigation.

       It's super cute you won't let this go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me educate you on politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are correct, the president can order an investigation. They can also order a stop to the investigation (which is what happened). They can also tell the DOJ to not press charges (which is also what happened). Furthermore the president can introduce laws through House or Senate leaders or make signing statements which directly affect laws... by doing this they can change law in order to make things previously illegal legal (which is what happened under both Bush and Obama).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the US this is what we call a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic">
        Constitutional Republic.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you run under a Prime Minister then very similar actions can be taken by your elected official.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Constitutional Republics all citizens are supposed to be considered equal under the law. This is not what happened under Bush or Obama with regards to the financial collapse. Certain citizens were allowed to commit fraud and were not held accountable for it. Furthermore, those citizens who committed fraud were financially rewarded for their behavior with a $800 billion bail out which Bush failed to create guidelines for distribution and Obama failed to rectify.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going back to Regan, US Presidents have worked to entrench an
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy">
        Oligarchy
       </a>
       in the United States by centralizing powers in the federal government and creating laws the specifically benefit the upper classes of citizenry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The person currently acting as US President has made promises to decentralize government power and return much of those powers to the States, as well as attempt to end the pay-to-play aspects of lobbying government. These are steps that would effectively move
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       the oligarchy and possibly begin returning the US to its proper Constitutional Republic status. Whether or not he does this is what will define him as a fuck up or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You on the other hand,are quite happy seeing the subjugation of the lower class at the hands of upper tiers of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want a King. I don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't waste my time anymore with idiotic statements about government because it's painfully obvious you have no idea what you're talking about.  Maybe go read a book or something.

       Give me a break, you started the whole chain off by insulting the OP and then followed it up by calling someone else a retard.  Worry about yourself and your own comments, you'd be better off.

       I understand why I got the warning, and that's fine. What I did is what I did. What baffles me is how the other guy gets away like he did literally nothing. I also don't understand how I was the first to insult him.

       You sarcastically called OP "kid" so he sarcastically called you "genius".  Neither of those comments are particularly egregious which is why neither of you received warnings for them.  Your second comment is the particularly bad one, and the only one in the chain that is ban worthy.  Again, worry about yourself.

       For me, it's not that I
       <em>
        trust
       </em>
       Trump, rather I had ZERO trust in Hillary and the team behind her. I knew Hillary would bring bad things to the world and we would see essentially a female version of George Bush/Dick Cheney.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Trump, his Nationalist, anti-[group] talk is unsettling to say the least, but he also has said several things that I think could bring some much needed change to the establishment such as a re-working of NAFTA, reevaluating the NATO situation, and having closer ties to Russia rather than demonizing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day I truly believe both candidates would be total disasters, and I believe Trump's will be no short of a horrendous President. But I at least have some hope that the anti establishment talk will at least stir up discussion about what direction we want to take the world in going forward. Maybe people will see this as a rock bottom of sorts and decide that starting in 2020, we need to really reassess what kind of leader we really want. Let's rebuild our society from scratch and do it right.

       I feel you, but I'm surprise that you think a billionaire, casino operator, Israel Supporter, womanizer..etc is "anti establishment" ..and he picked pro-corporate, pro-war, anti-privacy,  pro-torture, anti-minority cabinet elitist rich members ...and from the way you talk, you seem very smart ..and that what makes me really surprised that r/conspiracy members (the most open minded people on reddit) are pro-trump or at least not don't see through him!

       This is exactly why I believe he will be a disaster of a President. He's easily the most alienating President in history, and his 'proposals' for his term are all over the place (like you listed). This is why I don't trust him one bit.

       I am definitely not pro-Trump and I see exactly what you see. But that's why I think he is the President we deserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't speak for a lot of other members in this sub, but the way I see it going forward is this: if Hillary won, we would just see a continuation of the status quo in Washington - more Washington politician types, more bureaucracy, a pro-war/anti-Russia rhetoric. But, with Trump winning, we get a giant wildcard. Nobody knows how it will go because just going by his quotes, he's all over the place. But within that mess is some promise (NAFTA re-do, trade and job growth, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       So the way I see it is that if he does a few of those things which I believe are badly needed, then it will be totally worth it. And if he doesn't succeed and becomes a complete mess of a President, then it gives us a chance to start fresh 4 years from now just based on all the attention it will draw.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr: love him or hate him, he is bringing attention and discussion to politics never seen before because of how polarizing he is. This can only be good for our future.

       Who invaded Iraq, who invaded Afghanistan, who didn't intervene in Syria and who was Sec State when Libya's current civil war began? Let me give you a hint: none of them are Clinton. So blaming her for trying to clean up Bush's mess is kind of silly. Yes, the intervention in Libya which she supported ended being a mistake, but it probably didn't change the outcome much, just prevented civilian casualties.

       You realize who killed Gaddafi, correct? I'm saying bush's iraq and Afghanistan are similar to clinton and Obama's Libya and Syria. The intervention in Libya was a mistake, you don't know that it didn't change the outcome much or that it prevented casualties, and arming syrian "rebels" was a mistake as well. The point is, as Secretary of state shit did fuck all for improving foreign policy from the days of bush and Cheney, and to think she'd be different as president is naive. That's how you know she'd be a train wreck. You should research these things and you'll see they're all very similar to eachother (Iraq, Libya, syria).

       A misratan militiaman killed Gaddafi, after rebels from the NTC occupied every major city in Libya, then chased him from his remaining strongholds. The only foreign aid rebels received was an arms embargo and the establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya. Syrian rebels won against a stronger state than Libya with neither of those things, until Russia and Iran bailed out Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arming Syrian rebels was a mistake, America should have established a no-fly zone and had boots on the ground to pacify Syria before Russia stepped in and started bombing everyone who wasn't pro-government.
      </p>
      <p>
       How the fuck is Iraq, Libya and Syria similar to each other? We invaded and occupied Iraq, which is now the most stable of the three, established a no-fly zone over Libya, which is the second stablest, and did nothing in Syria which has been destroyed by the civil war.

       I'm saying they're similar because we had to stick our dicks in all three of those sandboxes. If you're advocating boots on the ground in Syria and you don't think that's a move straight out of the Bush playbook, you may be retarded. Let's put boots on the ground and let our military be the fucking pacifists? Militaries are for killing. Not for mediating. If you want a war with Russia, putting boots on the ground and supporting jihadists is a great idea, but if you don't want war it's the most ass backward idea ever.

       You are right that militaries are for killing, which is why I think we should use ours to stop Assad/Hezbollah and ISIS/Jabhat al Nusra from killing more civilians. Because the US army is a lot better at avoiding civilian deaths than those armies. And I think there is a way to do so without starting a war with Russia, mainly because Putin is too smart to start shit with the US.

       We armed Syrians to overthrow Assad and assassinated Gaddafi. That's pretty significant.

       Do you think Assad was facilitating genocide? Do you know where the push to overthrow him came from? Figure those things out and then rethink your position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isis is an entirely different animal. We trained isis/isil forces. Our president is on record stating our early position of training them, there's loads of evidence aside from his word from investigative journalists and intelligence committees alike and if you think that's not true, you're naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isis is insatiable and cannot be appeased. They have to be wiped out. There is no future in working with them. Assad isn't some Kim il sung type dictator, we can work with him. Above all else, if we want to get involved in other country's bullshit, we need to do it by democratically supporting a democratic change within the country. Not with military force. That's why we're in this fucking mess.

       We didn't arm Libyans and did a terrible job or arming Syrian rebels.
      </p>

       Assad targets Sunni Muslims deliberately, using chemical weapons against civilians. The first push to overthrow him came from pro-democracy protesters during the Arab spring who were tired of the domination of him and his Alawite sect. He caused civil war by violently cracking down on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying America trained ISIS is disingenuous, because America has trained so many soldiers throughout the past 40 years, it has people who trained with them on every side of the way. It is impossible to know that they would turn out to commit genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS is a symptom of the US failure in the Middle East, it is not a problem in itself, and when it is wiped out, it will be replaced by another group like it. The way to stop that is to stop supporting military dictatorships in the Middle East and stand with pro-democracy groups. Until Syria is liberated and stable, terrorist groups will continue to come. Assad will not stand down. He will drive Syria into the ground, until every Sunni, Kurd and pro-democracy rebel is dead or has left. That is his plan. Obviously, that is not something that can be allowed to happen, it is the definition of genocide. The people want change, but until they receive support like Assad has gotten from Iran and Russia, all they will get is death.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US should have intervened in Syria before Russia started bombing anyone who didn't pledge allegiance to Assad. By the time Trump is gone and an actual leader who isn't in Russia's pocket is in place, it may be too late.

        The case of the sarin gas attack being ordered by assad is backed up by nothing
       </a>
       . It's all hearsay. We don't know that he did it (in fact, there's more evidence that our state department provided the gas to rebels and they used it against civilians either intentionally or unintentionally). The Arab spring being a genuine uprising aimed at democratic reshaping is another highly debated and unproven claim. Read 'Arabesque' by Ahmed Bensaada. America trained isis/isil when they were in fact known as isis/isil. That is how Obama referred to them when he mentions that we were training them, so for all intents and purposes, we did in fact train isis. If you truly believe trump is in Russia's pocket, it's no surprise you believe that assad is a murderous dictator who is orchestrating genocide. All of these things you claim are just recycled from news reports that are very weak in evidence, but it's taken as fact because it's reiterated by other 'credible' news networks. Before you pass me off as a crazy conspiracy theorist just remember that wmd in Iraq, babies being removed from incubators by saddam, and the aluminum tubes saddam had being used exclusively for weapons zed nuclear purposes, were all perpetuated by the media in the same way as this assad/Arab spring reporting, and they turned out to be demonstrable lies generated to make the bullshit case for war. Just for a few hours of researching, set aside any preconceptions you have about our government/hillary Clinton's honesty and credibility and read through the information that has actually been verified and is verifiable by you yourself. You may just see why many highly educated people decided that an unknown in the Whitehouse was less risky than President Trump. Give it a chance and see where you end up.

       So yeah, Assad or his allies used Sarin Gas. You should read through the report, it lists other atrocities they committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media has been wrong about some things, certainly, but in this case, what they say is backed by plenty of evidence, from reputable bodies like UNHRC. I actually do do research, unlike you, and instead of linking to a CBS anchor talking about how Assad said he didn't use chemical weapons, I linked to an investigation which shows he did. I would like to see any real evidence Obama ever funded ISIS, although I don't think you will find any, considering he didn't.

       I get that you love Trump because he is stupid like you, but this sub is supposed to be about critical thinking, so maybe you should do so.

       My man, the US facilitated Gaddafis assassination. The queen loser herself admitted it. "We came, we saw, he died." I've read the report. Nowhere in there does it say assad or his allies used the gas. The "rebels" could very well have been organized enough to use it. After all, they were supported by the best in the business. The article I linked was linked for the actual article, not the video. Nobody can prove assad did it, so by your logic it must not have happened, like you suggest with Obama administration funding isis. And you're right, I'm so stupid I made my way out of the ghetto and now have my own business with almost two dozen employees and I have a degree in business as well as astrophysics. So yeah I'm basically functionally retarded. Do me a favor and keep calling successful, determined people you speak with stupid. It's driving more and more people away from engaging in discussions with you and people like you, because it doesn't persuade people of you argument and instead alienates them, and your words will eventually be useless when nobody cares to hear your voice. Just food for thought. I hope you will do as I do and keep an open mind about all of this stuff because we will inevitable see more information come out and if we are set in our views new evidence does nothing for determining the truth. I appreciate the  (mostly) cordial conversation and wish you the best, my friend.

       The US might have facilitated it, but it would have happened without their help, and was not due to their support. The document clearly states on page 19 what I quoted, that shows that Assad or a member of the army used chemical weapons. I am very proud of you for achieving your awesome and definitely real astrophysics degree and business success, but that doesn't change the fact that you are incapable of critical thinking and have a laughable knowledge of history. I am not talking with you to make you happy or comfortable, but to tell the truth about what happened.

Your dislike or distrust about trump isn't a conspiracy.
It means you watch too much MSM .
Just relax.  At worst, he will be as awful as everyone else.

       How does theorizing with NO info help prevent Trump from doing evil things?  Do you go about life defensive that everyone around you is going to do evil things?  Or do you enjoying life assuming people are good and then when they prove otherwise do you change tact?

       He already has a chance. I didn't give it to him, and I'd take it away if I could, but I can't, so he's keeping his chance for the foreseeable future.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there is absolutely no reason anyone should stop predicting him to do evil things. This is not "theorizing on NO info" - there is tons of info about how Trump operates, what he wants, and what he's likely to do. Of course, you have to ignore what he
       <em>
        says
       </em>
       he wants to do, because he lies so blatantly and often that he's an outlier even among politicians. But 24 hours in, you can already tell he's one of, if no the most, corrupt presidents in history based on his cabinet picks alone. The only optimism to be found in his presidency is if you agree wholeheartedly with the GOP platform and think Trump will be weak, ineffective, and manipulable enough that the Republicans will get everything they want through him; or you were stupid enough to believe the hilariously flimsy narrative that he was an anti-establishment candidate.

       I don't really care what kind of opinions you want to be insulated from because they're not "conspiratorial" enough. And if I did, I could mention several things that Trump is involved with that fall directly in line with the theme of this sub. Things that reduce peoplexs trust in him, thereby also directly tying in with the OP's post.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about this for example: I don't trust Trump because I believe he is engaging in a
       <em>
        conspiracy
       </em>
       with Rex Tillerson and Vladimir Putin to enrich themselves via oil deals in Russia. Is that direct enough for you?

       Sure, of course companies put a lot of pressure on politicians to do what they want, Hillary isn't the one campaigning to spend more on the military or give companies free money, nor is she trying to start more wars, so I don't see how she is more influenced by the MIC than Trump, who is trying to do all of those.

       I hear this get thrown around a lot and it confuses me greatly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Military-industrial complex wanting wars with Middle Eastern nations or other relatively undeveloped nations that can in no way fight back and do any significant strike against American soil? Sure, makes sense, obvious profit there.
      </p>
      <p>
       War with Russia? I see no way elites of any kind would benefit from this. Even if things didn't go nuclear (which the risk of is quite high), Russia would be able to do significant damage to the US economy in ways that would definitely hurt even those making money off the military industrial complex. Why the hell would they want to take that massive risk when they have safe massive profits from fighting terrorists who can't do much of anything to them?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, sure, I can see
       <em>
        proxy
       </em>
       -war, but that's never what you people say, you're always all "full out WWIII direct war with Russia!" which just makes no sense if you think about it for even a minute.

       Okay, you don't seem to be able to think of reasons why, which I can understand as I can't either, but then why are you so confident that's what they want as opposed to proxy wars or something like that? Was there some sort of big evidence of that agenda I don't know of?

       The closest things I have heard regarding explanation is the ongoing issues in Syria, the competing pipelines that the Saudis and the Russians want to lay to provide to Europe. That the proxy wars have escalated to the point that TPTB are done playing, but who knows. It is just obvious if you have paid attention for the last year that a war is wanted with Russia.

       No you're not, there's an insane amount of new users here. I think that's attributed to the crack down on communities where open discussion can be had. Politics worldnews etc is extremely left and the Donald is well I don't know what it is but they are not open to criticism so it's not a place for open discussion. Pizzagate is banned many others quarantined or banned. Conspiracy is one of the few places where you could criticize either side. But a lot of the research and big topics here lately have been against Clinton and the DNC which have the impression that this was an anti Hillary zone. Being one of the last places where you could voice your opinion at least some what indiscriminately a lot of pro trump or extremely anti Hillary people continued to flow in.
      </p>

       Now with this place closer to half a million users the original intention and purpose of this sub has been lost and it's turned into a place people think is for general political news? The core users here will be suspicious of whatever government is in, you're just seeing the results of censorship and growing user base

       I'm flummoxed at the face of the reddit "conspiracy" subreddit. Conspiracy theory occurs at the crossroads of skepticism and delusion yet it seems this sub has dropped skepticism in favor of the only the latter. To see conspiracy theorist with such open admiration for the commander in chief and in essence the powers that be is shocking to say the least. It's like we bough a one-sided narrative and extinguished all critical thinking relative to who is selling us the message.
      </p>

       I think we're in the death throws of this bait and switch. How many posts about Clinton when sorting by "Hot" yet she is not even a candidate? How much longer can this last?

       Poor thing,  you probably think disestablishmentarianism was a good thing.  It would be about as good as conspiracy-minded Americans walking away from or disavowing the strongest tool ever put in their hands.  A very terrible idea indeed.

       But, fwiw, I'd expect no less from someone with a handle like u/CUNT_PUNCHER.  A genuine fedora-tipper, no doubt.  Not that you were owed an explanation; glad to see the word usage triggered you enough to join the dogpile, faget.

       I find the lack of moderation of clear violations of the rules in most clearly the last six months disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly has dropped the quality of posts in this sub a great deal compared to how it was prior to that influx in the run up to the US Federal Election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coming back to the OP; I'm skeptical of Trump but will wait and see what he brings to the Oval Office from across the pond (Australia).

       The rules there are too restrictive for my liking.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I would like is basically what this sub was prior to the influx of new members within the six months that either bleed across from the_donald, complain about the current US President on the grounds of cultural marxism or post to degrade this sub in general (this sub is as bad as the_donald/politics or some other sub).
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do not want, nor support, is a sub that restricts users from posting in other parts of Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sub, like this one was at one point, that enforces a 'Play the ball and not the player' method of moderation; encouraging users to discuss and debate issues where constructional criticism appears without attacking other users (because they post in sub x/y/z, have a bias they openly disclose or appeals to emotion/shaming tactics to undermine others). Take note also of the rule in the conspiracy sub about accusing others of breaking the rules, having that rule (report, do not post 'shill' accusations/etc.) would be beneficial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any sub that does that would be off to a good start IMHO.

       I don't have any recommendations for admins, nor am I interested in being a mod myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do suggest is good vetting of mods and checking their post history (ideally more than 12 months worth but Reddit only goes back x posts before archiving the rest) to get a good profile of their beliefs and opinions to ensure they aline with the goals of your sub. Keeping a firm eye on them with strong leadership will aid against infiltration from detractors aiming to derail the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good on ya for having a crack at it and good luck with your sub.

       The thing is, everywhere I go "Truthers" On Facebook, YouTube, Reddit, Forums ..etc are talking about the same Garbage, certain subjects have been installed by agents and/or "controlled Opposition" to waste our energy, time, brain cells on fake causes ..I'm looking for a sub  1-unpopbular 2-sophistected, does not attract stupid people 3- gives no room for agents or political supporters (such as Trump supporters) to bs us and waste our time and energy .. and we need to have a list of fake conspiracies that have been pushed on truth seeking people to mislead them and make them look like crazy or even make them crazy!  such as UFO's Aliens, Pro-Trump, Hemp ..etc  ... people have other places to speak about aaaalll these things, We need to take it to the next level

       I agree in principle, but still the systemic institutionalized trafficking and abuse of children is a real thing, so are the Clinton crimes. Exposing her (and the democrat establishment) as a bunch of self-congratulating war criminals doesn't mean we're shilling for the other head of this bicephalic, single-party system.

       You think the corruption is team error.  I believe its a league problem with the rules.

       Look at the last 7 presidents and their administrations. All have been corrupt and or horrible.

       You want to point at democrats but the reds have been just as corrupt and just as horrible.

       Most peoples gripe about trump is based off his actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has already broken his emoluments clause by continuing to own his businesses and not putting them in a blind trust which every single president has done before him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has not disclosed his tax returns which would tell us if he has investments that would serve as a conflict of interest. Again unlike any president before him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has been traced to Russian hacking attempts, has been tied to Russian bankers. Putin has just thrown a party in honor of trump winning and was overheard claiming "America is ours". Again unlike any other president ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has assembled a cabinet that cannot be defended. You can't tell me any of the appointments he has made is logical or well thought out. Betsy devos is not even eligible to be a principal and she is in charge of our nation's children's education. He talked of draining the swamp and just filled it with his own creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has not introduced a single plan, he has no plan for after removing the ACA. He has no complete tax plans. No plans to bring back business other than repeal NAFTA, which is unknown how much that will hurt us this far into the agreement. In fact he has ZERO ideas on how to achieve his goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a goddamn liability. He is not presidential, his mouth has offended world leaders without gaining any advantage. He doesn't strategize or position himself. He reacts and attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't heard a single good point about trump with out being able to look back in the past and find proof of the contrary. And sure you can call me a "cuck" or "socialist libtard" but you still will have no facts on your side.

       Fuck CNN, see all you stupid trump fans do is assume anyone who is against trump is some liberal CNN lover. You dumb everything down so much that you come off as idiots. Have you ever though there are alot of former Republicans that are straight up pissed off? No because you have no facts because "fake news" is your only defense.

       I'd wager that most people that visit this sub aren't especially fond of Trump, and probably disagree with a lot of his policy points as well as some of his personal attributes. Also, if Trump had run against Bernie, I'm sure the top (Clinton-related) posts on this subreddit, that you refer to, would instead be highly critical of Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to conspiracy theories, there's just so much material that can be dug up about the Clintons. Bill's infidelity and sexual proclivities, the Clinton Foundation, Benghazi, the DNC rigging things in favor of Clinton and feeding her debate questions ahead of time, Hillary and John Podesta's email leak, the billion plus dollar in campaign donations from corporations and foreign nations etc. But with Trump, there's a lot less material to work with. He has virtually no political experience (no conspiracy there) and he's a billionaire (although he was born rich and probably made ruthless business decisions to get to where he's at) which makes it unlikely he'd be easily bribed. Hell, the biggest conspiracy related thing about Trump I can think of is 'Pissgate', which doesn't seem very credible in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Obama stated, I think a lot of people are "cautiously optimistic" about Trump, though personally, I'm not holding my breath.

       I think what it is, is that Trump was mostly an outsider and not a career politician.  This is the "most different" POTUS we have had in forever and they want to give him a chance to see what he'll do.

       He will be impeached so fast it will astound everyone. There is no way he will be able to not cashing on this position and will get caught... hell he has already been at it ffs.

       I disagree. Positive talk about anyone isn't really what this sub is for. Which is why I said there are other subs to praise your preferred political leader. This sub is critical of EVERYTHING and EVERYONE. Why would we praise a leader of any country on this sub? I am suspicious of any praise or kowtowing done as everyone here should be. Let's theorize about every powerful person and entity, regardless of our own political leanings.

       Honestly? The sceptic in me would ask who those decisions would help profit (besides us). That's why I originally joined this sub, so we could look past the curtain and see who was pulling the strings. Not get distracted by smoke and mirrors. Question everything. 
I'm not saying we need to hate Trump and never talk about the achievements that happen under his administration. I am saying that we should not have rose-colored glasses on when it comes to a person on power, no matter how much we agree with him politically.

       Well I can agree with that statement but that statement means something entirely different than "we should never talk positively about anyone here ever", that seems like a railroaded conversation to me.

       I think this is a place where it's safe to have meaningful conversations / debates about all of this. Not saying my opinion is right/wrong but you won't get banned for having a different opinion. Much like T_D is for Republicans/Trump supporters, r politics is a safe place for Dems.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all its a mix of both mindsets with a distrust for big brother. His comments today about Iraq gave me pause. And it's great it's being discussed here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm hoping he follows through becomes one of the greatest presidents to be elected. I also got caught up in that same message of hope and change in 2008. Parallels yes, but I'm going to give it a chance before my opinion of him is swayed.

       The idea that one either trusts or distrusts someone should be abandoned.  It's too simplistic.  It's quite common however but it's far too simplistic of an approach.  It's not about the person - it's about the issue.

       Judge each issue on it's own merits then compare to his handling of said issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are too lazy in their thinking.  They like to break things into dichotomies (it's either love or hate Trump, it's either Xbox or Playstation, it's either VHS or BetaMax).  Stop doing this....we're better and smarter than this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can hate a person but love what they stand for.  You can hate their stance of position A but love and endorse their position on B.

      <p>
       It's time we evolve in our thinking.

       I fully agree, ... but sadly most of his supporters (the ones I know or met) 1-Fully trust him 2-Support him BLINDLY and defend ALL his actions or at least only speak positively about him ... also, I have red-lines, if you pass them, I will completely stop trusting you such as supporting Israel, supporting torture, picking certain people for the cabinet, owning a casino ..etc ...but overall I agree with you!

       1) So what - don't use other people's actions or thought processes to justify your own behavior or thought processes.  It all begins with you, not them.  Ignore them, do your thing, appeal to the more evolved approach.

      <p>
       This is where you contradict yourself and this has become all too common.  You can say that you only do this in the most extreme cases but you're missing the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about trusting the person it's about the merits of the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deal and address the issues and leave the person out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone gets this confused these days.  They say, "Well you support Trump on issue A therefore you support him on issue B"  Which is simply ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or they try to label people with idiotic labels such as Liberal or Conservative.  Which is also equally absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person can be liberal on an issue and conservative on other.  I can disagree with a candidate on a number of issues and agree with them on other issues and I don't have to be extreme with these agreements either.

      <p>
       haha then you don't fully agree with me like you initially said you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's difficult I realize this.  It's almost as if you want to believe in the ideas I propose but it gets sticky along the way and you revert to your black/white thinking by thinking that redlines are justified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life rarely is black and white and we constantly have to deal with shades of grey but most people don't want to deal with those because they're inconvenient.  They're also easy to misunderstand and one can quickly find themselves at the center of an attack they never intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless.....the change begins with me and I've been greatly benefitted by pushing myself to not adopt simple solutions.

       Thanks! If you only knew how much my challenging of others has NOT been seen as a gift.  Honestly at times, I'm only rarely aware that I'm doing it and unfortunately people just get pissed at me....from my perspective, this often happens randomly and quite unexpectedly even if I'm trying to be hyper aware and NOT challenge people so much.  Still trying to find a way to monetize this. haha

       Well, the first people will resist you, are the people you are trying to help ... The more informed you are, the more good you do, the more enemies you will have! however you will have a purpose! most humans go to school, find a job, watch sports, drink beer, make babies then die without discovering their sacred purpose! most important thing is keep an open mind, challenge your deepest believes everyday! the journey of truth seeking will never end, because life, like movies, have many twists!

       Take the top 5 issues you care about.  Then think if you would be excited or not if Trump endorsed those issues.  By your standard, you would be "unsettled" but by my standard, I would be thrilled.  My excitement is independent of the person endorsing the issue.

       I dislike Trump, have thought he was a terrible human being for years, and in general have little faith that he will change during his presidency and help anyone out.  He's a selfish prick that has lived a life of wealth, excess, and hedonism and I'm fairly sure he's got a lot of skeletons in his closet that need to come out.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I'm going to to proceed in the exact same way I do with Obama; when he does something I agree with I will support it and when he does something I feel is terrible for the nation I'll contact my reps and do what else I can to fight it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it doesn't matter who is sitting in the Oval Office when I'm fairly sure all the strings being pulled are done at a much higher level.

       I've been getting very sick and tired of the divisions between people.  Too many people go "I disagree with your opinion on this topic, so I will forever hate you and everything you say because fuck you".  I was over Trump winning pretty quickly, and I just want to see how he does going forward.  I don't have high hopes for him, but that doesn't mean I'm going to fight everything he does out of some petty need for revenge like the Republicans did during Obama(the Dems during Bush weren't all that sparkly nice either).
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the powers behind everything haven't moved an inch, been deposed, or are even the tiniest bit scared because Trump is dancing to their tune.  I'll just continue to be skeptical, support the issues I feel strongly about, and fight against the things I feel are meant to enslave is more fully.

       If only everyone shared this sentiment. Trump has been elected now and still I am seeing Hillary supporters and Trump supporters clashing with one another. For fuck sake people, just accept it and take the appropriate steps to tackle any issues you disagree with, as they appear. Bitching to each other is wasted energy.

       You're absolutely right. The people hold all the true power, they are simply unaware or have no idea how to use it. Which is the intended state of things I believe. Keep the people fighting against each other and they're easier to control.

       Yes, Trump was born wealthy. But if you look close enough you will find he works his ass off. He campaigned non-stop making 3 campaign appearances a day up until the election. His opponent went weeks doing 1-2 appearances the entire time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look, you will find his second marriage was destroyed because he worked too much. He was never home and Marla wanted a traditional family life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump didn't need to work so hard on the campaign trail, his opponent did though because his opponent relies on her position to sell govt. favors. Without the position, the income dries up. Trump has a steady income.
      </p>

       I found this to be a decently well thought out reply to my post, right up until the last sentence when I realized you're just a sad little person trying to pick a fight with someone on the internet.  It's unfortunate you had to ruin your post by adding something so childish and pointless to your post.  Have a good day, and maybe if you try harder someone might fall for your bait.

       Been here for years, bro. Far too long to stop now. I was a conspiracy theorist before it was cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       My positions lean far left to the progressive side. That doesn't mean I don't realize both sides are the same. I gave Obama a chance in 2007-2008. I argued for him back then.  He didn't get my endorsement after being in office a year, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same goes this time around. Hillary was god awful, I was forced to look into Trump with open eyes. I liked what I saw. He speaks his mind. He pulls no BS when he talks. He is anti establishment and anti corruption. He has worked his ass of to get the election. I'll give him a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       But believe me when I say as soon as shit starts to smell, I'm anti-Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Obama it was filling his cabinet with those Citibank recommendations, He had a majority in the house and senate and didn't do anything with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I lean left in ideology, I recognize both sides are the same. I'm gonna give Trump a chance. I gave Obama a chance when all the crazy right wingers said he was gonna take their guns. Obama didn't take their guns, but he turned out to be a piece of shit. And as soon it was obivious, I was anti-Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, it kind of sucks that it seems I am always on the side of defense when politics is in the lime light. I defended Obama when he was running for office. Then I found myself arguing the other side with Obama apologists in r/politcs.

       I'm going to disagree with you on him being anti-establishment and anti-corruption, but that's really just a matter of opinion right now until he takes more action.  How are you feeling about his cabinet choices, seeing as how you mentioned Obama's choice?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm hoping you're being serious and that you'll keep your skeptical, truth-seeking, eyes open and treat him the same way you say you did Obama.

       In terms of his cabinet choices, I posted this earlier:
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it has it's weaknesses and strengths, but overall is a solid cabinet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not handpicked by Goldman Sachs was for Obama, but it has it's weaknesses.
       <a href="http://infographics.economist.com/2017/Trump/TrumpGraphic.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Trump is a bright guy, and chose his cabinet because they can do the job. We'll see about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a serious problem with Trump's position on global warming. His position could possibly be because Trump doesn't believe the science (I don't believe this), or he just wants to trash the environment in exchange for short term profits. I'll be keeping an eye on this. Trashing the environment for now without concern for future generations isn't cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have a serious problem with Trump's position on Israel. Israel is the fucking anti-christ as far as I'm concerned, and Trump seems to embrace Israel. I don't know if it is just his online cheer leading crew, or if he is as pro-Israel as they make it out to be, but this is a serious problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other things I don't like about Trump, but these are serious issues to me. So far he has hit the ground running. He hit the ground running before taking office.

       I disagree with your assessment of his cabinet and your opinion of him, but I do agree with your opinion on global warming.  So we have things we agree on and things we disagree on.  I'm going to treat you like I treat most people; I don't hate you or dislike you, I just disagree with some of your conclusions.  When those topics are front and center we will be on opposite sides, but since there are things we agree on that means I feel you're a potential ally in those issues where we share similar stances.

       Based on some preliminary stuff I hear about them, they are more establishment than Obama had.  I feel his call to drain the swamp was only empty words on a campaign trail because he liked the swamp, it's just that he wanted to fill it with his own muck.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's still time for them to prove me wrong, so there is that minor hope.

       Something I find useful: there's a lot of people I don't trust, but that I do trust
       <em>
        to behave in a specific pattern,
       </em>
       and that predictability can be almost as good. I would have voted Clinton, for example, not because I trust her in general (hoooo boy, do I not trust her), but because I figured that a slow but regular erosion of freedom was probably less terrible than Trump getting us nuked. I'm a pessimist either way, but I ranked the devil I know over a hothead wildcard narcissist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm really just giving that as a practical example. I understand how other people could look at the same situation and come to other conclusions legitimately.

       Not at all man. I don't trust ANYBODY that makes it to Presidency. We need to watch Trump like a hawk, and hold him accountable for his actions. TOGETHER. the EXACT same thing would be said by me if Hillary became president. My personal view is that Russian conflict was imminent under a Clinton administration, so in that regard, and only that regard, I am glad Trump won. I try my best to be optimistic, and alot of folks I feel are, but I wouldn't necessarily confuse people's hope with ignorance. Although, don't get me wrong, ignorance is a'plenty.

       no, you're not &amp; at first i was perplexed by how many on

       (or any one person) is gonna be a savior.

       I do not think that he is a good candidate on any sort of absolute scale. Just maybe that he was not part of the criminal cabal that directly seeks our destruction and enslavement. But it is not like that little bit of hope makes me operate any differently, didn't vote for him and don't actively support him and remain suspicious of him.

       Some of them, but most of Obama's support came from increased African-American and youth turnout. The time to be nice to the deplorables was before they made America the laughing-stock of the world and politically set us back 25 years.

       Trump has dedicated himself to repealing all of Obama's executive actions, repealing the ACA, cutting taxes, building a wall with Mexico, lowering personal and corporate taxes and raising new trade barriers. It is like a platform from the early 20th century. You know what? Life during the early 20th century sucked for everyone, compared to modern life. So how about instead of going back to that shit, we go forward with a 21st century government, that believes in things like science, human rights for all citizens, and facts.

      <p>
       The current "riots" are nothing compared to what happened when America was
       <del>
        racist
       </del>
       "great", although I am sure Trump will be able to turn the clock back on that. It turns out when you treat a third of the country like dirt, make it impossible for them to afford healthcare, education, housing or food, they get pissed. They are a symptom of systematic oppression, which Trump's election will push to new levels.

       If Trump is a NWO globalist/puppet, it means his whole campaign, including media bashing, was a remarkably planned and executed psychological operation against the American public. If true,
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nqik3/we_are_witnessing_the_birth_of_seconddegree/">
        this takes the conspiracy to a whole new level
       </a>
       . Many cannot bear this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a contention: the longer since having awoken, the more likely you are to be skeptical of Trump. Recent awakees are more ardent Trump supporters. Many even have awoken because of the Trump campaign (see # of subscribers of this sub). If anything that will have been a great thing.

       I trust based on actions. So far he has said a lot of great things. Things that have awoken the anger in the average person, and motivated them. He had savaged the mainstream media, publicly, and repeatedly. He has personally worked 20 hour days making tons of phone calls and meetings with companies to bring them back to America or stop them from leaving, and has had immense success so far, even before he was inaugurated. He had gotten other companies to invest billions of dollars into building factories here in the US. He spoke out about Suadi Arabia being heavily involved in 9/11. He has called for auditing the federal reserve. It goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, he has said and promoted things I find abhorrent, like increased surveillance, torture, and further erosion of privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am overall very pleased with his overall message and attempts, but I will be watching closely, and if he goes sideways, I will spend the next 4 years doing anything I can to help get him out of office.

       The Dems, and by extension a majority of liberals, have been 99% co-opted by neocons at this point. Just like the GOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you doubt that, ask yourself why the general reaction to Trump saying he wants detente with Russia has been hysteria about the "threat to the World Order" and similar Totalitarian newspeak. Even up to the point of talking about a military response against "Russian cyberattack" and/or a CIA backed removal of the now-inaugurated President.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's what one of the, if not THE, keystones of Neocon ideology is: US/NATO global hegemony, the "uni-polar world order".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I doubt many of these liberals think of themselves as Neocons, but that doesn't change the facts about the policies they are endorsing.

       These nutters plan things years and years in advance. They own the media - they can orchestrate faux outrage at trump. The other candidates folded against him, with not much of a whimper. The DNC planned to elevate him as a "pied piper candidate." He loves Israel and firmly believes crazy box cutter wielding musslims took down the towers.

       I'm afraid such justifications are increasingly akin to wishful thinking. Trump hasn't killed anyone yet, so let's wait and see. The key is what he'll do when the economic/monetary calamity arrives. If he defaults on the odious US public debt, confiscates foreign gold at the NY Fed (as a fee for services rendered), dissolves the Federal Reserve System, institutes a gold-backed dollar 2.0 (with a preferential exchange rate for Americans and fuck the Chinese), he's a real nationalist/populist. This would plunge the world into a short-lived depression, but America would be thus leading the 21st century, and the NWO would be gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he signs the US into a new, improved, benevolent, multipolar (global) money system (Bretton Woods 2.0), he's a sell out globalist. If so, question remains how many will believe him when he'll say "i negotiated a great deal".
      </p>
      <p>
       If 911 2.0 strikes first, I fear he'll take us to the

       Bear in mind that the spillover from r/The_Dumbass and 4chan mostly doesn't believe the conspiracy theories they push, be they pizzagate, Hillary being a devil worshipper or Obama being a secret atheist Kenyan Muslim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their job is to spread disinformation and lies to help their candidate, Trump. Look at the number of stupid Americans who believe Hillary is a "globalist elite" but Trump, a literal billionaire who's made his fortune off globalism, is going to fix things. You couldn't make this shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who took over this sub only care about winning at all costs, even if it means flat out lying. A good example is a top post on r/The_Dumbass, which was a poorly Photoshopped photo of Trump's inauguration crowd made to look much bigger than it actually was. Do you think most of the people upvoting actually think it's a real photo? No, but their objective is to fight facts with lies and muddy the water - aka disinformation, Soviet style.

       1-Casino owners are people don't care about humanity, society or "the future of our nation" 2-Israel is the best way to "test" a person, an organization, a media outlet, ..etc Anybody supports Israel is either a complete RETARD ...or extremely EVIL. (or both). Some politicians might claim they support Israel to save their own political career (or lives) or for diplomatic reasons, but you can't say that about Trump, Trump (&amp; his family) are an Israel supporters, EVEN before getting into politics. 3-his TV show, teaches selfishness, heartlessness, greed, ..etc 4-Anybody runs Beauty pageants, doesn't care about family/human values 5-three wives five kids, not counting girlfriends and harassment 6-focuses on issues "simple minded people" worry and care about such as immigration/Islam ..etc instead of focusing on the real reasons we have wars and economy collapse ..etc it's unethical to use the stupidness, hate, anger, fear, racism, cluelessness, ignorance of people to your advantage and misleading them on it 7- doesn't care about the environment 8- does not care about the world and humanity ...among many other things

       Well the conspiracy Conspiracy seems to make the most sense. What better way to dillude the truth than to mix it with jargain. Its not too hard to compromise an online thread with a little influence. Hell half of us could be bots spouting bullshit opinions to fill the air, and up voting key topics. It took me less than 7 seconds to make this account, and i could make another too.

       Absolutely not. I think his ties to Epstein, which stem back to 2011 court dates, says a lot about who has blackmail on him and how controlled he can be.

       I keep posting this as much as I can, and its been pretty ignored so far. But the implications of involvement with Epstein, is involvement with the Clintons, is involvement with the CIA, is involvement with the string pullers of the deep state. He pulled his punches on Clinton in the election cycle, because they had easy dirt on him. If he doesn't cooperate, they already have enough dirt to force his hand.

       I didn't like Trump, Hillary or Sanders tbh. Trump and Hillary (and both VP choices) are affiliated with Jesuits. Both Trump and Clinton have kids married to Jews. Sanders fell all over Pope Francis like a fan boy, and him being Jewish has to make me wonder if he would be able to deal with Israel without having a conflict of interest. I have a FB account (I know, I know). It's amazing how so many people are viciously defending Trump against links that anger them. Nobody is arguing with their support for Trump with comments. It's a bunch of angry circlejerking.

       I don't trust him at all.  But what happens is the left keeps attacking him with such weak bullshit that you end up defending him a bunch and sounding like a supporter.  It's a really tough line to walk because you're constantly having to preface every sentence with "I'm not a Trump supporter, but...".
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially with the Russia stuff.  How the fuck did the media get people on the left, that all claimed to oppose the Iraq war, to want war with fucking Russia and criticize the desire to have a good relationship with them?  So then, if you don't want WW3 you're somehow a Trump supporter.  It's really the weirdest fucking thing.

       i dont TRUST any president, or politician. its not our role to TRUST them, we hold them ACCOUNTABLE. The government is supposed to work FOR the people, there isn't any TRUST necessary, its a business transaction and if they dont do the job well they get fired. Trust is not part of the equation.

       I trust him at least as much as I would trust anyone, if not more. I do believe he is sincere. I don't see him as evil, selfish maybe but who isn't, and not conspiratorial. From what he says and what his friends say about him, he is the real deal.

       I don't so much not trust him as I don't expect much from him. I don't fall for the misinformation about him, but I don't give him much benefit of the doubt. I just think he doesn't really have a plan. He needs his cabinet to tell him what should be done and what's going on in the world.

       I've been reading through most of the posts here. I think we l need to be really skeptical, cautious, and mindful of what the next few weeks and months will look like. I'm saddened that most of the people here keep pushing him down our throats, calling people out as shills, etc. I've read everything Pizzagate and think Soros is shady, Hillary is not innocent, Obama has skeletons in the closet, AND that Trump will not be draining the swamp. This whole anti-establishment / he tried to infiltrate the top circles to destroy it from within / he will make America great again sounds a lot like a Batman plot to me. I'd rather check how his bank account has continued to grow despite filing bankruptcy, how his cabinet members are high ranking private company executives, how he would act in office, and how he would act around foreign dignitaries. Just a note though, it's not binary - not because I question Trump means I do not question Hillary or won't question her if she has been President. That's the point of being on a conspiracy sub. It's the ability to question, to dig, to investigate, and to validate certain things people claim. It is not to keep reminding me daily than he is the lesser of two evils.

       Trump is an insane word-salad narcissist.  He won because money is the only thing that matters
       <em>
        at all

       now.  Our government is a zombie corpse just going through the motions while bits of it fall off.  There is no saving us from what is coming.

       These new neo-liberals are super annoying, but no, I dont trust Trump either, and he is sleezy. After a day, he did a bunch of things I like though, and they are things liberals 10 years ago would applaud. (I voted GJ)

       This is a very disparate group, and there is never going to be any sort of consensus amongst us.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have their own agendas.  In my many years on this sub, I've interacted with:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        false flag people
       </li>
       <li>
        Pizzagate and anti-Clinton
       </li>
       <li>
        anti-vaxxers
       </li>
       <li>
        survivalists and anti-gun-control
       </li>
       <li>
        Elders of Zion/Rothschild
       </li>
       <li>
        UFO contactees
       </li>
       <li>
        9/11 truthers
       </li>
       <li>
        communists, socialists and antifa
       </li>
       <li>
        anarchists
       </li>
       <li>
        anti "one world government" people
       </li>
       <li>
        free energy
       </li>
       <li>
        holocaust denial
       </li>
       <li>
        climate change denial
       </li>
       <li>
        skeptics/debunkers
       </li>
       <li>
        more I can't think of
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and there's a huge amount of overlap of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       More, many of these areas overlap with "right-wing US politics" - and the leftists here seen less hung-up about Trump, because they don't see the huge difference between him and HRC.

       I don't really trust anyone in that position but the fact that Soros and other evil people hate him has me curious. Unless it is all a big charade to keep the sheep occupied and distracted. I guess we will see what really happens over the next years. I don't expect anything to change really. Even if he (Trump) is honest, what can one man do? There are too many factors/people involved.

       Trump is obviously a rich psychopath. It will take little time for him to expose himself and the people to wake up to him. The question now is whether he will be reinstalled for 8 years or he can be stopped at 4. I imagine that with the backing of corporate america, we are looking at 8.

       This is the greatest opportunity to push TRUTH we have ever had. Choose wisely what you do with it. I feel that helping to unlocking people's minds is now much easier.

      <p>
       If he is one of us, this is the biggest game of chess in the world, and he'll need time to position his pieces.

       I'm willing to give him a chance. However if there are no signs locking up the Pedo Elite, then WE have to take it to the next level.

       No, you are not the only one! I feel exactly the same way as you do. Be ever vigilant to what he says and does. I never used to follow politics all that closely. I sure do now. Mr. Trump scares the living shit out of me!!

       You CANNOT trace an ip route across a border into an unfriendly or uncooperative country.  You have, and never will have, any idea where it goes. And every single engineer and technician in the world today knows that to be true.  At which point, you are left with "conjecture", "suspicion", judgement, and "high confidence". 
Which the Hateful Left has chosen to call "intelligence", because it deflects attention away from the obviously evil, selfish, and conspiratorial HRC.   I find it extremely disturbing that there are no calls from the Hateful Left to Lock Her Up !

       There's a fine line here. I don't trust Trump, that would be foolish, but I don't trust 'the powers that be' that were fighting tooth and nail the entire campaign to stop him from getting to power. The media, his own damn party, the left, part of the intelligence community, foreign countries media and leaders were all against him and his message. The votes forced them to accept the results. The other side of this coin is, not voting for Trump was allowing Clinton to reach power, which is the worst possible fucking thing that could've happened to this country.

       I think this is a place where it's safe to have meaningful conversations / debates about all of this. Not saying my opinion is right/wrong but you won't get banned for having a different opinion. Much like T_D is for Republicans/Trump supporters, r politics is a safe place for Dems.

       All in all its a mix of both mindsets with a distrust for big brother. His comments today about Iraq gave me pause. And it's great it's being discussed here.

       I'm hoping he follows through becomes one of the greatest presidents to be elected. I also got caught up in that same message of hope and change in 2008. Parallels yes, but I'm going to give it a chance before my opinion of him is swayed.

       So if Trump audits the Fed, deletes NAFTA closes the door on the TPP or declassified shit we all want to know, we shouldn't talk positive about it?

       A misratan militiaman killed Gaddafi, after rebels from the NTC occupied every major city in Libya, then chased him from his remaining strongholds. And Libya became more stable after he died, because their wasn't an ongoing revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the
       <a href="http://www.refworld.org/docid/53182eed4.html">
        UN Human Rights Commision
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        significant quantities of sarin were used in a well-planned indiscriminate attack targeting civilian-inhabited areas, causing mass casualties. The evidence available concerning the nature, quality and quantity of the agents used on 21 August indicated that the perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the Syrian military, as well as the expertise and equipment necessary to manipulate safely large amount of chemical agents.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So yeah, Assad or his allies used Sarin Gas. You should read through the report, it lists other atrocities they committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media has been wrong about some things, certainly, but in this case, what they say is backed by plenty of evidence, from reputable bodies like UNHRC. I actually do do research, unlike you, and instead of linking to a CBS anchor talking about how Assad said he didn't use chemical weapons, I linked to an investigation which shows he did. I would like to see any real evidence Obama ever funded ISIS, although I don't think you will find any, considering he didn't.

       I get that you love Trump because he is stupid like you, but this sub is supposed to be about critical thinking, so maybe you should do so.

       The rules there are too restrictive for my liking.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I would like is basically what this sub was prior to the influx of new members within the six months that either bleed across from the_donald, complain about the current US President on the grounds of cultural marxism or post to degrade this sub in general (this sub is as bad as the_donald/politics or some other sub).
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do not want, nor support, is a sub that restricts users from posting in other parts of Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sub, like this one was at one point, that enforces a 'Play the ball and not the player' method of moderation; encouraging users to discuss and debate issues where constructional criticism appears without attacking other users (because they post in sub x/y/z, have a bias they openly disclose or appeals to emotion/shaming tactics to undermine others). Take note also of the rule in the conspiracy sub about accusing others of breaking the rules, having that rule (report, do not post 'shill' accusations/etc.) would be beneficial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any sub that does that would be off to a good start IMHO.

       I don't have any recommendations for admins, nor am I interested in being a mod myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do suggest is good vetting of mods and checking their post history (ideally more than 12 months worth but Reddit only goes back x posts before archiving the rest) to get a good profile of their beliefs and opinions to ensure they aline with the goals of your sub. Keeping a firm eye on them with strong leadership will aid against infiltration from detractors aiming to derail the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good on ya for having a crack at it and good luck with your sub.
