    <div class="md"><p>&quot;For once, a book which really lives up to its title. Hall self-published this massive tome in 1928, consisting of about 200 legal-sized pages in 8 point type; it is literally his magnum opus. Each of the nearly 50 chapters is so dense with information that it is the equivalent of an entire short book. If you read this book in its entirety you will be in a good position to dive into subjects such as the Qabbala, Alchemy, Tarot, Ceremonial Magic, Neo-Platonic Philosophy, Mystery Religions, and the theory of Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry. &quot;</p>

<p>Aleister Crowley&#39;s version of the New Age is a dark, twisted version of what the real teachings are. It led to the modern New Age Movement, and the publication of books like &#39;The Secret&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;The Secret&#39; is a new age book endorsed by celebrities like Oprah Winfrey. My belief it that it is an evil interpretation of Universal law, intended to lead people down false spiritual paths. It takes provable forms of universal manipulation, and uses them to serve ourselves exclusively.</p>

<p>It sounds like you may consider yourself a New Age follower but you&#39;re not evil, so you think that these guys are a corruption of the real teaching. </p>

<p>Yes. Well, be careful with the term &quot;occult&quot; because it doesn&#39;t always mean demonic. It just means hidden. </p>

<p>Christianity is a secret society in places where that can get you killed.</p>

<p>I go to church every week.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I read a lot about &quot;hidden&quot; things. I don&#39;t read about demonic things with any curiosity, rather it&#39;s more of a defense mechanism. And not against the demons (Jesus has authority over them), but against the followers of demons.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The Bible, yes. But most of the doctrines surrounding the Bible are totally messed up. You have to study the Bible very carefully to get a good sense of what it means.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, the Koran looks very similar to the Arian position, with some extra things thrown in (kill the infidels, etc.) Which makes sense, because Mohammed ran into Eastern Christians who were either Arian or Nestorian.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or is it more of an &quot;entheogenic induced scripture&quot; approach that you take?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s helpful to understand the culture to which it was addressed. For example, if you truly understand what idolatry is (worshiping god symbols instead of the Creator), you&#39;ll understand much of the Bible and modern society.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I just don&#39;t see the core parts of holy trinity, heaven/hell, faith, etc being remotely true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, these are all very difficult doctrines that I&#39;ve come to truly accept only after many years of study.</p>

<p>For the trinity, I think the important part to grasp is simply that Jesus is God. People have excommunicated each other over the details, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re terribly important.</p>

<p>For heaven/hell, it&#39;s basically a choice to refuse to be a decent human being. CS Lewis&#39; work &quot;The Great Divorce&quot; is close to my thinking on this. I find the idea of people being tricked into hell to be utterly horrific, and CS Lewis basically believes that everyone in hell wants to be there, and actively chooses to do so.</p>

<p>I also hold out some hope that everyone will go to heaven. Some bible verses seem to indicate this, and there&#39;s so much we don&#39;t know about the timeline. For example, the Bible says almost nothing about what happens between the time we die, and the resurrection of the dead (and there are two of these). I&#39;m guessing people have a chance to repent after death, when they have better knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just haven&#39;t read anything convincing, blind faith isn&#39;t an answer for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blind faith is horrible, don&#39;t believe anything blindly. You should believe what you are convinced is true by the evidence and your reasoning and intuition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was there any specific part that was adequate proof for you? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a bunch of Old Testament prophecies written centuries before Jesus that describe intimate details of the life of the Messiah. Jesus fulfilled dozens of these, including things like where he would be born, the tribe and lineage, etc.</p>

<p>There have been some excellent religious and philosophical teachers over human history (and I read many of them), but nothing like this, where a man fulfilled so many prophecies written many centuries before he lived.</p>

<p>Do you think versions matter or translations?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitely. My Bible that I read every day has 4 different translation across the pages to compare the text.</p>

<p>The New American standard is a more literal translation, New International is a good balance, and the New Living translation is good at conveying the thought of each passage. But the King James also accurately conveys some things that modern translators don&#39;t like to translate literally, so I use it as well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, this is incredibly important. Understanding the time period and culture in which each book was written is crucial.</p>

<p>Things have undoubtedly changed with time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a little bit, but the original manuscripts we have are actually much more in agreement than most people think. The New Testament has more manuscript evidence in its favor than any ancient book, and it&#39;s not close.</p>

<p>We have fragments and quotations from within a couple decades of the writings, whole books a few decades after, and whole New Testaments by 250 AD. Compare that to other works which often have 1000 years or more between their composition and the first copies, and you&#39;ll see the text is in good shape.</p>

<p>Dan Brown misled a lot of people on this, and spread Jesuit myths of very late dates for the Bible that had been debunked since the writings of Albert Schweitzer. Modern scholarship has taken it further, proving it virtually impossible for any of the books to have been written outside the 1st century.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t relate to the conversation in any way. It seems to me like your using my comment as an attempt to soapbox your own ideas and philosophies.</p>

<p>I never even mentioned symbols, I never even went in to detail about my own beliefs. I have my own connection to God. One that I have found through time, effort, intention and persistence - all in the name of the truth. </p>

<p>I was abused as a child. No Athiest could ever justify what happened to me. Shit happens, is the general moral code for all Athiests.

Secondly, your 3 hyper-links posted at the bottom of the page are basically mass athiest circlejerks. &quot;We are good people!&quot; is really all I can hear you crying.

If there was a God in your mind, you&#39;d be extremely angry with him. I get it. </p>

How do we know <strong>any</strong> of this material on Pythagoras is legit?
We don&#39;t really.</p>

<p>Most of Hall&#39;s sources are modern writers.
Iamblichus is an ancient &quot;source&quot; for some info on Pythagoras.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iamblichus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iamblichus</a></p>

<p>Iamblichus died in 325 AD:
&quot;Only a fraction of Iamblichus&#39; books have survived. For our knowledge of his system, we are indebted partly to the fragments of writings preserved by Stobaeus and others. The notes of his successors, especially Proclus, as well as his five extant books and the sections of his great work on Pythagorean philosophy also reveal much of Iamblichus&#39; system. &quot;</p>

<p>Sooo....we (and Manly) rely on fractions of fragments of copies from other authors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome. </p>

<p>Steiner was originally a part of Theosophy but broke away from a few reasons. One, he became more Christian in his writing (and I do suggest focusing on this later writings, especially if you are interested in Christianity.)</p>

<p>Two, Theosophists claimed that a young Indian boy, Jiddu Krishnamurti, was the Messiah. Steiner denounced this and as noted on wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Steiner quickly denied this attribution of messianic status to Krishnamurti, &gt;claiming that Christ&#39;s earthly incarnation in Jesus was a unique event. &gt;Steiner held that though the human being generally goes through a series of &gt;repeated earth lives, the spiritual being Christ incarnated only once in a &gt;physical body. Christ, he said, would reappear in &quot;the etheric&quot; — the realm &gt; that lives between people and in community life — not as a physical individual.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>BTW, it is worth noting that Krishnamurti denounced the claim he was the messiah too as he became an adult. His readings are also worthwhile.</p>

<p>Steiner:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Our highest endeavor must be to develop free human beings who are able of themselves to impart purpose and direction to their lives. The need for imagination, a sense of truth, and a feeling of responsibility—these three forces are the very nerve of education.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Krishnamurti:
&lt; &quot;It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming you are already familiar with traditional Christianity, I believe on the very site you linked they have Gnostic texts.  Some are &quot;new&quot; coming from findings in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Nag Hammadi library in the 20th century I believe.  I have read some myself such as &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;.  I tend to be more interested by Hermetic texts which are not linked to Christianity like Gnostic Christianity is.</p>

<p>Gnostic Christians believe in things such as the demiurge, which is the idea that the god of the Old Testament was a lesser/imperfect God and not the same God spoken of by Jesus in the New Testament.  They were deemed heresy which is why their texts are not included in the Bible canon.</p>

<p>I am currently reading the updated NASV Bible with many perspectives; one of which being that perhaps &quot;God&quot; refers to the highest God and &quot;Lord God&quot; refers to the demiurge.  This stemmed from the verse along the lines of &quot;let US create man in OUR own image&quot; along with man being created in Genesis 1 and being created again? by &quot;Lord God&quot; from dust in Genesis 2.  This very well could be heresy against God so I do not encourage people to view it this way.  I also want to note that other belief systems resonate with me highly too (we are part of the all and the all is a part of us) so I have many questions that I am still sorting out.</p>

<p>I am new to all of this but I get the feeling that Gnostic Christianity is the merging of Christianity and Greek philosophy, so I tend to stick to the Bible canon.  The Book of Enoch may be worth a read.</p>

<p>You should be warned that many Gnostic and Hermetic translations you find online are by GRS Mead, a theosophist.  I find Theosophy to be a shady group but that doesn&#39;t mean they are all bad.  You may want to research Theosophy for yourself and make your own judgements.</p>

<p>I also recommend becoming familiar with the timeline of early Christianity up until the Roman emperor Constantine declared it as the religion for the empire.  You will find many on this sub who feel that Christianity was altered by the Romans but I do not feel that way based on the timeline, historical data, and when the New Testament texts were created.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would recommend reading the canon Bible if you have not already.  I am not too sure about what the best version is but I decided on the updated NASV (New American Standard Version) because it is one of the most literal translations.  Tougher to read but I am more interested in accuracy.  Someone on here a while back posted an online translation of the Aramaic Bible I believe it was that is probably even more literal.</p>

<p>Others on here may have better advice and I am new to this material similar to you.  I think that it might be best to start where you think you should start.  I asked God to show me the truth and I found some of the truth.  In fact, coming upon this sub Reddit I would consider to be a part of that (shout out to all the great posters and researchers out there).  I believe everyone has their own life path and that mine is probably different from yours.  I believe it means the most when you find out things for yourself.  I search within for the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps truths was not the best word for me to use.  Strong beliefs is probably better.</p>

<p>To condense it down so I don&#39;t ramble too much, I had a &quot;dark night of the soul&quot;.  I thought to myself, &quot;I&#39;d rather not exist than to exist,&quot; as I care little about the material world.  It was an empty place to me where I had more negative feelings towards it than positive ones.</p>

<p>I had been studying Hermeticism at the time.  I had recently read &quot;The Kybalion&quot;, which is likely a work of Theosophy that covers the Hermetic principles.  They are all very profound for me.  One of them is the Principle of Polarity: everything has its opposite.  Then I remembered that suicide was an evil act; negative polarity.  I would have also caused great pain for my family; also negative polarity.  I like to think that I am a good person so negative polarity goes against who I am.</p>

<p>I decided, &quot;Alright, I will just live out my life doing what I think is good in the world and continue to seek truth.&quot;  This life is infinitely short compared to infinity that is referred to in the beliefs I believe in.  Christianity tells you the same.</p>

<p>I felt a rush go through me.  Perhaps it is what is meant by being filled by the Holy Spirit.  I was &quot;born again&quot; in Christian terms though as I mentioned, I harbor affinities to other beliefs still.  People here usually call it a spiritual awakening.</p>

<p>To this day, that feeling arises inside me when I think of something that has a very high positive polarity.  One of these things would be reading verses by Jesus, for example.  Even as I write this, I can feel it as I can tell that you are on a similar path in some ways that I was.  I have come to learn on my own that it is what you may see people refer to on here, including myself, as increasing your vibration.</p>

<p>This gave me an actual physical indicator.  This is one of the reasons my next path is opening my third eye for an increased perspective.</p>

<p>So that is how I was able to strengthen some of my spiritual beliefs.</p>

<p>It also has led me here to learn about the darkness that I think is tied to the PizzaGate scandal.  I think that in the material world, if you are evil and get away with it, you can have tremendous power over the material world.  Capitalism is driven by greed at its core.  When I saw that Satanism, which I thought was some minor cult at the time, may be tied to it, it hit me that the highest people in the government may be aligned with the most evil.  That, coupled with how all mainstream media suppressed it despite a high amount of circumstantial evidence in my opinion, made me realize the manipulative power that may be at the top.</p>

<p>Further research here has really gave credence to the story in the Book of Revelation and I can see how it can come to pass.  There is tremendous evil in this world but I believe that there exists a positive counter force.  Perhaps that is represented by the second coming of Jesus Christ.  You may be surprised to find Christians on this sub that I consider to be &quot;woke&quot; to throw out a meme and to lighten the mood a bit.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should have been more clear.  I meant that I believe that the writings that are in the canon Bible were not altered by Rome.  Which books are included in the Bible are impacted by denomination like Roman Catholicism, for example.</p>

<p>Thanks for the information on this.  I was under the impression that the early church (pre-Constantine) decided the Gnostic texts were heresy.  I will look into this again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I believe about the esoteric teachings is this: they can be used for good or for evil.  From what I have seen, the likes of Crowley used them for negative purposes.  An example of this is how you hear about black magic and white magic.</p>

<p>I also believe knowledge is power.  I choose the positive polarity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;For once, a book which really lives up to its title. Hall self-published this massive tome in 1928, consisting of about 200 legal-sized pages in 8 point type; it is literally his magnum opus. Each of the nearly 50 chapters is so dense with information that it is the equivalent of an entire short book. If you read this book in its entirety you will be in a good position to dive into subjects such as the Qabbala, Alchemy, Tarot, Ceremonial Magic, Neo-Platonic Philosophy, Mystery Religions, and the theory of Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully appreciate you bringing this to the community. A little forewarning though, their is a lot of conflicting information in esotericism. It is all based in truth, but people&#39;s perspective are manipulated to believe that we should worship ourselves, entities and essentially anything that isn&#39;t </p>

<p>Aleister Crowley&#39;s version of the New Age is a dark, twisted version of what the real teachings are. It led to the modern New Age Movement, and the publication of books like &#39;The Secret&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;The Secret&#39; is a new age book endorsed by celebrities like Oprah Winfrey. My belief it that it is an evil interpretation of Universal law, intended to lead people down false spiritual paths. It takes provable forms of universal manipulation, and uses them to serve ourselves exclusively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming you are already familiar with traditional Christianity, I believe on the very site you linked they have Gnostic texts.  Some are &quot;new&quot; coming from findings in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Nag Hammadi library in the 20th century I believe.  I have read some myself such as &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;.  I tend to be more interested by Hermetic texts which are not linked to Christianity like Gnostic Christianity is.</p>

<p>Gnostic Christians believe in things such as the demiurge, which is the idea that the god of the Old Testament was a lesser/imperfect God and not the same God spoken of by Jesus in the New Testament.  They were deemed heresy which is why their texts are not included in the Bible canon.</p>

<p>I am currently reading the updated NASV Bible with many perspectives; one of which being that perhaps &quot;God&quot; refers to the highest God and &quot;Lord God&quot; refers to the demiurge.  This stemmed from the verse along the lines of &quot;let US create man in OUR own image&quot; along with man being created in Genesis 1 and being created again? by &quot;Lord God&quot; from dust in Genesis 2.  This very well could be heresy against God so I do not encourage people to view it this way.  I also want to note that other belief systems resonate with me highly too (we are part of the all and the all is a part of us) so I have many questions that I am still sorting out.</p>

<p>I am new to all of this but I get the feeling that Gnostic Christianity is the merging of Christianity and Greek philosophy, so I tend to stick to the Bible canon.  The Book of Enoch may be worth a read.</p>

<p>You should be warned that many Gnostic and Hermetic translations you find online are by GRS Mead, a theosophist.  I find Theosophy to be a shady group but that doesn&#39;t mean they are all bad.  You may want to research Theosophy for yourself and make your own judgements.</p>

<p>I also recommend becoming familiar with the timeline of early Christianity up until the Roman emperor Constantine declared it as the religion for the empire.  You will find many on this sub who feel that Christianity was altered by the Romans but I do not feel that way based on the timeline, historical data, and when the New Testament texts were created.</p>
