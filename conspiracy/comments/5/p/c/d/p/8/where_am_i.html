        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At this point, I&#39;m confused, right? </p>

<p>Okay, let me think about how to put this in a way I&#39;m going to understand it. </p>

<p>You wrote this to yourself. You don&#39;t remember it because you haven&#39;t remembered it yet.</p>

<p>Start thinking about the smallest thing you can remember. 
A grain of sand? Smaller. 
An atom? Smaller.
An electron? Smaller.
There we go. Now, there are scientific words to each of these things, but ultimately, words don&#39;t matter, so let&#39;s explain this in the simplest way possible. </p>

<p>There are only two things that make up everything in our universe. </p>

<p>One is physical; it only exists in three-dimensional space. Scientists call this a fermion, a fancy science name for a &quot;firm&quot; particle. These make up the rules that bind our universe together. Gravity, life, death, time, space, there are some rules that cannot be broken. </p>

<p>There are two types of firm particles. The first type is a gate. Scientists call it a quark, but let&#39;s call it a &quot;reality&quot; particle. If the gate is opened, space and time break. You owe your existence to it. Everything you are, taste, see, hear, smell, or feel would not exist without the gate.
Imagine a beam of light that never shines on anything. This is you without the gate. 
Respect the gate. It was put there so you can exist.</p>

<p>The second type of firm particle is a gift. Scientists call them leptons. Let&#39;s call them &quot;hyper reality&quot; particles. These particles make up electricity: your thoughts, radio and TV signals, the internet, the way you can look at these symbols on this page and understand what you wrote instead of seeing a bunch of squiggly lines. It is all the same thing. Leptons, or hyper-reality particles, carry all the thoughts of the universe. </p>

<p>And then, there&#39;s another type of particle. They exist in three dimensional space, but at the same time, they don&#39;t. They are the particles that reside between &quot;reality&quot; particles. They are the particles that make up light. They are what creates a wave. Scientists call them bosons. They aren&#39;t called &quot;firm&quot; particles because more than one of them can occupy the same space and time. How is this possible?</p>

<p>Fold up a piece of paper two or three times, and stick a pencil through it. How many pencils are there? There is still one pencil. But if you existed in a two-dimensional world along the piece of paper, you would see several slices of pencil, each with different shapes, sizes, and characteristics than the next. We believe there are countless bosons, using their vibrations and the rules set by the &quot;firm&quot; particles to drive the universe forward. But really, there is only one boson. </p>

<p>Have I thought more about where I am?</p>

<p>Look in the mirror. Are you in your eyes? Or in your brain? If you could pinpoint the location of you, could you? What&#39;s driving this crazy thing?</p>

<p>There are only two things that make up everything in this universe. One is physical. The other is you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Language only exists in hyper-reality. Hyper reality is abstract, malleable, and only tangentially relevant to physical reality. Human? Homo sapiens sapiens? Mortal? The words and categories change, the reality does not. Semantic discussion is as purposeful as thinking about creating  something and never creating it. What has been accomplished through thought and inaction?</p>

Don&#39;t let anyone- including me- control what you think. You have to make sure that reality and your perception of reality do not diverge. That is happening across our society right now, unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reminds me of <a href="http://imgur.com/ptGDWSB">this </a> image from the Bhagavad Gita. The horses are our senses. The senses are driven by the conscious perception of self, what we&#39;d call the conscious amalgamation of all of our sensory reactions to this reality. </p>

<p>At the back of the chariot is our soul, our unconscious life force that continues as life energy after the corporeal senses are gone. </p>

<p>We are simultaneously everywhere and nowhere as we control the chariot; the chariot serves as the metaphorical understanding that when we learn to better control the horses, the passenger has a more comfortable trip. </p>
