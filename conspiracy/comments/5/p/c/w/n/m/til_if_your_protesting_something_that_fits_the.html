    <div class="md"><p>I think he&#39;s right as far as Trump&#39;s #1 objective in any social situation: say whatever you can to impress, ridicule, or hope your ridicule is seen as impressive. He plays to an audience at all times, tailors sentiments, says what those he wants to win over want to hear. </p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s still a quote admitting and promoting forceful sexual assault, defined and defended by apologists of the activity as simply &quot;making a move.&quot; The gist of that shit-talking was consent is not necessary, and the more powerful/rich/impressive you are, the less it even pops into your mind. And that beautiful women always enjoy it.   </p>

<p>I am glad I am in the precense of an intelligent person.</p>

<p>Your comment is actually pretty incoherent, but not only did Trump say that, but he didn&#39;t apologize or seem to think saying that was unacceptable. Also, you lose credibility when you talk about how you would have sex with your teen daughter if she wasn&#39;t related to you, and imported a eastern European model 24 younger than for your third marriage. And I don&#39;t see what your fantasy about Podesta has to do with Trump being a despicable womanizer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either way, I still think Occupy Wall Street had a huge impact on the conversation about economic inequality and promoted awareness for so many people about the political and media establishment. For example, I was 14-15 when Occupy Wall Street happened and I didn&#39;t know anything about politics, but because I spent a huge amount of time on the internet (like most teenagers) I came away with the impression that Occupy Wall Street was cool and the 1% was greedy. It was a simplistic takeaway, but ultimately shaped my political views much later. I guess my point is, marches and protests are still worthwhile, regardless of media attention or establishment support.</p>
