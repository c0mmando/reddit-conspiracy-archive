        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m a small government, closed border conservative. I&#39;m a pretty skeptical guy; I don&#39;t believe in chemtrails, I don&#39;t think 9/11 was an inside job (though I don&#39;t rule out the prior knowledge theory), I&#39;m certain we went to the moon, and I&#39;m 100% certain that most vaccines are okay (HPV vaccine has been proven to be bad for children, but why the fuck do they keep pimping it?!). </p>

<p>But I have zero trust for the alphabet soup agencies, I know that there have been a LOT of conspiracies from the CIA and NSA and other alphabet soup agencies. I am pretty sure that the CIA assassinated JFK (possibly in connection to him rejecting Operation Northwoods), not to mention Operation Mockingbird (which is still fucking going on no matter what they say), Gulf of Tonkin, the Nayirah testimony preceding the Gulf War, COINTELPRO, etc. etc. ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Army veteran, I know for a FACT that freemasons are rife in the Army at least, maybe other branches (though not usually in combat MOS&#39;s). </p>

<p>I&#39;m a skeptic at heart, but I have seen too much weird shit lately to stay quiet; I&#39;ve been lurking for a while, but what really clenched it was the &quot;would you could you on a train&quot; thing that happened shortly before the Hoboken train crash in September of last year (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/55phpe/ems_hack_hours_before_nj_train_crash_could_you_on/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/55phpe/ems_hack_hours_before_nj_train_crash_could_you_on/</a>). In the post-election excitement, I had nearly forgotten about it (I was dead set against Hillary and remain a Trump fan, especially since the CIA&#39;s attempted hit with the &quot;muh Russians&quot; tie), but was reminded by some random thing earlier today.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to insult this sub, I&#39;m just wondering if I&#39;d be a good fit? I used to ghost-write for a relative on a paranormal/conspiracy website ($20 bucks an article lol), but I&#39;ve become more skeptical since my military and real world experience. However, I still am inquisitive and I am a big fan of &quot;cum grano salis&quot; as a life philosophy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m here to consort and hopefully find out more stuff about the CIA and most importantly #pizzagate, which was immediately jumped on by the MSM, dismantled by reddit admins, and never fully investigated. Like, that seems SUPER fishy to me that it was shouted down at its inception without any investigation. Clearly there&#39;s something in those podesta leaks, especially with the Epstein connection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was an inside job. It was more than that. It was a ritual. </p>

<p>Construction of The Pentagon began on 9/11/1941, under FDR, a 32nd degree freemason. </p>

<p>The WTC complex was built using masonic symbology. The most obvious piece of evidence to this claim is that it mimics King Solomon&#39;s temple. WTC 7 was owned by Salomon Brother&#39;s, and was oftened referred to as the Salomon building or Salomon Brother&#39;s building. Outside of Solomon&#39;s temple stood 2 great pillars, Jachin and Boaz. Google these names and you will see the connection to the Masons</p>

<p>Just figured Id show the Masonic connection, as you seem to believe they are somehow... influential, for lack of a better word. </p>

<p>Well, sure there are military Lodges, and the Freemasons that I&#39;ve known who were also current or past military speak highly of the sense of dual brotherhood that being both brothers in arms and brothers in Freemasonry can give...</p>

<p>But how does this bear on conspiracy? It&#39;s like saying, &quot;I know for a fact that Materialists are rife within the army!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me take each of those in turn:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there&#39;re a lot of theories about the Freemasons</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. there are a lot of theories about any group that claims to be seeking to improve themselves. I think that speaks more of the theorist than the theoree (if that&#39;s a word :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the &quot;New World Order&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the idea of the New World Order has become far too mythologized. We arm-wave at that phrase as if it should concretely mean something, and yet never do more than attach it to the conspiracy theory du jour.</p>

<p>There are dozens of individual &quot;New World Orders&quot; that have and do exist. Everyone has their own &quot;perfect future&quot; they want to work toward and some even get the chance to try putting some of it into reality (sometimes with positive outcomes, sometimes horrific). But if, by that, you mean some monolithic conspiracy of powerful individuals... I&#39;ve only known a few such folks in my life, but I can tell you that they don&#39;t play nice together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and they promote their own a lot, while passing up non-Masons for promotion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve never observed this, and I&#39;ve met an awful lot of fellow Masons in my travels around my jurisdiction and others. Sure, a Brother might mention that he&#39;s out of work and someone else asks for his resume to hand around at work. Especially in this day and age when most companies offer a referral bonus, I see this in Freemasonry, in  book clubs, online meetups, etc.</p>

<p>But as for &quot;passing up non-Masons&quot; that would truly shock me. The bonds created within the Fraternity are profound, but some random Mason who happened to be at my company would get no more consideration from me, professionally, than his work merited.</p>
