       There has never been so much division... t_d is blindly partisan (going as far as calling their candidate god emperor); altright is blatantly racist and calls t_d not extreme enough; politics is a homogenized voice; the 'left' is being pulled into justifying and defending increased extremism and violence, and more..
      </p>
      <p>
       But you guys resisted the pressures from all directions, and kept on focus. The problems that plague us are war, economy, monetary policy, the military and intelligence industrial complex, and more. And the rest of reddit is falling for distractions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I, myself, am glad to see you guys stick to the issues that matter.  I've been on this sub for half a decade, and it's one of the most consistent places around. Keep it up!

       I'm not sure what it is, but I'm grateful. It does fall victim to baiting at times, but the community bounces back. Also, somehow, the mods have resisted being taken over like the mod-base of like every other sub. Not sure how.

       The seeds of division are being successfully sowed it seems. Earlier the sub was being brigaded. Someone posted, "the MSM is glorifying a woman who tortured and murdered 
a man", and the top post was someone first framing it as revenge against someone who raped her as a child (even though her victim was a complete stranger), and then framed it as, "well, the victim deserved it anyway". A lie, followed by glorification of murder just because the accused "is on our side" re: this increasingly radical identity politics.

       It became a rollercoaster ride. The poster's glorification of violence was massively upvoted (500 and rising) but every post was calling it out for its lie. Eventually, it got deleted, and you folks all held strong.  We are being turned against each other, rather than the real threats to our security and quality of life. And where most subs falter, you guys haven't. Thanks,

       If you think that was bad, were you here for the Buzzfeed pissgate brigade? That one stuck for days and the remnants are still felt. And the fluoride post that made it to r/all was heavily brigaded too. It's really fascinating how quickly threads are turned to shit when minutes before, they were coherent and civilized discussion.

       Interesting. I think most people here are aware of TPTB's divide and conquer tactics and will not fall for them. Sometimes I see people falling into their traps and it bums me out. I just want to yell at them "THEY ARE PLAYING YOU LIKE A FIDDLE! CAN'T YOU SEE?!" It's funny though, some of the same people who claim to be "woke" fall into the divide and conquer trap. And I just sit there looking at them thinking, I thought you were woke?

       A lot of the sub seems divided because of the increasing amount of new people in the sub. I hope that after a few months, the heavy anti Trump PR effort supported by the MSM might die down, and everyone can take a deep breath, take a step back, and look at the big picture. There has been a lot of new information about the establishment to come out in the last year, and the MSM has blinded with distractions the whole time. I'm not sure how much or if they might let up, but I hope they do so that folks can see what's going on.
