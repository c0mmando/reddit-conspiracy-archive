<p>Now these things are coming out, so they obviously dominate the page. </p>

<p>I feel bad for people who used this sub to talk about aliens or Antartica but can&#39;t you see why those theories are being somewhat ignored?</p>

<p>It&#39;s the mainstream media&#39;s fault for labeling investigative journalists conspiracy theorists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. While I lean right, I hate seeing every Trump headline posted here. The only Trump related conspiracies we should be seeing relate to pizzag8, actual Russia evidence (the Flynn investigation is notable, until it isn&#39;t), or him starting the 10th Crusade as predicted by Jewish mysticism, or maybe the lawsuit that David Brock just filed.</p>

<p>Nothing about Obamacare or a pussy parade or a press conference or inauguration numbers or what some talking head is spewing; just evidence of the TPTB and the real war happening out of the public eye.</p>

If everyone does that and upvotes those post I would hope OP&#39;s get the message.  About the only thing you can do to clean up a sub when Mod&#39;s leave it a free for all.</p>

<p>Now these things are coming out, so they obviously dominate the page. </p>

<p>I feel bad for people who used this sub to talk about aliens or Antartica but can&#39;t you see why those theories are being somewhat ignored?</p>

<p>It&#39;s the mainstream media&#39;s fault for labeling investigative journalists conspiracy theorists. </p>

<p>Be mad at the elites, not the posters on this sub.</p>
