       Aren't there political topic debate forums all over the internet with which to engage in these discussions? "Counterculture" views and opinions are not relevant here, but apparently are so popular that they dominate TOP on a daily basis. Conceivable conspiracies and developing theories barely make it out of NEW unless they happen to align with the political bias of the non-conspiracy posts beside them.

       Or the age where those who've propagated them, applied their basic tenants to apparent present threats, and used their allure and projections have come into power on the strength of Fear, the uncertainty of the Unknown, and apprehension about an unclear future. This is in and of itself a sort of replacement conspiracy actually taking effect.

       Some of the main conspiracies were that the elites traffic women, children, and drugs, perform strange rituals, did 9/11, have total control over the media, and use fluoride against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now these things are coming out, so they obviously dominate the page.

       I feel bad for people who used this sub to talk about aliens or Antartica but can't you see why those theories are being somewhat ignored?

       It's the mainstream media's fault for labeling investigative journalists conspiracy theorists.

       I would go as far as to say that other topics are also regularly talked about when new stuff comes out, just not everyday. In the past months, antarctica was discussed multiple times and aliens too, I feel like the "we should talk about more aliums, not politics" is the new concern trolling.

       Ya I mean main stream press says Trump is a Russian puppet pissy pussy rapist. It's officially a conspiracy that he's human.

       TPP WAS a corporate conspiracy. Having Trump knock it down is badass - granted that's technically politics but it's not like you can have a sensible discussion elsewise.

       It's because the entire US edifice is a massive, out of control conspiracy, not to mention the US has corrupted and seized control of most other nations' government.  All managed by 98% owned and controlled media.  One of Trump's first acts should be to smash (((media))) monopolies.  And as jews claim to comprise less than .2% of the world's population, it makes sense for jews to own and control no more than .2% of the world's media, beginning with the US

       What are you implying btw? That some cabal decided this sub had been doing something poorly and out of the kindness of their hearts have set out to correct it? As opposed to that posts were pointing out consistently interesting things and now the dull and mundane have replaced them to suppress them....

       I think views and opinions are so popular here because people will actually give them a intellectual conversation or debate. Compared to posting on
       <a href="/r/Politics">
        /r/Politics
       </a>
       or some other politics fourm where everyone is a mindless idiot. Also this sub has a control over shills compared to other subs. In my opinion (which  doesn't mean anything) I enjoy posting and reading opinions since I can have a intelligent conversation with most people.

       Perhaps there should be a sub-sub-reddit exclusively for ideological/political discussion, but instead it's the mixture of opinion and conspiracy that dominates here, and certainly makes me doubt the validity of one another.

       Agreed. While I lean right, I hate seeing every Trump headline posted here. The only Trump related conspiracies we should be seeing relate to pizzag8, actual Russia evidence (the Flynn investigation is notable, until it isn't), or him starting the 10th Crusade as predicted by Jewish mysticism, or maybe the lawsuit that David Brock just filed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing about Obamacare or a pussy parade or a press conference or inauguration numbers or what some talking head is spewing; just evidence of the TPTB and the real war happening out of the public eye.

       I came here during the election, and realized it was one of the only places left where I could find real discussion of the news. Real news, even. If there are others like me, we're looking for a space that respects intelligent conversation about topics that matter. We're looking for a forum that defaults to critiquing sources. So, yes, not strictly conspiracy, but the mindset of this subreddit is what brings people here. The sanity of conspiracy is what keeps them here.

       I think a lot of us want conspiracies to see the real world and not just be on TV and books, we crave that someone is going to come along and expose these issues and for us Trump seems like the best chance we have had in a very long time.

       One could argue that politics has become more conspiracy rather than fact these days. It's 1984 in reality, with a sprinkling of Brave New World, and just a smidgen of I-Robot.

       I understand that Mods don't like to delete threads because people in this sub don't like it. Thus I post in lots of threads that this ISN'T a conspiracy. If everyone does that and upvotes those post I would hope OP's get the message.  About the only thing you can do to clean up a sub when Mod's leave it a free for all.

       Some of the main conspiracies were that the elites traffic women, children, and drugs, perform strange rituals, did 9/11, have total control over the media, and use fluoride against us.

       Now these things are coming out, so they obviously dominate the page.

       I feel bad for people who used this sub to talk about aliens or Antartica but can't you see why those theories are being somewhat ignored?

       It's the mainstream media's fault for labeling investigative journalists conspiracy theorists.

       Be mad at the elites, not the posters on this sub.

       All I'm saying is the same people who are criticizing the decision to destroy the TPP or who are ignoring the significance of it are the same people who'd be having a parade if Obama was the one to do it
