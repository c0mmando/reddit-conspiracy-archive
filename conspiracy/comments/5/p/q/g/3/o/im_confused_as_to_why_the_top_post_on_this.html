       I think it's because a lot of people still think of the world as "us and them" and right now Trump is, for most of those people, is firmly in the "us" camp. Therefore, anyone protesting trump is "them".

       No, it's anything supported by the MSM is "them." The MSM is the face of the real people in control. The CIA, corporations, whatever, the MSM is their most powerful manipulation tool. And when the MSM is so against Trump, and their coverage of the march is ridiculously sensationalized, I think a lot of folks think that this is just a way for the MSM to further their "divide and conquor" strategy. This march was not against the government. If it was, it would have happened a long time ago.

       I agree fully that it is a divide and conquer tactic. And it's the convolution of media coverage that is now making us question whether protests are real and organic or staged and really working against the progression of society. And peaceful protests were one of the better tools people had at their disposal in America

       This sub has always leaned conservative and there is a portion of conservatives who consider political and economic equality for all as threat to themselves.

       This March is anti government because the current government is a corporate war machine where this March was advocating for everything that's not that.

       Excellent point!  I used to believe, (in retrospect, I don't know why),  that the Democrats cared about the working class.  But you are absolutely correct, they do not want people to think about classes.  That could be dangerous because it would only unite people of different races, genders, and even political inclinations.

       I don't know if this sub should be in the business of "supporting" anything political.  Always ask questions and dig deeper. For example, George Soros has a history of backing anti-government protest in our countries and others, but in most cases those protests don't accomplish much for individuals living in that country but rather serve to make Mr. Soros rich. I appreciate digging deeper om these occurrences to see if we're all being duped.

       There was just nothing whatsoever "anti-government" about it. Unless you consider Soros to be a big proponent of free speech and anti-corruption.

       <p>
        Mission &amp; Vision
       </p>
       <p>
        We stand together in solidarity with our partners and children for the protection of our rights, our safety, our health, and our families - recognizing that our vibrant and diverse communities are the strength of our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        OUR MISSION
       </p>
       <p>
        The rhetoric of the past election cycle has insulted, demonized, and threatened many of us - immigrants of all statuses, Muslims and those of diverse religious faiths, people who identify as LGBTQIA, Native people, Black and Brown people, people with disabilities, survivors of sexual assault - and our communities are hurting and scared. We are confronted with the question of how to move forward in the face of national and international concern and fear.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the spirit of democracy and honoring the champions of human rights, dignity, and justice who have come before us, we join in diversity to show our presence in numbers too great to ignore. The Women’s March on Washington will send a bold message to our new government on their first day in office, and to the world that women's rights are human rights. We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us.
       </p>
       <p>
        We support the advocacy and resistance movements that reflect our multiple and intersecting identities. We call on all defenders of human rights to join us. This march is the first step towards unifying our communities, grounded in new relationships, to create change from the grassroots level up. We will not rest until women have parity and equity at all levels of leadership in society. We work peacefully while recognizing there is no true peace without justice and equity for all.
       </p>
       <p>
        HEAR OUR VOICE.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not even sure what this means. The best I can tell from these statements are that women are angry about stuff that got said during the election cycle, but there is no stated objective that is clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not bashing the event. I think it's totally fine, but don't most protests have a specific purpose? The language here is so purposefully vague that I find it off putting and questionable. To support a movement, I would like to know it's goals. I do not think that is unreasonable.

       The more I think about it, the more it seems like that is exactly what they are doing. They have 4 years to pull it together, so they hit the ground running. They claimed this march was about women, but in reality, per their website it is about women supporting minorities and marginalized peoples. The exact demographics the Dems claim stake too. 
The fact that the Soros money is behind it further tells me this is a political movement, not just a women unite for rights.

       It wasn't anti-government, if it was truly an anti-government protest they should have been protesting the fed, constant wars, corruption, the surveillance state, the two party system, lobbying, etc. The list is endless.
