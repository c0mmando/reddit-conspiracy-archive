       It's getting uglier by the second. I am seeing people attack each other  in almost every conversation. Women attacking women, men attacking  men, and so on. Are they going to start blaming dogs &amp; cats next?  It's insane.

       Perhaps that is by design. Shills being consistently divisive to the point where users become defensive, eventually going on the offense themselves. I cannot think of a better way to disrupt society than to subtly, over time, push regular conversation toward an environment filled with unexpected pitfalls of hostility.

       It seems crazy to me that people can't have a debate anymore without immediately resorting to insults.  After watching many of the Milton Friedman videos of real debates, it is honestly sad how far society has devolved. I am guilty of the the same thing, but it feels like everyone on the left goes straight to that.

       I love a good debate, its healthy to see other sides. It gives a broader perspective and eventually the best/correct side wins or you walk away and respectfully disagree. I know in politics is more my ideals vs. yours, but you get what I'm saying. But these things require respect, and from what I see, respect is long gone. Society as a whole have lost respect. Children do not respect elders, neighbors do not respect neighbors, parents don't respect teachers, employers don't respect employees, etc. everything is so self centered, they don't care about the other sides point of view. They don't want to see your side of the equation or how you got there.

       Fair enough I guess, but don't we all have some agenda? For me I love alien conspiracies and pizzagate/elite secret conspiracies. I also hate Islam and would say that's a conspiracy but it's pretty transparent about its desire to take over the world; not really a secret. I guess if by agenda to discuss aliens, elites and hate on Islam then yes I have an agenda. Also aren't shills paid money?

       This just in, users in r/Conspiracy might be a bit paranoid. More at 11.

      <p>
       But seriously, I don't Reddit a whole lot but it is curious how many new accounts I see in here posting. It's either agenda pushing or this sub creates such thought evoking ideas that people can't help but join in. I really want to believe the latter but wishing doesn't get us anywhere.

       Fair enough, I'm sure it is annoying. But, opinions are going to be pretty varied right now. There's plenty to talk about, and people want to vent their opinions on the current state of the nation. You can't police everything.

       In the press release this morning Sean Spicer said Trump will push for bilateral 1 on 1 trade deals which I hope are negotiated in both parties interests. I think we as a country will have to suck up some unpleasant realities about standards of living though ie we need to stop the glut of Walmart and amazon/ebay international luxury goods.

       The bilateral deals President Trump promised could also mean worse deals for the working class and middle class then the TPP could ever have achieved. That is what has me worried.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your a person who believes money flows down from the rich to the poor (like I believe Trump does) all the more likely your going to do a deal which is great for big business and the wealthy in each country but woeful to the middle class and working class of your and theirs countries.

       I agree. Why does "leftists" have to all be grouped together talking about supporting this? Hillary supporters and moderate dems and republicans believe in globalist trade deals. Anymore left than moderate and you begin to see people opposed to TPP and NAFTA (including myself). You're using r/politics of all subs to bash an entire group of people to fit your narrative.

       THIS!  So many Berniecrats were already against free trade deals, shit going back to Ross Perot and his “Giant Sucking Sound”, I remember well.  I absolutely despise the corporate Democrats that brought us HRC and Obama, they are all talk, telling democratic voters what they want to hear so they can then do the opposite.  People are waking up, but for sure there is a funny kind of confusion over taking many of them as they react as only Pavlov could dream.  But hey, Republican voters have been voting against their own self interest for as long as Democrats have been.  Jesus, they fell for trickle down economics, and some still defend it as a viable economic theory.  Even Bush Sr. called it out when he was running against Reagan, “voodoo economics”.  40 years later, and it’s still the basic policy of out government.  We’re pathetic as a society.

       At the risk  of sounding insulated it is maddening to go through the first few pages of reddit; especially going into threads. Only when sorting comments by controversial do I see what seem like organic replies. So if you ever feel like you're going crazy try that. like in that male abduction/torture thread (also interesting how in that same thread the top comment is wildly karma inflated with multiple guilds.) the agenda is real

       The whole idea of TPP was amazing: "Hey, if I'm going to invest in your country, I need to know that you won't suddenly elect a new government that changes the laws and thereby threatens my investment. I need a supranational board to ensure that laws passed internally by countries can be overrided otherwise it's a deterrent to international investment".

       What was obvious and scary about the TPP really for me was the fact that it was blatantly trying to circumvent other nations, specifically China, India and Russia. To me this is ridiculous that no one was outraged by the fact that it was o so obviously aggressive on our part.

       Well let's reason here: the government represents he people equally and wholly, and this plan would be negative for a lot of American workers. So I think that it's not really acting her best interests by staying in.

       Fair enough but your original point was a lot of hand wringing about America circumventing Russia and China while trying to get these countries within her orbit. Like what do you expect from Russia and China and every country? It's what they do.

       Well they are. Think about the next step: military aggression. Its the next Cold War right here if it went through. Then would go our rights in the name of 'safety'. Patriot Act is an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am saying is that it's deeper than "it's what they do". Actions have motivations and self interest has factors that shape them. Those factors in my mind are not in representation of citizens but rather those same factors have a benefit to gain from the TPP . This effect has taken the shape of the ability for companies to donate money to our politicians to get it to go through. Not even to mention compete secrecy about it and trying to rush it through. The US is trying to get around Russia and China with TPP, in the interest of big money

       I have, I don't see it. What I see are a bunch of very downvoted comments at the start of threads before the actual lefties hop in and comment about how stupid those comments are.
      </p>
      <p>
       This then puts the idea in everyone's minds that somehow the left supported the TPP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like racist comments early in a thread, and when you read the thread all the most upvoted comments are about how stupid the racist comments were, but to someone new to the thread those would be nowhere to be found.

       which is also why I suspect trump will still do TPP albeit give itself a new name since the TPP one is tainted. and do likewise with NAFTA and obamacare, keep em but give em a new name. for show. they're right wing, conservative ideas.

       Apparently you're not aware of what "nationalism vs globalism" even means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nationalism does not mean isolationism.  It means the control of international agreements is retained by the sovereign entities covered by those agreements.  This is directly opposite of globalism, which means the control of international agreements is retained by international organizations that the entities are legally beholden unto.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TPP is designed to give power to these globalist international organizations, taking it away from the nations.  Thus, with TPP you have a governing body that can tell the US they can't determine their own import taxes (neither raising or lowering) regardless of who has come into power in the most recent election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nationalism lets the involved nations directly negotiating with each other, and if the voting public of either country doesn't like it, they vote in new leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Globalism controls it via international organizations led by corporate leaders, and if the voting block doesn't like it.... Tough Shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that said, nothing in "nationalism" says or even implies that the state becomes isolationist and stops having global connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you thought ANY candidate was pushing the removal of "global connections" well, you're wrong.  The reason for that wrongness... insanity?  stupidity?  I'm sure we're about to find out.

       No. Neolibs are NOT socialists or communists. Actual socialists and communists go for people like Bernie Sanders, not scumbags like Hillary Clinton.

       I have zero respect or trust for trump, and possibly even less so for his political comrades. That said, I do try to remain hopeful because the idea that things could be better is not misleading. I see more overtly authoritarian and anti populace things coming from this administration.

       The only ppl left in the "left" are HC/NWO cabal and bots. They were defeated and are using shell of former entity to pretend they represent most Dems. They always had plenty of $ but no support (empty rallies). It's all orchestrated, FAKE, hired propaganda. (Soros supported post election protests and apparently Women's march was planned a year ago, as celebratory.)  MSM collusion is a foregone conclusion, from the DNC LEAKS. So, as Kanye said, we are being lied to.

       Eh, I've always supported it. The answer to the healthy process of noncompetitive jobs disappearing and competitive jobs appearing - also known as forward progress - shouldn't be protectionism. Without old jobs disappearing, new ones cannot appear. When cars are introduced, carriages go out of business. When machines are introduced, coal miners go out of business. That's not a bad thing, this is how it should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       People do lose their jobs, though. The American way is that when you lose your job, you lose your health insurance, and health is incredibly expensive, so if you break your leg while unemployed your life is basically over. Additionally, if you've just been fired from a closing factory in a field that doesn't exist anymore, then it'll be really hard for you to go back to work in a different field, since education costs infinity money. And if you can't find a job, you will have to rely on restricted government food programs and Fox News will berate you for eating fish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Save the people, not the ship. Let the jobs go, and arrange a safety net for the employees to continue living in a respectable way for a year or two while they learn new skills for a new job. This gives the best of two worlds - the market is kept flexible by not inhibiting fluidity in what the market is composed of, and employees aren't scared to death of losing their job.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a way, both Trump and Bernie are wrong here. Bernie won't let the ship sink, while Trump won't let the ship sink
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       won't save the sailors. I guess Trump is more wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two main issues the American economy has, by far, are the insane costs of healthcare and education. That the last elections were about any other topic boggles my mind. TPP wouldn't have been a bad thing if people could change jobs or fields when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides this point: listening to what the previous government had to say brings up that the TPP was a strategic move to strengthen China's neighbors. There's more than just jobs on the line here.

       No US jobs are lost when McDonald's opens branches in Asia.

       Jobs are not "gotten". There is no global jobs dispenser that the US needs to grab more from. Jobs are also not "created" by the government. They happen when ability, vision, resources and lack of government interference coincide.

       What the hell are you blabbering about, really? McDonalds will take money they could have invested in the US and invest it in Asia. Then Asians will reap the tax, Asians will get the jobs. It's not good for the US people. We will have our rules enforced in their countries, so that our type of industries, like McDonalds, can compete. Asians will provide more demand for Tyson's shitty chicken, so we can sell it in walmart there, and then that demand is driving up prices Americans pay at home.

       So you're saying basically that exporting anything drives prices up? Maybe Trump should put export taxes on American industry to keep prices down then.

       I don't even think I need to make much of an argument. NAFTA looks like a job exporter on its face. It makes it easy to outsource our jobs to Mexico while selling the products that are made in America. Benefit from cheap labor, like Sanders was saying.
      </p>
      <pre><code>Immediately eliminated tariffs on 50 percent of industrial goods imported into Mexico from the US
Set a 10-year timetable for phasing out most tariffs — and a 15-year timetable for phasing out all tariffs — among Mexico, the US, and Canada. Before NAFTA, Mexican tariffs averaged 10 percent and US tariffs averaged 4 percent.
Eliminated a slew of Mexican protectionist measures: requirements that the government had to approve certain classes of imports; local content quotas, requirements that Mexican firms meet targets for export performance
Most importantly, gave Mexico guaranteed tariff- and quota-free access to the largest consumer market in the world, thus eliminating the principal cause of uncertainty that made investors leery of putting their money into the steel and concrete and machines bolted to the floor that are Mexican factories.

       I was a Bernie delegate at the Philly convention.  And smuggled a sign in that was anti-TPP just like almost every other Bernie delegate did. :P  And here is just one article about that:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And then I came home and participated in a Labor Day parade, and we all carried anti-TPP signs as the Roanoke Democratic Committee down the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know who is complaining about the TPP being dead, but I suspect it isn't Lefties.

       OP you don't seem to realize that the only reason Donald Trump is against the TPP is that he's been a Liberal for most of his life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile the GOP had UNILATERAL support for NAFTA AND the TPP.

       "Leftists" indeed, before this retardation leftists were the only ones who opposed the TPP.

       while tpp is horrible for most countrys involved it is indeed a dumb move for trump to cancle it without a alternative deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tpp was not made for economic reasons - it was made to bind the southeast asia countrys to USA. As a reaction to the danger of BRICS. So this countrys dont join BRICS. Now when India - China - Russia really start this BRICS thing and remove dollar for trade with eachother than this will hurt USA. But it will hurt much more when all other countrys  see the progress and join it.
      </p>
      <p>
       USA hates the euro because all the EU countrys dont use dollar anymore for trade with eachother - they have the euro now. And same will happen with east-asia.

       They never joined BRICS before why would they now? We're just getting out of the TPP and renegotiating trade with each country individually. They're eager to trade with the US, the media lately makes it sound like we're really messing up, they have everyone being a worry wort. Nothing is going to change.

       I really hate when stupid conservatives call Hillary Clinton supporters. Leftists. They aren't. They supported a neocon. Bernie supporters do not support TPP.

       That's true. But we also ignore the fact that it keeps wages low. We're overtaxed on top of that.

       The bilateral deals President Trump promised could also mean worse deals for the working class and middle class then the TPP could ever have achieved. That is what has me worried.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your a person who believes money flows down from the rich to the poor (like I believe Trump does) all the more likely your going to do a deal which is great for big business and the wealthy in each country but woeful to the middle class and working class of your and theirs countries.
