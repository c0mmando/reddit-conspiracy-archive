<p>THIS IS A CALL FOR YOUR HELP! Just got back from the FBI here in Seattle. They are taking my claims seriously and told me to gather any evidence that I thought was helpful, since I apparently have a lot of research into this. Find me the most degrading shit about these motherfuckers. No more votes for you kids. Below is the quoted initial report that I was told to submit included a lot of initial sources I could dig up about AntiFa so that they could justify some extra security in Seattle and some sort of lead to follow:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I contacted the FBI Seattle office this afternoon to report Terrorist activity within Seattle from the activist self-titled group &quot;ANTIFA&quot; or &quot;Anti Fascist&quot;. </p>

<p>Milo Yiannopoulos was scheduled to speak at the University of Washington on 20 January 2017. The AntiFa group hang a banner stating &quot;STAB MILO ALL OUT J20&quot;, as described by Milo&#39;s subjective article below.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2017/01/18/stab-milo-banner-university-of-washington-seattle/">http://www.breitbart.com/milo/2017/01/18/stab-milo-banner-university-of-washington-seattle/</a></p>

<p>Seattle PD noted confiscating materials from protesters:</p>

<p>In my experience while waiting in line for this event, I recognized that people holding flags, or wearing patches with the following icon:</p>

<p>were wearing all black, balaclavas or bandanas on their face, and were armed. I witnessed these uniformed individuals walk through the line of Milo supporters and I was assaulted following their instigation. The police removed the aggressor, but the individuals continued to incite violence. Shortly preceding the shooting of one of the members of this organization, who Seattle PD mentioned was armed with a knife and brass knuckles, this twitter user:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/apayuha63wavvrs">https://twitter.com/apayuha63wavvrs</a></p>

<p>posted that they were coming to kill Milo according to this alternative news source:</p>

<p>I personally feel that these individuals are a Terrorist organization following the private investigative journalism of James O&#39;Keefe with Project Veritas </p>

<p>I hope that this information can lead to helpful identification of possible violent actors in our community and these aggressors, who are calling for violence in response to the election, can be brought to justice. I am more than willing to accept emails or phone calls at any point in time to clarify any unclear information I have brought to your attention.</p>

<p>Thank you for keeping our community and country safe. </p>

<p>Antifa has public posts going back weeks in opposition to Milo&#39;s appearance at UW, with many calls for violence. They hang banners in the university district with their Disrupt J20 hashtag and &quot;STAB MILO&quot;. They tweeted that they were on their way to kill Milo. It&#39;s late, so I&#39;ll take the karma hit for sources at the moment.</p>

<p>Milo and local Police reported finding pillaging level armament, with studded bats, make-shift shields, and long pointed poles that we so beautifully saw in DC.</p>

<p>While I was there, I saw nearly seven hundred people line up to see Milo. Mostly everyone in line was just happy to be in good company, and there were very few people going out of their way to instigate violence, outside of the banter between protesters and chants.</p>

<p>It is a fact that the protesters threw many paint balloons, rocks, bricks, and firecrackers during the protests. I had two instances where things could have been ugly, where I was talking with four or five other people and a guy brushed through managing to bump into everyone in the pack, a couple minutes later two more people start to chat with us and are obviously digging to rile us up. I tell the guy that he&#39;s in violation of University Administrative Code, which can get you arrested, in which he was bothering us, and needed to leave (Cuck the cuck bluff called). Once he told me to make him, I got in his face, and the original twerp who bumped into everyone grabbed me, and threw a punch. I turned him to the ground, put my forearm to his throat, and calmly said &quot;stop&quot; until a cop showed up. He tried to tell the cop that I had assaulted him, and the cop just looked at me while I flicked my cap back on, and responds &quot;I watched what happened, you&#39;re out.&quot;</p>

<p>In another instance, the line was diminishing as they were vetting people to get through between dispersing the protesters for a moment, and it was pretty much two lines face to face. The police oversaw everyone, while the protesters threw their objects towards the line. They continued to advance on the people trying to see the event, so I on three occasions maced the crowd. This pushed them back, and probably prevented a fucking riot.</p>

<p>The University sent out a memo to the school standing with the campus Republicans, seemingly as a &#39;fuck you&#39; to the cucks at UC Davis, or that the UW Republicans played a hard fight to get Milo there in the name of Civil Rights and busting down this fucking victimized generation; but the fact that a shooting occured with a probably lawful owner against a protester is really good fucking bait for the new proposed law that would restrict nearly all modern weapons. Could also possibly a false flag, since it&#39;s already national news.</p>

<p>This is on the SLPC page, and you can see the shooter just hanging out, and the victim rips a white hat off of someone from behind. Surely a &quot;Peace Keeper&quot;</p>

The dude has made me food before and dated people I know. So I&#39;m obviously bias because as well no one in their right mind should consider bringing a gun to an event at UW and for fucks sake don&#39;t just fire it into a crowd. The Asian dude is lucky he only hit a white dude, if he hit a white lady the cops likely would have cared. </p>

<p>That video is a bit better, shows what happened before and during the shot. The guy was taking punches from all sides and randomly fires his gun off. Being that he was clearly a Trump supporter he decided to fire in the direction of the crowd opposing his view point. There was no self defense in that video, he shot a guy who was being held back by his friends. How can someone with their arms bound by other humans require being shot at? It doesn&#39;t make any sense from a self defense stand point. Makes perfect sense if he simply fired because he was afraid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My argument is that there are news sources repeating that he was a peace keeper, when he was in fact trying to start shit with people. </p>

<p>The fact that an aging man felt the need to discharge his weapon was because Antifa was being violent and was the only group starting violence.</p>

<p>If this group hadn&#39;t tried to manipulate the mob mentality, there would not have been a shooting.</p>

<p>Therefore, Antifa is responsible for the shooting. </p>

<p>Further, if the police and FBI were to take my claims seriously (which they luckily haven&#39;t disregarded in any statements thus far), they can hold the victim responsible until he releases any names of his &quot;comrades&quot;. </p>

<p>If the city and FBI were to make an example of Antifa, there would be a much more productive outcome for legitimate protests with righteous causes. For example, protesting the event at UW was totally within everyone&#39;s rights. Fight for what you believe in. However, it is not ethical to label others as fascists and use that as an excuse to be violent. </p>

<p>There are more and more people posting in default subreddits that it&#39;s okay to start a revolution because Trump is a fascist. If we don&#39;t attack the rioters and domestic terrorists head on, they&#39;ll continue to move the bar for fascism until we&#39;re all fascists under their definition. It&#39;s the same thing as racism.</p>

<p>Fair enough, I&#39;m always for questioning the narrative, especially in a situation like this where it isn&#39;t clear. I was just putting that aspect out there, that even if he was an instigator, you still can&#39;t shoot him.</p>

<p>Ehhh. Being a dick isn&#39;t conducting violence, and neither is loudly protesting or getting in someone&#39;s face and yelling. Being part of an organization where other members commit acts of violence isn&#39;t one in of itself. I still have a hard time believing the guy should have been shot unless he was actively beating someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m agreeing with a lot of what you say, but you&#39;re just plain wrong. As I said before you cannot use deadly force except to defend yourself from an active deadly threat. Unless the guy was about to detonate a bomb, shooting someone who is being held back by others is a pretty cut and dry case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which is why I said Jury. I think it&#39;s hazy based on these videos, just because we can&#39;t see everything that happened between them. I wholeheartedly agree with you. </p>

<p>What I am making this post for is to show that the claims that the victim was some righteous person is not the full truth. I am also posting this so that the view of the protests is not solely &quot;against the alt-right&quot; but also against everyone that these people choose to attack. </p>

<p>Refusefascism.org is trying to make the current presidency seem like fascism and I think you can see where that leads us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You goddamn sure can shoot somebody with a deadly weapon, menacing you. Sorry, but I have to disagree with you real strong on that point.</p>

<p>Before you even get going, here&#39;s why: if I punch you in the face, particularly sucker-punch you, with brass knuckles, I will probably kill you. Period, end. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t die, you will, with 100% certainty, be permanently disfigured, and probably lose an eye, and/or most of your teeth. Your jaws, and orbital sockets, or skull, will be fractured.</p>

<p>If I get a good right hook in, without brass knuckles, 75% of the population will also suffer similar injuries, although without lacerations, and a lot of the trauma created by the brass knuckles.</p>

<p>When a physically hard grown man punches a person in the face, especially if that person isn&#39;t a physical match, that man does so with the expectation of causing grave bodily harm. Real life isn&#39;t like a video game. If you get punched in the face for real, to the hospital you will go.</p>

<p>That is a very real, and grown-up fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the video <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/5pac0u/video_of_uw_milo_event_shooting_watch_the_asian/">here</a></p>

<p>at -21 you can see the victim rush over to the shooter in the yellow hat who isn&#39;t even looking at the guy.</p>

<p>When he gets up to him you can see his fist with brass knuckles cocked right by the shooters face.</p>

<p>At -15 you can see the asian guy trying to break free and get away while multiple people are grabbing at him and the victim is hitting him from behind.</p>

<p>At -13 you can see another guy in a mask trying to reach for the asian man&#39;s waist trying to grab his gun right and that&#39;s when the guy draws it and shoots the victim assaulting him.</p>

<p>Victim was found with brass knuckles and a knife. Video shows he started it and lost. </p>

<p>The police interviewed the shooter and released him. No charges because it was self defense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t see that the guy who was shot had been threatening to punch the shooter, until you pointed it out.</p>

<p>In that thread you linked to, people are saying the shooter already had the gun out- but I&#39;m having some trouble making heads or tails of the video.  Clearly the antifa guy targets yellow hat man for some reason.  i do think it&#39;s interesting that really stands out in the crowd as the only guy in a bright yellow cap.</p>
