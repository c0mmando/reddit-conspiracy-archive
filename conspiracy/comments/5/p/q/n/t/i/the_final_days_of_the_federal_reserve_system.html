       "It’s becoming pretty obvious that the days of Federal Reserve System hegemony are now limited, in that much of the world is dumping the US Petro Dollar and plans to shift to direct trade and use of Gold, Silver and commodity-backed real currencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyday more and more Americans that didn’t already know are now finding out that the Federal Reserve System is a private corporation, owned by foreign “Bloodline” families, and is neither Federal nor a Bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are finding out it is a private corporation, a franchisee of the privately owned Bank of London located in the City of London, a private Khazarian Mafia nation-state with its own ambassadors and police.
      </p>
      <p>
       The City of London is not a part of the UK and pays no taxes to England.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was infiltrated and completely hijacked by the Rothschild Banking family by use of some crafty covert operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most notable and first major covert operation by the Luciferian Rothschild money-changers was a stock price suppression operation which allowed them to buy up vast quantities of stock at fire-sale prices. This was based on a false announcement a victory of Napoleon in the Battle of Waterloo, when it was just the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second covert operation was the use of Rothschild money power to place Oliver Cromwell in power in England. Cromwell was a Rothschild puppet who was willing to harass, abuse and even murder Rothschild opposition which allowed them to complete their hijacking of the City of London financial and Banking enterprises and make England the center of their ancient Luciferian dark-side Babylonian Talmudic black-magick powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       From their new home base in England they were able to expand their private central banking kingdom as a replacement for the eroded and dying British Empire which when at it peak was claimed that the Sun never set upon it it was so worldwide and vast.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the Rothschilds who were allegedly anointed by Lucifer (Satan) to become the functional head of the Khazarian Mafia, the World’s biggest Organized Crime Syndicate based on the power of the dark side. Those who run the dark side using the RKM and its Worldwide occult network of Evil must first give up their souls to Lucifer and must function as non-humans dedicated to living in an occult world of secret evil dedicated to performing the opposite of everything that is good, loving, just and righteous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hierarchy advancement to the higher positions of extreme power, privilege, wealth and status is based on participation in evil initiation rites based on deviant, perverted criminal acts such as satanic black masses, drug usage, pedophilia, child torture, child-hunting at private hunting lodges, child sacrifice, and human vivisection all secretly videoed for later blackmail purposes in the initiate ever goes outside their allowed behavioral parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The RKM learned of the addictive nature of Turkish Opium and its medicinal and intoxicating powers, and its ability to temporarily stop time and remove all worldly cares.
      </p>
      <p>
       The English had been buying a lot of tea, spices and silk from China and had paid them a lot of silver and gold in exchange for these products which the English people demanded and paid high prices for.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschild decided they would traffick opium into China to create massive addictions and thereby recover all the silver and gold they had paid out to the Chinese for tea, spices and silk. Opium was deployed by the Khazarian mafia associated “bloodline families” as a weapon of covert economic war.
      </p>
      <p>
       It didn’t take too long for the Chinese warlords to figure this all out and fight back. Thus the Opium Wars occurring. English troops prevailed but because they had suffered some losses negotiated treaties allowing some opium sales but with significant curtailment."

       "Ever since, at various times, the Khazarian Mafia has continued to deploy illegal, habit forming narcotics that are able to steal a person’s very soul and dirty them up for life in most cases, an addiction that usually takes everything they have including their life itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschild Khazarian Mafia (RKM) “Beast” is centered in the City of London (COL) and is run by the Luciferian Rothschilds.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is these Banksters who are reputed to have been anointed and empowered directly by Lucifer who are the head of the occult beast known as the “Hierarchy” which uses the High Freemasonry, and the Worldwide Satanic and occult networks as cover, and has continually trafficked illegal habit forming narcotics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The RKM have trafficked numerous illegal drugs into America as covert weapons of war to not only destroy America the Constitutional Republic but to raise vast “off the books” black funds for various worldwide covert criminal activities as well as to make the Bloodline families participating in the drug trade rich beyond reason."

       Many of these funds are used to finance vast mercenary operations of mind-kontrolled dupes pretending to be and acting like bloodthirsty terrorists who have lost their souls and are no longer functionally human.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the RKM basically owns and control every head of most of the American Intel and Law Enforcement Agencies they are basically immune from any arrest and prosecution for their massive illegal drug trafficking into and across America and much of the World.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only their small time cutouts are ever arrested as token LE prosecutions to fool everyone.

       "President Andrew Jackson had driven the RKM Banksters out of America and felt they were evil. He was correct. He fully understood that these COL Banksters were foreign based vipers and parasites.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Gentlemen, I have had men watching you for a long time and I am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country. When you won, you divided the profits amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter, I shall ruin ten thousand families.
      </p>
      <p>
       That may be true, gentlemen, but that is your sin! Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families, and that would be my sin! You are a den of vipers and thieves.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “If Congress has the right under the Constitution to issue paper money, it was given to be used by themselves, not to be delegated to individuals or corporations.”
      </p>
      <p>
       These are quotes from Andrew Jackson, who was a distinguished Constitutional President of the United States 1829-1837, and who killed the RKM Bank and drove it out of America. Sadly, it successfully bribed its way back into America in 1913, this time to last for over 100 years; and the RKM bank effectively parasitized millions of American soldiers’ lives and health, along with most American’s earned wealth and assets."

       "Once these COL RKM Banksters were able to set up their stateside franchise, they were able to slowly and systematically change the US Dollar from Gold and Silver Certificates (real money) to their own FRS Fiat (counterfeit) money better known as Federal reserve notes.
.
These FRS notes are actually pernicious interest bearing debt-notes and slowly but surely all Gold and Silver backing was removed in 1971 by Richard Nixon and they became debt-notes only.
This final act of the JFK Assassination coup d’etat occurred in 1971 by the man Richard Nixon who was deeply involved in what he called “that Bay of Pigs Thing” with GHWB.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was GHWB who served as the titular head of the Bush Crime cabal which ran the CIA as its personal tool on behalf of the Fourth Reich and it was he who planned and ran the JFK assassination of the behalf of the Fourth Reich which was functioning as a part of the RKM."

       "This seems so counter-intuitive but when one pulls back the curtain one finds the RKM Babylonian Talmudic Zionists at the core of the RKM who work with every other major crime syndicate including the Fourth Reich which they set up and ran in the first place.

      <p>
       David Rockefeller has been the head of the American RKM franchise. Kissinger negotiated the US Petro Dollar deal with the Mideast Oil producers. The deal was the US Military and NATO will protect you and will make sure you have plenty of profitable western markets only if you agree to accept US Dollars for your oil sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to know the ugly truth about Heinz Kissinger (“Bor”) invest about 8 hours listening to Kay Griggs’ video affidavit, a truly great American Hero like Gwenyth Todd and Sibel Edmonds.
      </p>
      <p>
       This deal was made and soon the US Petro Dollar became the World’s Reserve Currency, a distinct advantage for the FRS franchisee of the COL RKM private central Banking System.
      </p>
      <p>

       "That is why insiders have called it both the “Octopus” and the “Baby” which is short for the current form of the ancient Babylonian Talmudic “black magick” money from nothing Zionist system (aka the secret Sionist Luciferian occult black-magick money-creation system).
      </p>
      <p>
       And we know that without question a strong association between the RKM private banking octopus has always been associated with both illegal narcotics and drug trafficking and the massive Rockefeller created oil cartel which started out as the Seven Sisters and has now morphed into a smaller number of much larger corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that one of the main methods used by the RKM to infiltrate and hijack many nations has been through the infiltration and capture of control over the underworld or criminal organizations in each nation, as well as by infiltrating their banking and corporations and consolidating them.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the significant RKM leaders are initiated into secret societies using criminal, sadistic and highly deviant rituals, which increase in intensity and severity at each higher level as one become initiated to move up to the next higher level in the RKM system (aka the Hierarchy). Once the RKM gains control over the leaders in every sector, the rest is relatively easy."

      </p>
      <p>
       We now have gained a simple understanding of how the RKM buys its way into (infiltrates), then hijacks large corporations and then consolidates them into larger and larger entities that operate as virtual monopolies in function only but not corporate structure.
The joke was on us, the American people with the Bankster Bailouts. The FRS threatened that there would be blood in the streets and martial law would have to be declared unless the FRS and the “too big to fail” Wall Street Banks were bailed out by the US Taxpayers. This trick was successfully pulled off — TWICE
      </p>
      <p>
       Once an industry is consolidated, be it oil, manufacturing or entertainment or media, it is easy for the RKM to exercise control over these virtual monopolies because all of the CEOs are owned and controlled by the RKM or its Cutouts one way or another."

       Rothschild money lending/banking is a Vatican creation, by way of the Rothschild name itself: Red Shield, representing the Romans/Holy Roman Empire. They are court factors (common name is 'court j e w s'), which were in charge of the fortunes and money of fiefdoms during the middle ages/Renaissance and merged into money lending in the modern era.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say the Vatican is close to the top because I don't know for sure. Before the Romans, were the Greeks. Before the Greeks were the Egyptians. Before the Egyptians, the Babylonians/Sumerians. Before them the Indian Brahmans and Tibetans (who still hold powerful religious sway via Buddhism and Hinduism today). Before them all were the powerful African tribes. Possibly before them were the Aboriginal tribes of Australia. Before them you could have the lost civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria. Cannot rule out a continuation of hominid species underground in the basalt layers of the Earth. And you cannot rule out extra-terrestrial or inter-dimensional life at this point influencing the decisions of the surface-level powers that be. There are a lot of possibilities yet to be confirmed or refuted.

       Thanks a lot for that. That was honestly very informative and you put it together well. Going back to the Rothschilds being a Vatican creation. I was talking with another user who was explaining how Switzerland is the Knights hospitalir
And the world wide banking system is centrally run out of Switzerland. Does this sound true to you as well? If so what are the rothschilds relations to Switzerland like?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, I tend to ask this question to people I come across that seem to have a good amount of knowledge and I can tell you do. How does Tavistock for into the big picture. I understand what they do but it's the why and for who that I'm stuck on. Was the Vatican behind their creation and behind their agendas as well? Is it more of a British Royal family or freemasonry creation? Or are they all one in the same?

       I feel that the Western banking system is run out of Switzerland. I think it operates via legs or branches of Court Factor families. Rothschild (HSBC, B ar clays, etc.), Rockefeller (JP Morgan Chase, Citi, Travelers, MetLife), Warburg (UBS, Deutsche Bank), Oppenheimer (Rothschild's mentor in the Judengasse), etc. These players influence the IMF and World Bank, the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and ultimately pull the strings of the One Bank To Rule Them All: The Bank for International Settlements.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't even scratch the surface to how tied throughout history Switzerland has been with the church/Rome. It makes complete sense how the Knights Templar/Knights Hospitaler are still watching the throne of St. Peter. It's been said here before that the Pope's guarded by the "Swiss Guard". Funny how that works.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of the Tavistock Institute, I think they are, or were, at least in this modern era, created via the British Crown/Chatham House/RIIA. They are probably heavy into eugenics/genetic manipulation (real Island of Dr. Moreau-type stuff). They are definitely all interrelated at some point. They are following far older blueprints than most could ever imagine.

       Thanks again for putting the time into answering my questions you've definitely helped connect a few more dots for me. I just wish more people would see how deep this all runs and how totally controlled and manipulated our everyday lives really are. People are hardly willing to go further than blaming democrats or republicans let alone questioning the real forces that got us here. You've pointed me in some good directions to keep researching, so thanks again.

       No problem. Glad someone listens to the details that many shut their eyes and ears to.
The British Empire ran the global drug trade through the vessels of The British East India Company (and the Dutch did as well via the Dutch East India Company and Dutch West India Company). The Royal Family's last name of 'House of Windsor' is just a recent creation. They are of the House of Saxe-Coburg/Habsburg, which derived from the House of Guelph, which derived from the House of Este, which can arguably be placed among The Black Nobility (Italian/Venetian/European nobility which have Roman ancestral roots....As in from the Republic/Empire).
The City of London is a part of the Empire of The City (a novel by E.C. Knuth). It states that there are 3 strategic points of power in this system: The City of London (money/banking/finance), Washington D.C. (military) and Vatican City (religion). Each is marked by the obelisk in each city (one of Cleopatra's Needle's in London, the Washington Monument, and the Egyptian obelisk in St. Peter's Square). Many on here believe that Switzerland (Been, specifically) is the 4th leg of the Empire of The City, and may be where the Templars went to after they were disbanded in 1312.

       Keep an open mind to all types of information. I'd focus on mystery schools (Alexander Hislop's 'The Two Babylons' is a start), eastern thought (those of the Tibetan Lamas and Hindu Yogis) and how science in current events and quantum physics keeps finding evidence to support the teachings, archeoastronomy (books like Hamlet's Mill), sacred geometry and the mystic side to religion (gnosticism, sufism, pagan practices and worship).

       I'm quite deep into gnostic studies currently attempting to understand how they played a role in all this. Still not sure if the early Gnostics went underground due to an oppressive church (rome) or if they were primarily hiding,because what they we're doing was nefarious. I also read a ton about quantum mechanics/zero point energy etc and how they tie in. The other suggetions will,make great additions.

       Sorry to bombard you with questions but in addition to how the Gnostics fit into the situation as far as being good or bad (i believe their are both depending on intention) do you have any knowledge about the priory of sion? Was their important just misdirection in the movie divinci code? Or do they play a role?

       I just know what I read in Holy Blood, Holy Grail about the Priory of Sion. Not sure if the society actually exists, but I think that there are others like it. There was something called, and pardon my code speak, Sec re tum Sec re tor um that was spoken of by some modern Venetian prince. I saw people post about it about a year ago, and at that point I could search for the guy (the Venetian) online and actually find info, but now I can't find much at all about it. Seems like it's been memory-holed, at least on reddit. You can still read the actual document that the society is based off of (the Sec ret um Sec re tor um, by PseudoAristotle).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if the Priory would be protecting a bloodline of Jesus Christ itself, or maybe secrets to consciousness itself (KRSNA Consciousness), or some other aspect we may not know of. Obviously tons of mystery surround the figure of Jesus of Nazareth (was he a real person, was he an avatar, were his teachings just an ideal where a character saying them was needed?).

       Very interesting, I have found certain websites that claim the Priory whether real or fake as being headed by members of families in one of the "13 illuminati bloodlines" how accurate that is I'm not sure. It is interesting that they are rumored to be protecting the bloodline of Jesus yet researchers lump them into the overall conspiracy as being nefarious in nature. Very interesting.

      <p>
       As far as early Gnostics go, do you believe they were forced underground because the knowledge they had, if it fell into the hands of righteous people, could enlighten to many people that it would threaten the power of the church? Or do you believe they primarily went underground because their intentions were "evil"? It seems to me there is multiple types of Gnostics whose intentions most likely vary.

       I never really thought of the Gnostics as a people. I think of them more as a teaching. So, I haven't thought too deeply on why they were forced underground. If I had my bet, it would be that the information would help too many people, and threaten the church's growing power at that time.

       I don't know about the validity of the 13 Illuminati Bloodlines......families like the Grimaldi family aren't mentioned, but they hold immense power in the world. Also, Indian or Asian families are mentioned, which blows my mind and sets off a lot of alarms. The Chinese have spent the past 30 years (at least) perfecting the art of shadow banking. I think they laugh at this Illuminati stuff.

       I agree I have always been skeptical of claims made like that. That leave out the influence of almost half the world in their theories. A lot of researchers never look into how the eastern cultures and religions have influenced world affairs. Anyway thanks again for all the info.
