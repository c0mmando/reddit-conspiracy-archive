        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been lurking on this subreddit for years now and I&#39;ve watched it go from tongue-in-cheek, to a place for serious, non-partisan, critique at potential global conspiracies, to a pro-Trump/anti-Liberal sub. So before I get downvoted to oblivion for putting the words &quot;Trump&quot; and &quot;Pizzagate&quot; in the same title- let me just say that <strong>I&#39;m not here to be anti-Trump.</strong> I&#39;m not anti-Trump at all. I&#39;m here because I have a question about Pizzagate that involves Trump and I would actually prefer if someone could provide an answer to my question that would clear up my suspicions regarding Trump in connection to Pizzagate.</p>

<p>My question is: <em>Why does Pizzagate not include an investigation of or at least an in-depth look at Donald Trump?</em> It seems like Pizzagate looks at a lot of leaders and politicians while carefully skirting around any mention of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>I understand why others like Podesta, the Clintons, etc are being looked at. Especially Bill Clinton, because if anyone is trafficking child-victims for sex in DC, he definitely had a hand in it. It&#39;s known that he was <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/05/13/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known.html">flying with Jeffrey Epstein</a> and there have been numerous rape accusations made against Bill (including a case that he settled) so it seems very likely that he&#39;s involved.</p>

<p>Trump on the other hand has also been accused of having sex with underage girls. Which (thankfully) turned out to be false. The thing is though, it wasn&#39;t proved to be false in a court of law, the accuser dropped the suit and I noticed a sort of &quot;thou dost protest too much&quot; thing happening with that which made me kind of uncomfortable. He is also alleged to have taken trips to that same sex slave island with Epstein and Clinton. Epstein and Clinton were also both members of Trump&#39;s private Mar-a-Lago Club (I have my own suspicions about these private clubs for rich people) and perhaps the most damning thing is that Trump is quoted as saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy... He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which came off as very disturbing to me. Naturally as soon as Epstein&#39;s crimes were exposed, Trump changed his tune and spoke about what a terrible person Epstein is as anyone would have. But still, I haven&#39;t seen a single one of my fellow truth-seekers in this sub or anywhere else say that there might be anything off about this quote or Trump&#39;s close friendships with both Clinton and Epstein in the past.</p>

<p>I&#39;m concerned that people are letting their un-wavering support for Donald Trump cloud their pursuit of the truth. I&#39;m <strong>NOT</strong> saying that Trump is as guilty as Bill Clinton or even guilty at all by any means. I actually really hope he&#39;s not. I&#39;m just concerned that no one has even bothered to look into it. In my opinion, that quote alone should be enough to at least raise a bit of concern or suspicion, but there hasn&#39;t even been a concerted effort to look into it in an attempt to even clear his name. Like, we are only (thankfully) aware of the Podesta thing because people looked into the emails. These people aren&#39;t just going to shout their guilt or involvement from the rooftops, you know. But instead of looking into the private Mar-a-Lago club records or anything at all, we&#39;re just flat out ignoring it. Why though?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I&#39;m really not sure why I even bothered. This post is being downvoted and all my comments are being downvoted. I&#39;ve tried to be rational and fair about this and I&#39;m getting shit on for questioning and being freethinking- which is (or <em>was</em>) the entire point of this sub. People talk about &quot;CTR brigading and downvoting everything&quot; but sometimes you guys are just as bad with anything you view as a being a &quot;negative&quot; critique of Trump. I think I&#39;m done here.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I came back and am trying to respond to everyone and ask for sources if you have em. Thanks to the non-partisan folks for showing up and restoring some of my faith in this sub. I hate how often a simple question gets turned around as an attack on the asker when I&#39;ve tried to make it clear that I am not against Trump and that no amount of accusations will make that true. I&#39;m even being told I &quot;should have kept my mouth shut&quot; and that I need to &quot;GTFO&quot;. Yeah no, you people are the ones who are just making me even more suspicious by attempting to silence me.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> Just wanted to say thanks again to the level-headed people who came out and took some time to discuss this with me. I&#39;ve learned some really interesting things from this thread and my conclusion is that while this is worth looking into further (see <a href="/u/Know_Comment">/u/Know_Comment</a>&#39;s comment about Roy Cohn), this does not mean that I&#39;m going to just stop supporting Trump just because I have some suspicions about his connections to this whole thing. At the end of the day, he still has mine and America&#39;s best interests at heart and I truly believe he will Make America Great Again!</p>

<p>Before I go though, let me just echo/paraphrase <a href="/u/JTwPAXT">/u/JTwPAXT</a> a bit and say that those of you who blindly trust in Trump or Clinton or Sanders or anyone else don&#39;t really belong in this sub. Per the sidebar- &quot;This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public’s imagination. Please respect other views and opinions, and keep an open mind. Our goals are a fairer, more transparent world and a better future for everyone.&quot; If you support Trump like I do, great, but don&#39;t let it cloud up your judgement to the point where hearing or reading anything negative makes you shut down and try to shut others down. People are allowed to ask questions without being attacked or silenced. Do your best to rationally explain your position and make a point without coming off as close-minded person and you should be fine!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I phrased it wrong, but at any given time for the last year and a half- the top posts have all been anti-Liberal and pro/in defense of Trump. Even right now one of the top posts is just an image macro of Hillary regurgitating stuff that we already know about her emails and lower down there are 3-4 posts either defending Trump or only mentioning him in a positive light. If you do a search on the sub for &quot;Trump&quot; for every 1 negative post about him there are 5-10 positive/favorable ones. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s <em>bad</em> I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s definitely a thing.</p>

<p>And as for the emails- I want to see Hillary Clinton in jail as much as anyone, but it&#39;s really up to Trump now to make sure that will happen as he originally promised but he already said he&#39;s not going to pursue it so I&#39;m not even sure why we&#39;re still talking about it. Just gives Liberals more fuel to keep saying &quot;HURR DURR LOCK HER UP WAS A LIE!&quot; and I&#39;m personally sick of hearing that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehh...no one&#39;s above reproach.  Blindly trusting politicians is never good, and I&#39;m with you that his name could easily come up in pizzagate, but as far as something else lurking in his past that&#39;s hidden...I have a hard time swallowing that.  There were 1000&#39;s of ppl, both journalists and citizens trying to find real dirt on the guy for nearly 2 years, and nothing of substance has come out.  I don&#39;t see how he could have a system for removing scandal from the historical record that works so effectively.</p>

<p>as far as the little girl pagents and their assosciation in the 80s that was also explored in depth [how else would i know i know nothing]
so it really is a disservice to our comunity when re-edits decided to fold pizzagate in 8 hours ....</p>

<p>luckily other places have allowed much research to move forward </p>

<p>i suggest doing some research but let me tell you google is broken!</p>

<p>so is reddits </p>

<p>Idk about this. I certainly believe that blame should be pinned on Epstein, Clintons, and Podesta and others as it goes on. People need to have some blame pinned on them for this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the trail leads to Trump you&#39;ll hear about it for sure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who decides if the trail leads to him or not, though? I think it&#39;s important to keep an open mind and not just sit back and be like &quot;Oh, if he&#39;s involved we&#39;ll hear about it&quot; because that&#39;s how people have been getting away with doing bad things for a long time. I want to be as skeptical of everyone as possible and that quote plus the friendships seem to put him on the same trail as Clinton and Epstein. Just kind of seems like everyone is purposely ignoring any possible connections and that really bugs me. Like you get accused of being a CTR shill or being anti-Trump if you even bring up the quote on Voat and that&#39;s wrong in my opinion. I just want to keep an open mind without getting automatically shut down.</p>

<p>Just for the record- I found out about Trump&#39;s Epstein quote through the MSM, not from fellow truth-seekers here or on other forums. It&#39;s mostly been buried or completely ignored here which bugs me. I mean, how do you personally feel about that quote?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Epstein is a huge target of the investigation - if there&#39;s any truth to the Trump connection it will be revealed.  Pizzagate is being investigated by many Trump supporters but also citizens with a wide range of political beliefs- this is a serious issue and if the evidence points to Trump being involved, investigators will absolutely talk about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As everyone here has said, the signals aren&#39;t pointing to Trump. The few issues that have cropped up with him have either been discredited or lack any significant evidence (circumstantial included). If anything credible comes up to implicate the guy I will happily light the fires to watch him burn with the rest. </p>

<p>As it stands right now there is pretty much a neon sign flashing away saying &quot;Perverts&quot; and it&#39;s pointing directly at a handful of individuals. It&#39;s logical to follow those leads until they branch off elsewhere.</p>

<p>The quote you mentioned from Trump about Epstein was before the Mar-a-Lago ban, and before Epsteins arrest. I&#39;m sure Stephen Hawking had glowing reviews of Epstein also, considering Epstein reconfigured his submarine on his private island to fit Hawkings wheel chair. That probably doesn&#39;t mean Hawking was a pedophile though.</p>

<p>But why?? Stephen Hawking has at least two kids so we know his penis works. Why does he get a pass? Fucking everyone who set foot on that private island should be investigated, especially someone like Hawking who people would quickly dismiss for being disabled or a nice guy or whatever. This whole &quot;Well if there was evidence...&quot; thing is kind of bullshit. No one is even looking!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, bravo, I&#39;m glad to see some people still out there are noticing the biased nature of pizzagate as far as who &quot;they&quot; are trying to use as the scapegoats of the real conspiracy, the international child trafficking ring and systemic pedophilia used for blackmail and dark spiritual practices.</p>

<p>In my opinion their is probably lots of truth to pizzagate and clearly there are lots of sucpicious things surrounding it. The problem is that it is compartmentalized to this one places. Lots of people are working on connecting the dots but the narrative being pushed the hardest is an attempt to keep it contained to a few scapegoats.</p>

<p>Trump never was or has been an &quot;outsider&quot; which means it is quite likely that somewhere along the line he was either blackmailed or joined the team of the delites. The lack of questioning Trump on this I think comes from multiple things. One being that Trumps campaign ran primarily on filling Americans with that the system we have all seen corrupted with somehow now be allowed to change. His supporters are holding on to this. Can you blame them? So you have an element of confirmation bias coming out of genuine hope. The other part is that since presidents are selected and not elected, they needed a way to keep trumps name out of it.
It is likely that shills have infiltrated different discussion boards tasked with damage control as to not implement the new leader in the same scandals while at the same to may possibly set him up to look like a hero.</p>

<p>The truth is the system has not changed with Trump, it&#39;s the same system that selected the last President with an extra genius script played out by the media by using people&#39;s frustration against them.</p>

<p>However, until Trump takes actions I am willing to reserve judgement. IF he starts truly exposing any corruption people will naturally look into him eventually as well. If he is willing to start locking up delite pedophiles it will be a start and will wake a lot of people up as to what can go on behind their backs and in front of their eyes at the same time. We can only hope more people awaken everyday, but time will tell as far as Trumps true agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sources? How are you so sure Trump is a legitimate good guy and the info telling you he distanced himself isn&#39;t disinfo? How do you know you haven&#39;t been tricked into that perception? Do you really think an &quot;outsider&quot; near the system that has strategically selected every President for many years? These are honest questions because of someone could produce some evidence for me that Trump is really some white knight to the rescue I would be very interested to read it. That hasn&#39;t happened yet...so until then I will treat him with the same skepticism I treat everyone who wants more power, authority and influence... Just remember you are trusting a billionaire reality TV real estate mogal to watch out for OUR best interests...seems highly unlikely to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Middle ground is always the goal. But you say good talk like I&#39;m done.</p>

<p>So about &quot;everyone teaming up against him&quot; I would say na...it&#39;s not proof exactly. That&#39;s what I mean by tricking you into that perception. Not saying this IS what&#39;s going on but it&#39;s certainly the most likely in my perception. I take it you don&#39;t trust MSM because lie so easily right? Why could they not lie about being against trump? The media is a way of selling certain public perception, is it so unrealistic that they came up with a script that plays on people&#39;s frustration with the system by bashing an &quot;outsider&quot; 24/7. Isn&#39;t it more likely they would have Ron pauled his ass if he wasn&#39;t part of a plan? The same people that own the media own Hollywood. Surely they could have written a script with only one simple twist...</p>

<p>As far as Brietbart, drudge and other alt media sites they have long since been compromised. Its called controlled opposition. They give slightly more info than the MSM to give the perception they are against them and simultaneously help control the overall narratives. You really think the biggest alt media sites would still be up by now if they were a legit threat? </p>

<p>Lastly, even if trump has been the plan all along like I believe he has, what matters is his actions, until I see him actually go after corruption in an unbiased manner I will stay skeptical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize their are players of this game that stay out of public view...all these things you are reading about are just talk until something actually happens. For example the fact that he pulls troops out of Syria around the same time he is suppose to move the US embassy in Israel from tel Aviv to Jerusalem seems strange since that&#39;s gonna piss a whole bunch of Muslims off. Almost like they want the Muslims to attack Israel to give a pretext for a large scale invasion...you see my point? Its all talk until we see his actions and results of those actions. Unfortunately there is too much disinformation out their and too many people on the payroll of the NWO conspiracy that it&#39;s virtually impossible to discern the truth. Which is exactly the plan all along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, it&#39;s all talk...you&#39;ve jumped to conclusions about trump by things he or other people have only said he wants to do. Audit the Fed? Cool yeah that would be interesting but if that is allowed to happen it&#39;s for a very specific reason. I also am not sure what you mean by CIA born and bred, of course presidents have to work closely with the CIA but I&#39;m not sure why you are so convinced that Trump is not apart of that as well. </p>

<p>My point is that they played on people&#39;s frustrations about the country and sold everyone the perception that he&#39;s an outsider. Its not that hard to see. All this talk about what he says he&#39;s gonna do or wants to do is just smoke and mirrors to keep people hoping. Trump will do exactly what it is the real powers that be want him to do.</p>

<p>Where did I say that? I never said that at all because there&#39;s no proof that he did. Please don&#39;t put words in my mouth. :( All I said is that they were friends and that Jeffrey was a member of his private club.</p>

<p>Anyway, to your point, I think the main reason Trump has not been deeply investigated is because Pizzagate largely caught fire amongst conservatives. It was a story that delegitimized Hillary, and that&#39;s all that Trump supporters wanted pre-election.</p>

<p>However, we also still know veryyyy little about the extent of this operation. The politicians that have been accused so far are mostly all tied to the story by emails, close relationships, or spending, and at this point there is no evidence that I know of that involves Trump.</p>

<p>Trump did know Jeffrey Epstein, and he&#39;s kind of a freaky dude, so I would not be surprised if he was involved. That said, only time will tell, and if anyone has Trump leads on the Pizzagate front, I would encourage them to follow them.</p>

<p>I agree 100%. Not super fond of his views on climate either and I&#39;m actually pro-Choice or more accurately, I&#39;d just prefer not to waste time meddling with Roe v Wade and focus on actual important issues. If people want to have abortions just fucking let them do it. The last thing we need is <em>more</em> poor people with <em>more</em> babies running around using up the welfare anyway. I&#39;d rather he focus on stopping our currently insane rate of illegal immigration and no worry so much about pleasing the God-botherers on the Right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate has been derailed by people who either are part of the conspiracy to conceal the fact of elite pedophile rings, or are in complete denial of reality and common sense. </p>

<p>If a bunch of someone&#39;s friends fuck kids, what does that say about them? I mean if it was just 1, I could totally see disregarding that. But when they are intimately involved with several people who have are in the public record as proven pedophiles, I don&#39;t understand why people have a problem with this math.</p>

<p>I actually don&#39;t think any legitimate person has a problem with this math.</p>

<p>Trump on the other hand has also been accused of having sex with underage girls. Which (thankfully) turned out to be false.</p>

<p>I thought the case was dropped because of harassment of the plaintiff? That doesn&#39;t mean it turned out false, just not true enough to withstand harassment. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m really not sure why I even bothered. This post is being downvoted and all my comments are being downvoted. I&#39;ve tried to be rational and fair about this and I&#39;m getting shit on for questioning and being freethinking- which is (or was) the entire point of this sub. People talk about &quot;CTR brigading and downvoting everything&quot; but sometimes you guys are just as bad with anything you view as a being a &quot;negative&quot; critique of Trump. I think I&#39;m done here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry to see this. I really do think r_conspiracy is close to being heavily influenced by pro-Trump propaganda and subtle psy-ops. One of the core tenets of the entire subreddit is that power by its very nature tends to corrupt, obfuscate, and persecute. When a billionaire New Yorker with ancestral wealth, international businesses, and literally millions of dollars of donations to both conservative and republican power brokers of the last twenty years and his cronies form the government suddenly, any skepticism or critique is off the table? That doesn&#39;t feel right.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the OP is trying to connect Pizzagate with every other case of pedophilia. If not <em>every</em> case, then at least every case involving a politician or a powerful person. I&#39;m sure that there are thousands of such cases, but they have nothing to do with Pizzagate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll throw this out there- Roy Cohn was Trump&#39;s lawyer and &quot;mentor&quot;.  He used his pleasure boat to shuttle sick children to and from children&#39;s hospitals, where he spent a lot of time.  Cohn also famously relied on sexual blackmail to coerce testimony, and has been accused of being involved in the management of a &quot;pedo book&quot; to compromise politicians and elites...</p>

<p>Roy Cohn was also the lawyer to the Italian Mafia operating in NYC (among other organized crime syndicates).  I think this is an interesting potential tie in to the theory.  Anyone ever seen Donnie Brasco?  Who is familiar with &quot;The Pizza Connection&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The trial centered on a Mafia-run enterprise that distributed vast quantities of heroin and cocaine in the United States, and then laundered the cash before sending it back to the suppliers in Sicily. The U.S. defendants utilized a number of independently owned pizza parlors as fronts for narcotics sales and collections – hence the name “Pizza Connection”. Evidence at the trial proved that the enterprise shipped no less than $1.6 billion of heroin to the U.S. between 1975 and April 1984. Arrests of scores of conspirators were coordinated in the U.S., Italy, Switzerland and Spain on April 9, 1984, following the capture of Gaetano Badalamenti and several family members the previous day in Madrid, Spain. Badalamenti was the former boss of the Sicilian Mafia, and a key supplier of heroin and cocaine to the U.S. Mafia distributors.</p>

<p>Thirty-eight mafia members and associates were originally indicted in the case, and 35 were named in the charges presented to the jury. Of those 35, 4 were convicted in Italy, 4 in Switzerland and 4 were fugitives. Approximately 27 of the defendants were residing in the U.S. at the time of the arrests. Out of those, only 22 defendants ‒ believed to be just a fraction of the number of Mafiosi involved in the scheme ‒ eventually stood trial. Prior to the start of the trial, one defendant was murdered, one died of natural causes and another was murdered during the trial. l</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well lets discuss the conspiracy. Trump didn&#39;t only associate himself with Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, Trump has been on flights and hung out with many different celebrities, millionaires and billionaires over the years and the chances that one of them turned out to be a pedophile increases each time. 
The only claims that have been made about Trump abusing children at an Epstein party were proven false, when the Guardian reported about the false allegations they were threatened by a man who turned out to be a producer on Jerry Springer. 
Other celebrities have been on flights with Epstein including comedian Chris Tucker and actor Kevin Spacey, it does appear Epstein did charity work with celebs, probably not out of the kindness of his heart, but he did offer lifts to celebrities and those people couldn&#39;t have known he was a pedo unless you are prepared to say they are also pedophiles along with Trump, which I think is absurd and without evidence to begin with.</p>

<p>Though I’m out of time to hunt down links, there’s plenty more on google. Trump International Escorts (now Mystique Escorts, or something, as of last spring/summer) seems highly suspsious as well. It’s located in NY, has been for years, and despite how protective Trump is of the name, it used the name, and Trump logos, for years. It’s also apparently owned by Multigroup, which is essentially an EEuropean organized crime group that it’s trying to look more legit. Trafficking is/was one if it’s top activities. </p>

<p>And Trump also had those illegal Polish workers, via a contractor, connecting him to another human trafficker of some sort. </p>

<p>There is nothing stopping you from researching Trump. Problem is where do you begin, people are using information and trails that exist. Yes there are ties to Epstein, same with many rich people who do not get bought up. I assume because there is nothing to go off. If you found any evidence to tie Trump into all this I guarantee many people here will listen.</p>

<p>Also even in this thread I&#39;m noticing one talking point being repeated over and over again that it seems a little rehearsed. &quot;Well if there was any evidence linking him, you&#39;d hear about it&quot; as if people are trying to lead me off the trail or discourage me from looking into it any further.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t really care if people were offended by my edit, I&#39;m not here to babysit anyone&#39;s feelings.

    <div class="md"><p>If Trump is in on it then there is no reason for the media and celebs to continue to bash him. If tptb control both sides so completely, then there is no reason to play charades with themselves releasing leaks on themselves redpilling massive numbers of people to the fact that the media is colluding and basically a hoax. Why destroy your means of control to put someone in power? If you own the system, just install whoever you want to. No questions would have been raised had Hillary won. The msm would happily go on.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m more skeptical of is posts like this one. But maybe you are seriously asking though, and if so, I can only say that the media that has lied to us poorly and transparently for many years despises Trump with a passion that is more genuine than any of the false flags they have ever perpetrated on us.

But I&#39;m not going to be one those rabid &quot;SHUT UP ABOUT THE GOD-EMPEROR&quot; people because I refuse to shut my brain off no matter how much I like someone. Lets not forget that he still has our best interests at heart regardless of whether or not he&#39;s involved in some shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yo. Don&#39;t take it personally. You know that this is a quality thread. it is a quality thread. Chill. You did good. CTR is easily tied to the DNC. Most people simply stop there, assuming they are the only group out there doing it. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s tens of thousands of trump bots out there, on twitter, etc. <strong>I haven&#39;t seen evidence</strong> but it&#39;s one of those things I do just assume. I could very well be wrong.</p>

<p>Ok, your post isn&#39;t getting downvoted because it&#39;s anti-trump. It&#39;s getting downvoted because it&#39;s about-pizzagate. Plain and simple, brother. Check other pizzagate threads. LOTS of discussion, few upvotes. Disproportionate to any other topic, even sandy hook. (although sandy hook similar situation)</p>

<p>Yes, Trump has made comments that would make you think he&#39;s right there with Epstein flying to the island and conducting ceremonies in the underground lair. His quote (re: Epstein) came out several months ago, and you bet your sweet ass people were digging into it. There simply hasn&#39;t been much found since then, afaik. That quote right there is the most damning evidence on him. Is it because nobody is looking? I think you&#39;re a bit confused about WHO is doing the gruntwork behind the investigation... It&#39;s people who are concerned for the potential children involved. Majority not driven by political parties. Because once (if) you begin to accept it as a possibility you&#39;ll see it transcends the bullshit left v. right.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is slow and greuling. Another reason Trump hasn&#39;t been tagged in PG is because PG goes where the evidence leads the investigation. evidence hasn&#39;t lead it to him yet. Well - it does - through the Epstein connection, but then it drops off. Trump bans epstein from one of his Flordia clubs (mar-a-lago I think?) and the relationship seems to end. It&#39;s not like people are researching democrats scrutinizing every time they ordered dominoes on the company card. The evidence is what steers PG. If it leads to Trump it leads to Trump.</p>

<p>And in essence that&#39;s the beauty of it right there. You&#39;re not going to see a headline on reddit providing you evidence that Trump is just as sick as the rest of them.. You&#39;re going to research it, and you&#39;re going to write it yourself. Let your genuine curiosity and sense of right and wrong take over, and start looking around. You&#39;ll be surprised at what you find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do I believe that? Absolutely. All of the evidence has been tenuous at best.</p>

<p>How about you bring up one or two of the pieces of evidence which you feel support the story the most strongly and we can discuss those.</p>

<p>We know that Epstein was doing despicable things with underage children and I&#39;m sure that Bill Clinton and Donald Trump were both provided ample opportunities to join in. My strong suspicion is that both of them probably did, too. However, I don&#39;t think that this has any relationship with Podesta or Comet Ping Pong Pizza.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no evidence linking him to it, that I&#39;m aware of. There is currently no hard evidence linking anyone to a specific crime.</p>

<p>However, that doesn&#39;t prove that nothing happened. How is the average civilian going to obtain such evidence? You won&#39;t find incriminating photos of high level politicians underneath the fridge. This doesn&#39;t mean that they haven&#39;t engaged in anything  questionable, pizzagate or otherwise.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also rarely ever mentioned that dealing in such incriminating evidence would be a life/death situation for the people involved. If the accusations are to be believed, the people implicated would have no problem killing off someone to avoid exposure.</p>

<p>Lastly, if this is really occurring, Republicans are almost certainly in on it as well. If not, they&#39;d have taken advantage and exposed it -but they&#39;re not going to do that if their own people are implicated. We already know of one who got busted, Dennis Hastert. he is mentioned by name in Podesta e-mails along with the bizarre phrase &quot;This traffic is really warm and really weird in light of Hastert. Boy that&#39;s sad.&quot; </p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t be a partisan issue, but it inevitably becomes one because a lot of people are incapable of thinking outside the Red/Blue box. </p>

<p>Thank you for this and the rest of your comment. The DNC hacks/Podesta emails, and other info that&#39;s been leaked about the Democrats really makes me wonder 1) What are they hiding over on the Right because everyone knows there&#39;s virtually no difference between the DNC and the RNC and 2) Why hasn&#39;t anyone even made an attempt to hack them yet? No one can tell me it&#39;s just that &quot;DNC servers were more vulnerable&quot; or whatever because that&#39;s bullshit. Also I distinctly remember Pence <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/17/vice-president-elect-mike-pence-has-his-own-email-dispute-in-indiana/?utm_term=.8ed84315d31a">fighting tooth and nail</a> to make sure his emails never got made public record. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya the whole trump vs Hillary thing has really clouded our ability to discuss this shit rationally. The closer we get to the truth the more obfuscated things become. This seems to be manufactured and I would advice you not to let the CTR/ Trump equivalent to misdirect your efforts. I&#39;ve stopped arguing points I know to be true, like when someone comes in saying Hillary has never broken the law and isn&#39;t corrupt. Why bother to give them the piles of evidence to the contrary? Never had this resulted in a &quot;o wow I never realized how wrong I was. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.&quot; It is met with brazen denial and deflection. They are here to give the appearance of opposition, that they have no leg to stand on doesn&#39;t matter. People casually viewing, and forming an opinion, see people rallying against it. Even if they are demonstrably wrong, it looks like the jury is out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just so you know Trump praises everyone irrespective of the background of the person,I saw the Indian Trump meet,in which he said we all love Hindu people,we all love India,he is a businessman,he doesn&#39;t maintain no fuss with anyone,I am from India and no our demography is quite different from what he suggested,the same thing with Epstien,just for the sake of moment he praised him.</p>

<p>The guy wholeheartedly congratulated Obama during inauguration,it was in his expression,no wonder the TPTB ridiculed him and even Obama who has nothing to do with next term has ridiculed him.</p>

<p>So,that Epstien Quote that he is a terrific guy is just a way of mediocre say for Donald,that&#39;s his Make America Great Again rhetoric,that&#39;s why I don&#39;t take this guys word as ultimate confirmation of his quality,this guy is a kid,he has good intentions and he is smart.</p>

<p>Anyway its my personal feeling that he is kind of good in his heart and has a better intention for this world,apart from that every fact has to be questioned.</p>

<p>I truly believe Trump is some form of a genius just not the kind people understand.</p>

<p>I sort of agree with this too. His public persona has fooled a lot of people and led them to severely underestimate him. That&#39;s one of the things I really like about him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, it&#39;s definitely not an easy job for them, and I have much respect for them for dedicating time to keep this sub up and running. But since the election, the quality of posts has absolutely declined, and we even had one moderator resign in protest of the failing state of this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I diddn&#39;t downvote but neither is it a mystery why there&#39;s no pedo ring connection to Trump: we don&#39;t have any damning emails, and he&#39;s not self-professed <em>best friends</em> with half a dozen convicted child rapists and traffickers.</p>

<p>The same can&#39;t be said for Hillary or Podesta, who frequently brag about being buddies with Dennis Hastert, Laura Silsby and Jeremy Epstein.</p>
