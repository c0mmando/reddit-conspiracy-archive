    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t teach the bible because of separation of church and state. Go to a Christian private school and they&#39;ll teach it to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bible is actually true</p>

<p>How do you know? What evidence do you have?</p>

<p>So the story of Jesus putting his hands on a leper without contracting leprosy are true? The creation story is true? The Flood story is true? People living for 200+ years is true?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget that Christians can&#39;t even agree what the Bible says, so how are they supposed to teach it? You&#39;d have a million kids all with a different interpretation of scripture. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/jwRo1hLFpLQ">I can link to videos too</a>.This one is about the failure of evidence of the Bible.

    <div class="md"><p>Well to be honest, I haven&#39;t gotten very far. I work about 50 hours a week if you include my commute. And I have a very rambunctious four-year-old when home, sandwiched in between whenever I have a few spare moments. Which is hard to do with a book that requires such focus. </p>

<p>So far what I have read has been very interesting. I am looking forward to finishing it eventually. I think I have considered myself very conscious almost my whole life but I definitely would love to explore what is possible. I did see one thing that HLI said was possible because of  consciousness, the ability to use telepathy. Very curious to know more about that. I also do believe in divine healing, laying on of hands, though I do think there are way too many charlatans out there in that regard. I&#39;m skeptical of some of the Christian healing ministries I&#39;ve seen. I think they put on too much of a show.
I&#39;m also fascinated and have practiced some qigong and so is discovering some of the different knowledge especially knowledge that has less to do with morality and more to do with what I believe is our birthright, The ability to create the way that God creates. I really do think the possibilities are endless</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Curious if you&#39;ve taken a moment to look at Peter Thiel and some of the fascinating things he promotes... consciousness, immortality, futuristic projects like Sea Steading, and what do you think about those poignant words in Trumps inaugural speech, specifically this part: </p>

<p>&quot;Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.</p>

<p>We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.</p>

<p>We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The telepathy thing blew me away as well - &quot;one who can detect the subtle interplay between minds&quot;
I was raised in the church- African style - and was turned off the idea of religion growing up as a result. I know exactly what you mean about the charlatans - they&#39;re the no.1 faith destroyers. 
The limits imposed on us from young are intentional, I think our true potential is unimaginably high. I&#39;ve noticed I&#39;ve grown considerably more optimistic about the future &amp; the world since researching into these subjects- I don&#39;t feel like a kite anymore, more like an anchor. What a time to be alive eh</p>
