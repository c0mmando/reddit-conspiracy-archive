       The Bible is actually real and they want you to think it's fake. That is why they don't teach it in schools and instead teach the bs theory of evolution.

       Bingo. I do believe the bible has been altered over the years and things have been taken out. My dad use to read about revelations all the time and as a kid it freaked me out but as I mature and grow older it all is starting to make sense.

       They don't teach the bible because of separation of church and state. Go to a Christian private school and they'll teach it to you.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Bible is actually true
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How do you know? What evidence do you have?
      </p>
      <p>
       So the story of Jesus putting his hands on a leper without contracting leprosy are true? The creation story is true? The Flood story is true? People living for 200+ years is true?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's not forget that Christians can't even agree what the Bible says, so how are they supposed to teach it? You'd have a million kids all with a different interpretation of scripture.

       .This one is about the failure of evidence of the Bible. If I'm remembering correctly, he also quoted a verse from the bible that pretty much says "if a nonbelievers asks for evidence, give it to them" which was spoken by Jesus

       Do you believe in genetics? Do you believe in eugenics? Microevolution? That's evolution at work. Just put that on a massive scale. Why is it so hard to believe? Humans have turned wolves into pugs in a few centuries. Speciation is something that's difficult to record because it takes so long.

       Jesus is lord.  Why do you think the powers that be hate him so much?  Why do you think there is such a huge propaganda campaign against "evil" Christians?  The New Testament is a warning, everything Jesus said about the synagogue of Satan is true and is coming into fruition.

       The Bible itself is a product of over two centuries of conspiracies building up on top of each other to form the book you see today. Old men get together and write stories and rules, claiming to come from God, in order to make themselves more powerful and influential. Religion is the oldest conspiracy of all.

       Jesus, or Yeshua, was real person. His teachings did not align with the church (making money off people), so the church chose certain books to go into the bible. They invented hell and the christian god to keep people ignorant about their own divinity.

       Well to be honest, I haven't gotten very far. I work about 50 hours a week if you include my commute. And I have a very rambunctious four-year-old when home, sandwiched in between whenever I have a few spare moments. Which is hard to do with a book that requires such focus.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far what I have read has been very interesting. I am looking forward to finishing it eventually. I think I have considered myself very conscious almost my whole life but I definitely would love to explore what is possible. I did see one thing that HLI said was possible because of  consciousness, the ability to use telepathy. Very curious to know more about that. I also do believe in divine healing, laying on of hands, though I do think there are way too many charlatans out there in that regard. I'm skeptical of some of the Christian healing ministries I've seen. I think they put on too much of a show.
I'm also fascinated and have practiced some qigong and so is discovering some of the different knowledge especially knowledge that has less to do with morality and more to do with what I believe is our birthright, The ability to create the way that God creates. I really do think the possibilities are endless

       Curious if you've taken a moment to look at Peter Thiel and some of the fascinating things he promotes... consciousness, immortality, futuristic projects like Sea Steading, and what do you think about those poignant words in Trumps inaugural speech, specifically this part:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
      </p>

       We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.

       The telepathy thing blew me away as well - "one who can detect the subtle interplay between minds"
I was raised in the church- African style - and was turned off the idea of religion growing up as a result. I know exactly what you mean about the charlatans - they're the no.1 faith destroyers. 
The limits imposed on us from young are intentional, I think our true potential is unimaginably high. I've noticed I've grown considerably more optimistic about the future &amp; the world since researching into these subjects- I don't feel like a kite anymore, more like an anchor. What a time to be alive eh
