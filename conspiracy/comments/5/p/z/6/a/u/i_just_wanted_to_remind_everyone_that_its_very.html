    <div class="md"><p>I assumed we were talking about cable news. Your article is talking about both prime time <em>and</em> day time. Prime time is usually dominated by ESPN and TBS <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/cable-ratings-only-espn-tops-fox-news-cnn-in-primetime/">(source)</a>. So this is the first year that Fox News did both.</p>

<p>However, of cable news networks, Fox is the champ. In 2012, Fox News had been the #1 rated cable news channel for eleven consecutive years <a href="http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/randy-hall/2013/01/08/fox-news-channel-ends-2012-top-ratings-11th-straight-year">(source)</a>. 2014 was another year of continued <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/2014-cable-news-ratings-cnn-beats-msnbc-in-primetime-demo-fox-still-1/">dominance</a>. So basically, yes, Fox is far more popular than CNN or MSNBC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m as certain as anyone could possibly be that Trump is not on the side of the baby-eaters.  And no, I&#39;m not gonna try to offer up proof, people can take the statement or leave it.  I&#39;ve been following this madcap election for a year and a half now, and based on everything I&#39;ve learned in aggregate, Trump, while certainly not perfect, is not a kid-fucker.</p>

<p>I am hesitant to give the entire GOP credit for &quot;not being baby-eaters&quot; because--let&#39;s face it--for the most part, R and D are both uniparty globalists offering an illusion of choice.  But I do think there are &quot;a few good men&quot; left, folks like Mattis, Chaffetz and Pence, who are not down with Spirits and the Cooking thereof.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of sick $#!+ in this world that I&#39;ve only just learned about.  Trump has been carrying that knowledge for probably half a century now.  Good on him for finally having had enough of it and seizing this one opportunity to strike.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say we should always be critical of &quot;leaders&quot;, especially in a democracy. A healthy amount of skepticism and challenging the narrative is a great way to keep a check on government. If they can back up what they&#39;re doing and prove they&#39;re doing good then great, the skepticism helped boost credibility. If they either keep quiet, lie, or you end up exposing something bad then great, your skepticism helped expose the government for what they really are.<br/>
Obviously what I&#39;m saying is very open ended and broad, but for good cause. Because this sort of attitude can, and should, be applied to pretty much everything. It&#39;s called critical thinking skills, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that it&#39;s not (commonly) taught in schools these days. At least when I was in school the only critical thinking course we were offered was a once a week optional additional lesson during the last two years of school. And it was essay based. Pssh, yeah like that&#39;s gonna sell it to a bunch of 17-18 year olds who already have enough stress from the abhorrent school system on their plates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem comes when you actually need qualified people in government to do stuff properly. You can&#39;t just make everyone dumb as fuck and then live happily. The more incompetent people are, the more they are prone to mistakes in critical jobs, the easier it then becomes to expose wrongdoings in the government, because of the mistakes people make. All financial criminals were extremely intelligent people, who knew and were willing to gamble the system. So the tricky part for the government is to make the education system be able to produce competent staff, while simultaneously make people obedient workers without much of critical thinking skills. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we need to be critical of is the idea of &#39;leaders&#39; and authority at all.  Authority is not something that truly exists among mankind- it is a claim made by one group/person that another group/person chooses to agree to and accept.  That&#39;s it.  It&#39;s an agreement built on a false belief- the belief that any person has the right to dictate what other people are allowed or not allowed to do.  </p>

<p>There is inherent, objective truth that we can discover and come to understand in this universe.  The natural law of the universe is about understanding the true difference between right and wrong action.  And to define natural law is easy and self-evident: we don&#39;t have the right to initiate violence against or steal from other beings, whether that is theft of property, physical well-being or life.  Such action is wrong action in this universe, 100% of the time; it always has been and always will be wrong.  Understanding the objective truth of natural law is simple; whether it is easy or not for a being to live accordingly is another question.  The founding fathers of the United States of America understood natural law and that the idea of the authority of <em>man</em> over any other is untrue and illegitimate.  That  all men are of &quot;separate and equal station to which the <em>Laws of Nature</em> and <em>Nature&#39;s God</em> entitle them&quot; (Declaration of Independence, 1776 [emphasis my own]).  And furthermore the founders of this country held &quot;these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&quot; (Dec. of Independence, 1776).  This is the understanding of natural law and true freedom.</p>

<p>So if the authority of man is an invalid supposition, then any institution which claims authority over others, such as GOVERNMENT, is illegitimate and has no such authority.  Because an individual cannot delegate a right that they don&#39;t have to someone else.  And if we as individuals don&#39;t have the right to initiate violence and aggression against other people, we cannot bestow that right on any other person or group of people.  The institution of government is one that extorts money and resources from people at the threat of violent action against them.  If you do not do what the government tells you you should do, if you do not pay the ransom the government demands you pay for your &#39;freedom&#39;, then the government will send in its gang of armed thugs (the police and military) to forcibly put you in a cage or murder you.  This is the agreement we all unthinkingly accept and condone by conferring authority to government and then obeying their threatening commands.  I own me; you own you.  End of story.  The only authority that any man can claim is over himself, anything else is WRONG action and in violation of the laws of nature.  </p>

<p>And to define natural law is easy and self-evident: we don&#39;t have the right to initiate violence against or steal from other beings, whether that is theft of property, physical well-being or life. Such action is wrong action in this universe, 100% of the time; it always has been and always will be wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Total bullshit. How the fuck did evolution happen without conflict? No, before ‘Government’ we were all happy hippies in a 24hour circle-jerk.</p>

<p>People have always been in conflict with each other, and always will be, it always has been and always will be.</p>

<p>This comment is just more classic American pseudo-religious worship for the ‘Founding Fathers’ who just happened to be a rich bunch of old whiteys who <em>owned other people</em> ffs, and then had the audacity to talk about the rights of men.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the authority of man over any other is untrue and illegitimate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmmm, unless you bought them at the slave market, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So if the authority of man is an invalid supposition, then any institution which claims authority over others, such as GOVERNMENT, is illegitimate and has no such authority.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the Founders come up with this idea that no man can rule another, and then instantly join the Government that rules over everyone?</p>

<p>While I agree that Governments are bullshit your ideas are very immature, the Founding Fathers were no better than the current group of elites we have right now in Government and in fact much less accountable. </p>

<p>There are no natural laws beyond survival of the fittest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; got us as a species to pretty much here, now, we&#39;ve developed and provided ourselves with the means to be able to transcend the need for conflict. We, as a species, have achieved global colonisation and instant global communication. We know that we share the same air and water with everything else on this planet, we know that everything must live in harmony and balance to stay alive as every species depends on another in one way or another - the circle of life. We have provided ourselves with the knowledge and means to healthily maintain that balance, and the knowledge that if that balance is upset too far in any direction then there will be a collapse. We know it&#39;s possible that we can maintain this while also expanding ourselves as a species further into the cosmos, and as individuals and a species expanding our consciousness. So why don&#39;t we?<br/>
Choosing now, of all times, to get selfish is going to end up with a complete collapse of the global ecosystem that holds us all in balance. We know that, and we can see that in real time happening - climate change. Yes, government has been a useful means to keep us &quot;in order&quot; to get us to this far, but we don&#39;t need that anymore. We have the knowledge and means as a species to transcend the need for a central governing body of any kind. This time in human history, as we currently know it, has never been before. This is all new to us. So we need to be careful in paving our way to a new way of living: a way that works in harmony with nature and the planet. Because we are nature. These bodies our consciousness inhabits evolved on this planet to live from the fruit of the planet. This is information we need to spread to see ourselves into this new age of man sensibly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would call myself an anarchist in the literal sense of the word- the root being from the Greek <em>a/an</em> meaning negation or against and <em>archon</em> meaning ruler.  So <em>anarchy</em> is the state of having no rulers.  And I 100% support having no rulers or masters, because to not have a master is true freedom.</p>

<p>What anarchy is not, to me, is a state of no <em>rules</em>.  I know the laws of nature to be true and to say there should be no rules is entering into the dangerous realm of moral relativism and solipsism.  When you enter &quot;define anarchy&quot; into Google, the first definition you get is &quot;a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority&quot;, with related words like lawlessness, chaos, mayhem, turmoil, etc.  </p>

<p>The concept of anarchy has been co-opted by the dark forces that hold the real reins of power on this planet.  They took a word that means having no masters, which is to be truly free, and contorted its meaning and connotation to be one of chaos and disorder.  So I&#39;m not sure how you are defining anarchy but I completely reject the far-leftist label.  True anarchy, true freedom of the individual over themselves, has nothing to do with the left/right false dialectic that we call politics today.  It is a divide and conquer strategy that pits one group against the others and ultimately perpetuates suffering on this planet.  I am a human being who stands for right, moral action and condemns suffering and slavery of all forms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it is disturbing to see how much of a psyop has been done on humanity to the point that the idea of <em>not</em> having a ruling class threatening you with violence if you don&#39;t pay them = a lawless society of violent people threatening you...it&#39;s the pot calling the kettle black and a complete logical fallacy.  </p>

<p>I think that human nature is aligned with the laws of nature; we all experience pain and possess the consciousness to understand right from wrong.  Humanity&#39;s natural inclination is to cooperate and work together.  The success of the individual is almost always predicated on the success of the group, and so placing value on the well-being of the individual naturally creates a group made up of well individuals.  This process of cooperation happens organically, utterly regardless of whether there is an authority like government in the picture.  All this ruling class, that we&#39;re calling government, is doing is demanding a percentage of each person&#39;s resources and labor for the ability to...what, work together like they were doing anyway?  So it isn&#39;t for the ability to build and accomplish things together that we pay this ruling class.  What it comes down to is paying the ruling class not to initiate violence against us and put us in a cage, because &#39;they&#39; made a &#39;law&#39; that we have to pay &#39;them&#39;.  And that&#39;s nothing more than an armed gang of violent people preying on the human community.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so funny how the liberal lies get out there before the truth. Sean Spicer didn&#39;t even know about the gag order. He was asked about it during the press conference today.</p>

<p>You have to understand that every media source you get your &quot;news&quot; is going to make up stuff, and they are going to work with moles in the US government to turn everything into a scandal.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what happened yet either, but I did read a news article that these places were pushing out liberal stuff after Trump was inaugurated. So you can imagine someone noticed it and shut it down. It&#39;s a trap set by Obama and the left and the media.</p>

<p>Trump thinks that you can take less than 10 years to build a bridge and still be a good steward of the environment. I don&#39;t consider pipelines to  be bad for the environment except for when people blow them up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps I showed you the wrong picture. But like I said anyone who watched any of the live streams can tell you that the picture they were using was taken from earlier on. There were also protesters blocking entrances as we saw on the livestreams. I&#39;m not saying this one was bigger than 2009, because it wasn&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I do agree with you. I could tell from the first time that the photo surfaced it could&#39;ve easily just been taken at an inopportune time...</p>

<p>With that said, it doesn&#39;t really change anything. The crowd size was obviously significantly different than 2009. So idk why the President has decided to make it a point to argue otherwise. </p>

<p>Sure the timing of the picture that most MSM used is certainly questionable, the point that crowd sizes were significantly smaller than before is not. Like I&#39;ve shown before, other pictures and statistical information from the public transit website can confirm this. </p>

<p>This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sean Spicer <sup><sup>^</sup></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I was explaining about the numbers.  We did a thing yesterday at the speech.  Did everybody like the speech?  (Applause.)  I’ve been given good reviews.  But we had a massive field of people.  You saw them.  Packed.  I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field.  I say, wait a minute, I made a speech.  I looked out, the field was -- it looked like a million, million and a half people.  They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there.  And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well.  I said, it was almost raining, the rain should have scared them away, but God looked down and he said, we’re not going to let it rain on your speech. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, when I first started, I said, oh, no.  The first line, I got hit by a couple of drops.  And I said, oh, this is too bad, but we’ll go right through it.  But the truth is that it stopped immediately.  It was amazing.  And then it became really sunny.  And then I walked off and it poured right after I left.  It poured.  But, you know, we have something that’s amazing because we had -- it looked -- honestly, it looked like a million and a half people.  Whatever it was, it was.  But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument.  And I turn on -- and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field.  And it said we drew 250,000 people.  Now, that’s not bad, but it’s a lie.  We had 250,000 people literally around -- you know, in the little bowl that we constructed.  That was 250,000 people.  The rest of the 20-block area, all the way back to the Washington Monument, was packed.  So we caught them, and we caught them in a beauty.  And I think they’re going to pay a big price.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People sworn to uphold the political party have taken the place of those who should have the Constitution and the American people as their top priority.  </p>

<p>Nothing else matters from the top down, other than remaining in power. I understand that it has been evident for decades, but it truly ramped up during the final years of the Bush presidency. And once the Republicans got their &quot;mandate&quot; during the &#39;10 mid terms the defiance increased ten fold. If the OTHER guys want something WE must oppose it...As seen in the TPP posts on r/politics yesterday, Trump pulled us out of a trade deal that would be bad for our country and the script on reddit flipped because HE did it.   </p>

<p>Commenters then proceded to attack Russia and putin for being involved in foreign elections, not even realising how hypocritical their allegations were. Just to remind you: The US <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-us-intervention-foreign-elections-20161213-story.html">has attempted to influence foreign presidential elections as much as 81 times only from 1946 to 2000</a>.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Apparently not, according to representatives of this UN peace council.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same people who put the Saudi&#39;s in charge of the human rights council, a country that still persecutes women for going out in public without a male chaperone, and executes people for witchcraft and heresy, all stuff most of the rest of the world grew out of in the 1800&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also this independent journalist who went to Aleppo to see for herself what was going on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has no bearing on Assad&#39;s past deeds at all just one persons take on things based on her current situation which hardly has the resources to see more than what affects her and the people she&#39;s &quot;embedded&quot; with. Also there are tons of other &quot;independent reporters&quot; who have various different opinions reporting from Syria, just go into r/syriancivilwar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course you didn&#39;t even watch the videos. They go into great detail about who they talked to, what they learned, and why things are being portrayed the way they are.</p>

<p>But if your whole point in discrediting these representatives is that the UN is evil then why are these guys going against the narrative of the UN? AFAIK the UN has provided support and resources for the fight against Assad yet these representatives are saying that Assad is not the brutal dictator everyone is saying he is. Ad hominems usually don&#39;t work when trying to argue, it&#39;s an ineffective fallacy.</p>

<p>And really that video of the journalist was kind of supporting material, not to be used as stand-alone evidence. The meat of the argument comes from that council, and I just provided that journalist&#39;s testimony as kind of a show that the representatives weren&#39;t blowing hot air. They weren&#39;t the only ones saying the widely accepted narrative was false.</p>

<p>Dude I&#39;m at work get off your high horse I&#39;m not watching your 52 minute and 24 minute video on shit I already know about. Even asking someone to take 52 minutes of my life rather than just laying out your own evidence is bullshit and somewhat selfish, that stuff should be attributed as the source for said argument rather than forcing me or anyone else to sit through it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you think the &quot;narrative&quot; of the UN is, the UN is just like any other political body, there are different factions that are competing to pull the strings and usually those factions differ depending on who or what is in charge of what and which. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>AFAIK the UN has provided support and resources for the fight against Assad yet these representatives are saying that Assad is not the brutal dictator everyone is saying he is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said different factions favor different groups, like you said they&#39;re obviously supporting the fight against him yet saying &quot;he&#39;s not such a bad guy&quot; obviously conflicts with that so you figure out which it is or go ahead and confirm your bias either or, the main thing is which country&#39;s rep. is saying this, if it&#39;s Iran of course they are saying that he&#39;s their longstanding ally, same with Palestine/Lebannon, if it&#39;s Russia, well duh he&#39;s their horse that they&#39;re backing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ad hominems usually don&#39;t work when trying to argue, it&#39;s an ineffective fallacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said I&#39;m replying with what I can use right now, the UN is a corrupt organization made up of many factions, of course they will have conflicting positions on a major event in world history and current events, fallacies be damned, just use your brain man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They weren&#39;t the only ones saying the widely accepted narrative was false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well most of the other places that the &quot;accepted narrative&quot; is being challenged are coming from Russian funded Macedonian fake news/propaganda pushers, so that instantly fucks up your argument here, believe me I&#39;ve seen my fair share in r/syriancivilwar in the earlier days of that sub. It&#39;s a fairly standard Russian intel tactic, but this is r/conspiracy where we&#39;re blinded to Russian malfeasance because the US is the &quot;evil empire&quot; or whatever. they&#39;re just another player in the game trying to win, just like we are.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you can quote the textual definition of patriotism, but you&#39;re missing the forest for the trees. Patriotism is a concept that espouses standing up for the ideals of your country, and one of America&#39;s ideals is that all men are equal under law, no man gets to do whatever he wants just because of his position. That the presidents power is derived from the will of the people, not of his own. Being skeptical of those in power is part of that, and those values are enshrined in the very fabric of our country. </p>

<p>&quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.&quot;</p>

One of the first ideals of this country is that we CAN do whatever we want within our professional and personal positions, inside the parameters of the law.  You can even argue, doing what we want because of our new position is why America is even a country today.</p>

<p>Why did you delete the two other times you made this exact comment? You can do just a good of job as me looking through my history. Use google. I&#39;ve been here for a while bud. &quot;honkimon&quot; site:reddit.com/conspiracy It only goes back to 2014 though. Theres a 250gb torrent out there you can download that has all reddit comments up to 2015 if you&#39;re really that concerned. Guess what? I don&#39;t like Trump. So if that&#39;s all you&#39;re trying to prove I&#39;m just messing up. But as I&#39;ve said I don&#39;t like any of the other past presidents either. Can&#39;t think of one where the good shit they did outweighed the bad. JFK had potential though...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, here&#39;s the problem. The thing that I am most skeptical about more than anything at this current moment in time, is the Main Stream Media. They just spent the last year lying their asses off trying to prop up one of the worst presidential candidates imaginable, while simultaneously propping up the three candidates Hillary had the best chance against, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, and President Trump. Then, after they successfully got Trump the nomination, continued to demonize him via every form of media at an unprecedented level, while refusing to cover any of the ridiculousness that was the DNC&#39;s entire 2016 presidential race.</p>

<p>So forgive me if I&#39;m skeptical of your &quot;skepticism&quot;. I think we all need to collectively chill the fuck out for a few weeks and see what happens. Personally, I liked his message at the inauguration, and I like how he handled Obamacare (didn&#39;t fully remove it) and TPP. Two things we would not have seen under a Clinton presidency.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so tired of people coming to this sub with accusations that &quot;isn&#39;t this sub supposed to be skeptical of our government??!??&quot;</p>

<p>Yea, as far as I&#39;ve seen so far, the establishment fucking lost. If that starts to change, I&#39;ll be the first one to call bullshit. But for now, there&#39;s way too much hate for anyone to even believe this could work.</p>

<p>When will weeks turn to months turn to years? When will putting a gag order on services I pay for with my tax dollars be an acceptable practice? It&#39;s our job and this subreddit&#39;s job to pick it all apart from as many angles as we can just like we did for Obama and just like we did for Bush. Politicians are guilty before proven innocent and this isn&#39;t a cheerleading squad. If you want to have your partisan ego stroked go to one of the subs that are designed for that. This one needs to stay centered and objective and paranoid. </p>

<p>Centered and objective does not = despise Trump and everything he does! I&#39;m complaining about the people like you who accuse me as being the partisan one, while you try to spread Trump hate. </p>

<p>Be skeptical of government, sure. No shit. But for the first time in US history, we have a President that came directly from the private sector, bypassing all military or government positions that usually precede a presidency.</p>

<p>Hence, why I say give the man a chance to fuck up before just assuming that he&#39;s the devil and the end of America.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trump owes hundreds of millions to foreign-owned companies </p></li>
<li><p>Neither you, nor I know how much he owes because he refuses to do a financial disclosure, which he promised </p></li>
<li><p>His team has consistently communicated with Russia</p></li>

<li><p>he criticized the CIA - which this sub fully supported - and now says he loves them, they are the best. That&#39;s like a span of a month. </p></li>
<li><p>He appoint his children to positions of leadership within the White House, probably because he needs that unconditional support. You&#39;ve seen all the leaks today, I&#39;m sure. </p></li>

<p>Get an argument and people will talk about it and discuss the issue. To be honest this post is pretty much &quot;hey it&#39;s ok to hate your govt&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s bullshit - it was never even remotely implied in the mainstream that it was racist to question the government under Obama - what was fucking racist was much of the opposition.  Let&#39;s not act like it wasn&#39;t.  Maybe not you in particular (and I certainly can fault the administration on many things - the ACA was a shitty deal for the middle class, the drone war escalated, we let Russia annex significant portions of Ukraine, the NSA debacle that had basically put a hush on real dissent, the ongoing militarization of the police, the list goes on and on).  But many many people did not like Obama because he was black.  I worked with guys who would yell the N-word at the TV when he came on the news in the crew house.  I have been around numerous people who thought he was a secret Muslim born in Kenya - that&#39;s all bullshit - he didn&#39;t take any guns, he didn&#39;t institute Shariah law, he was a relatively average American politician.</p>

<p>Same as it ever was. The job of the media who are run by the same corporations that have a stranglehold on our government is to keep us divided just enough so that we&#39;re still productive but also not killing each other. They were really testing the dials with the latest election though. Going back to the radios in the living rooms and print newspapers it has never been easy to find real news that actually matters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just wanted to let everyone know that I personally would never be critical of my government - to do so on the other Internet of all places - such a public forum! - could influence the beliefs and potentially the actions of many people.  To do so would be dangerous, unpatriotic, and could damage my Facebook-Sesame Credit score when it is inevitably implemented (if it doesn&#39;t already exist).  To the ever-present ears of the internet security apparatus presently searching the Internet - you&#39;ve found another completely not-disillusioned American who is totally in favor of conforming to the whims of the new administration.</p>

<p>Indeed I find that the best course of action is to sit back and let the smart guys in Washington DC do their job without a critical eye and with unfaltering loyalty to the cause.  I can&#39;t let things like the definition of factual, or the definition of reality get in the way of our combined struggle to make the world safe, democratic, and prosperous.  Indeed those are just words - the only thing that matters are the inherently accurate words and intrinsically ethical goals of the new administration as we mobilize as a society to take on the rising threat of East Asia.</p>

<p>That people are protesting the wrong things (Trump is not a threat to women&#39;s rights, the oligarchy is a threat to humanity).</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter is he is or isn&#39;t. The women march was a demonstration of resistance to the rhetoric of a man they do not support. People claiming that it is &quot;the wrong&quot; thing to have activism about is along the same lines as the point of my post. It is their right to do so just like my right to be critical of this administration and those that want to stifle dissent, even if you don&#39;t agree with it, ARE the problem. </p>

<p>Well, for starters, a man that says, &quot;I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn&#39;t get there. I did try to fuck her. She was married&quot; being awarded the highest office in the land. He is on tape recounting how he tried to seduce a married woman, and instead of the public shouting him down as a hypocrite for representing the &quot;part of family values,&quot; they reward him with the presidency.</p>

<p>Then, of course, there are other issues, like his intention to restrict women from receiving the vital health care they need from places like Planned Parenthood, who perform cancer screenings and routine checkups for millions of women each year.  Not that you give a shit about that, I&#39;m sure. </p>

<p>And, many of them are probably scared to lose provisions in the ACA like insurance companies denying applicants for pre-existing conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is, the media has so thoroughly presented the guy as the most terrible human being imaginable, an inconceivably racist and misogynistic white man that is unfit to serve as president.</p>

<p>This was the persona they created for him for months, so now that he has won, millions of women are outraged that this demon is now their leader.</p>

<p>Have you ever met the President? Has 99.8% of the women marching ever met him? No? Then everything that you think about him is a construction of media. </p>

<p>&quot;But I can just SEE what he said for myself!!!! They are HIS words that the media is repeating!!!&quot; blah blah blah. Out of context quotes seem to contradict his personality compared to EVERYONE that meets him.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m wasting my breath, and you&#39;re just going to downvote me with all 5 of your accounts, but at least I tried.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not supporting Trump. I&#39;m supporting whatever is worse for the establishment. And right now, at this moment, he has yet to do ANYTHING that the establishment is in favor of. As soon as he does, I&#39;ll grab my pitchfork.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that its important to be critical of government.  People have been doing that for thousands of years.  Even when governments or sovereigns didn&#39;t allow people to publicly disapprove the people would still find a way to talk amoungst themselves.</p>

<p>With todays climate of unrest and not any real unification on principals the only thing this causes is mistrust in our citizens judgement through out the world.  Since we live beyond our borders and everything hinges on world views and economics,  to lose trust causes us to damage our future.</p>

<p>If there were demostrations that focused on principals that the majority of people stand behind then it would appear that our grievances have merit.  Unfortunately with people everyone has a gripe and most of this is expressed through constant demostrating which water downs the power of free speech.  </p>

<p>Even through out demostraters they have not agreed over why they are demostrating.  They basicly just don&#39;t like the guy running the country and even before a problem arises they demostrate in case it does come up as if a possibly has merit.</p>

<p>Who loses?  Our children and our livelyhood.  When so many voices start yelling about so many different thoughts of disagreements,the only thing that is accomplished is a crowd yelling and no one listening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately Donald Trump and the way he spoke about both women, racial, and gender minorities, among swaths of other individual groups of people was honestly quite offensive and I do not stand for any of it and I don’t stand or support a president that embodies some of those ideals. I attended the women’s march in Washington because I support my wife and my daughter and I stand by them in their disapproval of that rhetoric. It’s that simple and as much as the movement gets discredited for not being focused enough is ridiculous. It’s pretty simple actually, the man has a track record of saying sexist shit and people disapprove of him representing us. </p>

<p>They have always been the same. You said the MSM was caught with their pants down, while in reality they have always been in the bag for Trump and they have been the most popular establishment pick.</p>

<p>When will weeks turn to months turn to years? When will putting a gag order on services I pay for with my tax dollars be an acceptable practice? It&#39;s our job and this subreddit&#39;s job to pick it all apart from as many angles as we can just like we did for Obama and just like we did for Bush. Politicians are guilty before proven innocent and this isn&#39;t a cheerleading squad. If you want to have your partisan ego stroked go to one of the subs that are designed for that. This one needs to stay centered and objective and paranoid. </p>

If only there was a channel for constructive communication between both sides, and the media is unfortunately the antithesis for that. A lot of education has to happen on both sides, so that we can get past the idea that one group can impose lifestyle choices on the other (lifestyle choices that ultimately don&#39;t harm others&#39; lifestyle choices)... so that we can all focus on the common enemy that is economic insecurity/inequality. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Of course you didn&#39;t even watch the videos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dude I&#39;m at work get off your high horse I&#39;m not watching your 52 minute and 24 minute video on shit I already know about. Even asking someone to take 52 minutes of my life rather than just laying out your own evidence is bullshit and somewhat selfish, that stuff should be attributed as the source for said argument rather than forcing me or anyone else to sit through it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But if your whole point in discrediting these representatives is that the UN is evil then why are these guys going against the narrative of the UN?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you think the &quot;narrative&quot; of the UN is, the UN is just like any other political body, there are different factions that are competing to pull the strings and usually those factions differ depending on who or what is in charge of what and which. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>AFAIK the UN has provided support and resources for the fight against Assad yet these representatives are saying that Assad is not the brutal dictator everyone is saying he is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said different factions favor different groups, like you said they&#39;re obviously supporting the fight against him yet saying &quot;he&#39;s not such a bad guy&quot; obviously conflicts with that so you figure out which it is or go ahead and confirm your bias either or, the main thing is which country&#39;s rep. is saying this, if it&#39;s Iran of course they are saying that he&#39;s their longstanding ally, same with Palestine/Lebannon, if it&#39;s Russia, well duh he&#39;s their horse that they&#39;re backing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ad hominems usually don&#39;t work when trying to argue, it&#39;s an ineffective fallacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said I&#39;m replying with what I can use right now, the UN is a corrupt organization made up of many factions, of course they will have conflicting positions on a major event in world history and current events, fallacies be damned, just use your brain man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They weren&#39;t the only ones saying the widely accepted narrative was false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well most of the other places that the &quot;accepted narrative&quot; is being challenged are coming from Russian funded Macedonian fake news/propaganda pushers, so that instantly fucks up your argument here, believe me I&#39;ve seen my fair share in r/syriancivilwar in the earlier days of that sub. It&#39;s a fairly standard Russian intel tactic, but this is r/conspiracy where we&#39;re blinded to Russian malfeasance because the US is the &quot;evil empire&quot; or whatever. they&#39;re just another player in the game trying to win, just like we are.   </p>
