    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your time James, ever since I discovered your work I&#39;ve been listening every day. Your insight into this strange world we live in is incredible and a breath of fresh air in our incresingly more polarised society.</p>

<p>Given the scandals surrounding climate science and the IPCC, and the problems of absolute control under a scientific dictatorship/technocracy, I&#39;m curious to hear some ideas regarding the inevitable food and energy crises, problems with e-waste and resource depletion. Will technology save us all? As someone who generally believes that technology can and should be harnessed for good I feel it&#39;s an obivous choice to be sustainable and renewable as a service to the environment we live, eat and breathe in, regardless of any climate change.</p>

<p>One radical idea I have heard to prevent catastrophe is to impose technological limits on society (including destorying cities and depopulating) to prevent humans from creating technologically advanced weapons and war, until human biology has evolved violent tendencies out of its DNA. This of course lies on the premise that violence is a part of human nature; do you think humans are violent as a result of evolution, or that it is perhaps caused by other factors such as environment?</p>

<p>Any thoughts on alternate states of mind and consciousness such as meditation and other spiritual practices? Cannabis is always a hot-topic for governments, but rarely are psychedelics like psilocybin, LSD or other drugs such as MDMA and modafinil (a nootropic) discussed in a positive or even neutral light in the MSM.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the conspiracy scene like in Japan?</p>

<p>Space elevator and space-based solar can do it. Solar arrays are much more efficient in space, and a space elevator would cut the launch costs to a tiny fraction of today&#39;s cost.</p>

<p>Fill up geosynchronous orbit with solar satellites, beam the power back to earth, and you&#39;ve got hundreds of times as much energy, at a tiny fraction of the cost, with no pollution or climate change.</p>

<p>Water desalinization and indoor agriculture (electricity for grow lights is the limiting factor) would allow you to feed the world.</p>

<p>These can all be done with existing technology. We need the political will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m familiar with the ideas behind Dyson spheres and the like. Based on our current trajectory I feel we are going to hit a massive wall and total collapse of society as we know it. We could solar/wind/biofuel and bioplastic our way out of it, but the increasing acceleration of consumption will ensure that it&#39;s always a race against the clock until we move into what would basically be a matter-based economy. Not to mention there&#39;s a limited amount of land, air and atmosphere (at least for now in practice) - how do you propose we deal with waste consumer electronics combined with planned obsolescence and consumerist vanity? </p>

<p>I think you may be underestimating the amount of power we can produce with this. Just by filling up orbit with satellites, we can generate thousands of times the current amount of energy generation.</p>

<p>The space elevator would make it many times easier to move to other planets. Vacationing on the moon would be within reach as a luxury vacation (perhaps 10s of thousands of dollars).</p>

<p>All water problems instantaneously solved with desalinization. Famine solved. Many geopolitical problems (the Middle East) significantly abated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello James,</p>

<p>First I&#39;d like to thank you for the awesome work you have done so far. I&#39;m probably going to join your website, after all you were the one who opened my eyes and mind for new ideas. </p>

<p>My question is:
Do you believe that Trump is a part of the same group as Obama and co. More precise the Bilderbergers?</p>

<p>Some background for the question:
I&#39;ve seen Angela Merkel and Germanys foreign minister talk about Trump in very negative way. Steienmeier (Bilderberger) went even so far as to say that &quot;Old world order is gone and global disorder has taken it&#39;s place&quot;. On top of that there are of course Soros, Hillary and Obama who are against Trump. An Israeli government official said that they have now true ally in the office and started building after Obama left presidency. So to me it looks like there&#39;s two different sides fighting over global power. The Bilderbergers seems like a more tight knit group. The other group is just beginning to contact each other and ally up (Putin, some of Israeli right wing etc). I&#39;m not saying that Trump is any kind of saviour or anything, just that I think he isn&#39;t working with Bilderbergers&#39; nwo agenda. Trump will have his on mischiefs if the Bilderbergers can&#39;t get him onboard with them. To me it seems like a far stretch that the rivalry is just show.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not dead. So he can&#39;t be a complete outsider.</p>

<p>But the regime has seriously harmed themselves trying to keep him from winning (particularly by undercutting trust in the media). So he&#39;s probably at the very edge of what the establishment isn&#39;t willing to kill to prevent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem&gt;Reaction&gt;Solution</p>

<p>Donald Trump and the rise of the far right across the world is a reaction to everything Liberal Democracies have been working to achieve since the end of WW2. If you want to say Liberal Democracy is the <em>thesis</em>, Donald Trump/Alt-Right is the <em>antithesis</em>. These two forces will compete for supremacy. From that competition will emerge a compromise, a <em>synthesis</em> between the two competing forces. Another way of putting it is the world elites need to remind us why we need them, they need to tear down the last vestiges of Constitutional Democracy in the United States to fully exert its control here, they need to bring the world in under its multicultural utopian agenda. In other words, we are in for a bumpy ride. This is all leading to a physical conflict because it has to. We need to be made to see why everything Trump represents and why everything that brought him to power is bad so that the world managers can come in and save us from ourselves. The thing is, they are the ones who set the agenda in the first place. But the masses, too stupid and lazy to be informed don&#39;t see that as their attention was directed exactly where it was supposed to be the entire time. </p>

<p>So NAFTA, EU and TPP, which took them about 40 years to come up with and implement, were all an elaborate ruse meant to be shot down <em>right now</em> to sow chaos?</p>

<p>No. Globalization is about bringing the world together under one technocratic supra national entity that is an amalgamation of fascism, socialism, and capitalism. These trade deals all have a purpose, which was to bring the world closer together under the goal. That is still the goal, but those trade deals are <em>no longer</em> serving that purpose. They are now serving an <em>ulterior</em> purpose, which isn&#39;t to create chaos, but rather is to create division.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It also doesn&#39;t really fit the PRS model, either, because &quot;Trump shooting down TPP&quot; as the Reaction isn&#39;t really valid if you look at how that came to be: with the media kicking and fucking screaming every time he so much as mentioned the word TPP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is part of creating an ANTITHESIS to counter the THESIS of the dialectic. The media is doing exactly what they are meant to do, which is to control the narrative for the &quot;profane masses&quot; that haven&#39;t the time to research Hegel or Marx or understand dialectic or the process of history unfolding. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before he brought it up? 99% disapproval rate by Americans, but it was NEVER mentioned on TV.... So how could that possibly be a pre-planned Reaction if they were literally trying to shut him down from even mentioning it? It simply doesn&#39;t add up as a PRS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TPP has been spoken of at length on television and in media as long as it has been public knowledge. It was used as a talking point against Hillary Clinton when she announced her candidacy for President, not to mention it was discussed during the 2008 election.</p>

<p>Also, I think when we talk about AGENDA SETTING I think people mistake that for planning. You cannot <em>make</em> people do things, you cannot make plans based on how people <em>will</em> react because the future is uncertain. However, you can <em>direct</em> people toward making decisions that benefit you by narrowing the focus of the conversation and debate to what benefits <em>you</em>. The key in managing people is to make them want what <em>you</em> want without them realizing it. That is not achieved by saying, &quot;This is what is going to happen, this is how it is going to happen.&quot; It&#39;s achieved by manipulating people. It helps then that the media in the United States is consolidated under, more-or-less, one umbrella of corporate control. When you look at who sits on the Council on Foreign Relations and Bilderberg Group, you will see among the politicians and elites are media executives and presidents and so on. In other words the masses only know what they know because that is what they&#39;ve been told. Or, as Orwell put it, &quot;What opinions the masses hold, or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference. They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m well aware of and have been for years of the PRS model and the Hegelian Dialectic, but you have to actually understand when it&#39;s being used, not just apply it after the fact to every event.</p>

<p>No-one is applying anything <em>after the fact</em>, people have been saying all of this for years. The events of the last few years make it very clear that this is what is happening. While I recognize your point, that it&#39;s easy to just cherry pick and say this or that is the result of the dialectic, that is not what is happening here. While I personally believed Clinton would win the election because she is part of the power elite, from a Hegelian perspective it makes much more sense that <em>this</em> election would go to Trump because we&#39;ve already had eight years of neoliberal policies and all of this is a counter proposition to the last eight years. It makes perfect sense Trump would win because at <em>this</em> moment the Left needs to become radicalized as a reaction to the Right in order for all of this to progress toward its &quot;conclusion.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I don&#39;t know for sure so I can only speculate, but I&#39;ll give it my best educated guess.</p>

<p>In the Hegelian dialectic you have three things. The problem, the reaction, the solution. Or the thesis, anti-thesis, synthesis. </p>

<p>It is most easily discerned for me from reading the most mainstream article you can find. I used this one for example and context.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/amp/why-trump-killed-tpp-why-it-matters-you-">www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/amp/why-trump-killed-tpp-why-it-matters-you-</a></p>

<p>Notice the title right of the bat. 
&quot;Why Trump Killed TPP — And Why It Matters To You&quot;</p>

<p>They are setting the reader up from the beginning for the solution of the problem, while simultaneously telling them how to react. Great start.</p>

<p>A good summery of the &quot;problem&quot; they want people to perceive is usually at the end of the article, like this.</p>

<p>&quot;In the meantime, the protectionist measures instead promised by Trump could set off a damaging trade war. And with the U.S. bowed out of the multilateral agreement, it creates an opportunity for China to make attractive agreements with the Pacific Rim countries to trade with them instead.&quot;</p>

<p>The problem being of course being a trade war with China. This frightens everyone...right? It could be disastrous for the economy and the US dollar.</p>

<p>The reaction in this case ( keep in mind a notoriously left leaning source, pandering to its target audience) I believe is summed up in the final paragraph.</p>

<p>&quot;That could lead to higher prices for the cheap imports that Americans have become addicted to — so your kid&#39;s plastic Paw Patrol toys at Wal-Mart could get a little pricier.&quot;</p>

<p>The want people to start worrying about prices getting higher on everday items. This of course is a effect we will see from bring jobs home. There might be more local jobs, but prices will go up. Keep in mind our economy is rig from the beginning and will ultimately fail at some point. This is by design. The design all along is to offer the solution. The one world currency...What better character to crash the economy? </p>

<p>Now this is simply my opinion because there is no telling for sure what the &quot;solution&quot; will be because it is in the future, but with a little logic and clairvoyance you can make an educated guess. My guess is that Trump will destroy TPP and NAFTA in a &quot;last ditch effort&quot; to save the economy and &quot;make America great again&quot;. Which of course the selling point of his campaign. The planned economic collapse is imminent and that&#39;s what they want. Trumps character while inspiring to some is clearly clumsy and unpredictable to others. </p>

<p>Trumps nationalism will cause problems with the economy, which already exist, and possibly crashing the dollar or coming close. This will be used to justify a more globalist approach, possibly adopting a new form of currency.</p>

All rulers throughout history want the title of GOD. I don&#39;t think things have changed. With the current and coming technology the goal may very well be achieveable! And the race is on. One in which nobody you or I know is in that race. As far as us goes. Think of Gang turf wars. The gangs are fighting over the people that they exploit! This century will determine mans and the worlds fate for the next 100 years! We are going to have to end the monetary system if we are going to have a chance for posterity!</p>

<p><strong>Have you been following the open source investigation led by George Webb?</strong>  </p>

<p>Webb has essentially cracked the case regarding the Clinton Foundation, child trafficking, CIA, government, military conspiracy to overthrow countries around the world, and proves how its all related, and who is involved (DynCorp, Clinton Foundation, etc). </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t, you really need to look into his work.  He doesn&#39;t do a great job presenting all of his evidence he has, but I really recommend you take a look at his work start on his first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCTzFNrsKns">video.</a>  </p>

<p>and</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6J_7PvWoMw">Rockefeller Medicine</a></p>

<p>The Rockefeller Medicine is no small journey in understanding how gatekeeping can be established to assert personal gain and mold a world to one’s liking. How a small group of people can align the chief cornerstone of the hierarchy of human endeavour to their objectives.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5ZgR_-SO8U">Maurice Strong is Dead</a> shows how the Rockefellers were well connected to Maurice Strong throughout his career, a career which included setting the terms of reference for the IPCC to determine what is “climate change” and the “earth charter”. It shows how the Rockefellers can take over a backwater field and use their governmental and international connections to make it sexy, well-funded and directed to fulfill their global agenda.</p>

<p>Do you have any material on the Chicago Boys  (written about in Shock Doctrine) and Rockefeller influence on economics? Which other important spheres of influence do the Rockefellers hold or direct a gatekeeping position in?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi James - Your “follow the money” podcast on 9/11 failed to mention that the newsletter used as an alibi for the put options came from Agora Publishing, a Baltimore firm tied to Buzzy Krongard. You later did a podcast praising “Agorism.” Did you leave the information about Agora’s newsletter out because they are a libertarian company and you have a libertarian mindset?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey James, first off thanks for doing what you do!</p>

<p>I am at a loss for a very specific question, so I guess I&#39;ll ask something obvious and topical: Do you have any strong feelings for or against Pizzagate? Do you think this type of &#39;citizen journalism&#39; could actually result in people being held accountable?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate represents the best and worst of online open source investigative journalism simultaneously. But then again, any collaborative online effort that brings together a significant amount of people on a very important topic is going to be:</p>

<p>-disrupted by infiltrators
-subject to mistakes, errors and missteps by people who are not very experienced or are not skilled researchers
-subject to group in-fighting over the establishment of &quot;orthodoxies&quot; in the &quot;doctrine&quot; that begins to develop</p>

<p>All of this is inevitable. But my advice for pizzagate researchers is not to give up or get disheartened. It&#39;s an awfully long road and an awfully steep hill to climb, and there&#39;s no guarantee that the investigation will lead to justice. But we have to keep trying.</p>

It comes across as a bit of a strawman argument but it&#39;s the truth: So they&#39;re okay with the possibility of human trafficking and sexual exploitation of children? That&#39;s not something that should at least be seriously investigated? If there&#39;s nothing there (hah) then investigating would discover that eventually. Until then we continue to follow the trail of breadcrumbs apparently leading us to a really disturbing place.</p>

Anytime you have the pressure &quot;Don&#39;t investigate!&quot; -- even if you <em>think</em> that pressure comes from your own pragmatic reasoning -- that should raise alarm bells.</p>

<p>I greatly appreciate the work you&#39;ve done on 9/11, and I do hope you will reconsider this foundational aspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. Even presuming this is accurate information, it only shows that this was one aspect of the demolition. I could wave around my credentials, but it should be obvious that if thermite alone was used, the WTC would have been lit up like a sparkler on Independence Day. And there are many other aspects of the demolition that remain unaccounted for.</p>

<p>But this disagreement is not a reason not to talk about it. Rather, it&#39;s a reason to investigate the top theories, sort out the most likely, talk about the implications, etc.</p>

<p>Clearly, one of the very first questions that needs to be answered is &quot;So... if it wasn&#39;t Muslims in planes... how&#39;d they do it?&quot;</p>

Salvador Allende, Muammar Gaddafi, JFK, RFK, MLK Jr, Mohammad Mossadegh, Jose Velasco, Jacobo Arbenz, etc.  Its happened so numerous amount of times, I can&#39;t remember them all, when the CIA goes overseas and overthrows a government or kills a leader that is more interested in nationalizing their natural resources and using them to benefit their own people through education, healthcare and infrastructure programs.

    <div class="md"><p>Probably the biggest reason is that the corporate elite of the western world are legitimately afraid of a successful socialist and communist nation &quot;setting a good example.&quot;</p>

<p>The CIA and the global elite are terrified that a successful socialist movement or nation might set a good example, and start a domino effect around the world.  </p>

<p>&quot;The boys of capital, they chortle in their martinis about the death of socialism. The word has been banned from polite conversation. And they hope that no one will notice that every socialist experiment of any significance in the twentieth century - without exception - has either been crushed, overthrown, or invaded, or corrupted, perverted, subverted, or destabilized, or otherwise had life made impossible for it, by the United States. Not one socialist government or movement - from the Russian Revolution to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, from Communist China to the FMLN in Salvador - not one was permitted to rise or fall solely on its own merits; not one was left secure enough to drop its guard against the all-powerful enemy abroad and freely and fully relax control at home.&quot; ~ William Blum, &#39;Killing Hope&#39;</p>

<p>True. And hes MUCH better than a lot of other people out there. Again, don&#39;t get me wrong, Chomsky is way down the path of enlightenment, and I&#39;ve spent hundreds of hours of my life on him.</p>

<p>But does he tell you about what the CIA does here? And how they control the US? (I mean, besides &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; which is worthwhile book/movie) Or who controls the CIA and how? </p>

<p>Anarcho-syndicalism... but he also believes in progressivism as a bridge. And his political stuff is actually quite good.</p>

<p>That is a possibility. However, I think he has been pretty consistent through out his career to sticking to the documentary record to back up his positions, with a belief that showing what the available facts actually are is enough to justify radical politics.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>He actually says the opposite about the CIA. His position is that the CIA exists to provide plausible deniability for the executive branch.   He is sticking to the available documentary record, and I think this is correct. If one sticks to unclassified material about past CIA action in the past the picture that emerges is of an agency following executive orders.  </p>

<p>On his failure to articulate the power structure, I am in agreement. </p>

<p>However, his lack of solutions follows from anarchist politics. It is for regular people to organize and resist in creative ways. This follows directly from anti-Leninist politics.  Chomsky is not going to write another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_To_Be_Done%3F">&#39;What is to Be Done&#39;.</a></p>

<p>Which tells you what you need to know about anarchy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cool theory. But it doesn&#39;t work in the world as it exists. The biggest threat to freedom is subversion. Anarchy (as a governmental structure, not necessarily an economic one) is utterly unable to resist subversion, so it has never been implemented.</p>

<p>This can be a problem with certain versions of libertarianism as well.</p>

<p>To clarify, when I pointed out his lack of solutions it wasn&#39;t in the sense of not having any. It was in the sense that it is not a place of one person to solve these problems and impose it. Rather the solutions are to be created through common struggles of ordinary people. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a real solution for you. It would unite the people, and permanently hamstring the elites by creating massive wealth in the middle class. Literally the 2nd American Revolution.</p>

<p>We just need to build a space elevator and deploy solar satellite arrays into space. The elevator is a big investment, but once it&#39;s up, we can fill geosynchronous orbit with sattelites very cheaply.</p>

<p>Coal goes out of business overnight because it costs too much. Power generation is now a tiny fraction of current cost, which drives investment in other areas where power is a limiting factor (indoor agriculture, desalinization, terraforming).</p>

<p>The Middle East stops being a raging hellhole because we don&#39;t need to fight over water and oil anymore.</p>

<p>Vacations on the moon.</p>

<p>In our lifetime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its simple really.  Other countries keeping their resources and wealth for their own people means that US businesses can&#39;t exploit them for their own gain at a fraction of the cost by bribing a few heads of states.  These US businesses aren&#39;t capitalist though, they are corrupted crony-capitalism. They dont want competition, they want to use corruption and threats to make money and exploit others.  That is what the CIA has always been about...they protect US businesses ability to unfairly exploit the rest of the world.  I dont think its necessarily targeting socialism, its targeting whatever people are standing in the way of them becoming filthy rich through corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great response. </p>

<p>I really enjoy watching your videos and reading your articles. I am fairly socialist myself, so I&#39;m don&#39;t agree with everything, naturally. But listening to people you disagree with is how we grow and learn.</p>

<p>I think if a nation&#39;s head of state takes back a resource with the intent of giving it to the people, that can be a very good thing. There are middle eastern countries that place a percentage of oil revenue into the hands of their people. </p>

<p>However as <em>Animal Farm</em>, tells us, this depends on the leaders not being corruptible. A government can claim they want to help the people, lead a revolution .. and then just take everything .. and hand it over to the dominant empire (Russia, the EU, the US, etc.)</p>

<p>Public/social infrastructure requires that those resources are always distributed evenly among the people, and the people staying constantly vigilant to ensure it stays that way. When you can pump the people full of games and entertainment, they don&#39;t always realize that everything else is going to shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>James,</p>

<p>Let me start off by offering a most sincere thank you. You have been doing consistently excellent work for years, and I consider you the most reliable conspiracy journalist out there. We who wear tin foil hats salute you!</p>

<p>Question:</p>

<p>What do you think of the government&#39;s suppression of beneficial technologies? For example, a 2003 NASA study concluded that a space elevator was feasible. This would allow the deployment of space-based solar arrays that would allow power generation at a tiny fraction of current cost, and virtually eliminate pollution and climate change.</p>

<p>The cheaper energy would allow things like desalinization and indoor agriculture to become economical, thus fixing most of the problems in the Middle East (water and oil). There are many other example, any idea why the government is holding them back?</p>

I know most questions will deal with geopolitics or economics or something of the sort. What I would like to know is who is James? What is your favorite film? Television show? Food? Also, your pieces on love and the snippets about your son have given me a new take on actually wanting to have kids.

    <div class="md"><p>Hello James, hope you&#39;re doing well.</p>

<p>There is something I&#39;ve been wondering about in regards to the zionist agenda. Do you think that those towards the top of the pyramid of control actually believe in the religious mandates they claim to believe in? In other words... our exploits in the middle east are clearly more than a simple holy war between Christians, Jews, Muslims. I would assume resources (and therefore money) are the number driver of policy, and a lust of power on behalf of some in control.</p>

<p>But there is certainly a religious element that plays a role. For example, the zionists want to reclaim Temple Mount and it seems like many Western Christians who support the state of Israel- and by extension- the West&#39;s involvement in the middle-east- do so because they want to pave the way for the second coming of Christ. </p>

<p>To what degree do you think that political and religious leaders who influence the masses with religious dogma are themselves zealots? Is religion purely a tool, a smokescreen for the populace? Or do you think that Trump and  Netanyahu are actually devout believers in what they claim?</p>

<p>That was kind of a mess and I hope my question made sense. Thanks James!</p>

<p>The Christians are Churchians, &quot;The Jews&quot; are Kabbalists, the Muslims are Sufis, a few are Satanists, and many are Luciferian.</p>

<p>Look into John Hagee, and, historically, Scofield and his study bible. This view of eschatology is very rare, historically most Protestants have believed the Pope was the Antichrist, and the Roman Catholic Church is the Whore of Babylon.</p>

<p>(Not to take a shot at individual Catholics, most of whom are cool)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>James,</p>

<p>What is legitimate intelligence? Does Psychic Spying meet the criteria? </p>

<p>I point you to the of declassified documents on Project Stargate at Blackvault. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/the-stargate-collection/">http://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/the-stargate-collection/</a></p>

<p>I point you to Thomas Drake&#39;s statement that he&#39;d interviewed a known psychic about pre 9/11 intelligence five years after Stargate&#39;s closure, in his official capacity as an NSA executive at that time. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.starpod.us/2014/09/11/former-nsa-official-tom-drake-confirms-psychic-warned-cia-of-911-attack/">http://www.starpod.us/2014/09/11/former-nsa-official-tom-drake-confirms-psychic-warned-cia-of-911-attack/</a> (audio clip at site)</p>

<p>I point you to a statement arguing that evidence is overwhelming for the existence of ESP by Nobel Prize winner in physics Brian Josephson, who invented the Josephson Junction (a superconducting transistor):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv4PRD6PCk4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv4PRD6PCk4</a></p>

<p>And, of course, the latest CIA document cache release, some of which consisted of documents about ESP and Project Stargate. </p>

<p>So. Tough subject. A question that genuinely challenges. Because it goes against the grain of accepted skeptical thought. And yet, there&#39;s considerable evidence by academic physicists in support, along with continuing use by intelligence agencies for forty years. </p>

<p>Under controlled conditions, by trained personnel, do you believe ESP can provide viable intelligence? And if not, why do you think intelligence agencies continue to use the technique? And why do some very well regarded scientists continue to promote it? </p>

<p>...but it can only ever be a smattering and there&#39;s always important stuff left out.</p>

<p>As for a topic that I think is more important than I have yet articulated, it would be the connection of eugenics to population control to global warming to biometrics and technocracy. All of these things are connected and I wish I could just scoop my comprehension of those connections out of my head and put them directly on the screen. As it is, I&#39;ll just have to continue chipping away at it.</p>

<p>Physical currency is essential to liberty and freedom, sadly most everyone I know of every political belief system has already phased out 95% of their cash usage and transactions. </p>

<p>I&#39;m basically the only person I know besides my wife that carries cash each day and tries to use it as much as possible to support small business, help tip based workers, and avoid a constant digital footprint...it also saves me hundreds of dollars per year in cash discounts for services. I try and use my cards as little as possible, but year after year they are becoming the only option. </p>

<p>Honest question, what would you say to someone like me who does just the opposite of that? Every single purchase, from a tank of gas to a pack of gum, I can make with my credit card, I do. My card pays me between 1% and 5% cash back for every purchase. I never ever carry a balance and pay in full each month. This equates to a few hundred bucks a year. Additionally, my checking account will pay me 2% interest on the balance up to $25K as long as a I make 4 purchases a month using a debit card. I feel like I&#39;m maximizing my &quot;pay plan&quot; by doing this. Why would I want to use cash? (aside from the conspiracy behind our money system stuff)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course using your card works out more beneficial for you now and you should definitely take advantage of it. The problem doesn&#39;t come now, the problem comes down the line when cash is no longer an option to use anymore. At that point, you won&#39;t be able to make a transaction without the banks/governments/TPTB knowing everything about it. There will basically be one central authority that controls the entire country/worlds bank accounts, and the only possible way that every person in the world can perform a transaction. We might have to go back to bartering at that point.  </p>

<p>This has been an agenda decades in the making, and they are still going ahead step by step as planned. There really is no hope for the future unless the entire system is overhauled. Unfortunately, TPTB have access to unlimited funds to just keep paying people to do their bidding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for me, it is just my belief system, it isn&#39;t about the money, I&#39;m lucky to make a lot so that things like rewards cards just don&#39;t mean anything to me, even if using cash cost me more. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think someone should be able to push a button and take away or freeze all the money you have in the world over something as simple as a bank error that could take weeks or months to sort out, or an IRS investigation, or someone hates you and tells the FBI you are a terrorist or pulls an insurance scam on you and a court says they get all of your money out of your bank account. More likely you&#39;ll have your identity stolen, especially the more places you use cards. You can lose everything for months, and if you get evicted, can&#39;t buy food, lose your job, etc, none of that matters to anyone, in the end, if you are lucky, you&#39;ll get it all fixed but this will only be after you woke up to having an empty bank account and maxed out cards. </p>

<p>Also, maybe you don&#39;t agree with the system, maybe you have different ideas, maybe you are not a good little sheep, do you really trust the machine not to turn off access to your money? Do you trust that there will never be people in power in this country who would use that kind of control on the population?</p>

<p>Do you think other people should know so much about what you buy and when? where you are at all times?</p>

<p>Again these are all personal decisions. Tens of millions of people live on cash, millions of businesses use cash revenues to stay afloat and avoid at least some of the massive taxes that cripple them. </p>

<p>There are many reasons I believe in cash, I don&#39;t dispute the convenience and security of cards, but I also know how those systems were never meant to be convenient, they were always meant for profit and control, the convenience is how they sell you on it. </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m not anti-tax or anti-government, I&#39;m just for way lower tax, way less government, and not giving people that kind of power over others, it never ends well. </p>

<p>Depends. There are very different intepretations of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a lot of them view Lucifer &quot;the lightbringer&quot; &quot; the morning star&quot; etc to be a Prometheus figure, being the one who gave mankind knowledge via the apple in defiance of god (who in that myth wanted to keep mankind ignorant) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That one is very common. It&#39;s funny, too, because Jesus calls himself the morning star. </p>

<p>And the connection between Satan and Lucifer (Isaiah 14) is pretty clearly mistaken. Read in context, that passage is not talking about a spirit being, it&#39;s talking about a man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>many of them see organized religion to be attempting to perpetuate ignorance. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of it is. But this is generally Luciferians (and a few Satanists) doing it. Many Luciferians want to keep the light to themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you would think this sub would be fans of their goals if not their dogma</p>

<p>Did you know there&#39;s a $300,000 finite model analysis being conducted which challenges the official models released by NIST regarding the 3 tower collapses on 9/11?</p>

<p>This two-year finite model analysis is underway by Dr. J Leroy Hulsey, Chair of UAF&#39;s Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, and two Ph.D. research assistants: <a href="http://www.WTC7Evaluation.org">www.WTC7Evaluation.org</a></p>

<p>His primary findings are discussed here at this ASCE presentation: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKN4qilUOfs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKN4qilUOfs</a></p>

<p>The models will be released for peer review in ~May.</p>

<p>According to NIST, they will not release their own finite model data for peer review: <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf</a></p>

<p>Thoughts?  I think you should do a video on this.  Your last 9/11 series was fantastic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First massive fan, you been nothing short of exceptional in laying out the groundwork for understanding what&#39;s going on in the world and how it all ties down to geopolitics and markets world wide. I have one question and one request. What die you think of the current state of geopolitics now that Trump has won, do you think that his winning now means other countries like China or Germany will have a bigger impact in both what happens in Europe and as far as China worldwide? Did his winning now mean the Globalist have to push for China dominance even more or do you think they could work a deal with Trump and have business as usual?</p>

<p>My request is that I would LOVE if you did a history on the founding of Israel, The Israel-Palestine Conflict and the Rothschild/Balfour Declaration and its impact with the Treaty of Versailles and all that follows? I think that would be jam packed and highly interesting episode on a conflict that many feel strongly about, but don&#39;t know how it happened without bias on each side. I think your track record and propensity to give the facts and history straight no chaser would really clear up any misconceptions some have on the whole affair.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you James for all your amazing work. I had a question regarding your thoughts on the NWO and the concept of &quot;3D chess&quot; being played by the people at the highest tiers of our society. And please forgive me if you have covered this before.</p>

<p>In one of your previous AMA response videos, your notion of &quot;3D chess&quot; closely mirrors Chalybaus&#39; theory of the Hegelean Dialectic, a theory which had origins in the back rooms of occult (secret) societies, at a time when members closely adhered to the mythologies that go along with these societies. What role, if any, do you think the occult and its system of beliefs play in to the modern 3D chess board being played in the world today? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi James,</p>

<p>Been watching your videos over the past few years. THANKS for all the excellent work you do, and especially this AMA in r/conspiracy! </p>

<p>That said, I have <strong>a couple of related questions</strong>:</p>

<p>1) The CIA recently released a searchable database of 13 million newly declassified documents online: <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/crest-25-year-program-archive">https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/crest-25-year-program-archive</a>. Have you had the chance to snoop around in there yet? If yes, have you found anything even interesting? If not, what will you be digging into first?</p>

<p>2) Further, it has also been also reported (<a href="http://time.com/4606082/jfk-assassination-secrets/">Time magazine</a>) that about 3,000 never-before-seen JFK assassination related documents, along with 34,000 previously redacted files, are scheduled for release on October 17th, 2017. Just curious if you expect any previously unreported revelations from this? (For the record, I don&#39;t think they would ever jeopardize they&#39;re &quot;lone gunman&quot; narrative or incriminate themselves or the FBI in any way.)</p>

<p>Best of luck in your future endeavors! I&#39;ll definitely keep listening and watching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) I tweeted about it when it was first released and did do a test search just to see what the search function was like. I can&#39;t remember what I searched now but it did seem potentially useful. I will likely do an open source investigation with the Corbett Report community to see if there are any documents worth parsing in there. Please do contact me through my site if you know of anything worth looking at.</p>

<p>2) I&#39;m not holding my breath, but if the last few years have shown us anything it&#39;s that we&#39;re living in chaotic times. You never know if they might decide to release something to increase the chaos. Either way, I&#39;ll be reporting on whatever does/doesn&#39;t get released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>James, here is a piece of data that could potentially ruin the controversial hypothesis (which I believe you subscribe to) which says that hydrocarbons (oil, natural gas, etc) are not fossil fuels, but rather are generated by the Earth&#39;s magma (or something to that effect).</p>

<p>So, there is a 12 km hole that the Russians bored starting back in the 1970s.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iflscience.com/environment/deepest-hole-world/">http://www.iflscience.com/environment/deepest-hole-world/</a></p>

<p>Relevant portion:</p>

<hr/>

<p>So did we learn anything from these decades of labor? Thankfully, yes! <strong>Scientists found microscopic fossils of single-celled organisms at 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) down. And at nearly the same depth, they discovered water.</strong> They also found that the temperature at the bottom of the hole reached a blistering 356°F (180°C). </p>

<hr/>

<p>If there are organic fossils 4.3 miles below the surface of the solid Earth, then what other explanation is needed? It certainly does not hurt to ask how these fossils got there or what they are feeding on at these depths, but still ...</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How does that disprove abiotic oil sourcing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, it is a question of who has the burden of proof.</p>

<p>When the status quo explanation of the source of oil sourcing is so popular, you kind of need to work harder to support an alternative theory. That is just how it is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microbes occurring there in no way proves they caused what is there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like a plausible enough explanation to me.</p>

<p>Now you need to work on selling the alternative theory to me.</p>

<p>Has The Corbett Report experienced any problems with Youtube&#39;s new rules?  Over the past year Reddit &amp; Twitter have been changing rules in the major subreddits.  For example, last May r\politics disallowed &quot;self-posts&quot; (and more recently has made a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5o598x/january_2017_submission_rule_changes_youtubing/">White List</a> of approved media) and r\worldnews has begun to look like the front page of The Independent or the Guardian...</p>

<p>During the same interval, the MSM has been expanding onto Youtube--as the independent channels have been getting demonetized, etc...</p>

<p>On top of that--we see the internet providers buying up the media conglomerates (such as AT&amp;T buying Comcast)...</p>

<p>I think many of us are longing for &quot;the good old days.&quot; </p>

<p>Hello Sir,</p>

<p>I was reading your breakdown on Trump here and one thing that wasn&#39;t immediately clear I was hoping you would comment on,  Do you think that Trump is a net benefit or burden for American Sovereignty?</p>

<p>I know these answers aren&#39;t always easy to give a black or white response to, I personally feel supportive of Trump but at the same time my pavlovian conditioning keeps me on edge for what tomorrow may bring.</p>

<p>So far i&#39;m please with his moves, TPP and ACA being iced and NAFTA being put on notice.</p>

<p>The pipeline deals don&#39;t worry too bad because its pretty much in line with the infrastructure promises and energy independence promises he made during his campaign. </p>

<p>I feel like we might have a non-politician in the white house who will actually follow through with his words. Even though he isn&#39;t necessarily the smartest person in the world, he seems sincere about his promise to the voters.</p>

<p>I also feel like his ego creates a man who is more easily pushed around by popular chorus than he is by elite chorus.  I feel like the people can probably exploit that to great effect if they could just get over the hate campaign and just feed his ego a little bit.</p>

<p>To rephrase, I feel that if the people were to praise Trump as some genius or as a super-patriot mythological character like George Washington, that his ego would force him to take on that role.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I second this. Linda is Palestinian and her family can be connected to Hamas which was quickly brought up by some &quot;alt-right&quot; media. It seems like this is just one example of the many things going on in the name of &quot;political activism&quot; and &quot;journalism&quot; that have an underhanded agenda. A lot of avid Trump supporters believe there&#39;s been an ulterior plan to infiltrate the country with Muslim refugees and ultimately have forced Sharia law. They believe this is the goal of Islam and all Muslims (Obama) but now Trump is here to save us. I live in a very conservative state and come across these people entirely too often. They also all express unwavering, blind support of Israel and validate it with the claim that they are surrounded by terrorists who want to kill all the Jews. So having Linda and Sharia law showcased in the Trump-hating Women&#39;s March certainly doesn&#39;t bring the much needed awareness to Palestinian oppression by conservatives and plays into the &quot;Muslim takeover&quot; narrative. After seeing a story on this my father even told me &quot;SEE! I told you this was their plan. FORCED SHARIA AND HIJABS.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey James, thank you for all your great work.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but agree with your analysis that a large portion of the alternative media are drinking the Kool-Aid. At the same time I find myself slightly optimistic. Surely Trump is part of the establishment, but what faction is the question? I guess we&#39;ll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>My question for you. With Trump&#39;s proclimation of America first followed by China&#39;s immediate announcement that it is happy to take the lead. Wasn&#39;t this the globalist agenda all along to make China the new world superpower? Best case scenario the second Cold War, worst case WW3. I&#39;m interested to hear your thoughts on this.</p>

<p>Again thank you for all that you do.</p>

<p>Chris</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear James Corbett!
I have and huge amount of love and respect for the work you do. I always try to keep up and although I&#39;m not a subscriber (I don&#39;t really &#39;subscribe&#39; as such to anyone), I always bring you up to the relevant people. You have kept me going through some very difficult times!
My question is - How on earth do <em>you</em> keep your chin up with the weight of all this knowledge? How do you sleep with all the ideas buzzing around. And how do you sympathise with the futility of your &#39;place&#39; in the world, when you begin to <em>understand</em> more than your average citizen. The topics you discuss span generations, You must be mentally knackered? </p>

<p>Thank you and please don&#39;t ever give up what your doing. I&#39;m with you all the way.</p>

<p>My question is this.  I really don&#39;t know what to think about your stance on climate change.  Is is accurate to say that you consider it a total hoax and a neocon attempt to further control us and centralize power?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your many excellent documentaries--how do you see Errol Morris&#39; <em>The Fog of War</em> and <em>The Unknown Known</em> documentaries?  </p>

<p>I find them to be quite disingenuous in that the viewer leaves thinking they just actually learned something about McNamara/Rumsfeld--when the reality is that the questions/topics were all pre-approved with the end result being to humanize these war criminals.  Add a Philip Glass soundtrack with lots of old newsreel footage give the viewer <em>an escape</em> rather than an education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey James, I haven&#39;t watched a ton of your videos, but what I&#39;ve seen I have certainly liked. I only recently got into your stuff through your interview on The Higherside Chats. Two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What do you make of Donald Trump? I know that&#39;s an overly simple question for a complicated situation and obviously you&#39;ll have ample time to explore that in the coming months and years, so feel free not to answer it. If you are inclined to answer, a succinct &quot;hot take&quot; will suffice.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m a big fan of your piece on Noam Chomsky as an &quot;intellectual gatekeeper&quot;. I still think there&#39;s some value to some of Chomsky&#39;s ideas, but you certainly brought some stuff to light that undermines much of that. Another pop philosopher that I&#39;m a fan of is Slavoj Zizek, someone whom Chomsky has a vocal distaste/disrespect for. Do you think that this feud is performative? Would you classify Zizek as an intellectual gatekeeper? Do you like Zizek&#39;s work/opinions on pop culture?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you and keep up the good work.</p>

Do you think there is an agenda in regards to disclosure? Do you think Trump beating Hillary helps or hurts the disclosure movement? I feel like Trump doesn&#39;t really care about disclosure, but I think he is self-serving and smart enough to know that he would be as famous as Lincoln or JFK if he was the disclosure President. </p>

<p>Thank you for all your excellent work and thank you for the bump you gave my podcast/YouTube channel <em>Frequency Resonance Radio</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhactAB37YI&amp;amp;t=4m8s">here</a>).</p>

<p>What part do you think Trump plays in the &#39;game&#39;? Obama left him a &#39;dictator&#39;s toolkit&#39; (as Lee Camp pointed out); will he use it?</p>

<p>Who do you think are funding organisations such as the National Policy Institute and for what purpose? I&#39;ve noticed that Richard Spencer and some of his associates have Heritage Foundation ties and that NPI itself was initially founded by William Regnery II and has received a grant from the Pioneer Fund.</p>

<p>What do you think of entertainment starting to have deep politics themes, even in the most unlikely places? I actually saw a show that quoted the Corbett/Lionel Law almost word-for-word.</p>

<p>And as an anarchist, what do you think of Rojava? From what I&#39;ve seen, they&#39;ve been rather successful and stable.</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Are you aware about the internal civil war in its development? To the point that its adoption has been crippled with small blocks and slow trading, developers controlled by a shady corporation blockstream (with Brock Pierce -Trojan horse?- as a member, that has been accused of paedophilia and was a member of the Clinton&#39;s Global Initiative), big Chinese miners controlling almost all of the current hash power, forks... </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to follow the drama and know what&#39;s going on. Some official forums and r/bitcoin are heavily censored by its mod called teymos, (r/btc of another subreddit not so censored maybe)</p>

<p>Will you please revisit the cryptocurrencies and what&#39;s happening with them by interviewing some knowledgeable people?

    <div class="md"><p>Hi James. I&#39;m sure you get a lot of requests like this, but I wanted to see if I could convince you of the importance of two subjects that I see lacking visibility in the truth movement.  </p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Water quality in the US. I compiled some information that basically shows half of America being in a state similar to Flint Michigan. You can view that here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5oysx1/today_marks_1000_days_since_flint_had_clean/dcn85wl/?st=iyca22ls&amp;amp;sh=c0d80da9">https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5oysx1/today_marks_1000_days_since_flint_had_clean/dcn85wl/?st=iyca22ls&amp;amp;sh=c0d80da9</a></p>

<p>The US media focuses almost all attention on Flint and very little to the rest of the failing water infrastructure in the country. If people are drinking poisoned water, they will remain asleep. No amount of spreading the truth can change the state of things until the population is able to process the information that you offer them. </p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Similar to the previous complaint of the media, but this time with astroturfing. I compiled a bunch of information here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=iycalwdu&amp;amp;sh=e0cd046a">https://www.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=iycalwdu&amp;amp;sh=e0cd046a</a></p>

<p>Many people believe that &quot;shilling&quot; is a conspiracy theory. The scant reports in the media that I was able to scrounge up paint a terrifying picture of the very near future. Sophisticated propaganda bots will be indistinguishable from typical human interaction on social media. 3 letter agencies will be able to automate propaganda programs, drowning out all of the people spreading truth on Reddit, Twitter, etc. Manpower will no longer be a limiter of the amount of propaganda that can be spread on social media.  Not only is a significant percentage of the population unaware that astroturfing is a thing, they are unaware that bots will be subtly swaying entire populations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, </p>

<p>what are the risks associated with holding and eventually &quot;cashing out&quot; of a crypto-currency, or rather specifically, Bitcoin? How easy is it for hackers or other Internet-enabled thieves to steal one&#39;s Bitcoin investment, is it problematic, risky to sell, i.e. &quot;cash out&quot; of a Bitcoin investment (i.e. are there thieves waiting in the wings, so to say, at the point one is attempting to sell or trade Bitcoins)? I realize these are probably very elementary questions, any impartial information on the subject would be much appreciated. Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nations were falling apart and the sheep were beginning to notice, so the nations started using &quot;diversity&quot; to invite Muslims in to use as scapegoats, like this: &quot;[Pay no attention to the maniacs behind the curtain! Um, hey Muslims, come here. LOOK EVERYBODY, MUSLIMS ARE INVADING! Worship your failed state! Give us your money! Surrender your liberties! Support your local police! Support our troops! Enforce depopulation rights!]&quot; Merkle/Germany was the first one I noticed using &quot;diversity&quot; for this purpose, but most western nations seem to have picked it up over the years.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not really about Zionism. I think Jews are simply beginning to realize they look like Nazis if they don&#39;t try to prevent the next holocaust from unfolding more or less the same way it did before. <a href="https://imgflip.com/i/1icpge">https://imgflip.com/i/1icpge</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Essential yes. You wont find the name Grand Tartaria on any maps from after 1700. And if you bring up Tartaria to most historians they will assure you that it was just a regional name and that they were not a unified force. However this conjecture is challenged by the artifacts and historical sites on the ground. For why would they label something as grand if it was no empire? And why do we have evidence of tartarian writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A9rendrye_Runestone">stretching as far as north america?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>La Vérendrye told Kalm that the tablet was sent back to Quebec, where Jesuit priests concluded that it was written in &quot;Tatarian&quot; writing. They reportedly then sent it to the French Secretary of State, the Comte de Maurepas. There are no descriptions of the stone after that time, but it has been claimed that it was shipped with other artifacts to a church in Rouen (the Rouen Cathedral?), later to be buried under a pile of rubble when the building which housed it was destroyed during World War II. The Minnesota Historical Society has offered a $1000 reward for the stone&#39;s rediscovery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi James, I&#39;ve been a viewer-slash-listener to all of your material for the last few years, and I&#39;ve shared it with as many folks as I can. Thank you for providing a reasoned, intelligent, and appropriately sourced view in the - unfortunately often questionable - sea of alternative media.</p>

<p>My question is regarding Obama&#39;s January 12 &quot;update&quot; to Executive Order 12333, allowing the NSA to share the raw data that they collect on millions of American citizens, including identifying information, with the other 16 alphabet soup intelligence agencies. Do you believe that this is evidence of a continuance or even further expansion of this program under Trump, with blessings from the outgoing administration?</p>

<p>What is your take on Kaveh Waddell from The Atlantic&#39;s view (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/obama-expanding-nsa-powers/513041/">https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/obama-expanding-nsa-powers/513041/</a>) that Obama&#39;s action could actually be meant to dissuade Trump from even further extending surveillance powers? &quot;We&#39;re going to further crush your civil liberties to ensure that it&#39;s harder for the incoming administration to further crush your civil liberties,&quot; seems farcical to me.</p>

<p>Regarding Waddell&#39;s idea, Bush sent us into debt more than any other previous president, but it didn&#39;t stop Obama from sending us deeper into debt more than any other previous president. ...but it did help raise awareness, look at all the Libertarians it helped create, if that counts for anything.</p>

I have been to the famous radio tower and have been on top of it plenty of times it is a very eerie feeling inside and around the old Air Force station. Camp Hero was a Air Force that was suppose to be use to spot enemy ships off the cost of Long Island. But what went on there was more of what you see in sify movies. They experimented with electromagnetic fields to make things invisible also the experimented with time travel and psychological warfare.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey james, thanks.  I really appreciate what you do, and you’re at the top of my list of journalists/analysts that I can count on to have well researched and logically analyzed perspectives and so importantly, you present it soberly.  I cant express enough how important that soberly part is today when offering some cud chewing barn animal a new perspective to expose the m0ck1ngb1rd media for what it is.  </p>

<p>My question</p>

<p>Do you think that maybe the depopulation agenda has to do with technocrats getting rid of the remnants of a slave class aka “working class” bred and proliferated by past rulers for dated modalities of labor?  Over eons we’re talking about an exponential proliferation of nation upon nation swollen and clogged with subjects bred “smart” enough to swing a hammer or a sword effectively but “dumb” enough so as not to question why they should or shouldn’t, nor to question who had told them that they must for theirs is but to do and die, and oddly enough the majority seem to like it that way.  And as we’ve seen predictably throughout history all the way up until now, when such people are set free and the gates of their pens are unlocked, they will dig in their heels and hold them closed for “all they’re worth” and then accuse the liberators of breaking and entering. Free or not, they will still be driven by their innate impulse towards some infantile fantasy to seek out some meta-mommy peering sympathetically at them from the kitchen window into the backyard, cooking dinner, washing the dishes, etc. etc.  just so her fat unappreciative little tards can feel safe playing in the mud and shitting themselves all day, and to come home to an orderly house with foodstuffs of every color and flavor heaped into steaming mounds of gelatinous muck topped with extra cheese, then topped with extra extra cheese and positioned front and center of the household brain-beam psychofucker appliance, in HD tho. Cue the cross-dressing reptiles to slither on into the picture belly first, always belly first and with a huge white board for a smile that you can write any old bullshit promise on but it wipes right off with an old handkerchief, with a pizza map on it of course.</p>

<p>What im really trying to say as my high wears off is do you ever feel like maybe there are people in and around the toppy tops that realize the only way for the world to know peace and to live in truth is for it to be inhabited by mostly humans and not pavlovian pigs and their sheep in wolves uniforms.  </p>

<p>This crazy idea came to me from the realization that so much of what “we know” here is not a secret nor nucular rocket surgery by any stretch!  THAT’S THE BULLSHIT THAT BOGGLES MY MIND!!! (and weed).   All this !BOMBSHELL! news about weirdo shit-eating fuckedintheheadophiles in government, 911 truth, jfk, the fed and on and on, I mean jeezus, the lightbulb conspiracy was on the PBS FFS and still…  they vote, suit up and drool and shuffle around in their pathetic taskbot lives while pointing their government licensed compensatory phallus at my head because I don’t identify with any of the cast members of friends, though some people say I look like ross and frankly I do enjoy anthropology.  </p>

<p>Also do you believe that’s why the info is just left lying around, like its all a test for proof of humanity and they&#39;re calling out to those that &quot;get it,&quot; and have you received your boarding pass for “the ark yet?” john Cusack was asking. </p>

<p>Note[obligatory:I’m not saying enyone should be eradicated or culled or whatever] but I am drifting slightly toward the “fuck’em” camp.</p>

<p>Again thanks thanks thanks for your perspectives and hard work, there are so many that count on your diligence so please don’t give up.  ill send you some money, if you need a human shield at a speech or someone with sunglasses and an earpiece standing behind you looking dangerously official, let me know,  just please man..  ..  bro . .., don’t give up, you’re still amongst the best… Or worse, you go full alexjones  shitshow  and I find photos of you, benn swann and jay-z doing devil horns and triangles and stuff.  I’ve been let down so many times before.. please never happen.
Thanks again.</p>

<p>Depopulation is not about eugenics, though eugenicists do use it. Eugenics is an obsolete long term agenda which in most cases does not evolve fast enough to make significant improvements. Eugenics takes millenia, but is often used as a front for a divide and conquer strategy, segregating everyone into controllable groups. Most traits attributed to eugenics are more nuture than nature, but eugenicists like to make themselves seem elite.  Eugenicists are a dying breed. Transhumanism makes eugenics obsolete.  </p>

<p>Zbigniew Brzezinski suggests population control is mostly about control: “And these new and old major powers face still yet another novel reality, in some respects unprecedented, and it is that while the lethality -the lethality of their power is greater than ever,  their capacity to impose control over the politically awakened masses of the world is at an historical low.” ... “I once put it rather pungently, and I was flattered that the British Foreign Secretary repeated this,  as follows… namely, in earlier times, it was easier to control a million people, literally it was easier to control a million people, than physically to kill a million people. Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people. It is easier to kill, than to control…”</p>

<p>Population control is about control. Depopulationists care more about their liberty than our lives. </p>

<p>The slave class will be taking a hit though.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As long as society is human there can be no world peace, there can only be islands of peace created by those who rise above humanity, surrounded by a world of natural human shortcomings, because human society requires a breeding/cess pool underclass from which the new elites rise. Eugenic bloodlines are not enough to guarantee intellectual elites. The spirit is like the wind, you know not from whence it cometh or whither it goest.</p>

<p>Crowdsourcing is very effective. None of us are as smart as all of us. And I don&#39;t trust arks (see: Titanic), but I might be curious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I joined the Green Party 20 years ago (before becoming non-partisan), so you can imagine I share a few of your concerns. I suppose the main concern about &quot;climate change&quot; is that it&#39;s being used as a false pretense to push so many other agendas, much like how legislators tack &quot;midnight riders&quot; on the Defense spending bills to make sure they get passed with minimum fuss. A few agendas that often get tacked onto climate change are tyranny, government overreach, extortion, deindustrialization, austerity, and depopulation. While some bits of these agendas may even be beneficial to humanity, I bristle when I see them being pushed secretly, because so many UN and world leaders behind them have repeatedly proven they are not to be trusted, such as Bill Gates and Ted Turner, who are depopulationists who admitted in their own ways that they want a lot of people to die (Zbigniew Brzezinksi suggests population control is more an issue of controlling people than overpopulation being a burden to industries which could provide for everyone but prefer not to). Industrialists do not care for deindustrilization, obviously. Only inflationary bankers who get rich and anprims and the poor who have nothing to lose are comfortable with austerity. Only mass-murdering eugenicists like the idea of depopulation. Oil is the blood of the military industrial complex, so nations with strong militaries tend to not care for restricting or even criticising the oil industry.  ...but most people do like the idea of a clean environment unless they are the one&#39;s polluting it to save money, or make money (See Omar Mateen&#39;s scene in The Big Fix, a documentary about the BP oil spill cleanup). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey James,</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to do an AMA and thank you for all of your hard work. My question pertains to the modern movement now known as the &quot;SJW&quot; movement. </p>

<p>To me, it seems as though there are a lot of parallels between this movement and the Hippie movement of the 60&#39;-70&#39;s in terms of how it has been cultivated and purposefully guided. As we all probably know here, we have many &quot;alphabet soup&quot; agencies almost entirely dedicated to the war for public perception and I think they are, at least partially, responsible for cultivating this movement using a combination of the media and our own good natures against us (among other things). I think, generally, the anger that has been stewing is completely warranted and for a time started to hit on some issues of actual importance in the grand scheme of things...of course this cannot be allowed. So once again our anger has been channeled into useless outlets of aggression and causes that do nothing but create more divisions among us ultimately distracting from the more pervasive issues.</p>

<p>My question(s) is do you see this in a similar light and if you do, what do you think is the best way to open someone&#39;s mind to the idea that all though they might mean well they also have to consider, based on the fact that this has undeniably happened time and time again, they are being manipulated into championing causes that are inherently divisive or are of little significance in the grand scheme of things? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best way to open someone&#39;s mind to the truth depends largely on the individual. Each brain is wired differently, different agendas, motivations, language. Just care for them as an individual and be intellectually honest, and be patient, it might take a while or it may never happen. Also consider the possibility that they know exactly what they are doing. Many activists are false flags, psyops and phishing expeditions, but that doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t talk to them. Spies need love too.</p>

If you take away all the healthy food, they will find something unhealthy to eat, shoe leather, feces, bark off trees... though if you boil trees down and mash them up and boil them again, they actually turn into something like Jello (needs sugar). On a related note, exercises around Area 51 suggested fallout from nuclear bombs is relatively harmless unless you breathe it in, you can theoretically eat it and unless you have open sores in your digestive tract it will almost always simply pass right through you, but if it gets into your lungs or blood, that&#39;s a bad sign.</p>

<p>My question is this:  During Donald&#39;s inauguration speech, he mentioned exploring &#39;the mysteries of space&quot;, do you have any ideas about why he might have mentioned this?  Also, what do you think about the theories surrounding his connection with the Jesuits, (Georgetown, Bernie visiting the Vatican before stepping down from the nomination), and what could this have to do with his strong speech about God in America?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably the biggest reason is that the corporate elite of the western world are legitimately afraid of a successful socialist and communist nation &quot;setting a good example.&quot;</p>

<p>The CIA and the global elite are terrified that a successful socialist movement or nation might set a good example, and start a domino effect around the world.  </p>

<p>&quot;The boys of capital, they chortle in their martinis about the death of socialism. The word has been banned from polite conversation. And they hope that no one will notice that every socialist experiment of any significance in the twentieth century - without exception - has either been crushed, overthrown, or invaded, or corrupted, perverted, subverted, or destabilized, or otherwise had life made impossible for it, by the United States. Not one socialist government or movement - from the Russian Revolution to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, from Communist China to the FMLN in Salvador - not one was permitted to rise or fall solely on its own merits; not one was left secure enough to drop its guard against the all-powerful enemy abroad and freely and fully relax control at home.&quot; ~ William Blum, &#39;Killing Hope&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I second this. Linda is Palestinian and her family can be connected to Hamas which was quickly brought up by some &quot;alt-right&quot; media. It seems like this is just one example of the many things going on in the name of &quot;political activism&quot; and &quot;journalism&quot; that have an underhanded agenda. A lot of avid Trump supporters believe there&#39;s been an ulterior plan to infiltrate the country with Muslim refugees and ultimately have forced Sharia law. They believe this is the goal of Islam and all Muslims (Obama) but now Trump is here to save us. I live in a very conservative state and come across these people entirely too often. They also all express unwavering, blind support of Israel and validate it with the claim that they are surrounded by terrorists who want to kill all the Jews. So having Linda and Sharia law showcased in the Trump-hating Women&#39;s March certainly doesn&#39;t bring the much needed awareness to Palestinian oppression by conservatives and plays into the &quot;Muslim takeover&quot; narrative. After seeing a story on this my father even told me &quot;SEE! I told you this was their plan. FORCED SHARIA AND HIJABS.&quot; </p>
