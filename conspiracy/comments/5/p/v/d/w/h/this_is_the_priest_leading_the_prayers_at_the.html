    <div class="md"><p>No I was getting at the fact that every time the pizzagaters post their newest &quot;alternative facts&quot; and it gets downvoted of criticized, they immediately jump to that &quot;pedo apologist &amp; defenders are trying to silence us.....&quot;</p>

<p>And I was being sarcastic, because you&#39;d think If pizzagate was anything but a democratic smear campaign, these people would want to investigate any potential pedo news as intensively as they did PG. I mean come on every time it&#39;s called out for what it is, they claim it isn&#39;t a witch hunt, and that all the non-believers need to put aside politics and &quot;think about the children&quot; or that &quot;we need to protect the weakest people in our society&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;d be willing to bet, if you had posted this as &quot;pedo priest sat next to Hillary during inauguration&quot; people would already be shouting it from the rooftops as yet more undeniable proof that &quot;proves&quot; pizzagate </p>

<p>I feel like there&#39;s a disconnect here, my first comment responding to you being downvoted was intended to be heavily sarcastic, implying that the same people who make the &quot;apologist and defenders&quot; claim on PG post when they&#39;re being downvoted are probably the ones downvoting this (since it&#39;s not about Clinton)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly man. It makes me sad to have people dismiss Pizzagate or people posting about it because they still think they&#39;re just trying to bash Dems and Hillary.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why people can&#39;t just accept that those are the emails we got, so those are the ones people worked with and made connections from. </p>

<p>Basically implying pizzagate posters would turn a blind eye to Republican involvement if something came to light.</p>

<p>NO! No you assholes! If republican emails leaked, I would bet the house that the same people would be tearing into them looking for pizzagate connections. The election is over and settled. Perhaps consider the possibility people just want to get to the bottom of this? Maybe there is something more to it for these people than just making Dems and Hillary look bad?</p>

<p>Whether or not the emails were released to crush the democrats, it&#39;s very disturbing that people believe that people online looking into this only care about smearing Dems and don&#39;t just, I don&#39;t know, 
want to expose the possibility of some foul play/abuse involving children? </p>

<p>Someone actually challenged me on the notion that those emails don&#39;t even contain codewords, that people are just careless with their word placement and that is why these emails don&#39;t make sense. Unbelievable. Most of these clowns posting here dismissing pizzagate don&#39;t put up much of a fight when challenged on it. 
I haven&#39;t actually gotten the impression that ANY of the people like this that I have interacted with have even seen everything that has been found. Not once. I have not seen any plausible explanation for everything that has been found when considered as a WHOLE. 
I can believe words were misplaced in one email. Not far-fetched at all. But when were aren&#39;t talking about JUST ONE instance of these sentences that make no sense and with these same words in play, I have to really question if I&#39;m dealing with an honest skeptic.... or an intentional deceiver.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m afraid of the results here but what about katie Johnson? Who said she was raped by trump and epstien when she was 13, and was gonna do a press conference about it till she was threatened if she did? Why is no one coming to fight for her voice or demanding a real investigation into whether or not her story checks out? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m buying her story blindly, but I&#39;m sure there is a ton of dismissing suspect evidence in her case, where are all the citizen journalist on this case? With one conspiracy you have self determined code words and weird art, and the other you have a girl saying something actually happened to her, yet I have not seen any of the PG pushers even mention her name? Why does no one want to give her story the time of day if this isn&#39;t partisan? </p>

<p>With out a doubt had she been accusing podesta or Hillary and then canceled a press conference because of harassment and threats it would be all anyone would be talking about  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are too quick to dismiss something attaching across the aisle, I agree. Pizzagate has some substance to it to dig into.</p>

<p>The Katie Johnson thing is just the claims of an anonymous person. You either believe her story or you don&#39;t. Without a bill Cosby situation with tons of people stepping forward with similar tales, there&#39;s not much anyone can look at to make their decision.</p>

<p>I found the whole anonymous thing to be kind of weird to be honest, as well as the cancelling of the conference. If Trump really raped her, he and Jeff could very well know who she is...Why hide her identity from the public? I would be more worried about resourceful billionaires who raped me being able to figure out my identity and have me whacked  while I&#39;m still &#39;anonymous&#39;, personally. </p>

<p>Trump never went to pedo island and we know Bill did. I can see why people would think they cooked this up so both of their &quot;rapy&quot; stories would cancel out.</p>

<p>I find it a little hard to believe such a prominent public face would commit such a crime and leave such a person alive to tell the tale. If you are already a child rapist, would you really draw the line at murder and take on that risk of a surviving witness? Would you let victims disappear into anonymity to tell on you? Just seems far fetched to me</p>

<p>With pizzagate there is a code being used and we have the emails to go off of. I don&#39;t know what we can do to look into and make judgements on regarding Katie Johnsons story.</p>

<p>I am certain there are republicans involved in the pedo rings. If they were squeaky clean and the dems were depraved on their own, republicans would go public with this and never shut up about it. Politicians themselves would bring it up. It would be the death of the Democratic Party. </p>

<p>It&#39;s had to be all encompassing at the highest levels or it wouldn&#39;t work. </p>

<p>Anyone can go look up Google trends and see for themselves how INSTANTLY the moment pizzagate spread, &quot;Fake News&quot; trended to almost an identical degree. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s just a coincidence though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s even more infuriating because while simultaneously demanding acknowledgment that a humongous organization that for most of human history went hand in hand with government is partaking in child trafficking and pedophilia and covering it up, tries to sweep the insinuation that coked out old men who who take bribes for a living would do the same. You have no problem acknowledging that a power structure based around &#39;holiness&quot; is full of shit, but God forbid someone accuse your precious DNC of doing the same.</p>

This website lists each of the cabinet members and shows if and where they&#39;ve had financial connections.  On the website it had him listed as director of the boy scouts of America.  Did a separate Google search on that,  and found a couple articles talking about how he suppressed the allegations that children had been making.  Also,  an article about him allowing gay scout masters. Huge red flag. Thought about posting here once i came across it,  but didn&#39;t want to have to type out a long spiel about how i came to the conclusion.  But hey,  better now than never. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how you essentially post the same article, in multiple formats to make it seem more substantial or something?</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same article. The Reuters article at the top was disseminated to all the rest of the mainstream media sources.  </p>

<p>The Reuters article (and all the subsequent articles) makes it seem as though Dolan <em>definitively</em> shielded pedo priests.  He <em>did</em> reassign priests -- which at the time of the scandal, the 80s was common practice -- the assumption being that this sin was &#39;curable&#39;.</p>

<p>The therapeutic model has long since been scrapped.  But to say that he did this deliberately in order to &#39;shield&#39; the priests is not substantiated by the information given.</p>

<p>Further the information given shows  that &quot;in September 2003, Dolan informed the Vatican of abuse by Reverend John O&#39;Brien&quot; sending multiple letters to Pope John Paul II.</p>

<p>After receiving no response &quot;records show that Dolan followed up with more two accounts of abuse on the part of O&#39;Brien, according to a document.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, Dolan repeatedly contacted the Vatican about Rev. Obrien&#39;s actions and was did not receive a prompt response.</p>

<p>I love how the mainstream media is &#39;untrustworthy&#39; except when it publishes things about the Catholic Church.  <em>&quot;Then...it&#39;s all true!&quot;</em></p>

<p>You will not hear me defend pedophiles or defend people who definitively harbored or shielded pedos.  I am a female who was assaulted by an Anglican priest myself.</p>

<p>But I will stand up for the truth, no matter what side it is on. Where my beloved Catholic Church has fallen and is in error I will speak out against her, but where error is wanting, I will stand to defend her.</p>

<p>This post -- and these multiple &#39;articles&#39; all saying the same slanted thing -- are not fair to the record of Cardinal Dolan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Church of Rome existed long before it ever hitched it&#39;s wagon to Christianity and agreed to proclaim the divine right of European kings in return for recognising and financially supporting &quot;the Princes of the Church&quot; in equal style and splendor and restoring it&#39;s control over the monarchs who from then on needed the church&#39;s blessing to be fully acknowledged as absolute rulers that God had bestowed that power on and given that right to, just as the priesthood of the Church of Rome had in pre-Christian times when it came to selecting and endorsing Rome&#39;s own Emperors and most powerful leaders. A long tradition and a direct contradiction of Christ admonishing all of his followers &quot;to call no man Lord&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started on that website,  opensecret. Org, which shows where the candidates get their financial contributions from.  Follow the money is a very true statement.  This website lists each of the cabinet members and shows if and where they&#39;ve had financial connections.  On the website it had him listed as director of the boy scouts of America.  Did a separate Google search on that,  and found a couple articles talking about how he suppressed the allegations that children had been making.  Also,  an article about him allowing gay scout masters. Huge red flag. Thought about posting here once i came across it,  but didn&#39;t want to have to type out a long spiel about how i came to the conclusion.  But hey,  better now than never. </p>
