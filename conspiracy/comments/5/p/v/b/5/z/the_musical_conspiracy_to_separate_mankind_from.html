<p>Now, this relates to the famous quote from Tesla, “If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.” </p>

<p>If you&#39;re not familiar with any of this, you&#39;re probably asking why the hell does this matter? I hope this brings some clarity.</p>

<p>The following text below is quoted and sourced from: <a href="http://thetruthnews.info/440_enigma.html">http://thetruthnews.info/440_enigma.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The difference between an ( A = 432 hz ) and an ( A = 440 hz ) Hear it Understand it</p>

<p>Frequency and Vibration hold a critically important yet hidden power to affect our lives, our health, our society and our world. The science of Cymatics proves that Frequency and Vibration are the master keys and organizational foundation for the creation of all matter and life on this planet.</p>

<p>Music has a hidden power to affect our minds, our bodies, our thoughts, and our society. When that music is based upon a tuning standard purposely removed from the natural harmonics found in Sacred Numbers and the Fibonacci series of Nature, the end result may be the psychic poisoning of the mass mind of humanity.</p>

<p>A nefarious alliance between The Rockefellers, The Third Reich, and a landmark Chicago musical instrument maker may have promoted the acceptance of a Western musical tuning standard totally disconnected from the science of Sacred Numbers to the detriment of Mankind. Despite its near universal adoption by the Western World, could the 440 Hz tuning standard actually promote war, disease, death? Might the most beautiful symphonies and melodies be covertly creating conflict and destruction throughout our world? “The 440 Enigma” provides the answers to these thought provoking questions, and sheds new light on how our current musical tuning standard -- A=440Hz -- came to be, and what it may mean to our world if we allow it to continue. </p>

<p>“This unnatural standard tuning frequency (440 hz), removed from the symmetry of sacred vibrations and overtones, has declared war on the subconscious mind of Western Man.” by L. C. Vincent (for henrymakow.com)</p>

<p>Vibration throughout the frequency spectrum of sound, heat, and light, is the organizational principle of matter.  Sound is the organizational principle of our Universe, of physical matter and most importantly, living matter.</p>

<p>Prologue:</p>

<p>Vibration throughout the frequency spectrum of sound, heat, and light, is the organizational principle of matter.  Sound is the organizational principle of our Universe, of physical matter and most importantly, living matter.</p>

<p>The science of Cymatics illustrates that when sound waves move through a physical medium (air, water, sand, metallic particles, etc.) the frequency of the waves has a direct effect upon the structures which are created by the sound waves as they pass thru that particular medium. YouTube videos show these fascinating patterns and arrangements here:

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4jUMWFKPTY">Cymatics - Bringing Matter To Life With Sound, Part 3 of 3</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine an incredibly powerful, wealthy person who secretly prospers from conflict, disease and war learns that certain sound frequencies (those easily divisible by two, signifying opposition) create conflict, discord and disharmony while those divisible by three  (signifying balance, polity, reconciliation, harmony) produce symmetry, and visually harmonic, pleasing structures.</p>

<p>Now imagine that he has the power to establish the tuning standard of all musical instruments throughout the Western World.</p>

<p>Imagine that he bases the entire scale of musical artistic creation upon a frequency which would skew vibrations towards discord.</p>

<p>It sounds like science fiction.  Yet this is exactly what transpired in September 1939 when Rockefeller (Illuminati) financial interests dictated that the standard tuning for the note of “A” above middle C would henceforth be said to vibrate at precisely 440 cycles per second.</p>

<p>This unnatural standard tuning frequency, removed from the symmetry of sacred vibrations and overtones, has declared war on the subconscious mind of Western Man.</p>

<p>The standard tuning fork, which is set to vibrate the note “A” above middle C at 440 cycles per second, is based upon a frequency only divisible by two rather than three, which means that all of the musical notes both above and below it are affected.</p>

<p>Despite the apparent “sweet music” a symphony orchestra can produce, when all instruments are tuned based on the A=440Hz key frequency, they are covert weapons no matter what “music” they may be playing.</p>

<p>These destructive frequencies entrain the thoughts towards disruption, disharmony, disunity.  Additionally, they also stimulate the controlling organ of the body — the brain — into disharmonious resonance, which ultimately creates disease and war.</p>

<p>“MILITARIZATION OF MUSIC”</p>

<p>In a paper entitled “Musical Cult Control,” Dr. Leonard Horowitz writes:</p>

<p>The music industry “…features this imposed frequency that is ‘herding’ populations into greater aggression, psycho social agitation, and emotional distress predisposing people to physical illness….” while the agents of this conspiracy provide ‘therapeutic’ pacification in the form of myriad psychotropic drugs and tranquillizers for the stress they purposely created, and chemotherapy for the more serious illnesses it inspires.”</p>

<p>He says, “Energy (vibration) impacts “life” (biology) and our bodies through the most common medium of life:  water.  Our body weight, which is nearly 80 percent water, vibrates and resonates to frequencies, and frequencies entrain our physical matter as well as thought processes.  </p>

<p>Light and sound have been shown as the primary drivers of inter-cellular communication, which indicates that our health, or lack of it, may indeed by a product of the vibrational resonance of sound and light.”</p>

<p>As noted, the Rothschild-Rockefeller (Illuminati) alliance chose “….to determine the musical factors capable of producing psycho pathology, emotional distress and ‘mass hysteria.’”</p>

<p>BAD VERSUS GOOD VIBRATIONS</p>

<p>The initial effort to make A=440 Hz the basis of standard tuning took place in 1910 when the Rockefeller Foundation issued a grant to the American Federation of Musicians to popularize the concept. The initial effort failed.</p>

<p>However, the BSI — British Standards Institute — officially adopted A=440 Hz in 1939, promoted by the strange consortium of Rockefeller Foundation influence and the Nazi government.  Ironically, The British adopted a tuning standard promoted by the Third Reich, just as both went to war.  While 440Hz had been rejected by British musicians only 3 months prior, Josef Goebbels persuaded the BSI to adapt 440Hz saying it was of extraordinary importance.</p>

<p>As Dr. Leonard Horowitz concludes: “Music bioenergetically affects your body chemistry, psycho  neuro immunology, and health. Your body is now vibrating musically, audibly and subliminally, according to an institutionally imposed frequency in harmony with aggression and in dissonance rather than vibrating in harmony with Love.”</p>

<p>Musical instrument tuning using the artificially imposed standard of A=440Hz may promote physical and mental disease and distrust, while effectively suppressing spirituality, intuition and creativity. This universal tuning frequency has been empirically shown to suppress the creative, intuitive aspects of our mind, while negatively affecting our body chemistry and our immune systems.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>I don’t know if anyone can prove a direct link between aggression, disassociation, paranoia and violence to a tuning system that was promoted by both the Rockefellers and the Third Reich. However, just the fact that these two entities came together to push this standard is more than suspicious in my mind.</p>

<p>Although more than a few people have made the connection between the music of John Philip Sousa and his marching music as a stimulus to war, that specific link is in reference to composition, not frequency and vibration based on a tuning system.</p>

<p>“Intuitively, I think my sources are correct. But how does one go about proving that a specific frequency tuning is creating social stress, disharmony or physical violence and war? But the fact that the Rockefellers and the Third Reich pushed this tuning standard over the opposition of British musicians makes it suspicious, even sinister.”</p>

<p>The Rockefeller–Illuminati axis, their money and research, imposed this artificial tuning “standard” upon Mankind for the purpose of creating chaos. It continues to this day to funnel our minds and emotions along paths of negativity. It is high time for new, good vibrations to become ascendant and a “new standard” of vibrational tuning to emerge. It is time for the power of Love to triumph!</p>

<p>Okay, so here&#39;s what I was able to find. This forum post had some text that seemed like it was pasted from somewhere, <a href="https://www.realistnews.net/Thread-john-lennon-threatened-to-destroy-rockefeller-conspiracy-of-radio-tv-frequency">https://www.realistnews.net/Thread-john-lennon-threatened-to-destroy-rockefeller-conspiracy-of-radio-tv-frequency</a></p>

<p>I wondered, who is this Tobias being mentioned? So I searched &#39;tobias burris-meyer&#39; and the top result is a non-existent page. Thank you wayback machine!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121017235751/http://www.medicalveritas.org/MedicalVeritas/Musical_Cult_Control.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20121017235751/http://www.medicalveritas.org/MedicalVeritas/Musical_Cult_Control.html</a></p>

<p>A very in-depth write-up with cited sources by Leonard G. Horowitz. Source (8) is a paper by James Tobias pulled from the RF archive.</p>

<p>From page 10 of the document: &quot;Thus, following musical meaning purposefully through the domains of radio, theatre, and motion pictures meant inadvertent excursions into the sternly cynical heights of critical theory with Adorno in the late 1930s and early 1940s, into sonic warfare and musical behaviorism as Burris-Meyer&#39;s succeeded his early Rockefeller-supported activities with work for the Department of Defense and the Muzak Corporation in the early 1940s, and into false accusations of aiding communism in the case of Eisler in the middle 1940s. Yet with the highly productive results as well as the unintended outcomes of the Rockefeller Foundation‟s music projects, the Foundation demonstrated the new status of music as a determining factor in a historical phase in which media “convergence” was thought to proceed more through listening as an ambivalent behavior than through a single, transformed technical substrate (as in “digital” convergence theories). &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quick follow-up if you have time. How exactly do you &quot;tune&quot; to a different frequency?</p>

<p>For example if you&#39;re a guitarist and want to go an octave above middle C you tighten the guitar string so there&#39;s less slack when it&#39;s picked. But you&#39;re saying the note should be exactly the same octave, but the frequency is different(meaning # of oscillations per second). So how does someone physically do this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of practical reasons for everyone to use the same tuning frequency. I was part of an orchestra concert tour in Europe once, and we would tune to the piano of each concert hall we played in. Some were tuned at 440 and some were at 442. Tuning when your ears are adjusting after getting off of a plane is bad enough-tuning to different frequencies all the time really screws with your internal pitch. Someone with perfect pitch would be driven nuts by different tuning frequencies. So whether they pushed for it or not, I imagine with traveling musicians and with recordings being sent around the globe, a standard tuning was more practical. Personally, I find it difficult sometimes to listen to very old recordings or to recordings of &quot;authentic performance practice&quot; of baroque works in which the tuning is dropped below 440. They all sound very flat. </p>

Most pianos are tuned to 440, and unless you cart your own 432 piano with you everywhere or want to pay to have a piano retuned for every performance and rehearsal, you&#39;re tuning to the piano in the concert hall in which you&#39;re performing. </p>

<p>I wondered, who is this Tobias being mentioned? So I searched &#39;tobias burris-meyer&#39; and the top result is a non-existent page. Thank you wayback machine!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121017235751/http://www.medicalveritas.org/MedicalVeritas/Musical_Cult_Control.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20121017235751/http://www.medicalveritas.org/MedicalVeritas/Musical_Cult_Control.html</a></p>

<p>A very in-depth write-up with cited sources by Leonard G. Horowitz. Source (8) is a paper by James Tobias pulled from the RF archive. </p>

<p>From page 10 of the document:
&quot;Thus, following musical meaning purposefully through the domains of radio, theatre, and motion pictures meant inadvertent excursions into the sternly cynical heights of critical theory with Adorno in the late 1930s and early 1940s, into sonic warfare and musical behaviorism as Burris-Meyer&#39;s succeeded his early Rockefeller-supported activities with work for the 
Department of Defense and the Muzak Corporation in the early 1940s, and into false accusations of aiding communism in the case of Eisler in the middle 1940s. Yet with the highly productive 
results as well as the unintended outcomes of the Rockefeller Foundation‟s music projects, the Foundation demonstrated the new status of music as a determining factor in a historical phase in which media “convergence” was thought to proceed more through listening as an ambivalent behavior than through a single, transformed technical substrate (as in “digital” convergence 
theories).  &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always had an interest in this idea. I&#39;m a semi-pro cellist and play in a string orchestra. I&#39;ve been planting seeds to our conductor and musical director to try tuning down to a432. I keep getting sidelined because of the inconvenience of tuning the piano. It&#39;s understandable because we do play with untunable instruments occasionally.</p>

<p>So the plan is to start smaller with quartet pieces and see how it feels. I&#39;m pretty excited about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post with so many good links, I&#39;m book marking you!</p>

<p>I agree - Music/Sound is the building blocks for literally everything. (Because everything vibrates) Yet, here in Canada, it is no longer taught in schools. This to my conspiratorial mind indicates that Music is vitally important. </p>

<p>And I have to agree that sadly the end result of manipulating sacred frequencies is to separate us from the divine as much as they possibly can. </p>

<p>On a side note: There is a very compelling theory going around which is that we are all in a simulation/holographic reality and can control our reality based on our thoughts, intention and vibration. </p>

<p>I think there is a lot of truth in this theory, but imho it&#39;s forgetting the most important and profound point --- which is that everything is spirit. It&#39;s not cold and mechanical -- it Love!</p>

<p>This is conspiracy lore :) But it&#39;s actually been suggested that the deity the Elite worship is technological in nature. Lol. (They view our universe and Metatron&#39;s cube as a big machine) </p>

<p>But where do they think this technology came from? And what in fact is technology made up of anyway, but vibrations of sound and light?</p>

<p>And what is sound and light? It&#39;s not cold and life less --- it is life -- with spirit and intelligence. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been programmed to view the material world as separate from the Spiritual World. Which is simply ridiculous - they are one and the same. And I agree with you that moving to a more loving frequency in both thought and action will transform our world on a fundamental, biological level. Music is the key! :)  Love not Fear! </p>

<p>Thanks again sparkledarkle! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Switching to A432Hz is a good start, but you want Pythagorean tuning as well to be most natural. Modern &quot;equal temperament&quot; screws up the intervals between notes. And most modern instruments (guitar, piano, etc) have this temperament hard-coded either by fret placement or design.</p>

<p>Surprisingly and disappointingly, most modern electronic music software (lookin at you, Ableton Live) won&#39;t let you change the base frequency (440Hz vs 432Hz) or temperament. This cannot be an accident. At some point the software designers hard-coded this.</p>

<p>Beyond that, equal temperament 440Hz is enforced by convention. If you try to play in A432 Pythagorean, you&#39;ll be out of tune with &gt;99% of other modern musicians.</p>

<p>The ideal instrument, IMO, for playing A432 Pythagorean is fretless or allows arbitrary, not-predefined notes. Violin, viola, cello, fretless bass. It&#39;s interesting that violin and viola are tuned in 5ths and use a chinrest to transfer those vibrations right to the skull.</p>

<p>I think music can be used to help regulate the endocrine system. Each note of the scale corresponds to one of the 7 chakras, each of which corresponds to a particular gland. I think classical music in the correct temperament can have a therapeutic value for humans -- similar to how it makes plants grow better. </p>

<p>Parting thought: Your heartbeat beats in 3/4 timing, not 4/4 timing. Interesting that 4/4 is everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>432Hz is by no means arbitrary. See below.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The second is not arbitrary. A second is the rotation of the Earth divided by 24 (for hours), divided by 60 (minutes), divided by 60. A second is based on vibration found in nature.</p>

<p>Wanna know something neat? The precession of the equinoxes takes 60*432 years. Not arbitrary. Speed of light = 432<sup>2</sup> mph. Not arbitrary. This is natural. There are many more examples.</p>

Further.  24 and 60 and 60 are arbitrary.  We could have defined an hour, minutes, and seconds into any number we like.  There are billions of other vibrations in nature, whats sacred about that certain isotope of a cesium atom?  If you take the square root of the speed of light, it&#39;s actually more like 431.7...and besides that, you get a different number if you don&#39;t use miles per hour.

<ul>
<li><strong>Root chakra</strong> (1st - 456Hz?) — Reproductive glands (testes in men; ovaries in women); controls sexual development and secretes sex hormones.</li>
<li><strong>Sacral chakra</strong> (2nd - 606Hz?) — Adrenal glands; regulates the immune system and metabolism. Bladder, prostate, ovaries, kidneys, gall bladder, bowel, spleen</li>
<li><strong>Solar Plexus chakra</strong> (3rd - 364Hz - F#) — Pancreas; regulates metabolism. Intestines, liver, bladder, stomach, upper spine</li>
<li><strong>Heart chakra</strong> (4th - 256Hz - C) — Thymus gland; regulates the immune system. Heart, lungs</li>
<li><strong>Throat chakra</strong> (5th - 384Hz - G) — Thyroid gland; regulates body temperature and metabolism. Bronchial tubes, vocal cords, respiratory system, all areas of the mouth, including tongue and esophagus.</li>
<li><strong>Third Eye chakra</strong> (6th - 288Hz - D) — Pituitary gland; produces hormones and governs the function of the previous five glands; sometimes, the pineal gland is linked to the third eye chakra as well as to the crown chakra. Eyes, brain</li>
<li><strong>Crown chakra</strong> (7th - 432Hz - A) — Pineal gland; regulates biological cycles, including sleep. Spinal cord and brain stem</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Music is merely a projection of personal culture.</p>

<p>I am a musician who can make money at it when I so choose. I mean, enough to get by. I&#39;m not famous.</p>

<p>I loved Jimi Hendrix&#39;s idea of the electric church and I think he implemented it well.</p>

<p>Point being, modern music replaces a lot of what religion used to give people. Beyond that, music does allow for as much freedom as your mind is capable making for yourself and projecting that to other people.</p>

<p>But, unless the backbone of the music you create is based on the cultural understanding of your audience, they won&#39;t &#39;get it.&#39; It&#39;s an exercise in confirmation bias and mimetics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a music student in college and wrote a whole essay on this topic. The issue isn&#39;t necessarily with any single note, but with the harmonies produced between two or more notes. </p>

<p>There have been many tuning systems throughout western history and they all relied on tuning that corresponded to the harmonic series. This is a mathematical truth that is found in many natural processes: from planets, to colors, to sound waves. A simple way to explain this in a musical sense is that every interval between notes is a whole number ratio of the fundamental. This system of tuning had many iterations but is commonly called Pure or Just Intonation. It was used in Ancient Greece, in the Baroque and Renaissance Eras and still exists in many great musical traditions of the Far East and indigenous cultures. </p>

<p>All the music we hear in Western Culture today is tuned to Equal Temperament. This is where the ocatve is divided into equal parts. The mathematically pure ratios between two notes no longer exist in this tuning. This really came into dominance in the mid 1700&#39;s for a variety of reasons. </p>

<p>One of the drawbacks to Pure (Just) Intonation is that you cannot easily modulate into different keys. The notes in Pure Intonation are only related to the fundamental, so modulation becomes impossible.</p>

<p>One of the ways around this was to standardize the space between notes so that you could modulate to a different key and the same ratios would apply. This was convenient for instrument manufacturers because around this time they were beginning to mass produce instruments, especially pianos. It was much easier to produce something that was standardized. However this caused all instruments to be mathematically &quot;out of tune&quot;.</p>

<p>My essay was suggesting that this dissonance was being seen in society as a whole. If you listen to music that&#39;s out of tune with the laws of nature, than perhaps the individuals/society would also behave that way. It also is interesting that cultures where Pure Harmony is still used there is a thriving Sacred/Spiritual musical tradition and understanding.</p>

<p>The switch to Equal Temperament may not have been a conscious conspiracy but it has produced the same result. This is one of the most compelling visual representations of Just Intonation vs Equal Temperament. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NlI4No3s0M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NlI4No3s0M</a></p>

<p>A good anecdote: The human brain naturally is inclined toward pure intonation. Acapella singers will intrinsically sing a pure harmony with each other, not the harmony found on a standard keyboard. </p>

<p>This part right here posits that it is the music that is a large reason negativity is created, and that human history (when using pure intonation, if they even actually used pure intonation) has had a lack of that amount of negativity. This is simply not the case, because negativity takes many many forms, and yet all throughout &quot;history&quot;, in all places across the globe, there has always been the same types of negativity, albeit modified over time with the changing of government systems, economic systems, religions, &quot;scientific knowledge&quot;, technology, medicine, and indeed entertainment. </p>

<p>During ancient Greece and the other time periods and places you mentioned, there was still war, there was still abuse, there was still inequality, there was still discrimination, there was still conformity to limiting beliefs, there was still intolerance, there was still unwarranted cynicism, there was still all of the same types of negativity we see today, albeit there are simply a few more nowadays because there are more humans, there is more technology, there are more diseases, etc. </p>

<p>Even in mostly indigenous places that have a sacred/&quot;spiritual&quot; musical tradition and &quot;understanding&quot;, there is still negativity and many of the same types of negativity, and any lack of overt and varied negativity comes from the fact that these societies do not have as many people, do not have as many things, do not have the same technology, are not connected to everywhere else, so there is simply less, which means simply &quot;less&quot; negativity in terms of overtness and variety.</p>

<p>Those people in these places that might still use pure intonation (if they ever did) still have negative thoughts about others, still have very negative feelings, still have fights, still engage in hostile behavior, still have much negativity, and it has been this way everywhere all throughout &quot;recorded human history&quot;.</p>

<p>These people are not somehow slightly immune to negativity because the music they create and listen to is more harmonic than modern western music. No matter the ratios between intervals or the tuning of your notes, the same negativity is still there and is not reliant upon the music.</p>

<p>And suggesting that dissonance itself is a negative thing and that consonance itself is a positive thing is essentially positing that one series of tones (everything tuned to 432 hz) is actually superior to another series of tones (everything tuned to 440 hz). This is because this posits that consonance is superior to dissonance and that tension in music is thus less important than the relieving of tension. </p>

<p>If this were the case then this then means that consonance is more important to music than dissonance, and that any minor scale (which is based on dissonance) simply isn&#39;t as pleasing as any major scale (based on consonance), and thus minor isn&#39;t as important as major, which of course means major is superior. </p>

<p>This is an entirely subjective viewpoint simply because one creates tension and the other resolves it. Both tension and its resolution are needed in music, and songs that are either completely dissonant or completely consonant are nowhere near as pleasing to the ear as the combination of the 2, because excitement is created with tension and calmness is created with its resolution. </p>

<p>Completely dissonant and the music becomes harsh and can be disorienting. Completely consonant and the music becomes boring and gets old very fast. </p>

<p>Both of these things are unpleasant to listen to, just for different reasons. So dissonance is no more unpleasant than consonance, it is simply unpleasant in a different way. </p>

<p>Even if the elite did get the tuning of A to be changed to 440 hz, it still is not important at all, even if it creates different shapes with cymatics and is based on more complete math (the only reason they would have done this would be to standardize music so they could more easily control it, because order is needed to control a populace, etc. There would be more to this that I could go into but again, it simply isn&#39;t important.).</p>

<p>Now music is such an immensely and deeply connected and logical thing that allows for infinite subjective expression and interpretation that to posit that it, along with math and geometry, and so many other things, simply formed that way without any intelligence behind it is simply absurd, and essentially insane, to one of the highest degrees imaginable. </p>

<p>These things, along with so many other things, speak of not only intelligence, but essentially infinite intelligence, and where there is intelligence, there is something behind that intelligence. That something behind that intelligence would be God, and that would mean that God is essentially infinitely intelligent. </p>

<p>An essentially infinitely intelligent God would understand and appreciate that equality among things is one of the most important aspects of reality, and God would also understand and appreciate that equality is not at all the same thing as sameness, and would also thus understand and appreciate that uniqueness is just as valuable. In fact these very concepts of uniqueness, value, and equality, are all objective concepts that humans simply subjectify. </p>

<p>Now I am not going to go into everything because there is simply no point in doing that at the moment, but this would mean that God would never have created music and have the 2 main components of melody/harmony (consonance and dissonance) be unequal at all. Everything is so connected and logical but also values subjectivity just as much that tension inherently creates excitement (and one could also say anticipation) and that its resolution inherently creates calmness (and one could also say relief). Both things are necessary to appreciate and enjoy music to its fullest extent. </p>

<p>So saying that one frequency of A (432 hz) is superior to another frequency of A (440) simply because it is more harmonic (and thus consonant) and has more complete math is simply not the case. Saying that any frequency of A is superior to another is folly, except if the A goes so far as to completely change notes. Organization is of course important and to have no organization as to what would consist of notes themselves would be chaos without order, which itself is a negative thing. </p>

<p>Order itself without chaos is also a negative thing, because randomness is needed to appreciate and enjoy existence just as much as order is. Order and chaos apply equally to music, and too much of either makes the music unpleasant. too much order and its too repetitive and boring, too much chaos and its confusing and disorienting. </p>

<p>There needs to be both in order to be appreciated and enjoyed as much as music is meant to be, and music is certainly meant to be appreciated and enjoyed <strong><em>quite</em></strong> a lot. In fact, it is meant to be appreciated and enjoyed essentially infinitely. </p>

<p>An infinitely intelligent God would understand that in order for there to truly be a point to existence, positivity would have to reign and be the natural state of things. Because if negativity were at all part of the natural state of things, such as being 1/2 along with positivity, then since the state of things means reality (reality means everything that exists), that would mean that negativity would naturally be a part of God (since God exists). </p>

<p>That would then mean that God would destroy everything because that is the most naturally negative thing God can do, and if negativity is natural to God <strong><em>at all</em></strong> then God will absolutely do it because it is simply a part of God. </p>

<p>And that hasn&#39;t happened, and isn&#39;t happening, and because God is essentially infinitely intelligent then God would absolutely know that this would happen so God will never ever make negativity part of the natural state of things. So therefore it has never been, is not, and never will be the natural state of things. </p>

<p>Now this doesn&#39;t mean negativity does not exist, not at all. Negativity exists, and since positivity is the natural state of things, negativity would therefore serve a positive function and purpose. But in order to justify its existence it would have to be positive in a way that positivity alone really isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>To make a long story shorter, and because its pointless to go into extreme detail at this time, the main point of negativity (<em>there are other points, but this is the main one</em>) is to help us <strong>learn lessons</strong> (<em>lessons that could not really be learned through positivity alone</em>). </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>This is reply #2, please reply to this</strong></p>

<p>Since that would be the main point of negativity (since it makes negativity positive in a way positivity alone really can&#39;t be), that (learning lessons) would also be one of the main points of positivity as well (another would be to appreciate and enjoy existence), and since these things come from God, learning lessons would be the heart of true spirituality. This is of course, paraphrasing (because there&#39;s not enough space to write more), but that means that only those who have learned the initial lesson that negativity is not the natural state of things and who also understand that learning lessons is the core of true spirituality, are actual true spiritual initiates. </p>

<p>So everything else &quot;spiritual&quot; is either something that is obvious (like unconditional love), or ridiculous/insane (like &quot;oneness&quot;). No religion on earth is &quot;spiritual&quot; and so much of the &quot;new age spirituality&quot; is neither truly spiritual or logical in any way.</p>

<p>Beliefs are based on incomplete and inaccurate information and are based entirely around using subjectivity to determine reality,  and essentially all religions do this, &quot;new age spirituality&quot; does this, and &quot;science&quot; (mainstream science) does this as well.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t get into all of that here, but read my recent posts (all of which are on this sub) because I show and explain all of it in them. I still have yet to write my post about obvious evidence and there is much I am going to do, but that will all come in time because logic determines priorities and there are more immediate things that are more important than posting here (even though that is extremely extremely important).</p>

<p>Now back to negativity. Negativity is applied to music, this is true. And the main point of negativity is to learn lessons. But if one has not learned the lesson that negativity is not part of the natural state of things, then all true spirituality is outside of the realm of that being&#39;s existence, and thus negativity is simply negativity, 1 half of reality along with positivity. </p>

<p>But there are also different forms of negativity, like intentional negativity (rapping about drugs, violence, negative lyrics etc.), and unintentional negativity (pure dissonance or consonance, over repetition, etc.). Lessons would be learned in both, but for different reasons.</p>

<p>Now all of the negativity we see in music is outside of true spirituality, because no one has learned that very very very very important lesson about negativity yet. But the lessons learned regarding intentional negativity and unintentional negativity are different. </p>

<p>both ultimately point to the same first lesson however, that same lesson I have been talking about involving negativity. Unintentional negativity would involve learning lessons regarding the combination of objectivity and subjectivity and how music is a cominbation of those 2 things, and how music effects subjectivity etc.</p>

<p>But regarding negativity being outside of true spirituality, extend that to life here on earth. Now animals are different because many of them are biologically meant to eat meat, hunt, etc., and there are so many other things that distinguish them from humans. So I am essentially talking about humans and their effect on earth and the rest of life here.</p>

<p>This means that the elite that control the world are outside of true spirituality and spiritual awareness, so thus negativity is simply negativity to them. That means that they are not learning lessons from negativity because they still believe it is part of the natural state of things And they are attached so deeply to negativity that it is the most important thing in existence to them, so they propagate and create it everywhere they can. They have as a group, over the millennia, created a system of control, domination, and oppression that runs deep in every part of life here on earth. </p>

<p>The elite as a group are much older than &quot;recorded history&quot; and extend back millennia. They have based their system of control around hiding, keeping secret, debunking, discrediting, devaluing, and fictionializing the existence of the place they stem from. That place is Atlantis, and it is the most important thing we could be talking about.</p>

<p>It is the key to defeating the elite (which include the Rockefellers) and destroying their system once and for all.</p>

<p>I will not go into it here, but I can assure you that it was <strong>very very very very very</strong> real, and there are so many things that point to this, most importantly of all the obvious evidence, all of the connections between everything, and the logic that shows what order these connections would be in.</p>

<p>I have made a thread going into detail about Atlantis and its connection/paramount importance to defeating the elite and their global control system <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">here</a>, and it continues in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixn93/">this</a> comment, and in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixo60/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">this</a> comment that continues the first comment. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbkbysz/">This</a> comment goes into Atlantis, the elite, secret societies, and spiritual initiates, all things that are important to understand Atlantis, and how there is a lie that the elite are somehow &quot;spiritually&quot; minded. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nmxg4/mysterious_10000_year_old_underwater_ruins_in/dcdga4q/">This</a> comment explains why the &quot;comet&quot; theory of Atlantis&#39; destruction is false and it explains how Atlantis absolutely would have been destroyed, and it also goes into why cyclical rising and lowering of human consciousness is false as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright I appreciate the response but this is a really complicated and lengthy post and I don&#39;t really have time at the moment to respond to all of it. But first of all you are assuming a lot of things about what I said. I don&#39;t doubt that there is a globalist cabal that is oppressing the masses and using a system of control and domination to run our lives. I am just explaining the harmonic series and the difference between tuning systems. I was explaining the concept of harmony in general, the relationship between two or more notes. Dissonance and consonance are not just subjective terms when talking about the harmony. There is mathematically pure harmony, which is found in pure intonation, and there are (for lack of a better term) non-pure harmonies, which is found in equal temperament. The harmonic series is a mathematical truth that appears in many natural processes, it is not subjective. Western culture had two major musical traditions, secular and sacred. The sacred musical tradition has disappeared. It&#39;s just interesting to hypothesize why that has happened. What I&#39;m saying isn&#39;t mutually exclusive to what you&#39;re saying, and it doesn&#39;t counteract it at all. I think it just adds another interesting layer to music and culture. I don&#39;t doubt that the Rockefeller&#39;s are nefarious as fuck and are part of the globalist elite, I&#39;m just saying that the shift away from pure harmony may play a bigger part in controlling our minds than the shift to 440.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, I never doubted that you yourself doubted the existence of the elite and their system. What I am saying is that regardless of mathematically pure ratios, and regardless of the objectivity that consonance and dissonance are indeed part of harmony, subjectivity is intricately and so very very very very very very deeply linked to consonance and dissonance (because those things would not matter if there were no beings around to hear them), and that positing that mathematically incomplete or impure ratios regarding frequencies have a negative effect at all on humanity is simply false, because it doesn&#39;t take into account all of the obvious evidence, does not make all of the connections between everything, and does not use logic to order those connections in the correct sequence to find the actual truth. </p>

<p>Objectivity helps you understand and appreciate subjectivity more and the fact that it is equally as important as objectivity to our existence. Subjective experience allows one to learn the lessons needed to reach objectivity. These 2 things are equally important. </p>

<p>But subjectivity used to determine objectivity is insanity, and objectivity used to determine subjectivity is also insanity. The same applies for using chaos to determine order or order to determine chaos. </p>

<p>Objectivity deeply influences subjectivity and subjectivity deeply influences objectivity. Things that objectively exist influence our subjective lives, and our subjectivity (thoughts, feelings, desires, beliefs, attitudes) affect our actions and actions affect things that objectively exist (such as animals, the water, etc.) </p>

<p>But these 2 things do not determine one another. Your beliefs regarding mathematically pure ratios of harmony do not determine negativity and why it exists, and logic does not determine why someone likes ketchup more than mustard, or why someone finds tall girls to be more attractive than short girls.</p>

<p>The sacred musical tradition, ever since the destruction of Atlantis, has existed as a means of spreading belief rather than simultaneously stemming from true spiritual awareness and creating as much appreciation and joy as possible. </p>

<p>Theories, conjecture, beliefs. All of these things are based on incomplete and inaccurate information, and are all essentially the same thing. They are subjectivity being used to determine reality, and this is <strong>insanity.</strong> There are no assumptions being made, because you, and everyone else who uses belief to determine reality (even if they say its only a theory), quite plainly give obvious evidence, through your words, pointing to the simple truth that you, and they, are using subjectivity to determine reality. </p>

<p>The op is doing this, and the vast vast vast vast majority of this sub does this constantly. And this is what is going to change. Subjectivity and objectivity can never, and should never, determine one another. They can only ever, and only ever should, influence each other.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary"></span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Lollipop111111.html">Lollipop111111</a> 2017-01-24</p>
    <div class="md"><p>The point is that you cannot, and never should ever consider &quot;quantum physics&quot; to be obvious evidence for anything because it is not possible for everyone to see any of it for themselves in person, including that slit experiment you were talking about. It is microscopic &quot;evidence&quot; and it is completely hidden away from everyone who isn&#39;t &quot;qualified&quot; to see this &quot;evidence&quot;. &quot;Scientists&quot; expect everyone to simply accept their word as absolute &quot;fact&quot; and say they have the &quot;evidence&quot;, and might even give recreations or show arbitrary pictures of such things (they are arbitrary because when it comes to microscopic things, <em>especially this &quot;observer effect&quot;</em>, these things need to be seen in person) to give their claims validity. </p>

<p>They expect that their authority remained unquestioned because they have &quot;evidence&quot; to prove their conjecture, but in reality they do not have any evidence for anything, because it is not obvious whatsoever and thus their &quot;facts&quot; and conclusions are indeed conjecture, and thus beliefs.</p>

<p>Evidence can only ever be considered evidence if it is possible that everyone can see it for themselves, and I will post a thread in the near future showing and explaining this as much as i possibly can within reason. </p>

<p>To top off the truth that most mainstream &quot;science&quot; and &quot;scientists&quot; propagate conjecture and beliefs as &quot;fact&quot; on their own, the elite have an <strong>incredibly</strong> vested interest in making sure &quot;science&quot; is controlled and fabricated to suit their needs. This includes radio carbon dating and fabricating dates, giving theoretical &quot;physicists&quot; tons of exposure to the public, perpetuating the idea that global weather patterns cannot be changed or influenced by technology on a mass scale, etc. and SO many other things. </p>

<p>They actively manipulate, control, threaten, influence, and ultimately make &quot;scientists&quot;, archaeologists, and historians to censor any actual findings that do not support the elite&#39;s narrative of reality. They do this the world over and their system of control has conditioned all of these people to scoff and ridicule any who go against the approved grain of &quot;science&quot;, archaeology, or history.</p>

<p>You cannot, and should not, ever use conjecture and beliefs to say that the elite are not actually as powerful and controlling as they actually are, because their system of control, domination, and oppression <em>literally</em> runs through every aspect of life here on earth, even in nature, where they influence and effect the lives of essentially every species on the planet.</p>

<p>When you are able to take into account all of the obvious evidence, make all of the connections between everything, and use logic to order those connections in the correct sequence, you both find the actual <em>objective</em> truth, and write a lot because there are so many things to be said *<em>in order to show and explain the truth as much as possible within reason.</em></p>

<p>Changing the world is not idle conversation, it is active discussion. Those who do not actually know the <em>objective</em> truth (and who believe something to be true) will not ever consistently write as much as I do because they simply do not <strong>know</strong> that they know the truth, and thus doubt will always set in at some point and they will eventually stop trying to convince others of their beliefs.</p>

<p>You will see this with essentially everybody here on this sub, and on this website, and everywhere else, because they do not <strong>know</strong> that they know the truth, and when you know the truth, you understand and appreciate just how supremely important it is that everyone else knows it too, and understands and appreciates all aspects of it the same way you do and to the same degree.</p>

<p>This sub isn&#39;t the sub for &quot;food for thought&quot;, and even if many threads are like that, it will change because this sub&#39;s goal, whether it is conscious or not, is to change the world for the better, and the objective truth will do just that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Subjective experience is of course necessary to learn lessons, which themselves enable you to find the objective truth. Now of course subjectivity encompasses your existence, but the point is that subjectivity does not determine objectivity. It cannot and should not ever be able to do so, because the existence of negativity itself and its deep connection to subjectivity would put everything at risk and there would be no order, only chaos, and not <em>only</em> that, but reality itself would break because if someone&#39;s beliefs about something being possible or impossible conflicted with the beliefs of another person, or if one group&#39;s shared belief conflicted with anothers. </p>

<p>Possibility and impossibility cannot exist at the same time regarding the same thing because they are universals. Universals encompasse all things in a category and only 1 can exist at any time for thst category.</p>

<p>It is simply <strong>impossible</strong> (that word means it can never happen ever) for 2 universals to exist at the same time, and subjectivity determining reality means that objectivity does not, and reality is not broken because people <strong><em>already</em></strong> have conflicting beliefs about the possibility/impossibility of certain things.</p>

<p>So no subjectivity cannot and does not determine reality. And quantum physics, regardless of any supposed surprise and controversy surrounding it, is exactly like the vast majority of &quot;science&quot; in that it is subjectivity being used to determine reality because it is based on beliefs, which themselves are conjecture, which is conclusions formed from incomplete and inaccurate information.</p>

<p>I have showed and explained the objective truth, why it is that way, how to find it yourself, and what is stopping you from doing it. What other beans could I spill? The only oher beans for me to spill would be to tell you to actually read everything in detail and reread it so that you are actually able to understand and appreciate everything. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t do that then it is willing ignorance and insanity and it then becomes pointless to continue doing anything further because you will have shown you are far too attached to your beliefs about &quot;science&quot; and reality at this time.</p>

<p>Changing the sub is more important than continually trying to help a single overly subjective person.</p>

<p>So either read in detail and reread or simply continue to live with your conjecture/beliefs. The choice is yours, I cannot do anything for you. Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pointless and insane for a number of reasons. Just to name some of them off:</p>

<p>1.) it posits that the music is in anyway responsible for the negativity of mankind, and completely ignores the very obvious truth that with more people, more technology, more inequality, more diseases, etc. there will be more negativity (which is a combination of many factors, mainly that these things all allow the elite that control the world even greater control and allow them to spread and propagate even more negativity). <em>I have already gone into why people are negative in many of my posts, I will link my comments in this thread that go into why negativity exists.</em></p>

<p>2.) It posits that this inconsequential change in frequency of A is responsible for the increasing amount of negativity of the world (#1. <sup><sup>^</sup></sup> gives simple reasons why that isn&#39;t the case) and implies that things were somehow not as negative before this change in tuning (which they certainly were, and have been for millennia).</p>

<p>3.) It posits that if the elite were, in fact, behind the change in tuning frequency, that it would be to cause chaos, rather than create order. A chaotic music scene/industry is far harder to control than an ordered one, and the elite desire control almost above all else, with the exception of perpetuating and propagating continual negativity, which a controlled music scene/industry allows them to do.</p>

<p>4.) It posits that simply because A at 440 hz is more dissonant and A at 432 is more consonant that 432 hz is superior, thus effectively saying that consonance is superior and thus more important to music than dissonance, and is also saying that dissonance is a negative thing and that consonance is a positive thing. This is saying that the resolution of tension is desirable and more important than the tension itself, which is undesirable, and because tension is what creates excitement and anticipation in music, that excitement is inferior to calmness and relief (which is what consonance creates). This simply is not, and can never be the case, as pure consonance is boring and gets old <strong>very</strong> fast. Now of course on the flip side, pure dissonance is harsh and disorienting. Both consonance <strong>and</strong> dissonance are needed to appreciate and enjoy music. And because consonance is not lost when A is in 440 hz, it is a non-issue. </p>

<p>5.) It posits that because A in 432 hz is more harmonic and is based on more complete math (both of which mean its more orderly), that it is superior to A in 440 hz, which is not as harmonic and is based on more incomplete math (both of which mean its more chaotic). This then insinuates that order is more important than chaos, which itself means that structure is more important than randomness, and this is the absolute death of music. structure allows music to be listenable and followed, but what point would there be if music could not always be different? Structure and randomness need to both be applied in order for music to be appreciated and enjoyed.</p>

<p>Now regarding order and chaos, and negativity, and the elite, and spirituality, God, and ultimately changing the world,  I have posted 2 other comments in this thread to another person that explains all of this and has further links to what is <strong><em>really, actually</em></strong> important. Please read these 2 comments, and all of my links <em>in detail</em>, and reread them so you understand and appreciate everything. Also read all of my comments and links in the order they are written/linked. </p>
