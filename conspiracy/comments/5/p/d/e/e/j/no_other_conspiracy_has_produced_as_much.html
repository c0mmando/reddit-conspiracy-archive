<p>I hear you, but you should see some of the things said to me when discussing it.  I&#39;ve lost count of the number of times I&#39;ve been called a shill or an apologist.  There are quite a few Pizzagaters that stifle discussion and seem to be advocating echo chambers.</p>

<p>Definitely don&#39;t avoid that if it interests you.  The more reasonable people that discuss it, from the skeptics to the believers, the better.  In my opinion, its biggest weakness are the irrational claims that are made.  I&#39;ve always said that it&#39;s very possible that there is a global child trafficking ring operating, but the hyper-partisan rhetoric, baseless speculation, and divisiveness scares people away or just makes them roll their eyes.</p>

<p>The media is my biggest gripe.  You&#39;ll always hear about the biased MSM, but the &quot;alternatives&quot; are just as bad, if not worse.  People no longer care about having their ideas challenged.  Confirmation bias is the order of the day, it seems.  HuffPo, Breitbart, Infowars, Mother Jones, and many more that I&#39;m too lazy to name exist to divide and paint the &quot;other&quot; as the ignorant enemy.  </p>

<p>There are so few news organizations that care about objectivity, but I no longer think they&#39;re exclusively to blame.  I think, as a country, we&#39;re becoming more intellectually lazy and media groups are just taking advantage of that fact.</p>

<p>My point is that you&#39;re definitely not alone in your thoughts.  The media is supposed to play an important role in our republic, but they&#39;re letting us down.  This is something that I could rant about indefinitely so I&#39;ll spare you, haha.</p>

<p>There&#39;s really only a handful that are that intellectually dishonest.  It is worrisome, however, that people seem to be advocating echo chambers.  The appeals to emotion and lack of actual evidence should make anyone a skeptic.  I also believe that this is a hyper-partisan issue as you&#39;ll see Epstein&#39;s ties to Trump often completely ignored. </p>

<p>Yeah, agreed.  It&#39;s also why I&#39;ve become so skeptical of Wikileaks.  Their pushing of this idea (PG) as well as other behavior (tweets showing a severe bias) has made me lose faith in them as a media group and question their integrity.  The truly sad part is that many conspiracy theorists should see that, but they&#39;re so blinded by partisanship that they willfully ignore these facts or they&#39;re not intellectually honest enough to care.</p>

It&#39;s almost too hard to believe, but the fact that there&#39;s no official investigation made public - at all - has to make one wonder why. While there is no hard core at this point,  the connections are beyond suspect. Worthy of investigation and media scrutiny at the least. Yet, media &quot;debunked&quot; this in 24 hours. No investigation.  Citizen investigators are left to find out what&#39;s going on, with limited resources. I&#39;m amazed at how resourceful some folks are with those limited resources. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Hard core evidence&quot; is by definition illegal. When shills ask for this just point out they are demanding snuff porn or child porn. There&#39;s enough circumstantial evidence to warrant investigation or at min official answers to $60,000 hot dog parties. None of that happened though. </p>

<p>Also it&#39;s plausible the evidence did drop. Right around the time the &quot;chemical attack&quot; happened at London airport and people reported police activity/phone seizure outside Ecuadorean embassy and officially the US was cutting Assanges internet access, Twitter, Reddit and mass internet outages happened. It&#39;s possible the wikileaks keys were released. Given the founders death and a mix of rumours after its highly suspicious. </p>

<p>Also worth noting Russia went dark on Norsemap some time around November 1st. Which is bizarre if u track that map. (So much for Russian hacking)</p>

<p>A chan online had reports of people decoding wikileaks insurance but the story is as soon as they do they go dark. No idea if it&#39;s legit or not. It&#39;s not beyond the realms of possibility that if someone were to break it their systems could be entire shut down or that any residual trace couldn&#39;t be blocked. Astute followers will note that many incidents and evidence has been scrubbed online over the last few months. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When u find the sick history behind atheism and what they are covering up/trying to build you will feel very used. </p>

<p>At least go agnostic. If u need a scientific explanation of god, someone just worked out a mathematical model, and the evolutionary model (bang on a keyboard long enough it will produce the alphabet - that experiment failed horribly)</p>

<p>Also fractals, cymatics and research into dmt where random people reported the same experiences, speaking with elves and other beings. </p>

<p>Another good place is actually old scientific texts. Gods existence was not questioned previously because it was evident in science. It wasn&#39;t until darwin and the popularization of evolution and dinosaurs (created by two fraudsters from skull and bones no less) </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying dinosaurs didn&#39;t exist. But the concept didn&#39;t prior. Things are being labelled dinosaurs which are clearly birds. Look up &quot;feathers&quot; with dinosaur as a key word. Also find pictures of tyranasauras before it&#39;s plaster caster and propped up. Now compare that skeleton to a birds skeleton. Say ostrich. </p>

<p>The &quot;dinosaurs evolved into birds&quot; myth is a lie as well. They found cases where one ingested the other. Admitting it&#39;s impossible. </p>

<p>Books on demons and other major incidents of biblical nature will make u seriously question modern teachings. They reported very physical interactions. Black Plague and ghosted figures in crops spraying something from a scythe. (Where the cartoon notion of &quot;death&quot; comes from&quot;</p>

<p>St Anthony and his experience of witnessing a silver disc in the desert with a &quot;demon&quot; inside. </p>

<p>Also look at hybrid species. In fact check chromosome number and u will notice a pattern in hybrids. Humans are hybrids too btw.  </p>

<p>Take the Golden Takin for instance. A goat-antelope mix. The creation story was that a God came down took a goat and antelope and turned it into a golden Takin. And quickly ate it. Said thank for the hospitality and left. Just so happens they are a hybrid species with a creation myth involving genetic engineering by a hungry god. </p>

<p>You will find many more of these. Though much was lost. You really think it&#39;s coincidence that the native populations around the world were systematically destroyed culturally by forcing them into &quot;residential schools&quot; where rape and murder was prevalent and the total destruction of their culture happened? Aus/US/Can all had them. Prob more but those three off the top of my head. </p>

<p>What was it about their culture/spirituality that made them so threatening I wonder...</p>

<p>Just read old books. Truths will become apparent. Don&#39;t take my word on anything either just go and look. It&#39;s there. Hidden. But if u are critical it will become apparent the lies today are nothing more than a continuation of a larger deception. </p>

That is censorship. </p>

<p>I was a 9/11 researcher and of all of the 9/11 topics that were censored, the fact it was nuked was censored the most. That is why almost nobody knows about it. I talked to Richard Gage about this in person; when I say I throughly researched 9/11, I mean it. It was a nuclear event. Richard Gage didn&#39;t want to hear about it.

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that all Jimmy would have to do, or the supposed community that is so upset about Jimmy being attacked, is post a recent pic of them and their kids (the ones that were so prominently featured on his commercial and public IG) and say &quot;hey, we love comet and so do our kids. We enjoyed being on our beloved pizza place&#39;s website and now we&#39;re totally pissed that our children&#39;s pics are being used by mistaken researchers to insinuate these horrible things&quot;. The fact that no parents are sueing regarding this investigation, upset that it is alleged their children were molested .... Is very interesting. There are many ways Pizzagate could easily be silenced - why hasn&#39;t it been?</p>

<p>Podesta could share the map of the pizza, or the Stratford guys could tell us how to split one slice of pie with several people. Any one of these people could just start tweeting about how &quot;I love pizza, let me count the ways. $65k for pizza... I&#39;d pay a million dollars of taxpayer money for pizza and hotdogs. Everyone in the WH has never progressed beyond 3rd grade culinary tastes&quot; and explain this shit away. But no. Hasn&#39;t happened.</p>

<p>All the emails make perfect sense. Nobody would be confused unless they were mentally retarded. I&#39;ve read through every email presented to me and there is nothing confusing about them. Additionally, Podesta owns a pizza oven. Do you? Don&#39;t you think someone who loves to cook Italian food, including pizza, might talk about pizza more than you? Get your head out of your fucking ass.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And this is evidence to you? How fucking sick do you have to be in the head to think this is a child sex reference. Maybe they were talking about a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MTifP6x.jpg">pizza related handkerchief with a map on it?</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>What the fuck are you talking about? He&#39;s basically only posted pics of his god-daughter and he almost always hashtagged her name. The parents often reply in the comments. I&#39;m not posting their names because I respect their privacy and there are rules against posting personal information, but even a few minutes of research can prove this is another lie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve never used the phrase chickenlover for anything.</p>

<p>What the fuck does this even matter? Are you saying they were calling the little girl in the picture a homosexual man with attraction to young boys? Are you accusing her dad of raping her because someone hashtagged &quot;chickenlovers&quot; on their picture? That makes no fucking sense you sick fuck. Maybe they were just, I don&#39;t know, eating chicken earlier? Maybe they made a joke about loving to eat chicken? Do you think of toddler-fucking every time you think about chickens or food, or when they are referenced with kids around. You&#39;re a sick human being.</p>

<p>How would you even know? PG proponents only backed up the pictures they cherry picked,</p>

<p>And who cares if there&#39;s no pizza or chicken in that particular picture.

<p>Perhaps you don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I personally talk about food with some frequency. My partner and I watch The Great British bakeoff with great enjoyment and talk about things we&#39;d like to bake. I sometimes ask coworkers if they&#39;d like to join me for lunch. I sometimes invite clients to meet over food. I sometimes complain to friends that I&#39;ve been so busy I&#39;ve just been eating junkfood. I&#39;ve several times told employees that there was leftover pizza in the fridge if they like.</p>

<p>Whether or not it&#39;s part of your habit, talking about food is fairly common and innocuous. It seems to be a pattern here that if someone talks in a way that&#39;s not exactly the way you (a pizzagate &quot;investigator&quot;) do then they must be up to something. There is a tremendous amount of variation in the way humans communicate. The fact that this is suspicious is bizarre to me.</p>

I was falsely accused of viciously lying about a man in order to destroy his reputation out of pure spite! That was a pretty nasty accusation and apparently he must have been very convincing because just about everyone took his side against me. </p>

<p>Do you think him accusing me was harmful to me? I sure thought it was. What do you think I should have done, kept my mouth shut? I SAW him do it. All I was doing was telling people what I observed. That a pretty mean thing he did to me, wasn&#39;t it? I mean he sexually assaulted my little boy while I was watching and then when I complained about it he ruined my reputation. I think that is vicious.

While most around here would quickly denounce the Pope, I&#39;m a big fan of the notions he&#39;s put forth. The conspiracy community is quick to denounce those in power, but slow to give them any credit when they say the right thing. All the Pope can do is use his voice, and I don&#39;t think many could find fault with Francis&#39; words </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with your first point about people in general, I have to disagree with your assessment of the Pope. While he seems to espouse inclusivity, there&#39;s a lot that doesn&#39;t quite line up with real biblical teaching. I&#39;m all in for inclusivity, don&#39;t get me wrong, but there should to be a renouncement of sin and a turning away of that sin. I don&#39;t necessarily see the Pope advocating the latter. That&#39;s why he&#39;s so popular, in my opinion. He gives people the idea that they can continue to live in their sin rather than denounce it.  I&#39;m not Catholic, but I&#39;m certainly a sinner. I know that I&#39;m a believer, but that I need to turn away from my sin in order to fully be in relationship with God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;ve had some of those people with good intentions throw their hat in the ring...but they don&#39;t have the media power to gain traction. It takes great influence to elevate someone from Junior Senator - like Obama for instance - to the leader of the free world. Or an anomaly like Trump because people are fed up with the business as usual candidates. Hence, why we have a Trump presidency today. Not my choice, but the powers that be never thought he had chance and managed to oust every alternative this election season. HRC wasn&#39;t my choice either BTW.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think about it church rules are a contributor, but it also seems like a perfect religion for blackmail.</p>

<p>Do you know about the confession sacrament where you confess your sins? Imagine if you were able to use that as blackmail. It probably went from there to some political blackmail and then to some other blackmail and then you have a network. What if the church gets infiltrated by pedo agents? Then we have the current church.</p>

<p>Also, another point is that it seems like it&#39;s one of the best places to go hide as a pedo. You get a cover from the top of the organization and because at a time priests were the last people to be signaled out as pedos.</p>

<p>Now ask yourself if you think many religions weren&#39;t at some point co-opted or created to make you worship a false idol. There is some good evidence there too.</p>

A disease, obviously defined by societal normals, but a uncontrollable thought process nonetheless.

I&#39;m sure there have been many pediatricians who suffer from these desires, but generally love children, and possibly entered the profession to distance themselves from the notion of such, and have never acted on their sexual feelings </p>

This person is then easily blackmailed and performs like a puppet or &quot;man in the middle&quot;.  (This is bad news for the nonperverted and uncorrupted who are not offered easy political advancement.)</p>

<p>Child sex slaves are an important element in this system.  Those who procure and groom them are also rewarded.  Those who keep the sexual perversions of politicians hushed up are also rewarded.  Rewards are jobs, money, status eg knighthood, etc.  There are many roles and a lot of winners in this system.</p>

<p>I got this insight from listening to Kay Griggs&#39; interview on youtube.  She said the Germans invented it, beginning with the industrialist Krups.  In one of Michael Shrimpton&#39;s interviews with Richie Allen, Shrimpton also said political control through paedophilia plus blackmail was a German invention which spread to Britain.</p>

<p>That people still don&#39;t understand that words and actions online have very real consequences baffles me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those of us that follow this story or actively investigate it have something in common that makes us categorically different from the population. We can handle the possibility for whatever reason. Like for example my a brilliant cousin could have done anything after law school but made a genuinely altruistic career decision when she chose to become a public defender. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have statistical evidence to support this statement but I suspect most consumers of media can&#39;t stomach the possibility of pizzagate. Its literally so stomach turning that people turn the channel, flip the page, or click on another story. It&#39;s not that the reporting of a story is too much, it&#39;s that the possibility of something requiring further inquiry might be.</p>

<p>I think most people can deal with a heart breaking story that already happened, like for example, that little girl who was kidnapped in Utah and found years later at a park or something in a public park in California after years of abuse. That happened, it&#39;s a story with closure. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m asking the question, not begging my answer because I don&#39;t have one. But is it possible that media won&#39;t touch this because the concept is so insanely unpalatable? That if true, we&#39;d be living out the evil as the official investigations proceeded? It&#39;s like the question of the chicken and the egg. Which comes first. If this question has any validity, it could mean that maybe media drives policy and media consumers drive media. </p>

<p>Just a thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post!</p>

<p>Yes most sane people don&#39;t want to believe that sick people could hurt children this way. But it happens sadly more often and in more severe ways than I could ever have imagined. Researching other cases of child porn and pedophiles during this time has made me sometimes actually hate humanity and see the deep evil in mankind like I never have before. That&#39;s why the LIGHT must be shown on this dark world. </p>

<p>Pizzagate woke me up. Now that I&#39;ve stomached the possibility, by researching the reality of other pedophile rings, child porn operations and the torture, rape and trafficking of children I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll stop until I&#39;m dead trying to find the truth and do whatever I can to end this sickness. </p>

<p>I think the media won&#39;t touch this because at the end of the day they are cowards. They don&#39;t do real investigative work anymore. They rely on their masters at Soros-funded operations, the left wing think tanks and others to do the real thinking and researching to feed them. </p>

<p>MOST reporters these days are just puppets who string together interesting sentences around the key &quot;talking points&quot; that are fed to them by TPTB and their masters higher up on the food chain.  And this conspiracy takes a lot of time and effort to put together a reasonable chain of logic and map out the players and the facts. Really it is a massive conspiracy.</p>

<p>The media also doesn&#39;t like to be scolded by the left. Since most of the players in this conspiracy are on the left (btw I don&#39;t give a fuck if they are or not and screw those on the right too) the media does not want to piss them off by exposing them for what could turn out to be wrong.</p>

<p>Finally, they are scared of getting sued. The McCann case of the UK family whose child was abducted in Portugal at one point led to the four families being implicated in the media. They sued and won a money judgment against the media that published the POLICE reports and suspicions. In Europe! </p>

<p>Do you think the MSM in America is willing to take a chance on this one that is being uncovered by reddit and voat researchers and not the police or FBI and risk a huge lawsuit by the powerful players implicated? No way.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the beauty of the non-centeralized, independent research going on here and on voat. There&#39;s no over lord system to intimidate and punish us for going against their commands. Look at how the MSM has spun this story and how ineffective it is at convincing us that there&#39;s nothing to see here!</p>

<p>And finally, I am afraid that the media is involved in this too. They must be. Pizzagate is a power structure pyramid like the mafia or a drug cartel based on what I&#39;ve learned. Not just a regular way child porn operation selling digital media to paying customers. The media higher ups and even lower levels must be involved too. How else would they elevate their status in exchange for those scoops on politicians and celebrities and get &quot;close to the stories&quot; that are controlled by the people implicated in this scandal? </p>

<p>No, because if there were actual evidence for them to report on other than a few goofy emails, they&#39;d be all over it. The ratings would be insane.</p>

<p>I think Pizzagate should be investigated more, but I also think that due diligence needs to be done before exclaiming people to be child rapists.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s also a lot of conspiracy theorists driven by the unconscious fear that the world isn&#39;t as organized or planned as they want it to be. It&#39;s sometimes easier to believe that there is some grand cabal pulling the strings, than events being random or sometimes inexplicable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s a possibility, but I would just counter that there a quite a few people on this sub, myself included, can handle the possibility and even strongly suspect that pederasty is far more prevalent in the halls of power than commonly accepted, and yet just haven&#39;t found that much truly compelling about PG in particular. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit of a truism that one must accept or be able to handle the possibility of this evil in order to follow it or investigate, although I do think it&#39;s a useful observation. I just wish certain PG proponents (and I&#39;m not saying you, nothing you&#39;ve said has indicated this) would not immediately dismiss as a shill anyone who isn&#39;t convinced by the evidence we have now. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the Podestas or Alefantis or any of the other players are directly involved in these rings, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they weren&#39;t either. I think the establishment, which in general I believe does cover these things up, has a reason to try to suppress discussion of PG even if it&#39;s not real, because it could lead to some real breadcrumbs. They might even have more of a reason to pull out the big guns on PG, because if it&#39;s effectively discredited, the general populace will be less likely to believe future claims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um ... maybe Pizzagate is easiest to debunk? Or there are a lot of unemployed pedophiles who have nothing better to do than shill these threads? Or homosexuals have been persuaded that Pizzagate is homophobic and they need to debunk it to protect their rights?</p>

<p>That being said the pizzagate threads I posted on r/politics got shilled way more than any 911 thread. I got a 7 week ban for saying &quot;if someone doesn&#39;t appreciate these are code words they must have aspergers&quot;. Despite the fact in the thread all the shills were saying the most awful things, like &quot;do you masterbate and drink your own cum sperglord&quot;. I asked the mods, do they get banned as well, or only me because I post pizzagate. 2 days they still haven&#39;t replied.</p>

<p>I wonder if Jame Alefantis has been involved in pedophilia and the elite know he is sloppy and that at any point in time he will be exposed. His actions like threatening the family of a pizzagater suggests there&#39;s something there we don&#39;t know about.</p>

<p>The regulars, who are notorious for being well mannered critical thinkers, have taken a serious interest in the Pizzagate investigation. There is so much evidence to point to a legitimacy regarding Pizzagate, that anybody who DOESTN&#39;T see anything wrong with what has been leaked and presented, hasn&#39;t done enough research. It&#39;s out in the open now, mainstream media outlets are picking this up. </p>

<p>The lurkers are people on here who are just looking and reading, observing and learning. I want them to know that Pizzagate is a legitimate discussion, it&#39;s a real thing that we have to come to terms with. Why would you discourage an independent investigation into anything? Let alone child abusers at the highest levels of government? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people look at pizzagate and see that it&#39;s obviously not true. At least with 9/11, JFK assassination, etc there were scientific facts to look at and debate on. Here it&#39;s a lot of &quot;I think this is a code&quot; which delves into the 9/11 symbolism-type of stuff that no one really cared about. </p>

<p>I debate the points of pizzagate a lot, and I realize a lot of you believe in it, but this is the way a lot of people are seeing it. And that&#39;s why no one gives it attention, because accusations of child rape are horrible if they&#39;re not true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>ALL 100% SPECULATION. JUST AN IDEA I&#39;VE BEEN THROWING AROUND IN MY HEAD.</em></p>

<p>Im starting to think a buncha dudes on 4chan were like:</p>

<p>-&#39;ok, let&#39;s fuck up the DNC, hillary, Bill and the family friends. -Wow yea great idea, how? </p>

<p>-Well, WL just released a bunch of emails tied to hillary and her private email server. 
-OK, perfect, what should we come up with? Well it needs to be something so specific, yet so vague in evidence against or for it, but so impossible to prove or disprove, something like...the moon landing, or 911. The topic is specific, the scope massive, yet for the average person, or even agency, it&#39;s almost impossible to research. Also, almost the mere mention of the topics is taboo. </p>

<p>-Brilliant...so what should we do? -Well we need anger from the public, and also mistrust. A large portion of the public have a small understanding of the concept of the NWO. </p>

<p>-Right! </p>

<p>-So let&#39;s start there, saying hillary and company are NWO and that would also go with the narrative of trump draining the swamp and taking down the elitists(even though so far he&#39;s doing the exact opposite). </p>

<p>-But ok, most people won&#39;t bat an eye saying they are all NWO, look at the reaction about the Clinton foundation, and political scandal in Benghazi. Making those claims won&#39;t go far in changing public opinion. </p>

<p>-Ok, well we need to outrage the public. Make them foam at the mouth....what gets people worked up beyond imaginable? </p>

<p>-Kids!! Sex abuse, human trafficking, that shit. People lose their minds over that. </p>

<p>-Yea kids. Let&#39;s say hillary and her connections and cronies, have been running and participating in a underground sex slave ring for kids, and using their power and wealth to maintain and continued participation in it all. </p>

<p>-My God that&#39;s genius!! Ok well that can work bill just got in trouble for being friends with Epstein. Claims he has a island and a pedo air liner. </p>

<p>-So all we need to do now is, find a middle man, claim he&#39;s the one making it work, but taking orders from higher ups. </p>

<p>-Yea, make sense. I&#39;ll go through, find a guy that&#39;s just off the political radar, so far off the radar he doesn&#39;t censor what he does or says. </p>

<p>-Dude with the pizzashop...everything he does is online, so all we need to do is spin it and the story, make it seem him and his connections to hillary are enough to make it seem like they are relatively close. </p>

<p>-Perfect, after looking in to the pizza guy, he&#39;s already alil weird, plus theres pictures of his families babies on his instagram!!&#39;</p>

<p><em>this is all hearsay, OBVIOUSLY, but I envision how this all went down and got started. You could maybe even throw in the story got its research and traction with the help of an opposing political party. AGAIN I can&#39;t prove any of this, without a confession specifically, about this and what took place, this would be next to impossible to prove or disprove. Also yes this is reaching beyond all logic, and feel yucky for doing so. But reaching and stretching facts and ideas to make them fit a narrative is the way things work I guess</em></p>

1. WTC conspiracies helped white middle class &amp; white lower class people hate George W (which is what liberals wanted ) &amp; sink the reputation of the RNC. 
2. Sandy Hook Conspiracies - Yes this occurred under Obama&#39;s watch, but the DNC was a bit too smug to calculate/estimate any form of long term damage from this.  Especially after taking a victory in the Birther Movement. 
3.  I think PizzaGate comes in the wake of the DNC Leaks. DNC Leaks were the Pearl Harbor of MSM/DNC.<br/>
In some ways it&#39;s revenge for Trump winning. In other ways the DNC Convention CTR movement felt like Clinton surviving the convention was proof that CTR removing any anti-liberal conspiracy was best for the party.<br/>
MSM knows it won&#39;t gain trust with the masses for some time. That&#39;s why every day is dedicated to getting Trump kicked out.  It has less to do with Trump&#39;s politics and more to do with Sheeple coming back to the DNC in a lesser of two evils scenario.</p>

If Alefantis screws up only he will go down. All we really have is the hope that Trump has our back and WikiLeaks even told us the Obama administration was illegally destroying records when he won....who told them that?

And there&#39;s no convenient boogey man to point to.  The elite are in the spotlight for their heinous crimes, with the spotlight being squarely on their highest secret (Satanic ritual pedo-sexual abuse and murder), and there&#39;s no squirming out of it.

    <div class="md"><p>The other things are singular events - if information and evidence about the cover up/conspiracy doesn&#39;t go viral online within the first few weeks after the event, they have the chance to shape a narrative that is acceptable to the general public, so any claims of wrongdoing will be dismissed as people are already satisfied with the official story and have emotionally invested in it.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is different because it&#39;s an ongoing, systemic thing, and because it was sparked off by the Podesta emails and rapidly snowballed over a matter of days/weeks - it was going viral which is why they had to try to address it somehow, but they are fighting against a natural phenomenon, the time to seal it up before it reached tipping point is long gone.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also the fact that so many people are involved and implicated, it&#39;s unprecedented, no one has a clue what will happen, because this disease is embedded so deeply within our societal structures. When it goes supernova in the next few months, unless there are enough decent people left in law enforcement to clean up somewhat t tidily, you are looking at a French revolution type thing, internecine warfare,  who knows - something unpleasant. Hopefully mainly unpleasant for them, and not for the ordinary nice people.</p>

It was satan so they turn to him for everything. Thats why they got everything. Gold money silver rule the world. They get it all from him. Thats why they sacrafice children to get power.

It&#39;s almost too hard to believe, but the fact that there&#39;s no official investigation made public - at all - has to make one wonder why. While there is no hard core at this point,  the connections are beyond suspect. Worthy of investigation and media scrutiny at the least. Yet, media &quot;debunked&quot; this in 24 hours. No investigation.  Citizen investigators are left to find out what&#39;s going on, with limited resources. I&#39;m amazed at how resourceful some folks are with those limited resources. </p>
