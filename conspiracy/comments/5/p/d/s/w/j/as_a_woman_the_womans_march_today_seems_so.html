       I went to a march today and it was a pretty tranquil deal with a whole panoply of signs - mostly about reproductive rights and equality, with a lot of "Love Trumps hate" stuff and generic "Trump sucks". Maybe the speeches were more divisive; I skipped them.

       I went today as well and was surprised at how well I thought of it.   I've seen all the big gatherings over the last few years (Glenn beck, Jon Stewart, etc) and this was the most supportive, cohesive group, considerate group I've witnessed.    Their concerns are deeply personal and legitimate and they've been provoked by both sides for a while.    Used as tools really.     I would think there is great potential at earning them as lasting allies simply by alleviating unfounded fears as a starter.

       Reproductive rights and its relation to health care were the main policy related themes I saw but there was the larger issue of rhetoric.   A noticeable amount Russian interference stuff too which really surprised me.    The mood was remarkably bouyant and all the impending doom that was felt immediately after the election seems to have subsided considerably.

       I'm still not sure what the hell they're about. They seem to be protesting Trump's presidency, because (as the MSM would have them believe) he's supposed to single handedly take away birth control or something?

       Don't they not have the right to peaceful assembly and protest? Of course they do. The point being-- their message doesn't seem to be an attempt to reverse the election, as you were implying, that's all I'm saying.

       Of course Trump. Of course alot of other things that he and in-power extremists want. Defund planned parenthood, continually stifle reproductive rights in red states, the 20-week limit in Ohio and Texas, the idea that feminism is anti-man, that date rape doesn't exist, that being a chauvinist is simply "being a man." How many things would you like me to list?

       Official policies that he could actually accomplish as president would be logical, but none of that you listed is, aside from defunding racist, eugenics, inc. Planned Parenthood. And even that takes an act of Congress, not just the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, again, these protests are illegitimate since they are against an idea of a man, not actual policies he's enacted.

       I have no problem with them protesting and wanting to be heard. What I have a problem with is the "if your not with us, your against us" mentality. As a woman, you don't get to dictate how I feel on these issues, so I shouldn't be shunned if mine are different from yours. I have encountered this IRL and it is trying my patience.

       Fuck me.  They reall really are saying he shouldn't be president. That's
       <strong>
        why
       </strong>
       they disaprove.  He actually
       <strong>
        should
       </strong>
       be president, no matter how much of an arse he is, because he got voted in. They are protesting the presidency of the person who fair and square won the election that whoever their candidate was didn't.  I mean... What kind of mental gymnastics are we going through here?  The woman I quoted actually gives the reason that he's "psychologically unwell and not fit to be president".  She is protesting the man and his presidency, not an actual policy.

       The TPP is not about capitalism its about control.  A mass EU communist trade bloc, working with a massive Far East communist trade bloc, working with a Mexico/USA/Canada communist trade bloc.

       This.  Yes.  Bernie's miraculous run helped to tamp down the use of the word "socialist" as the go-to word for boogeyman.  But there's always the traditional "communist" boogeyman.  So people fling the word around without knowing what it means.

       This is just a small demonstration of power to the asshats that want to dictate how, when and where we use are uteruses. Don't think this can't be transferred into real political power, it can and will be if necessary.

       Am also a woman.   Don't support the stupid march today. I'm a feminist, Clinton-hating, liberal, gun-toting, vegetarian.  I was thrilled that Trump beat her. His win saved us from her zeal for war and and gave us a (probably brief) break from the continued onslaught of global corporatism.  I'm grateful to him for that.  Let's see what he does with his time.

       I know, I know.  I've been following all the Goldman Sachs appointments, the Dyncorp advisors... My pick was Bernie.  But Hillary stole it from Bernie.  Hillary labels herself liberal and progressive. She pretends she has helped women, gays, the poor and EVERYBODY.  But really she's nothing but a self-serving grifter and a puppet for the elite.   Democrats like Hillary have used social justice issues as a “look over here” technique, while they get on their knees and suck off the Wall Street, banks, global elite.
       <br/>
       At the very least Trump stopped the TPP. We need jobs here in the U.S.  I'm sick of ivy-league liberals conceding that, yes, some people lose out as we globalize. Yeah - how about the entire working class gets slammed, spreading up to the middle class, and down to the poor.  There needs to be some limit to what we will let the horde of locusts (global corporatists) suck out of the U.S.  At least Trump seems to acknowledge that.   And the Republicans are trying to audit the Fed.  Good for them. Did the Democrats do that?  Oh no, the banks and Wall Street and the Fed are sacrosanct. I know that Trump’s appointments are looking pretty sketchy.  Can't I just have a few more days of hope? (When will I learn, I bought the whole “hope and change” thing 8 years ago and that asshole ended up being a major war monger and the biggest cheerleader for the TPP.  What should I have expected from an ivy-leaguer -- they just know best don’t they?)

       Seriously?  Why do you even say that?  The Democrats, (and I am one), and the establishment Republicans have been conducting wars for the last 8 years, and have been angling to go to war with Russia.   Trump seems to acknowledge that Americans have had enough.  Maybe this anti-war sentiment doesn't stem from a touchy, feely place.  But just from a practical standpoint, Americans know deep down that we're getting too poor to subsidize the military industrial complex to the extent that they want.

       Im a woman too, and I don't support the pointless march either. Remember the "Million man march" some years back? What lasting impressions did that have? How about all you ladies save your bus fare next time, and feed a homeless person, or donate to a shelter? That's the stuff that will make an impact. And the feels you get are kinda priceless

       Would that make an impact, really, though? There are probably as many homeless people as there were marchers. Those bus fares may pay for a few weeks worth of meals for homeless people, but that would do nothing in the grand scheme of eliminating homelessness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, they weren't only talking about "women's rights" (reproductive rights, gender equality) issues at the various marches. Several of the speakers professed generally leftist viewpoints. To them, unemployment is a "women's rights issue"; foreign policy is a "women's rights issue"; climate change is a "women's rights issue", because, in their words, "women's rights issues" are human rights issues.

       I have a theory as to why the women's march happened. Prior to the Inauguration there were reports in the media that massive amounts of protesters were gathering and planning to protest. In anticipation of complete carnage and destruction in cities across America, an operation was put into place where a woman's Facebook post about a peaceful march was artificially magnified in popularity with the main goal to flood the streets, where the supposed destruction would take place, with peaceful, kind-hearted  women who would counteract all aggression by paid protesters. After all, even paid protesters aren't going to harm a bunch of women and children. Also, notice how the Facebook post didn't get popular until the news of large amounts of protesters were forming. Therefore, all the women marching today were merely decoys keeping the peace and stopping all violent outbreaks from happening so a calm transfer of power could take place.

       Same here. I'm actually surprised at the rise in the general sentiment among my acquaintances being "unapologetic feminists" and "patriarchy crushers" etc. That's just never resonated with me and I don't understand why so many women are getting so angry all of a sudden. I'm all for women having equal rights and all, but I guess I've just never felt like I didn't have equal rights? I dunno, I've just never been denied anything I wanted strictly because I'm a woman. And I've never been denied access to birth control. The whole march thing just seemed like a pink-washed Trump protest. But I'm just over here like, you know there's a shadow government, right? Why aren't you protesting that?

       Amen! I have never felt like I didn't have equal rights. I've always had access to birth control, health care for my lady parts,etc. if I was passed over for a job or paid less, it was because I didn't qualify for the job or had less experience in the field. I am not offended by a man, any man, being crude talking about grabbing a pussy, and trust me, I've heard a lot worse.

       Didn't think of it like that, but I see the March more as women coming together and refusing sexism and disrespect from anyone based on their gender. I guess I just appreciate that people can gather and stand for something that's right even if it won't make a big impact in the long run... It might not be world changing in a day but people will look back on this day and you never know it may spark some real change. This March might not be it or it might be.

       It sparked change all right, it's made me no longer a democrat since they no longer represent me.  These women do not represent me, speak for me or make sense to me.  The world was watching this march and what they got to see was the shameful Ashley Judd wallowing like a hog in some fresh steaming self indulgent shit.

       It is a phony revolution held by vile creatures who thinks they are heroes of democracy, nothing more.

       Upvote for the the "embrace femininity - not feminism" comment. North Americans would live in a stronger and happier atmosphere if more women understood what that meant and then made it so.

       They're just mad about the patriarchy! Or something. Or that Trump bragged about being able to grab women. You know, there are a whole bunch of women that are into that. That throw themselves at money and power. So to me, that statement was neutral.

       Women in the US have more opportunity than women in pretty much every other country. They are more college educated. We get preference in custody cases. No one forces a veil over our faces and mutilates our genitals.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the women's match, to me, looks petty.
