<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t know how much better the evidence could be than an email from Sid Blumenthal saying I want OTPOR to train the Muslim Brotherhood.  That is why OTPOR is relevant</li>
<li>Sid Blumental is going to needle in the opposition in the Bush Administration (oppose them); he is a journalist, but he&#39;s acting as a front for Bill Clinton during the impeachment, he&#39;s one of the guys who testified, so he&#39;s kind of this oppositon information agent.</li>
<li>The neocons thought they were going to run Jeb Bush, so Sid wrote an article i 2007<sup><sup>[Salon</sup></sup> article](<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=salon+sid+blumenthal+wmds&amp;safe=off">http://www.google.com/search?q=salon+sid+blumenthal+wmds&amp;safe=off</a>) that Bush knew Saddam didn&#39;t have WMDs and put in CIA agents as whistleblowers to add credibility, in order to oppose the Jeb plan</li>
<li>The two CIA agents in the Blumenthal piece were Valerie Plame Wilson and Tyler Drumheller, her boss</li>
<li>Tyler Drumheller -- European station chief of CIA gave Blumenthal the idea to topple Libya</li>
<li>What was she doing in Europe?  It was the whole OTPOR thing with George Soros (((DISRUPT))) toppling all these countries, balkanizing Yugoslavia</li>
<li>Valerie Plame Wilson CIA agent tweets &quot;RIP Tyler Drumheller: CIA officer who exposed US reliance on discredited Iraq source &quot;Curveball&quot; dies at 63.&quot;</li>
<li>Every time that happens, the NATO generals profit.</li>
<li>The CIA ran the parties, a <strong><em>brownstone operation</em></strong>, where you get the generals drunk and then introduce them to girls, and keep introducing them to younger girls at subsequent parties.  They do this over the course of years.  They&#39;ve done this type of thing since Allen Dulles, 1949...</li>
<li>Until you get to this situation where the kids are 12-13 &lt;&lt;points to Epstein and Clinton&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>That&#39;s when you have the camera, when you have maximum blackmail.  They are willing to do this over the course of years. What they don&#39;t want to do is uncover the operation.</li>
<li>Brownstown operations: Craig Spence (?), Franklin Coverup, Second mile with Sandusky, many in Florida, in Boulder Colorado, Hollywood area with Scientology, DC Madam.  Barney Frank had one...</li>
<li>Read the memoirs of the CIA Directors and they&#39;ll say straight out, &quot;yes we do this&quot;</li>
<li>1100 hidden investors are going to be these NATO politicians and generals and US generals and politicians</li>
<li>Belgium is where British and French fought the Germans in WW1/2 and it&#39;s their spiritual center; and it&#39;s where the parties are.  George says he&#39;s a journalist who has been there and seen this whole system work and has reporting behind this.</li>
<li>This relationship with the Brownstone operations have moved to NY to Paris to Africa to Little St James--Clinton Epstein Connection.</li>
<li>Do you think Hillary is out there getting the Generals out there to go to these parties?  No, it&#39;s their seconds [in command], Doug Band for Bill, Philipe for Hillary, in Europe it was Valerie Plame</li>
<li>That&#39;s why this sex case is more important than Paula Broadwell--it&#39;s about the blackmail and pedophila</li>
<li>NATO C3 meetings and CENTCOM, where the State Dept people meet NATO generals, &lt;&lt;points at Philipe Reines&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not saying its the current people at the State Dept, that&#39;s why I put this [text] over Philipe, I&#39;m pointing the finger; that&#39;s why he&#39;s lashing out at anything even approaching a sex scandal--it&#39;s because he&#39;s behind it all.</li>
<li>Tyler Drumheller to Sidney Bluemtnal.  &quot;Here it is.  Don&#39;t share it with anybody&quot;.  Someone called me a &quot;fringe site&quot; but this is in their own hand [email].</li>
<li>I prefer to call them &quot;Microsweatshops&quot; because they work with microfinancing schemes, which forces them into ever-increasing poverty which forces them into prostitution and drug dealing.</li>
<li>Mentions &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; and when Kennedy sent in 300 agents into Mississippi.  That&#39;s what the president needs to do.  To send 300 FBI people here [Haiti], especially when you have a person who has been conviced of child-running.</li>
<li>The [lawyer] representing [child-runner / 33 kids in Haiti] Laura Silsby is himself a convicted child-runner in 2004 in central america.</li>
<li><strong><em>There are hundreds of emails going back to 2002 from Huma to Laura Silsby, [[the Haiti earthquake / &quot;New Life Childrens&#39; Refugee Case&quot; was 2010]]</em></strong></li>
<li>On the FBI&#39;s obstructionism.  Retired Deputy Assistant the of FBI {{Who?}} says &quot;No grand jury, no subpoenas, no court orders, you know, immunity to the co-conspirators, letting the co-conspirtors in on the interview.  I mean, these are all crazy things the FBI never does&quot;</li>
<li> George speculates: Grange&#39;s wife is in charge of the ports, and this could be a gaping hole in security; that guns from Iraq could be funnelled into the port at Norfolk.</li>

<li>Is the Clinton Foundation a CIA cutout?</li>
<li>&quot;I find it hard to believe Hillary could do this by herself&quot;</li>
<li>What is a cutout?  We&#39;re making parking meters and sending them to nicaragua as a cover for sending airplanes down there but what really really making is hollow nosecones so we can put cocaine inside them and fly them back to Mena Arkansas.</li>
<li>Upcoming film &quot;MENA&quot; by Ron Howard?</li>
<li>If Hillary was involved in a CIA operation that far back, around the time Gary Webb was doing the Dark Alliance series, its not too much of a stretch to think her whole career has been a CIA involvement and she&#39;s just progressed up the chain.</li>
<li>Does Eric Braverman know that?</li>
<li>The &quot;Power Elite&quot; C Wright Mills.  The oils making the decision, then the military brokers making plans to take it, then CIA is setting up the group of dissidents</li>

<ul>
<li>Neil Brown was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee</li>
<li>Decisions are made in the US on the oil/gas level at the CFR (council on foreign relations)</li>
<li>Braverman at the World Bank, he was a consultant for McKinsey</li>
<li>Neil Brown is the pipeline infrastructure guy</li>
<li>When Clinton was a Senator she was part of the arms committee;</li>
<li>You need to get the armed services in order to back any kind of expropriation</li>
<li>So that when you become a president, you get half of the takings, and the other half goes to the others involved in oil/gas, pipelines, and armed services as a type of group investment program &lt;&lt;&lt;americans get none of this but we pay for it.&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>NATO generals will win no matter who is president</li>
<li>If you become president, you can&#39;t just have your gang spring up out of nowhere, so you have to be training them, &quot;cultivating your gang&quot; along the way</li>
<li>Dyncorp mention, Delta force people &quot;Gladio programs&quot; to be training people 6 months before any war</li>
<li><em>Did Hillary fund these [ME Project] Gladio programs?</em></li>
<li>Firstly we know Hillary is the key funding source in 1990 in Kosovo to overthrow the Serbs</li>
<li>She also trained gladio programs in North Africa (egypt/libya) and the US as well as Europe (George mentions citations and evidence in show notes below video)</li>
<li>You need to have a Soros in every country to build up your political base (points to Open Society Foundations)</li>
<li>ICG the spy extension of the CFR</li>
<li>George discusses the competititon between Hillary and Bush.</li>
<li>W Bush gets elected, Bush goes after Iraq because that has the most oil</li>
<li>Valerie Plame, she gets sent to Iraq working as Hillary&#39;s spy, to slow them down because <em>you</em> want to knock over these banks &lt;&lt;George points to toppled countries&gt;&gt;, to slow down the Bush move to war.</li>
<li>If don&#39;t have the army yourself--like Bush did--to do a topple, is to get NATO to do it for you (the 1100 hidden donors, US and NATO generals), that&#39;s why you are going to have a 240B dollars missing (Gaddafi&#39;s billions)</li>
<li><em>Sibel Edmonds, an FBI counterterrorism translator, blew the whistle on this activity, she called this &quot;Gladio B&quot;</em> that Clinton started, the ME Project we are talking about</li>
<li>George believes there are more gladios he calls C and D for north africa and the US itself</li>
<li>You send Valeria into Iraq, and you send her ambassador husband to Niger to say there is no uranium, and then as a result we found out the WMD story that Colin Powell story is a hoax, and that&#39;s why these two were involved [AND SHE WAS OUTED as a SPY by BUSH ADM]</li>
<li> &lt;&lt;&lt;Just to explain here, since its complicated.  This is infighting within the CIA, fighting over NATO Generals and military forces.  There&#39;s Clintons HYDRA versus Bush&#39;s CIA.  HYDRA is trying to topple othe countries with NATO/US forces, and this is why Iraq had to hire so many &quot;security contractors&quot; (mercenaries).  So to &quot;slow down Bush&#39;s efforts in Iraq&quot; to contine activities in north africa, Joe Wilson outed WMD&#39;s as a rouse, so then as revenge the Bush administration outed Plame as a spy&gt;&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>&quot;Lockheed F35 -- British Officers Club&quot;</li>
<li>Valerie Plame was in counter-proliferation, so she knew about the Sarin gas is in Libya</li>
<li>Wikileaks offers $20,000 reward for anyone in the Obama White House that sends them files.  &quot;Two terrabyte drive with Clinton White House emails missing, presumed stolen from National Archives&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;All Files on Clinton Hires (including) SSNs and DOBs Destroyed Three Classified Budget Programs Authored by Lael Brainard 2013&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Lael Brainard destroyed 3 classified documents, and I believe these were the funding documents from the treasury.  You have to get the treasury to pay for these programs</li>
<li>US Gladio Program PDD-62 (Presidential Decision Directive 62 or D&amp;D (Diffuse and Disrupt)), Gladio B, Manpower from Arkansas, [Senator Byrds&#39; old disrupters from] West Virgina</li>
<li>Basically the idea is targetting political opponents initially, as time has gone on they&#39;ve targetted more and more people with the disruption program</li>
<li>NSA&#39;s point of view you can disrupt them, make sure emails don&#39;t go through, like purchase orders</li>
<li>D&amp;D &quot;Operatives out in the field&quot;</li>
<li>PDD-62 &quot;US Gladio &quot;Program&quot; D&amp;D is very expensive; requires lots of informants; continual recruiting and training cycle</li>
<li>Whistleblowers are telling us that they are doing these sneak and break in searches without a warrant, the whole constitution is forgotten</li>
<li>Let&#39;s bring all these new agents who&#39;ve forgotten the contitution -- 1/2 of the FBI has changed since 9/11</li>
<li>CFR people are the ones targetted for Brownstone Ops, Jeffrey Epstein was the guy from NY and has moved to Little St. James for the African (NATO) branch</li>
<li>Gladio 4 will be a big weapons grab by Osprey</li>
<li>D&amp;D is break up relationships with people, isolate them, focus the attention of disruption with a lot of other informants moving in and out of their life  &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;Gangstalking&quot;&gt;&gt;</li>

<li>This is a followup to a Jeff Rense show<sup><sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLFs2erY_7s">[]</a></sup></sup></li>
<li>Could Hillary use La Raza (the US political arm of Sinaloa cartel) to arm gangs in sanctuary cities and use either Sarin gas on those cities or Stinger missles against commercial airplane traffic.</li>
<li>If you look at the players involved, it&#39;s the same players: Marc Turi with the gun running in fast and furious</li>
<li>There is a military component to that, if you look at George Soros organizations, La Raza, Moveon.org, he uses OTPOR (DISRUPT) almost everywhere to topple, train Isis.  You see ISIS being trained in Mexico</li>
<li>You see these OTPOR 90/10, these 10% gladio people hiding among the 90% peaceful people thinking they are doing the right thing.  &lt;&lt;&lt;10%=bodysnatched&gt;&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>The military feels the need to &quot;try out&quot; New military technologies on people.  History has shown them doing this with nuclear weapon testing and bioweapon testing on US soldiers.</li>
<li>If you are willing to use Sarin gas against Syrian children, then would you stop if you think you are firing Sarin into a group of &quot;deplorables&quot;, would that stop you? At what point would you draw the line if you&#39;ve already done 52 gas attacks against other humans.</li>
<li>George Recaps Fast and Furious, Sinaloa and the Pemex breakup to sell gulf oil leases</li>
<li>There is nothing to stop Hillary from phoning Sid, having him reach out to General Grange get the Delta Force and take out certain location and create sanctuary cities within the US; or do political assassinations against Mayors who didn&#39;t want sanctuary cities.  This is a possibility.  If they are doing this already elsewhere and assassinate our own....Now that you&#39;ve seen their modus operandi</li>
<li>George recaps Kadzik and McCabe coverups and obstructionism</li>
<li>Hillary&#39;s group is hedging their bets on &quot;waiting it out&quot; and &quot;forgetting about it&quot;...Stonewall until everyone forgets about it.</li>
<li>&quot;The US Office of Government Ethics&quot; -- these Hillaryites stonewalled this because they are the bad guys.</li>
<li>Trump tweets one time and it&#39;s back on the table</li>
<li>If Trump were to tweet even once, &quot;who is this eric braverman?  Or I&#39;d like to have a press conference with this eric braverman&quot;, it would make a pinhole into this informational firewall that is the [fifth-column controlled] Mainstream Media</li>

<li>Hillary&#39;s strategy was very simple, using CIA subverts pushing the narrative of counterterrorism, take private armies and donations from political ruling class, go around the world and steal everything and topple everyone and then become president and then recreate the US using stuff they stole, giving 99% to those who helped her of course.</li>
<li>An &quot;oceans 11 cast&quot;, each one is going to play a specific role</li>
<li>1100 hidden donors are along for the ride, giving funding along the way as needed</li>

<li>Going back to Mena Airport that Ollie North setup in 1984, this has been a funding mechanism [which has become  the Clinton Foundation (1997)] to do this: to create terrorism events around the world or in the US.</li>
<li>I predict there will be terrorism in the US &lt;Gladio D&gt;</li>
<li>It&#39;s all to drive funding and to create this larger FBI counterterrorism effort</li>
<li>&lt;&lt;&lt;Terrorism is used as a hegelian dialectic strategy to enrich the security state, just like everyone has said before; *ordo ab chao*&gt;&gt;&gt;</li>
<li>At the center of this is Andrew McCabe the JTTF (joint terrorist task force), the interface between IC and FBI -- it&#39;s used for infiltration, breaking into people&#39;s houses illegally</li>
<li>D&amp;D is about making false claims against people as white supremacists, and creating crimes, using children as bait and perpetuating fake crime in order to have a reason to go after regular citizens who are politically opposed to them.</li>
<li>Chaffetz questioned the secret service and their response was to revenge-investigate Jason Chaffetz.  It was an oblique threat against him.  They found out he had applied to secret service and was turned away for not making the cut, and they shamed and ridiculed him.  That&#39;s all they found on him.</li>
<li>People in Europe are living under this also, that&#39;s why we need to publish the 1100 hidden donors</li>
<li>You can even pass a law that says we can&#39;t be sued by the World Court for revealing these donors</li>
