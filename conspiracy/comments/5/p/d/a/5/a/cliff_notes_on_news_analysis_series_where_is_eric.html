       George Webb has a great series where he's figured out what's actually going on.  This is part 3 of "cliff notes" on George Webb's video series. This is my attempt to drink from the firehose of George Webb's material by taking notes on it.  Please submit corrections in the comments below.

          I don't know how much better the evidence could be than an email from Sid Blumenthal saying I want OTPOR to train the Muslim Brotherhood.  That is why OTPOR is relevant
         </li>
         <li>
          Sid Blumental is going to needle in the opposition in the Bush Administration (oppose them); he is a journalist, but he's acting as a front for Bill Clinton during the impeachment, he's one of the guys who testified, so he's kind of this oppositon information agent.
         </li>
         <li>
          The neocons thought they were going to run Jeb Bush, so Sid wrote an article i 2007

          ) that Bush knew Saddam didn't have WMDs and put in CIA agents as whistleblowers to add credibility, in order to oppose the Jeb plan
         </li>
         <li>
          The two CIA agents in the Blumenthal piece were Valerie Plame Wilson and Tyler Drumheller, her boss
         </li>
         <li>
          Tyler Drumheller -- European station chief of CIA gave Blumenthal the idea to topple Libya
         </li>
         <li>
          What was she doing in Europe?  It was the whole OTPOR thing with George Soros (((DISRUPT))) toppling all these countries, balkanizing Yugoslavia
         </li>
         <li>
          Valerie Plame Wilson CIA agent tweets "RIP Tyler Drumheller: CIA officer who exposed US reliance on discredited Iraq source "Curveball" dies at 63."
         </li>
         <li>
          Every time that happens, the NATO generals profit.

          The CIA ran the parties, a

           </em>
          </strong>
          , where you get the generals drunk and then introduce them to girls, and keep introducing them to younger girls at subsequent parties.  They do this over the course of years.  They've done this type of thing since Allen Dulles, 1949...
         </li>
         <li>
          Until you get to this situation where the kids are 12-13 &lt;&lt;points to Epstein and Clinton&gt;&gt;
         </li>
         <li>
          That's when you have the camera, when you have maximum blackmail.  They are willing to do this over the course of years. What they don't want to do is uncover the operation.
         </li>
         <li>
          Brownstown operations: Craig Spence (?), Franklin Coverup, Second mile with Sandusky, many in Florida, in Boulder Colorado, Hollywood area with Scientology, DC Madam.  Barney Frank had one...
         </li>
         <li>
          Read the memoirs of the CIA Directors and they'll say straight out, "yes we do this"
         </li>
         <li>
          1100 hidden investors are going to be these NATO politicians and generals and US generals and politicians
         </li>
         <li>
          Belgium is where British and French fought the Germans in WW1/2 and it's their spiritual center; and it's where the parties are.  George says he's a journalist who has been there and seen this whole system work and has reporting behind this.
         </li>
         <li>
          This relationship with the Brownstone operations have moved to NY to Paris to Africa to Little St James--Clinton Epstein Connection.
         </li>
         <li>
          Do you think Hillary is out there getting the Generals out there to go to these parties?  No, it's their seconds [in command], Doug Band for Bill, Philipe for Hillary, in Europe it was Valerie Plame
         </li>
         <li>
          That's why this sex case is more important than Paula Broadwell--it's about the blackmail and pedophila

         <li>
          NATO C3 meetings and CENTCOM, where the State Dept people meet NATO generals, &lt;&lt;points at Philipe Reines&gt;&gt; I'm not saying its the current people at the State Dept, that's why I put this [text] over Philipe, I'm pointing the finger; that's why he's lashing out at anything even approaching a sex scandal--it's because he's behind it all.

          Tyler Drumheller to Sidney Bluemtnal.  "Here it is.  Don't share it with anybody".  Someone called me a "fringe site" but this is in their own hand [email].

          I prefer to call them "Microsweatshops" because they work with microfinancing schemes, which forces them into ever-increasing poverty which forces them into prostitution and drug dealing.
         </li>
         <li>
          Mentions "Mississippi Burning" and when Kennedy sent in 300 agents into Mississippi.  That's what the president needs to do.  To send 300 FBI people here [Haiti], especially when you have a person who has been conviced of child-running.
         </li>
         <li>
          The [lawyer] representing [child-runner / 33 kids in Haiti] Laura Silsby is himself a convicted child-runner in 2004 in central america.

          On the FBI's obstructionism.  Retired Deputy Assistant the of FBI {{Who?}} says "No grand jury, no subpoenas, no court orders, you know, immunity to the co-conspirators, letting the co-conspirtors in on the interview.  I mean, these are all crazy things the FBI never does"

          George speculates: Grange's wife is in charge of the ports, and this could be a gaping hole in security; that guns from Iraq could be funnelled into the port at Norfolk.

          What is a cutout?  We're making parking meters and sending them to nicaragua as a cover for sending airplanes down there but what really really making is hollow nosecones so we can put cocaine inside them and fly them back to Mena Arkansas.

         </li>
         <li>
          If don't have the army yourself--like Bush did--to do a topple, is to get NATO to do it for you (the 1100 hidden donors, US and NATO generals), that's why you are going to have a 240B dollars missing (Gaddafi's billions)

         <li>
          &lt;&lt;&lt;Just to explain here, since its complicated.  This is infighting within the CIA, fighting over NATO Generals and military forces.  There's Clintons HYDRA versus Bush's CIA.  HYDRA is trying to topple othe countries with NATO/US forces, and this is why Iraq had to hire so many "security contractors" (mercenaries).  So to "slow down Bush's efforts in Iraq" to contine activities in north africa, Joe Wilson outed WMD's as a rouse, so then as revenge the Bush administration outed Plame as a spy&gt;&gt;&gt;

          There is a military component to that, if you look at George Soros organizations, La Raza, Moveon.org, he uses OTPOR (DISRUPT) almost everywhere to topple, train Isis.  You see ISIS being trained in Mexico
         </li>

          The military feels the need to "try out" New military technologies on people.  History has shown them doing this with nuclear weapon testing and bioweapon testing on US soldiers.

         <li>
          If you are willing to use Sarin gas against Syrian children, then would you stop if you think you are firing Sarin into a group of "deplorables", would that stop you? At what point would you draw the line if you've already done 52 gas attacks against other humans.

          Going back to Mena Airport that Ollie North setup in 1984, this has been a funding mechanism [which has become  the Clinton Foundation (1997)] to do this: to create terrorism events around the world or in the US.
         </li>
         <li>
          I predict there will be terrorism in the US &lt;Gladio D&gt;
         </li>
         <li>
          It's all to drive funding and to create this larger FBI counterterrorism effort
         </li>
         <li>
          &lt;&lt;&lt;Terrorism is used as a hegelian dialectic strategy to enrich the security state, just like everyone has said before; *ordo ab chao*&gt;&gt;&gt;
         </li>
         <li>
          At the center of this is Andrew McCabe the JTTF (joint terrorist task force), the interface between IC and FBI -- it's used for infiltration, breaking into people's houses illegally
         </li>
         <li>
          D&amp;D is about making false claims against people as white supremacists, and creating crimes, using children as bait and perpetuating fake crime in order to have a reason to go after regular citizens who are politically opposed to them.
         </li>
         <li>
          Chaffetz questioned the secret service and their response was to revenge-investigate Jason Chaffetz.  It was an oblique threat against him.  They found out he had applied to secret service and was turned away for not making the cut, and they shamed and ridiculed him.  That's all they found on him.
         </li>
         <li>
          People in Europe are living under this also, that's why we need to publish the 1100 hidden donors
         </li>
         <li>
