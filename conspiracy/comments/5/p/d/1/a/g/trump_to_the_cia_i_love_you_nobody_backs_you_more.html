       Worst fucking speech that I have ever heard....
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The world is fucked. and we KNEW!! that this would happen with Trump as we
       <em>
        KNEW
       </em>
       that we didnt want clintons... but holy shit... this is the worst way to handle this.
      </p>
      <p>
       His speech to the CIA was just made fun of by the media "the most dishonest people in the world" -- where they said "this was a campaign rally speech, not something that we would expect to hear from a president"

       Can you 1. Calm down, and 2. Maybe edit your whole post until it can be understood by a normal person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, Trump should've been more respectful at the HQ. That's why they're bashing him. If it was at a different location, with the same CIA people, Trump's comments would've been appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the media
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       the most dishonest people in the world. And Trump fucking made them show their own viewers Trumps speech. He called them out on their shit. Each day approval ratings drop. And that's awesome.
      </p>
      <p>
       The movie you're watching is a mass global awakening. Whether Trump is a good guy or a bad guy, both good and evil contribute to this mass awakening.

       Lets just hope that DT is ACTUALLY not in the inner circle and is just a lucky useful idiot and we have some breathing room to go after the Clinton/Bush Cabal and fuck them up.

       I am 100% anti-hillary. You don't know who I am, but let me assure you, internet friend, Hillary is the most evil corrupt POS from the entire clinton/bush cabal -- I can go into detail if desired, but she is satan incarnate.

       I knew that BOTH HRC and DT were == demise... but I in-no-way wanted HRC+ to profit from the demise of the US.

       I would rather Trump fuck it up, or MAYBE he can actually do something. But therewas literally NEGATIVE faith in HRC doing ANYTHING to benefit

       Where are you reading that? You make an ass out of yourself when you assume. Just because someone posts a wtf trump message doesn't mean they are for Clinton or the previous president, they are simply WTFing trump. Unfortunately Trump is a hot mess and we are seeing him unable to properly lead. Who goes to the CIA and bitches about the media for 9 minutes out of 15, talk about not knowing your audience or respecting the hollowed grounds and the sacrifice of 167 (?) KIA CIA agents.

       Trump isn't a dumby. You play ball with intelligence agencies, or they remove you from office one way or another. That's just plain history. He was marketing himself before he was sworn in. Now that he is the president, he will be operating under different rules. Remember, the Director of the CIA serves at the pleasure of the president. Brush up on your U.S. History before assuming. Before he was an outsider, now he's the boss. That's two different roles you have to play.

       anyone who gets riled up at the drop of the hat is not in control of their emotions thus not the brightest. If you knew anything about US history, you would know that a cabal runs the CIA (look into Mossad) and the president is not as powerful as you are purporting.

       The President may be a puppet, but it doesn't matter. He's the face of the Nation now. And like it or not, he's the leader of many organizations he was critical of before being elected. Now that he is the "face" of those organizations, he will tend to act differently. A true leader knows the difference between a time to critique and a time to lead.
       <br/>
       The Mossad and CIA are joined at the hip, there is much Israeli influence within the U.S. Government, but I doubt they control the CIA. I tend not to speculate without physical evidence on things, you know making assumptions.

       I'm not saying that. I'm saying he is acting completely different from the moment he was president elect to president. Whatever he does in the interim is beyond me. I'm not one of those who support everything the guy says, but the promises he made and what he does will determine whether he's a one term president or not.

       Dude wake up. He put five Goldman Sachs guys in his administration. Betsy DeVos family donated $200 million to the GOP and her brother even founded Blackwater. His Secretary of Treasure is even called the "foreclosure king".

       Well that sounds a lot like what he told the American ppl. What they want to hear.

       We knew going in he was a poor bet. Only thing that made him preferable:  he was not treasonous war criminal, not a satanic pedo ring queen,  and not for TPP or war w Russia. I think all these still stand.

       I have read that he talked about a room w no columns, and had said CIA would be restructured before election. Possibly means to reassure, but also means to neutralize their evil ways?  I believe the "fifth column" was NWO.

       Of course... see my other comments. After he met with the CIA/deep state - he has a lot more info than we do, I'd bet he is about to fall in line....

       But holy fucking christ - his cabinet picks before he was sworn in shows he is a moron (Devos, Perry, et al) -- and his fucking statements at the CIA shows he was being as much of an ass-licking suck-up as Paul Ryan was to him at the inagural luncheon.
