       Hello, I just want to express an idea to y'all; it's called the false left-right paradigm and some of you may have heard of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in a nutshell, most propoganda either attempts to turn us to the left, or to the right... Think about it- how much propoganda have you seen that leads you to think outside of box of liberalism and conservatism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my theory, and it's really very simple. The goal is to keep the citizenship within a certain spectrum, and especially to draw them to one of the 2 political parties (there is a reason why 3rd parties are systematically excluded in America).
      </p>
      <p>
       These 2 political parties are trying to take your rights; the left is trying to disarm you (kind of obvious) along with some other stuff but that's the big one. The right seeks to increase the surveillance state in the name of "national security."
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents, I could go into more detail but I wanted to keep it short since it's my first time posting about it.

       Indeed. If we had a more centrist or even libertarian leadership, TPTB would not have much power. They want the more extreme policies of both the left and right implemented in order to keep the populace powerless. Balance of power is the enemy of our enemy.

       Be careful even with libertarianism. Their ideas are great, but they, too, can be a funnel of our creative energies.

       It's tempting, but false. If Ron Paul had won the election, they would have shot him dead.

       I respectfully disagree. What's your basis for saying that if Ron Paul had won the election that he would be shot? I heard plenty of people say that about Trump, and even Obama lol. Just not seeing it. MD even if they did, it would give way to a new wave of consciousness (imo)

       Well, they're both in the establishment. I think Trump is at the outer edge of it, and he is trying to force it into the right direction, but it's pretty clear that there are limits he has to work within (i.e. not throwing Hillary in jail because her blackmail file is too big)

      <p>
       In a sense, it has. Just the death of Kennedy has left a remarkable wrinkle in most people's thinking. Most people know something really bad happened when Kennedy died, and a part of our soul as a nation died with him.

       People mostly voted for trump not because of his ideals but because they find the left to be worse and visa versa. In the mean we fail to notice were pushing a dangerous agenda either way.

       Do you think the notion that 'a vote for third party is a wasted vote' is the result of inculcation? It seems silly and it really reared its head this election season. (Full disclosure, I went with Trump but that's because I think he's an outsider) Even though the two had the lowest favorability ratings of all time there was still such a push against voting third party by everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~4% going third party? That's ridiculous when they were both so hated.

       Yeah, I do think it's a result of inculcation (had to look that one up, TIL) and propaganda. Most people who weren't third party voters would tell me that my vote was a waste; Trump supporters would tell me a third party vote was a vote for Hillary- while Hillary supporters would tell me a third party vote was a vote for Trump.

       Definitely agree. It's too bad all the millions of people marching and rioting today didn't throw a ruckus when the third party candidates were getting almost only negative press or radio silence. Voting for the lesser of two evils, D vs R, is a dangerous boxed in mindset when another option is sitting right there out in the open.

       What they need is a powerful candidate at their head, one who can draw a lot of attention on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanders could've done it, he may have been able to outright win if he went third party, I mean, worst case, the outcome is the same as it is now. Ron Paul could if the

       I hate how that was used against Johnson. No one had heard of Aleppo before then. That shouldn't be the thing people bring up when they disagree with Johnson. I get that it's kind of a joke, not meant to argue here, but I just don't like how the MSM used that to completely destroy his campaign. And how he wasn't let into the debates. It should be obvious that this is all a show, but no one gives a shit.

       Gary Johnson is a bloody dolt. Anyone paying attention to world news would know. Johnson was not paying attention. Instead of saying that he was not paying attention because [insert excuse], he went on to say "If the President does not know what's going on, he can't send the troops there."
      </p>
      <p>
       That reply makes him a total bloody idiot. He could've said that he would "catch up" on whatever's going on with the Generals, CIA, DIA, etc. But no, he chose to flaunt ignorance and make it, and himself, a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM did not destroy his campaign. His ignorance and his responses did. He literally knows nothing. He can't even reply "who's your favourite foreign leader". Even if he does not know ANYONE he could've just said "I support 'MURICA and no one comes close to Reagan, to name a foreign leader would be to make America #2!". Instead, that daft dolt went to say "I am having an Aleppo moment".
      </p>
      <p>
       I repeat, the MSM did not destroy Johnson's campaign. He destroyed it himself by being a total bloody idiot.

       The MSM did not give him the light of day. They only gave him attention when it was to ask "do you think that you're a spoiler candidate?" or "do you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       not know what Allepo is?" and other bullshit questions. They didn't take him seriously. He knew that the game was rigged, and all of the bullshit was driving him crazy, so I think he just said "fuck it" and just fucked around and made a fool out of himself. If the MSM treated me like that, I wasn't let in the debates despite overwhelming popular demand, and I had Gary's perspective, I would probably have done the same and just treated the MSM with as much disrespect as I received from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he was
       <em>
        trying
       </em>
       to be clever and shit when he would go "I'm having an Aleppo moment" and the foreign leader thing, but Gary is just not the kind of guy to be clever and shit. I still voted for him because the two party system is cancer, and any vote not for the two political parties was better than not voting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree he did not handle basically anything in the right way during the election, but he didn't necessarily cause his own destruction. He may have been ill equipped to handle the MSM bashing and social media bashing, but he's alright. I think the election was just so batshit crazy itself, Gary started to not give a fuck. Before the Aleppo moment, he was actually doing pretty well and gaining a lot of support. Once he got MSM attention, however, he spiralled out of control.

       No one from any country wants a dumbass to win an election. Especially if he's from a minor party, because larger and well established parties have many advisers that would help the politician. To be a 3rd party candidate, he has to know his stuff well enough to recite it both forwards and backwards. And if he really does not know shit, he has to have the EQ to bloody reframe the whole engagement instead of triggering the keyword and associating himself negatively. Gary Johnson is now referred to as "What is Aleppo?" He's done.

       That's because they're highly unpopular. People talk about how unpopular Trump is, well, 3rd parties are even more unpopular.

       The 5% is not in polls - polls are bloody worthless.

       5% is in the actual election.

       Obviously I don't have an example of it actually happening in a real election. If I did I would be distributing that information as well as working with law enforcement because it's a crime. I respect your opinion, but I don't see how that destroys my argument at all. It's not a smoking gun but it makes me think....

       As mentioned earlier, polls are useless because not only can the
       <strong>
        results be skewed* even if there's no manipulation (poll who's more popular in a Dem/Rep-exclusive area), it is not **legally binding
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       What is legally binding, however, is the result of the election. 3rd party candidates must pass the 5% threshold to get Federal funding.

       I agree that polls are worthless. However, I disagree with your assertion of my poll destroying my case. I am not sharing it as evidence, rather just as an example that things like this do happen. Obviously if I had direct evidence I would be sharing that directly as well as coordinating with law enforcement

       I'm all ears. I've been discussing with friends and trying to do what I can. It's difficult because there's a lot of cognitive dissonance out there, and it's obviously an effective systems. I think getting government funding to a third party would be a great first step.

       Both sides are the same, except for some wedge issues that keeps the nation divided. And in reality, the wedge issues don't really matter. They aren't going to take guns away (at least not without a systematic, escalating, paradigm that leaves taking guns as the only viable solution).

      <p>
       I think this is the owners plan, to ultimately take guns away from people. Just because one side says they are more lenient on guns, doesn't mean they actually are. Both sides are the same. Reagan instituted some of the strictest gun legislation the country has seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are going to take guns through a series of escalating circumstances like we see with these false flag gun operations. They will continue to tighten gun legislation, quietly, until one day we realize it's too late and guns are basically taken.

       Completely agree. Great points, especially about the false flags. I've heard people say that there is one party, and I don't disagree with that because they are so essential to each other. Without one, we would realize how stupid the other is and vice versa.

       It's not that false.  Conservatives want religion and traditional values to deal with problems like poverty and drug use.  Liberals want and demand a huge oppressive bureaucracy to enforce equality.

       These are fundamentally different visions, and one in particular is very violent.  Sure, the two parties are a joke, and an oligarchy that prefers a third position between the two gold the real power.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if that oligarchy disappeared, we'd have civil war.  Because of the left and their aggression.  And the oligarchy does lean towards the left.

       I have liberal friends.  They are in academia and government.  They basically recognize they'll lose their jobs if the government loses power.  They believe lies even when I point out cold hard facts to them.  They literally classify information as fake or not simply according to whether it conforms to their worldview.  They in particular are unwilling to accept any information that suggests a big government might have fakes or that there might be alternatives

      <blockquote>

        “The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum....”

       In Satanism and other occult circles, one of the most useful tools appears to be the Hegelian Dialectic. The idea is, that if you want people to do what you want, you have to present them with two extreme and opposite versions of what you want, whereby creating an illusion of choice. We are routinely presented with the choice between thesis and antithesis, but never receive either; we always end up with a synthesis of the two ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed it is also taught in books about parenting as a useful tool to get your kids to eat their food or go to bed, etc. If you want them to put on their pajamas and go to bed but they refuse, you simply offer them the choice "do you want to wear the blue PJs tonight or the orange one?", and voila, as soon as they pick one, you have circumvented their decision if they want to go to bed at all.

       Some call it the Hegelian dialectic. Brit David Icke, who has his own peculiar take on the elite conspiracy simply calls it "problem, solution, reaction..." where the elites first create a problem or crisis that enables them to introduce a solution that actually serves their own greater control and ability to exploit the masses that the public only goes along with because they are tricked into believing that the problem or crises is real rather than a completely staged and pre-arranged event engineered by their own government in order to re-direct their taxes away from services that benefit them into ones that will actually be used to oppress and exploit them even further.

       Great question, it's always so hard to define TPTB in specific terms.  The military industrial complex seems to be a very big beneficiary, and that is an industry that pours money into politics. There is likely others, and specific people (probably owners of MSM) but it's very hard to pinpoint

       A better term for this is 'false dichotomy', its a well known informal fallacy, and a very important topic to bring awareness to, for sure. And it's completely baffling to me how two party systems are effective at duping and corralling electorates.

       I do want to ask you, however, what it is that you see, on the economic dimension, beyond the left and the right. Either the economic power is distributed among individuals who undertake private enterprises, or it is concentrated in some central body. What other alternative is there?

       The terms left and right are pretty conflated nowadays, as a lot of random associations get pilled on top of the original definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       In so far as left and right refer to differences on the economic dimension — where left represents central control of the economy, in whatever form that might take and right represents distributed control, private property, free enterprise, etc. — I believe they describe a dichotomy which is very real. Because how else can an economy be organized?

       Thanks for clarifying. This was difficult for me to answer, as I've never really thought about it. But here my take; on both sides, the left and the right, we have ideologies that aren't ideal but are used anyway. I think we could organize the economy in more pragmatic terms if we got away from ideological concepts. I know this isn't the best answer but if we become more pragmatic in how the economy is managed and who it benefits then it would just be a lot better. The problem is that economic control is in the hands of the elites, central banks, etc.

       already your speech seems to be gravitating towards a community-oriented and centrally-organized paradigm, do you see what I mean? You can't really get away it. It's not even a matter of these ideas being charged with 'ideology' as you say, it's just a logical inevitability that any system is either centralized or distributed.

       I'm convinced the "left-right" system for politics and  the "heaven-hell" for morals are a way for TPTB to keep us thinking about the world around us two-dimensionally. If we were to conceptualize the world around us in three dimensions we may be able to build true respect and empathy among one another and take a step towards global consciousness.

       I respectfully disagree. What's your basis for saying that if Ron Paul had won the election that he would be shot? I heard plenty of people say that about Trump, and even Obama lol. Just not seeing it. MD even if they did, it would give way to a new wave of consciousness (imo)

       Great question, it's always so hard to define TPTB in specific terms.  The military industrial complex seems to be a very big beneficiary, and that is an industry that pours money into politics. There is likely others, and specific people (probably owners of MSM) but it's very hard to pinpoint
