        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello, I just want to express an idea to y&#39;all; it&#39;s called the false left-right paradigm and some of you may have heard of it.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell, most propoganda either attempts to turn us to the left, or to the right... Think about it- how much propoganda have you seen that leads you to think outside of box of liberalism and conservatism. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my theory, and it&#39;s really very simple. The goal is to keep the citizenship within a certain spectrum, and especially to draw them to one of the 2 political parties (there is a reason why 3rd parties are systematically excluded in America). </p>

<p>These 2 political parties are trying to take your rights; the left is trying to disarm you (kind of obvious) along with some other stuff but that&#39;s the big one. The right seeks to increase the surveillance state in the name of &quot;national security.&quot;  </p>

<p>Just my two cents, I could go into more detail but I wanted to keep it short since it&#39;s my first time posting about it. </p>

<p>Kennedy. Lincoln.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, they&#39;re both in the establishment. I think Trump is at the outer edge of it, and he is trying to force it into the right direction, but it&#39;s pretty clear that there are limits he has to work within (i.e. not throwing Hillary in jail because her blackmail file is too big)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>even if they did, it would give way to a new wave of consciousness (imo)</p>

<p>In a sense, it has. Just the death of Kennedy has left a remarkable wrinkle in most people&#39;s thinking. Most people know something really bad happened when Kennedy died, and a part of our soul as a nation died with him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think the notion that &#39;a vote for third party is a wasted vote&#39; is the result of inculcation? It seems silly and it really reared its head this election season. (Full disclosure, I went with Trump but that&#39;s because I think he&#39;s an outsider) Even though the two had the lowest favorability ratings of all time there was still such a push against voting third party by everyone.</p>

<p>~4% going third party? That&#39;s ridiculous when they were both so hated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I do think it&#39;s a result of inculcation (had to look that one up, TIL) and propaganda.

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely agree. It&#39;s too bad all the millions of people marching and rioting today didn&#39;t throw a ruckus when the third party candidates were getting almost only negative press or radio silence.

    <div class="md"><p>What they need is a powerful candidate at their head, one who can draw a lot of attention on their own.</p>

<p>Sanders could&#39;ve done it, he may have been able to outright win if he went third party, I mean, worst case, the outcome is the same as it is now. Ron Paul could if the <em>entire</em> media wasn&#39;t actively working against him...</p>

<p>Who would be a good third party candidate? Johnsons out, Stein&#39;s out...</p>

I get that it&#39;s kind of a joke, not meant to argue here, but I just don&#39;t like how the MSM used that to completely destroy his campaign. And how he wasn&#39;t let into the debates.

    <div class="md"><p>Gary Johnson is a bloody dolt. Anyone paying attention to world news would know. Johnson was not paying attention. Instead of saying that he was not paying attention because [insert excuse], he went on to say &quot;If the President does not know what&#39;s going on, he can&#39;t send the troops there.&quot;</p>

<p>That reply makes him a total bloody idiot. He could&#39;ve said that he would &quot;catch up&quot; on whatever&#39;s going on with the Generals, CIA, DIA, etc. But no, he chose to flaunt ignorance and make it, and himself, a joke.</p>

<p>The MSM did not destroy his campaign. His ignorance and his responses did. He literally knows nothing. He can&#39;t even reply &quot;who&#39;s your favourite foreign leader&quot;. Even if he does not know ANYONE he could&#39;ve just said &quot;I support &#39;MURICA and no one comes close to Reagan, to name a foreign leader would be to make America #2!&quot;. Instead, that daft dolt went to say &quot;I am having an Aleppo moment&quot;.</p>

<p>I repeat, the MSM did not destroy Johnson&#39;s campaign. He destroyed it himself by being a total bloody idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The MSM did not give him the light of day. They only gave him attention when it was to ask &quot;do you think that you&#39;re a spoiler candidate?&quot; or &quot;do you <em>really</em> not know what Allepo is?&quot; and other bullshit questions. They didn&#39;t take him seriously. He knew that the game was rigged, and all of the bullshit was driving him crazy, so I think he just said &quot;fuck it&quot; and just fucked around and made a fool out of himself. If the MSM treated me like that, I wasn&#39;t let in the debates despite overwhelming popular demand, and I had Gary&#39;s perspective, I would probably have done the same and just treated the MSM with as much disrespect as I received from them. </p>

<p>I think he was <em>trying</em> to be clever and shit when he would go &quot;I&#39;m having an Aleppo moment&quot; and the foreign leader thing, but Gary is just not the kind of guy to be clever and shit. I still voted for him because the two party system is cancer, and any vote not for the two political parties was better than not voting.</p>

<p>I agree he did not handle basically anything in the right way during the election, but he didn&#39;t necessarily cause his own destruction. He may have been ill equipped to handle the MSM bashing and social media bashing, but he&#39;s alright. I think the election was just so batshit crazy itself, Gary started to not give a fuck. Before the Aleppo moment, he was actually doing pretty well and gaining a lot of support. Once he got MSM attention, however, he spiralled out of control.</p>

<p>Then he will be treated as a fool. But no, he &quot;fucked around and made a fool out of himself&quot; because he&#39;s a bloody fool. Does he even know that he&#39;s not campaigning for the MSM to vote for him, but the people?</p>

<p>Total disaster not &quot;to be clever and shit&quot;.</p>

<p>Then lose. This isn&#39;t the first time he&#39;s running. You&#39;re giving him way too much credit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Even according to you, he destroyed his own campaign.</p>

<p>No one from any country wants a dumbass to win an election. Especially if he&#39;s from a minor party, because larger and well established parties have many advisers that would help the politician. To be a 3rd party candidate, he has to know his stuff well enough to recite it both forwards and backwards. And if he really does not know shit, he has to have the EQ to bloody reframe the whole engagement instead of triggering the keyword and associating himself negatively. Gary Johnson is now referred to as &quot;What is Aleppo?&quot; He&#39;s done.</p>

<p>I think this is the owners plan, to ultimately take guns away from people. Just because one side says they are more lenient on guns, doesn&#39;t mean they actually are. Both sides are the same. Reagan instituted some of the strictest gun legislation the country has seen. </p>

<p>They are going to take guns through a series of escalating circumstances like we see with these false flag gun operations. They will continue to tighten gun legislation, quietly, until one day we realize it&#39;s too late and guns are basically taken.  </p>

<p>Neither of those things are true. Those are mostly negative stereotypes and very loose generalizations, fallacies, and guidelines.</p>

<p>People can be whatever they want. They&#39;re forced to define themselves by labels like left or right because Americans buy into the idea that everything is black or white.</p>

<p>Most of the issues partisans complain about are social issues that don&#39;t affect most people but they&#39;re easy to argue about and mostly ideologically driven. Real issues like war or finance are ignored while people fight over more irrelevant stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum....” </p>

<p>In Satanism and other occult circles, one of the most useful tools appears to be the Hegelian Dialectic. The idea is, that if you want people to do what you want, you have to present them with two extreme and opposite versions of what you want, whereby creating an illusion of choice. We are routinely presented with the choice between thesis and antithesis, but never receive either; we always end up with a synthesis of the two ideas.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed it is also taught in books about parenting as a useful tool to get your kids to eat their food or go to bed, etc. If you want them to put on their pajamas and go to bed but they refuse, you simply offer them the choice &quot;do you want to wear the blue PJs tonight or the orange one?&quot;, and voila, as soon as they pick one, you have circumvented their decision if they want to go to bed at all.</p>

But here my take; on both sides, the left and the right, we have ideologies that aren&#39;t ideal but are used anyway. I think we could organize the economy in more pragmatic terms if we got away from ideological concepts. I know this isn&#39;t the best answer but if we become more pragmatic in how the economy is managed and who it benefits then it would just be a lot better.
