       <p>
        MSNBC's Chris Matthews offered a harsh critique of President Trump's message of
        <strong>
         "America first"
        </strong>
        in his inaugural address Friday, describing it as being
        <strong>

          the Hitlerian background to it,

        Maddow said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over on ABC, journalist Terry Moran echoed Maddow's comments saying Trump's speech reminded him of the 1930s.

       I agree, but the utopia you want to happen will never happen I'm sorry to say, imo.  We are stupid hairless apes and will never get to Star Trek before mass extinction, exhausting all resources and destroying our ecosystem.  I wish it could be different.

       As populations rise, we continue to wipe out species and use up finite resources every day.  CO2 levels are rising, and methane is going to start releasing from many areas in the world speeding up that process even more.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, and there is no worse news.  Believe me when I say this grieves me down to my being every single day, and I wish humanity weren't so short sighted, tribalistic, greedy and power-hungry.

       i didn't hear the speech, but i read parts of it, was nicely surprised, trump kept most of the trumpi-ness out of it. thought it was an ok speech, parts were very bernie sanders.
      </p>
      <p>
       my dad, an msnbc junkie asked me about it yesterday, which was weird because he yelled at me the week before that i was never to talk to him about the news again.
      </p>
      <p>
       i said i thought it was ok. he used the following adjectives: dark, very dark shades of hitler's speech in 1933 and deutschland uber alles
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       deutschland uber alles is simply the germany national anthem and has been since before hitler and still is...so i pointed out that it kind of a spurious criticism, and the fact that america first was a nazi group in the US
      </p>
      <p>
       given the identical criticism, i'd say ge got it from them, esp since he did immediately agree that he already knew that "germany above all" is just the german national anthem and has nothi g to do with nazi's
      </p>
      <p>
       there was an america first commitee and charles Llndbergh was an anti-semite, but, that's cherry picking.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't know how trump, or rather his speech writer intended it, but jumping onto ZOMG!!!!! NAZIS!!!!! because of a 75 year old short lived club that had zero impact historucally soeaking, when the recent/modern usage is as a battle cry by labor against neoliberalism, globalist trade agreements, is a bit of a stretch
      </p>
      <p>
       requiste disclaimer: i did not vote for trump, i don't particularly like him but he can be legitimately funny, i think his cabinet is a nightmare, there is not one politician in the world i trust, even bernie, let alone trump (though i do think ron paul is usually on the up and up), i voted fir jill.
      </p>
      <p>
       (when the fuck can the need for disclaimering stop?)

       Immediately after the speech the CBS faces said that Trump had said nothing about bringing people together, but actually Trump opened his speech with this statement: "We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people." and throughout the rest of his speech he spoke to all, and concluded with this: "So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:
You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together, We will make America strong again."

       The above is a classic example of a vacuous comment. These are typically made by individuals who know little or NOTHING of the subject matter at hand, yet seek to project an air of pompous superiority.

       if you want to impress us, child, cite those points of "HISTORY" that you pretend I have overlooked in my "ignorance". But you had better be able to back your spiel with impeccable cites, otherwise you may find yourself bitch-clapped, red-faced, and cringing in the corner.

       Sorry. It was late. I was tired. Charles Lindbergh, who I personally admire, represented a group of anti war, anti Zionist Americans who tried to keep us out of WWII. They were the first and foremost group identified with this slogan. It is also the first listing if you google it. So read some history,please .🐸 - Me trying to be pleasant.
