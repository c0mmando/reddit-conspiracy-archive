<blockquote>
<p>MSNBC&#39;s Chris Matthews offered a harsh critique of President Trump&#39;s message of <strong>&quot;America first&quot;</strong> in his inaugural address Friday, describing it as being <strong>&quot;Hitlerian.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;When he said today</em> <strong><em>&#39;America first&#39;</em></strong> <em>it was not just the racial, I mean the — I shouldn&#39;t say racial,</em> <strong><em>the Hitlerian background to it,</em></strong>&quot; Matthews said, making a reference to the speeches delivered by <strong>Nazi Germany leader Adolf Hitler</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fox News (archived):</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/rX2cb"><strong>MSNBC, ABC hosts deem Trump inaugural address as &#39;militant,&#39; &#39;anti-Semitic&#39;</strong></a></p>

<p>QUOTES:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MSNBC&#39;s Rachel Maddow emotionally proclaimed Trump&#39;s <strong>&quot;America&#39;s First&quot;</strong> slogan has &quot;very dark echoes in American history.&quot;</p>

<p><em>&quot;There was an America First Committee that formed in this country, hundreds of thousands of people in this country, some of the richest businessmen in the country who were part of it, they were formed to keep us out of World War II.</em> <strong><em>They were infiltrated by the Nazis, many of them are anti-Semitic, part of why they weren&#39;t alarmed by Hitler&#39;s rise in Germany,&quot;</em></strong> Maddow said.</p>

<p>Over on ABC, journalist Terry Moran echoed Maddow&#39;s comments saying Trump&#39;s speech reminded him of the 1930s.</p>

<p><em>&quot;It carries with it overtones from the 1930s</em> <strong><em>when an anti-Semitic movement saying, &#39;We don&#39;t want to get involved in Europe&#39;s war. It&#39;s the Jews fault in Germany!</em></strong>&#39;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Maybe Trump SHOULD have said <strong><em>&quot;ISRAEL FIRST&quot;</em></strong>???</p>

<p>i didn&#39;t hear the speech, but i read parts of it, was nicely surprised, trump kept most of the trumpi-ness out of it. thought it was an ok speech, parts were very bernie sanders.</p>

<p>my dad, an msnbc junkie asked me about it yesterday, which was weird because he yelled at me the week before that i was never to talk to him about the news again.</p>

<p>i said i thought it was ok. he used the following adjectives: dark, very dark shades of hitler&#39;s speech in 1933 and deutschland uber alles</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yLHGTJjHXLo">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yLHGTJjHXLo</a></p>

<p>deutschland uber alles is simply the germany national anthem and has been since before hitler and still is...so i pointed out that it kind of a spurious criticism, and the fact that america first was a nazi group in the US</p>

<p>given the identical criticism, i&#39;d say ge got it from them, esp since he did immediately agree that he already knew that &quot;germany above all&quot; is just the german national anthem and has nothi g to do with nazi&#39;s</p>

<p>there was an america first commitee and charles Llndbergh was an anti-semite, but, that&#39;s cherry picking.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t know how trump, or rather his speech writer intended it, but jumping onto ZOMG!!!!! NAZIS!!!!! because of a 75 year old short lived club that had zero impact historucally soeaking, when the recent/modern usage is as a battle cry by labor against neoliberalism, globalist trade agreements, is a bit of a stretch</p>

<p>requiste disclaimer: i did not vote for trump, i don&#39;t particularly like him but he can be legitimately funny, i think his cabinet is a nightmare, there is not one politician in the world i trust, even bernie, let alone trump (though i do think ron paul is usually on the up and up), i voted fir jill.</p>

<p>(when the fuck can the need for disclaimering stop?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Immediately after the speech the CBS faces said that Trump had said nothing about bringing people together, but actually Trump opened his speech with this statement: &quot;We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.&quot; and throughout the rest of his speech he spoke to all, and concluded with this: &quot;So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:
You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together, We will make America strong again.&quot;</p>

<p>The above is a classic example of a vacuous comment. These are typically made by individuals who know little or NOTHING of the subject matter at hand, yet seek to project an air of pompous superiority.</p>

<p>if you want to impress us, child, cite those points of &quot;HISTORY&quot; that you pretend I have overlooked in my &quot;ignorance&quot;. But you had better be able to back your spiel with impeccable cites, otherwise you may find yourself bitch-clapped, red-faced, and cringing in the corner.</p>

<p>I have a considerable interest in the history of the times. If you can provide information that will enlighten, elucidate and edify, I welcome such instruction, BUT if all you have are moronic drive-by-shootings of snide remarks, crawl back into your hole.</p>
