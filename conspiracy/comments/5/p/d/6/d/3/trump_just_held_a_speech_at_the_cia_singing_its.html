        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>TLDR: Trump may have just signaled he plans on doing Netanyahu&#39;s bidding and going to war against Iraq (and possibly Iran).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xagAlOXT9Wk">Here is the video of the full speech</a> (starts at 25&#39;&#39;, Trump at 31&#39;&#39;). Edit: timestamps have changed, Trump starts at 6:30 now.</p>

<p>Starting at <del>40&#39;&#39;</del> 15:40, talking about how America got out wrong of Iraq, and how ISIS needs to be defeated, he repeats his old line &quot;we should have kept the oil&quot;. CIA people laugh. He then tells them: &quot;maybe we&#39;ll have another chance&quot;. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to care he immediately thereafter holds his hand in a sustained &quot;triple-six&quot; gesture. The content of that quote in itself is worrisome. He&#39;s the president now, not campaigning anymore. Does he plan to invade Iraq anew? </p>

<p>If he did, the purpose of course would be to do Israel&#39;s bidding, i.e. undermine Iran&#39;s newfound influence in its Shiite neighbor. </p>

<p>The propaganda is already set-out: ISIS. Undermining Iran is already a key reason for American/Western support of ISIS in Iraq (and the CIA people obviously know this). </p>

<p>Trump could even go to war against Iran. He did verbally attack Iran a great deal during his campaign, and his backer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sCW4IasWXc">Sheldon Adelson wants to nuke Iran.</a>. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm5Je73bYOY">proximity to Netanyahu</a> is also common knowledge, and we know what the Likud has been wanting to do with Iran for some time now. </p>

<p>If Trump cancels the nuclear deal, how is any option apart from war more likely? Iran would ramp-up its nuclear program, and Trump/Netanyahu would bomb it. It seems quite straightforward.</p>

<p>Remember Libya: a disarmament deal was made by Bush with Qaddafi before Obama bombed it back to the paleolithic. </p>

<p>Other notable quotes from the CIA speech:</p>

<p>&quot;sometimes you haven&#39;t got the backing you wanted, you&#39;re going to get so much backing, maybe you&#39;re going to say please don&#39;t give us so much backing! (laughs)&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;we are all on the same wavelength, folks, we are all on the same wavelength. right? he knows. it took Brian about 30 seconds to figure that one out. because we know. we are on the same wavelength. we are going to do great things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;we&#39;ve been fighting these wars longer than we&#39;ve ever fought, we have not used the real abilities that we have, we&#39;ve been restrained.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;i believe this group [the cia] is going to be one of the most important groups in this country towards making us safe, towards making us winners again, towards ending all of the problems [...]&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;[for his next speech at the CIA] we may have to get you a larger room, and maybe, maybe it will be built by somebody who knows how to build, and it wouldn&#39;t have columns. Do you understand that? We get rid of the columns!&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s my summary of the CIA speech to you r/conspiracy. Trump supporters, please don&#39;t downvote this thread because you dislike the possibility Trump may be a sell-out. Don&#39;t get me wrong, Hillary is an arch-villain and needs to hang. Still I do not grant Trump the status of superhero. What would constitute for you a red line, what would Trump need to do in order for you to declare he&#39;s not who he claims? I agree for the time being he deserves the benefit of the doubt, but let&#39;s be vigilant and skeptical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just so you know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_presidential_campaign,_2000">Bush also ran on a non-interventionist campaign back in 2000</a> and we all know how that turned out.  It was very similar to Ron Paul (not say Ron Paul would have gone into Iraq).  I really hope Trump is serious about a non-interventionist foreign policy, although I didn&#39;t vote for either Trump or Hillary. Foreign Policy is the one issue I really care about, hence why I have supported Paul, Kucinich, Sanders, Mckinney and any one else anti war.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a bit of an exaggeration. I mean the disillusionment would be absolutely tremendous. Orders of magnitude higher than the Obomba hope/change disappointment. The current feeling &quot;the system is rigged&quot; would inevitably multiply. The &quot;meta-conspiracy&quot; people envision would grow exponentially.</p>

<p>If Trump turns out to be a NWO puppet, it means the whole campaign (including media bashing) was a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nqik3/we_are_witnessing_the_birth_of_seconddegree/">highly sophisticated psychological operation</a>. Imagine the realization of that - for those who care bare it, i.e. those who aren&#39;t in cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>Those people would look at Trump, and would realize he is (and has always been) surrounded by Jews. They would criticize his foreign policy goals as being that of the Israeli right. They would start <a href="https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/v/voltaire/dictionary/chapter287.html">reading Voltaire</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1efQPJz0dQA">looking into the Holocaust</a>. They will be looking for a culprit/scapegoat for all the deception. They may start thinking things like &quot;May a tenant having been expelled of 110 homes and saying there&#39;s a problem with all the landlords have a problem himself?&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately history may rhyme and if it does once again innocents will die.</p>

<p>People had their steam off, they won&#39;t realize the huge jewish influence, especially when they are busy following stupid &quot;scandals&quot; about trump&#39;s wife and kids or w/e.

<p>Now onto wether he is or not. I am baffled for far too long and I can&#39;t make any sense.... Certain things show that he is not, undeniably...but other show that he falls perfectly into the scheme of things... I am just so lost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid such justifications are increasingly akin to wishful thinking. Trump hasn&#39;t killed anyone yet, so let&#39;s wait and see. The key is what he&#39;ll do when the economic/monetary calamity arrives. If he defaults on the odious US public debt, confiscates foreign gold at the NY Fed (as a fee for services rendered), dissolves the Federal Reserve System, institutes a gold-backed dollar 2.0 (with a preferential exchange rate for Americans and fuck the Chinese), he&#39;s a real nationalist/populist. This would plunge the world into a short-lived depression, but America would be thus leading the 21st century, and the NWO would be gone.</p>

<p>If he signs the US into a new, improved, benevolent, multipolar (global) money system (Bretton Woods 2.0), he&#39;s a sell out globalist. If so, question remains how many will believe him when he&#39;ll say &quot;i negotiated a great deal&quot;.</p>

<p>If 911 2.0 strikes first, I fear he&#39;ll take us to the <a href="http://www.threeworldwars.com/albert-pike2.htm">envisioned</a> clash of civilisations with Islam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read multiple claims that both at Trump&#39;s last press conference <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUyAk0bYps0">link</a> as well as during his speech for the CIA, he brought along his staffers to cheer and clap. As a comparison, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9VcS-EF7T0">here</a> is Obama&#39;s first press conference as President-Elect. I tried to but couldn&#39;t find Bush&#39; or Clinton&#39;s first press conference as President-Elect. I also wish there were more footage of the people clapping, I feel uncomfortable making claims if I can&#39;t see them.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s true, then honestly Trump seems too concerned about superficial pomp and he should try and rise above it. Same as how his press secretary in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AjjVMAdWm4#t=5608s">latest statement</a> squabbles about media reports on inauguration crowd sizes. It just seems so...petty.</p>

I can&#39;t remember who said it, but the setup was that right after inauguration or right before the new President gets taken to a small room with a screen and a few men they&#39;ve never met before.  The president sits down, the screen turns on, and you see a very clear of the assassination of JFK from a different vantage point than Oswald&#39;s.  The tape ends after JFK is shot, the lights go on, and the people in the room ask the new president if they have any questions.</p>

<p>What does that mean? Look for the same Deep State agenda to continue over the next 4 years. China is still going to be a major concern. Probably Iran will be a higher priority than it was during the last few years.</p>

<p>The wars will continue and Big Media is going to blame it all on Trump... he&#39;s the ultimate distraction.</p>

You haven&#39;t said anything besides no.  Go ahead and doubt trump but you dont believe he will try and grab control of the cia.  Trump said he has a ongoing war with the media,  he knows the role the cia plays in that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Do you understand that? We get rid of <em>the columns!</em>&quot; </p>

<p>Seems an odd thing to say... doesn&#39;t it? Or is Trump implying something else altogether by it? </p>

<p>The CIA has always been the US&#39;s &quot;fifth column&quot; working to undermine and destabilize other nations the US wants to take down. They&#39;ve also shown themselves to be playing a similar role inside the US and aimed at undermining Trump himself. </p>

<p>&quot;No more columns&quot; may indicate that the CIA&#39;s role will no longer be up to itself or by any elements within it to determine without direct Presidential instructions and final approval of any plans they come up with to satisfy the instructions they&#39;re given.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s an unusual character. Very blunt and direct about things. Not the sort who&#39;d deliberately look the other way or give the CIA the luxury of determining whatever it wants to do in order to maintain a visible degree of plausible deniability about what any of those activities are or for what ends, especially if they&#39;re inadvertently exposed.</p>

<p>Just another possibility to throw into the mix as to why Trump as President appears to be buttering the CIA up after his inauguration right after kicking their asses around the block before formally taking charge.</p>

I&#39;ve always felt he was a narcissist, a cartoon character, a charlatan, and a person who would blatantly abuse power for himself. Then seeing the lestream media that screwed Bernie doing the same to him made him easier to relate.</p>

<p>But I think there is enough evidence on this guy to know his intentions are not good, and that he was bought and paid off long ago. I remember the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary I watched on the AFL and how he pretty much convinced all the owners he was going to fight for them in court, only for them to lose everything they had as he profitted. And now he is president...And telling us how he will fight for us.</p>

<p>Talks blatantly like a Zionist, talks back his own &quot;drain the swamp&quot; slogan, says he will be the most pro Israel president ever, and now this.</p>

<li><p>No reference, he just means there are columns in the hall he is that are blocking people&#39;s view. Weird he&#39;d say &quot;you understand what I mean&quot;, as if there was a hidden meaning, but still possible.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>BTW, this is who Trump wants as our new Director of CIA (Mike Pompeo). Not impressed.  It seems Trump is pro surveillance state. The more I learn the more I feel Trump doesn&#39;t give a damn about civil liberties and has authoritarian leanings.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your conclusions are a bit off but there are some alarming things in here. Obviously he&#39;s not talking about invading iraq, he&#39;s talking about fighting isis in iraq (which would be in cooperation with iraq). </p>

<p>Though it does annoy me that he&#39;s pandering to the CIA and saying how he plans to give them tons of funding which is fucked. Maybe it would be to exert more control over them, to try to fight them by buttering them up and using them, but he should know that if they aren&#39;t on his side that is not something that will happen. The CIA would use him, not the other way around.</p>

<p>The Left doesn&#39;t have a monopoly on using global events to push their agenda, the Right is also damn good at it. In fact, the decades of the Cold War were used primarily by right wing groups to further their own interests under the guise of fighting Communism.</p>
