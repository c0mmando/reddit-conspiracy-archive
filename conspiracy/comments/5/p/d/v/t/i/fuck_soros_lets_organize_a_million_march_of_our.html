<p>Without government to make it top secret, any number of enterprising young guys would have invented packet systems.

    <div class="md"><p>No-one cares. People don&#39;t want to hear the Truth. They want to be told everything is fine. Notice, no-one marched when they found out that we were lied into an endless war that has killed thousands of US soldiers and thousands of civilians. No-one cared when we discovered that our political parties are compromised. No-one cared when we learned the government spies on everything we do and say. What was it that got thousands out in Washington to protest? The media manipulating people into thinking Trump cares less for &quot;women&#39;s rights&quot; than Obama did. Funny, because Obama has spent eight years supporting regimes that beat and brutalize and enslave women. You tell one of these Leftist protesters that, their head will explode ala Scanners. The fact is that the only way you can get people to care about the issues we discuss on conspiracy is to present these issues in a way that spark the selfishness in the masses. The women&#39;s rights march isn&#39;t really about women&#39;s rights, it&#39;s about government paying for women to get abortions and medical screenings. They cannot be protesting for <em>women&#39;s</em> rights because not <em>all</em> women agree with abortions and those ideas which these crowds are professing allegiance to. People want to march and fight rhetorical battles, they do not want to hear <em>real</em> information. They don&#39;t want to deal with elite pedohiles, they do not want to deal with murder, they do not want to discuss fascists, they do not want to talk about corruption, they do not want to have meaningful discussions about anything. They want to fight for free shit. Period.</p>

With the development of television, and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end. Every citizen, or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching, could be kept for twenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels of communication closed. The possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the State, but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects, now existed for the first time.</h2>

<p>There are only four ways in which a ruling class can fall from power. Either it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented Middle Group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and willingness to govern. These causes do not operate singly, and as a rule all four of them are present in some degree. A ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in power permanently. Ultimately the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself.</p>

<p>What opinions the masses hold, or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference. <em>They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect</em>.&quot;</p>
