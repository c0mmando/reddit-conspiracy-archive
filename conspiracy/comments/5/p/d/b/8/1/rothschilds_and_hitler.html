<p>Today I found out that the Rothschilds are essentially responsible for making Hitler out to be a villain. I learned that Hitler was actually a pretty good leader in the late &#39;30s which is why he won Times Person of the year, but when he had a Rothschild arrested and tried control Germany&#39;s economy on his own that is when the media started to bombard him and make him look like a villain. I also learned that the people running the concentration camps in Nazi Germany were actually Zionists Jews and not SS.</p>

<p>Was Hitler forced to exterminate the Jews by the Rothschilds? Also please let me know if you think I&#39;ve been horribly misinformed.</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What sources have you been reading?</p>

<p>The astounding role that the Rothschild banking family <em>(defacto leaders and primary financiers of the Zionist Movement)</em> played in world history during the first half of the 20th Century has largely been downplayed or outright ignored by most &quot;legitimate&quot; historians. </p>

<p>To say that the Zionist plan to establish a &quot;homeland for Jews&quot; in Palestine was ambitious would be a gross understatement. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was Hitler forced to exterminate the Jews by the Rothschilds?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. </p>

<p>But were it not for Hitler and the Nazi persecution of the Jews of Europe (and elsewhere), the Zionist Dream of a Jewish State in Palestine could NEVER have materialized. </p>

<p>Again, where have you been reading?</p>

<p>David Icke (I know he&#39;s controversial for his reptilian shape shifter stuff but he tends to be right about a lot of other things) goes into detail about how Hitler may have been a Rothschild himself. Interesting read that seems somewhat believeable given the connections he makes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I am glad that I am seeing more and more people bring this up.  </p>

<p>I also would like to know your sources for this information.  At first glance, it looks like some of it is accurate, but not other parts.  The part about the guards at the concentration camps I believe is false...  Although, I will say that I believe the banks made a lot of money off of the plight of the Jews and others.  To understand why I believe this, then read about the fucking bastard Soros.  </p>

<p>It is risky to allude to Hitler at all in a positive light because of the horrible things that he did.  I will discuss Hitler from a purely objective and historical point of view.  I do not like to discuss the horrible things Hitler is responsible for because it is depressing, people get emotionally charged, and the historical record is very, very solid on that issue.  I think that we can all agree that is it not acceptable to commit war crimes or crimes against humanity.  </p>

<p>Here is one of my sources regarding Hitler: </p>

<p>Hitler is listed towards the upper right in the flowchart.  The Rothschilds are not listed in the flowchart, and I am trying to figure out why.  I sent a few messages and I am waiting for a response.  Notice that George Herbert Walker and Prescott Bush are listed.  Do those names sound familiar?  What is the exact connection with the Rothschilds?    </p>

<p>This is Part 1 of 4 from a radio interview of Daniel P. Sheehan.  It is good to listen to in the background.  I would make it through all four Parts.  It will greatly change your perception of the world.  </p>

<p>Daniel Sheehan has a bunch of videos from the college course he teaches.  I believe these two are relevant to Hitler and the Elites, but I cannot keep them straight.  Anyways, he goes into great detail in his college course to explain the flowchart I linked to above.  </p>

<p>If you see anything good, or have some insight to add to this issue, please post it so others can look at it.  I will freely share the information I have, and I hope that others will do the same.  That way, we can awaken humanity quicker.  </p>

<p>Also, have you seen any movies about stolen art recovery from nazis? Guess who that art belonged to?</p>

<p>Furthermore there were some efforts of nationalist jews to support hitler et all who condemned the international jews who would &quot;make the situation worse&quot;, which they did culminating in the suggested 1942 &quot;final solution&quot; to the german problem by american jew kaufman sugeesting genocide of germans, and there were zionist jews who negotiated the haavara agreement with hitler, while hagana (mossad precursor) worked together with the ss to smuggle jews into palestine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s genuinely a life-changing experience when you realize that we&#39;ve all been indoctrinated with essentially the opposite of what actually happened.</p>

<p>MAN OF 1938<br/>
From the unholy organist, a hymn of hate.</p>

<p>Read the entire article <a href="http://www.scrapbookpages.com/DachauMemorial/TimeCover.html">one a single page here</a> or <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760539,00.html">on TIME&#39;s web site.</a></p>

<p>A few excerpts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Führer of the German people, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, Navy &amp; Air Force, Chancellor of the Third Reich, Herr Hitler reaped on that day at Munich the harvest of an audacious, defiant, ruthless foreign policy he had pursued for five and a half years. He had torn the Treaty of Versailles to shreds. He had rearmed Germany to the teeth— or as close to the teeth as he was able. He had stolen Austria before the eyes of a horrified and apparently impotent world.</p>

<p>But the figure of Adolf Hitler strode over a cringing Europe with all the swagger of a conqueror. Not the mere fact that the Führer brought 10,500,000 more people (7,000,000 Austrians, 3,500,000 Sudetens) under his absolute rule made him the Man of 1938. Japan during the same time added tens of millions of Chinese to her empire. More significant was the fact <strong>Hitler became in 1938 the greatest threatening force that the democratic, freedom-loving world faces today.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A generation ago western civilization had apparently outgrown the major evils of barbarism except for war between nations. The Russian Communist Revolution promoted the evil of class war. Hitler topped it by another, <strong>race war.</strong> Fascism and Communism both resurrected religious war. These multiple forms of barbarism gave shape in 1938 to an issue over which men may again, perhaps soon, shed blood: the issue of civilized liberty v. <strong>barbaric authoritarianism.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The genius of free wills has been so stifled by the oppression of dictatorship that Germany&#39;s output of poetry, prose, music, philosophy,art has been meagre indeed.</p>

<p>The man most <strong>responsible for this world tragedy</strong> is a moody, brooding, unprepossessing, 49-year-old Austrian-born ascetic with a Charlie Chaplin mustache. The son of an Austrian petty customs official, Adolf Hitler was raised as a spoiled child by a doting mother. Consistently failing to pass even the most elementary studies, he grew up a half-educated young man, untrained for any trade or profession, seemingly doomed to failure. Brilliant, charming, cosmopolitan Vienna he learned to loathe for what he called its Semitism; more to his liking was homogeneous Munich, his real home after 1912.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The situation which gave rise to this <strong>demagogic, ignorant, desperate movement</strong> was inherent in the German Republic&#39;s birth and in the craving of large sections of the politically immature German people for strong, masterful leadership. Democracy in Germany was conceived in the womb of military defeat. It was the Republic which put its signature (unwillingly) to the humiliating Versailles Treaty, a brand of shame which it never lived down in German minds.</p>

<p>In bad straits even in fair weather, the German Republic collapsed under the weight of the 1929-34 depression in which German unemployment soared to 7,000,000 above a nationwide wind drift of bankruptcies and failures. Called to power as Chancellor of the Third Reich on January 30, 1933 by aged, senile President Paul von Hindenburg, Chancellor Hitler began to turn the Reich inside out. Unemployment was solved by: 1) a far-reaching program of public works; 2) an intense re-armament program, including a huge standing army; 3) enforced labor in the service of the State (the German Labor Corps); 4) putting political enemies and Jewish, Communist and Socialist jobholders in concentration camps.</p>

<p>What Adolf Hitler &amp; Co. did to Germany in less than six years was applauded wildly and ecstatically by most Germans. He lifted the nation from post-War defeatism. Under the swastika Germany was unified. His was no ordinary dictatorship, but rather one of great energy and magnificent planning. The &quot;socialist&quot; part of National Socialism might be scoffed at by hard-&amp;-fast Marxists, but the Nazi movement nevertheless had a mass basis. The 1,500 miles of magnificent highways built, schemes for cheap cars and simple workers&#39; benefits, grandiose plans for rebuilding German cities made Germans burst with pride. Germans might eat many substitute foods or wear ersatz clothes but they did eat.</p>

<p><strong>What Adolf Hitler &amp; Co. did to the German people in that time left civilized men and women aghast. Civil rights and liberties have disappeared. Opposition to the Nazi regime has become tantamount to suicide or worse. Free speech and free assembly are anachronisms. The reputations of the once-vaunted German centres of learning have vanished. Education has been reduced to a National Socialist catechism.</strong></p>

<p>Pace Quickened. Germany&#39;s 700,000 Jews have been tortured physically, robbed of homes and properties, denied a chance to earn a living, chased off the streets. Now they are being held for &quot;ransom,&quot; a gangster trick through the ages. But not only Jews have suffered. Out of Germany has come a steady, ever- swelling stream of refugees, Jews and Gentiles, liberals and conservatives, Catholics as well as Protestants, who could stand Naziism no longer. TIME&#39;s cover, showing Organist Adolf Hitler playing his hymn of hate in a desecrated cathedral while victims dangle on a St. Catherine&#39;s wheel and the Nazi hierarchy looks on, was drawn by Baron Rudolph Charles von Ripper, a Catholic who found Germany intolerable.</p>
