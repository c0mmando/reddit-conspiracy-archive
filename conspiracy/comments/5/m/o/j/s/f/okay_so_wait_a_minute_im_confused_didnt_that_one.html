       He said
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZQxYQ49p0U">
        here
       </a>
       that he was scared shitless, got death threats from Alefantis over having put up
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7PcSf4Tj8o">
        this "Kill Room" video
       </a>
       , promised he would delete it, and just wants to be left alone now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Uh...so why is that video not only still up...but apparently got
       <em>
        re
       </em>
       -uploaded?
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally - it actually does appear that it WAS Alefantis that he had a conversation with and not someone posing as Alefantis and trolling the user.  The user posted
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqMMm52CWxE">
        this video
       </a>
       , and it does appear to lend credence to the fact that he was in fact communicating with Alefantis himself via facebook.  He doesn't have the phone conversation he said he had with him, of course, but it does seem he communicated w/him via fb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sooo....It appears he did communicate w/Alefantis himself...so if Alefantis
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       in fact threaten his life and said he'll kill him and his family, mom, girlfriend, etc, etc unless he takes the "Kill Room" video down like the user said he did - and proceeded to send the user pictures of him and his mother, him and his girlfriend, etc, etc...and that user said he was genuinely scared shitless over this now (which I'd understand) then why the fuck did he then repost the video itself that he said he got his and his family's life seriously threatened over?  Why does he still have it up?
      </p>
      <p>
       What am I not getting here?

       You're saying this because at the end of one of his videos, he says "And oh yeah.  Buy some pizzagategear t-shirts." with a shit eating grin on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah - it's a bit of an opportunist kind of sheist move, but as has been already mentioned on here by others, what he said in the video and the fear he seemed to definitely show in it didn't look like any sort of ploy to "sell pizzagategear t-shirts!"  That didn't seem like someone trying to spin some sale pitch ploy or gimmick to generate t-shirt sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       This dynamic seems a bit deeper and more multifaceted to me than "dude simply making shit up so he can sell more t-shirts", so jumping to that conclusion simply because he's plugging his product - sheisty and opportunistic as I acknowledge that seems to me - is something that can also be contextualized from the "people are always trying to make a buck" rationale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems stupid on one level for him to have done that, but well...this IS the shit planet that we live on and we
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       still debt slaves that have to still make $ in order to live here - so yeah.  I don't see being scared, yet still trying to throw a quick plug in at the end to try to make some money as being
       <em>
        entirely
       </em>
       inconsistent within the context of this completely fucked up, totally backward world we already live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of all this, part of what I mentioned above in the OP is that the dude actually seems to show proof that he
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       in fact communicate with Alefantis himself at least via facebook - so that actually lends quite a bit of weight to his not making all this up.  It appears that he DID talk w/Alefantis, so the "he's just lying to try to sell t-shirts" angle doesn't really hold up to that data right there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm open to the possibility that the dude is in fact just being NOTHING but an opportunistic, sheisty liar and he is in fact making the entire thing up, but I'm not convinced that he is, and a quick, 10 second plug to a product he's trying to make money with at the end of a video where for 10 minutes he seems to be genuinely scared and is telling people to NOT go to Alefantis' place and STOP investigating pizzagate doesn’t seem to be enough to me to conclude he’s just making it all up at this point - again,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       when he seems to show proof that he did in fact communicate with Alefantis via facebook.

       I think the t-shirt thing is the easy target they want you to go for.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real agenda is don't mess with Alfentis, he'll threaten you personally. They want scare as many people off as they can from looking into him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they keep pushing the video of Alfentis threatening they guy, under the guise of the guy selling shirts, you'll have been exposed to the idea you shouldn't trifle with Alfentis. It's quite clever actually.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That’s actually part of the very point I’m trying to make though.  This kind of goes against what you were stating above because this shows that Alefantis DID threaten the dude, no?  If the real agenda, as you said, is “don’t mess w/Alefantis”, then that gets shown by this video actually being
       <em>
        true
       </em>
       …and not by being any sort of ploy to sell t-shirts.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But then that would mean that the dude who made the video is either in on it (which I’m
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       not sure about)…or Alefantis
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       indeed threaten him to the extent that the dude claims - in which case the “don’t mess with Alefantis” angle certainly doesn’t keep someone like
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       and I feel quite a few other people from continuing to investigate pizzagate.  Heck, it gives many of us even
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       incentive to continue investigating because, if what this dude said is true, then Alefantis IS in fact in to some possibly EXTREMELY criminal shit…and that should
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       by any means just be ignored.  It needs to get found out, exposed, and rooted out.

       Something aint right about this. 50% of me wants to say it's trolling on that dude's part, but than 50% knows fabricating such things could get you locked up. That's a heavy crime (fabrication of evidence, false reporting, etc etc).

       Anything can be edit via the developer console to make it look like someone said something. All it takes is minimal HTML knowledge, and the way FB works, you could edit the HTML on the chat box and load it then reload and it would still be there. Kind of hard to explain, but I'm a web developer and this is what I do to keep me and the pups fed (professional web coding and design, not fraud - lol).

       I'm saying I'm leaning towards what you are thinking, but is someone desperate enough to damn near commit 3 crimes (possibly felonies) in order to sell some t-shirts? I mean, it wouldn't surprise me, desperate people do desperate things... But holy hell. Then again those punks video taped themselves torturing a man and live streamed it.... IDK anymore, truly... We live in a topsy-turvy world. The moment I heard him speak about his website and "gear" immedietly flew up red flags (I'm a web entrepreneur and know the mindset - but this? Fuckin' hell).

       Okay it's all good and well to say that...but to
       <em>
        what end?
       </em>
       Like...making a video exposing Alefantis' "Kill Room" is cointelpro for
       <em>
        what?
       </em>
       I'm willing to entertain that possibility, as this guy might somehow very well be "in on it"...but somebody's gotta ELI5 and spell it out for me how he's cointelpro because I'm simply not getting the motivation or angle on it...
      </p>
      <p>
       And no.  "To sell more t-shirts" doesn't seem to be a sufficiently logical reason to explain the cointelpro angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if selling more t-shirts IS his ultimate motivation...that wouldn't be cointelpro anyway.  That would just be some dude REALLY going above and beyond the call of lying to sell some t-shirts...which wouldn't make sense since, as
       <a href="/u/Putin_loves_cats">
        /u/Putin_loves_cats
       </a>
       mentioned, he's breaking a few crimes to do it, so it simply wouldn't be worth attempting to sell his t-shirts that way.  At all.

       The general purpose of COINTELPRO operations is to
       <strong>
        debase and discredit
       </strong>
       a movement or idea by associating it with people who have poor character, are crazy, make weak connections, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So with this pg8 guy: he is selling t-shirts, and creating videos that are (purposefully?) flimsy at best, claiming to have made contact with people but has no real proof. All of these little things discredit this guy to a real skeptic, and in turn discredit the ideas the agent is associated with. The result is that this skeptic associates the COINTELPRO agent with the idea (pg8).  Once an "authority" on a certain subject or idea (i.e. pg8) is established, this person can mix in truth with the other bullshit. Now all this person's ideas as a whole are discredited.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the goal is to get people to think, "Yeah I watched a couple of videos on pizza gate, all the people who talk about it are crazy. I watched one video where a guy claimed to make a phone call with the perpetrator, but couldn't make a recording even with another person in the room who could have helped."
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it must be noted that I don't have any real evidence against this guy (ironic I know), but based on what I've read about COINTELPRO I wouldn't be surprised if this were the case.

       So then that person isn’t “a real skeptic”.  They’re just someone who doesn’t have very good critical thinking skills since they’re associating one instance of something with the entire group - not the most intelligent thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see what you’re getting at though.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe the video maker is simply “in on it” for real, and, like you said, he’s been put in place to attempt to discredit those who are trying to look into pg8 by
       <em>
        posing
       </em>
       as a legitimate investigator when he’s really just cointelpro.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay.  Fair enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the explanation of how this guy
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be cointelpro.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, I’m tentatively siding with the guy not being cointelpro since there is simply so much damning circumstantial evidence against Alefantis himself as it stands.  I would sooner give credence to the idea that Alefantis is threatening someone for making and possibly exposing the “Kill Room” video than that the video-maker is part of some elaborate plot to somehow get the trail off of Alefantis by making an even
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       damning video about him.

       Either way we are both splitting hairs. The goal of my comment was to give a short explanation of COINTELPRO. Not establish any accusations. Glad we can have a good conversation.

       And for this reason, I think it should rarely if ever be looked upon as any badge of honor to be called a “skeptic”.  Not saying you’re doing this, but many others most definitely look upon the term in this mistaken manner.

       I agree with you but I'm just wondering why he didn't file a report with the DC pd? considering alefantis was in DC when he supposedly made the threat. Can his local pd even do anything to someone out of state?

       It's not legal advice just a discussion. But since they have no jurisdiction then no actual charge was made only a report filed that an incident occurred (incident report) So other than being sued for defamation(which he even mentioned was very expensive in the video) what legal repercussions could he face?

       From my understanding, nothing for the accused, but the accuser could sue for defamation. The accuser would have to provide evidence up to the chain of command. If they are in different states, the accused has an advantage. Like I said, I'm not a lawyer and could be way off base. Just going off lay men's understand. Would love for a lawyer to chime in...

       Okay.  So maybe he didn't create the James Alefantis facebook page.  That seems possible then.
      </p>
      <p>
       To what end though?  To sell some t-shirts?  Really?
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay.  Maybe.  If that's what this all ends up being, then okay.  Crazier things have happened.  However, thus far, that conclusion doesn't seem to jive as much as some other ones that seem to be out there right now.

       The t-shirts is too obvious it's a red herring.

       Yeah... you could have a friend change their picture/name to match Alfie's and have the conversation with you... then alter the code in chrome to point to Alf's real FB page when you click on it... It's easy...

       I'm not the guy, but I certainly wouldn't risk getting locked up for any of these things.  Is there any other video this guy has that would give anyone any indication that he is this duplicitous?

       Maybe he's a charlatan troll of the highest order.  I don't know.  Based on videos I linked in the OP alone, however, I'm not currently leaning toward the "obvious troll hoaxer" conclusion.

       Your need for confirmation of your beliefs may be providing a massive bias. He has made videos that show something anyone can fak. He has claimed to his videos down due to threats, yet pu tup videos that detail the threats? He was unable to record any conversations or show anything that you can't fake using just a web browser.

       I don’t seek attention.  I have no followers.  I don’t do things for “clickthroughs”.  I have made exactly no money off anything I’ve done on the internet.  Hell, I’ve
       <em>
        lost
       </em>
       money.

      <p>
       The only agenda I have on the internet is to A) learn as much as I can about myself and the world, and B) kill time when I’m bored.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, and in my case, the answer to your questions isn’t “all of the above”.  The answer in my case is actually
       <em>
        ”none
       </em>
       of the above”.

       Is he really getting rammed down your throat though?  I mean maybe he is.  I’m not saying he’s not, but I wasn’t aware of any massive traction he’s gotten where everyone on the internet now knows about him.  Maybe I’m just not all the aware, however.  Definitely possible.

       There is no real passion here concerning pizzagate anymore... I was here when it was at a fevered pitch... then 90% of that shifted over to
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate

      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is a dead horse over here lately... compared to how it used it be at least... at this point we are over 3 months in... I love new revelations in the human trafficking scene... but piling more evidence on Alefantis at this point is meaningless... It's like a parking ticket for Jeffrey Dahmer.

        piling more evidence on Alefantis at this point is meaningless... It's like a parking ticket for Jeffrey Dahmer.

       Had to lol over that...in a morbid way...

      <p>
       Yeah.  The point you're making - purposefully or not - is that there is most definitely enough evidence to at least being an official, formal investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "official investigators", however, are empowered, payed, and employed by the very figures they would be investigating.  That makes getting to the bottom of things...difficult (understatement).

       The more one looks at this world, the more one discovers that it is controlled by an element that appears to be globally powerful, and globally evil.

       Do you use Google Chrome? Just right click and pick Inspect... from there you can search to find what you want to replace with something else... it's easy.

       I don't know, it could be fake. It just seems all too elaborate, which is why I'm still on the fence. Maybe he caught Alefantis drunk, or on a coke binge or something. Something where he wasn't thinking straight. People slip up, when the microscope is on someone 24/7 they are bound to make mistakes here and there. Not saying I'm completely convinced, but it's totally possible.

       Alefantis got really coked up and somehow elite hacked this guy's real  name, family info and private photos... but at the same time he's too coked up to understand simple things like how youtube or a message board work. Makes total sense... Please be sure to visit

       Well the dude in the video was all like... "OMG! He has pictures of my family! I'm a dead man!" you'd think a real deep digging pizzagate guy would set his shit to private... or not use his real profile for provoking nefarious internet celebrities... just too much tomfoolery to believe the whole entire narrative...  then you throw the tshirt business on top of it all and it kinda collapses.

       You'd think people would know not to open PDF files on their computer if they didn't actually create them, but you've linked them to me before asking me to open them. It seems as if everyone's knowledge and level of online security is different.

       Yeah if you are scared of a PDF housed on an American .gov address you might as well just kill yourself now because the CIA already knows what you are thinking due to the microchip in your tooth... and they will fry your brain with a satellite for being scared of a PDF.

       If you're only response to a valid concern about online security is to be condescending, it shows your lack of actual level of knowledge of online security, or your carelessness of it if you do know it. It also shows your lack of ability to hold a conversation, or your attempt of psychological manipulation to try to show intellectual dominance when there isn't any.

       Even if I did trust the government to release a document free of spyware/malware/trojans when it could contain them without my knowledge, it doesn't mean that the file couldn't be hacked/compromised by someone else. Websites get hacked all the time and "legit" files get replaced with nefarious files. If you don't think government websites get hacked, just google it. People that share files with knowledge of this possibility also share the file's hash number, on the website, as an extra layer of security, but even that's not 100% safe.

       I believe the pizza shirt seller is doing all the right things. He should be making money and he should be investigating pizzagate for the good of mankind. Anyone who says he's a criminal mastermind who only cares about his measly t-shirt profits to get some groceries for his family is really stretching judgment on him by demonizing him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let the man make his money and his contributions to society are very helpful. He uploaded everything from the police report to the cops business card with phone number on it to show he is being up front about everything. The problem is that some people are very distrustful of anyone outside of themselves since they think they are the only good one left and everyone else has evil intentions. If everyone felt this way, who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. Surprise. Everyone thinks they are the good guy in the story.

       Not according to Alefantis if dude’s telling the truth about getting his life threatened - which I feel he is.

        He uploaded everything from the police report to the cops business card with phone number on it to show he is being up front about everything. The problem is that some people are very distrustful of anyone outside of themselves since they think they are the only good one left and everyone else has evil intentions. If everyone felt this way, who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. Surprise. Everyone thinks they are the good guy in the story.

       He even uploaded a video showing the call log on his phone today, then took it down. It showed James' phone number on the call log. He took it down soon after, not sure why. I should have downloaded it.

       How is the dude in on it when he's exposing things that weren't publicly available before and that other people might not have even realized?

       And...in on

       exactly?  What's he in on?  What's the angle on your thinking that he's in on it?  If he's in on it, then it would seem he's trying to

       Alefantis' wrong doings, right?  I mean that's what being "in" on something means, right? - i.e. trying to protect it?

      <p>
       So if he's "in" on trying to hide Alefantis' wrong doings...then how is his exposing Alefantis' "Kill Room" helping Alefantis exactly or hiding anything about him?

       You're saying that because Alefantis said "Stop or I'll kill you and your family!" that it's going to scare all the thousands of internet sleuths from continuing to dig up all the information they can from the safety of their homes and keyboards?

       Applying Occam's Razor in the manner that you mention here doesn't work when the word in question is used in as absolutely out of context a manner as it is in the pizzagate case.  Occam's Razor has to be applied to the entire context under which the word in question is being used - and as has been noted by everyone who's looked into this, the use of the words pizza, handkerchief, map, etc, are
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       out of any type of context under which those words would otherwise normally be used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Applying Occam's Razor in this particular case, as a matter of fact, actually underscores just how anomalous this pizzagate case is
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       it illustrates just how out of place the words being used are.

       You make the mistake of confusing a simple ability to respond with being "really invested".
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if pizza means what you just interpreted above, the criminality of the action is no less punishable - so a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of people should absolutely
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       be investigated and possibly put in prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's not even talk about what would happen if "pizza" stands for what it's more often being interpreted as.  And there is a lot more circumstantial evidence pointing to "pizza" meaning pedophilia than cocaine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of what exactly it means, however, the fact of the matter is that you just finished going back on your original attempt to apply Occam's Razor to this case (that "pizza is just pizza") because you here just admitted that "pizza" is most definitely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       referring to just "pizza".

       Oh I wholeheartedly agree that something sketchy is going on... but anything related to Alefantis is totally irrelevant unless it is using him to link further in the ring... everyone is focused on such a tiny portion of the picture... Alefantis' boat is sunk... it sank long ago... but piling more evidence on it now isn't gonna make him go to jail any quicker...

       But it would seem that a great deal of what is going on directly involves Alefantis, so continuing with anything related to him
       <em>
        wouldn’t

       be totally irrelevant in that sense.

      <p>
       Perhaps part of the reason why focus on Alefantis continues is because A) he’s the biggest red flag that’s been uncovered thus far, B) none of the other snakes have been uncovered yet, and C) he may very well be hiding a lot of the other snakes, so continuing on him might ultimately reveal the others.

       I’m not sure the FBI should be trusted w/anything really.  That said, I do hope you’re right and something gets done…and if they are going to do something, it would make sense to wait until after inauguration.

       I figured you would be a voat reader... they have already connected Alefantis to a ton of other people... but they are private citizens in a lot of cases so it is frowned upon chatting about them here cause it is awfully doxxy.

      <p>
       Trust me... I know the FBI... if you don't know about "Operation Cross Country" then you haven't been paying close enough attention... too busy picking the bones of James Alefantis I guess... but the FBI along with a nice chunk of the DOJ are gonna move on all the bigger fish real soon... but not too soon... gotta be patient... but that time is better spent looking past one specific pizza place... Alefantis is done for... his case is terminal... there are other weasels out there just hoping not to get implicated though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get to voat if you are really interested in the pizzagate stuff... they really cast a wide net there... they go after the guys we cant go after on this sub.

       I’m on Voat every now and then, but not super often, honestly.  That they’ve connected Alefantis to others already is very interesting information actually.

       The good guys have been organizing behind everyone's backs... sure there are bad guys in every arm of the government... but they never thought the good guys would ever be able to make a move on them...  but those good guys have been very careful and meticulous... cause they are the real defenders of justice...

       He did take it down for a while. Then decided to put it back up after he made the threat video. Honestly, if he was truly threatened, getting as much info on his channel about the threat, including the video that caused the threat, is the best idea. Create a public record.

       Do you seriously think that somebody who is so determined to prove that pizzagate is a crime would waste/blow two opportunities to provide the first hard evidence of a crime actually being committed by Alefantis (death threats)?

       It's definitely a possibility.  That seems certain.  I just wouldn't be as quick to rush to conclusions as you seem to be since there is so much circumstantial evidence against Alefantis showing that he might indeed be involved in some extremely criminal activity.

       That's fair.  So maybe the guy is full of it.  Again, I'm not sure one way or the other, and that's why I made this OP - to try to get a better understanding of things.  I'm just not assuming he actually
       <em>
        is

       f.o.s. yet.  I'd like to see what else turns up in terms of whatever other videos he uploads or other communications he might have.

       Okay.  Fair.  However, it seems that he re-uploaded it himself to his youtube channel.  That's a bit different than finding that the video you uploaded is still up because someone else mirrored it independent of your actions.

       Oh... I just use a typewriter plugged into a CRT TV so that I can avoid all those nefarious files that hackers put on the FBI website... My OS is an AOL CD and a turntable. Now that is safe surfing! No Russians influencing my erections! I only masterbate to vintage Playboys now.

       It's unbelievable easy to change chat to appear as you want it to using inspect element:

       Do you seriously think that somebody who is so determined to prove that pizzagate is a crime would waste/blow two opportunities to provide the first hard evidence of a crime actually being committed by Alefantis (death threats)?

       The guy is a scam artist.

       That's fair.  So maybe the guy is full of it.  Again, I'm not sure one way or the other, and that's why I made this OP - to try to get a better understanding of things.  I'm just not assuming he actually
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       f.o.s. yet.  I'd like to see what else turns up in terms of whatever other videos he uploads or other communications he might have.
