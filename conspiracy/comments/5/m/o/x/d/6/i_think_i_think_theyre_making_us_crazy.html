        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think... I think their making us crazy on purpose.</p>

<p>Bare with me. I have been through this before. Once in my youth (5th grade), I was attending an isolated school, all poor white trash kids (Must be specific), and not only were the teachers literally making derogatory comments to the students, but were enjoying the torture, and torment of the minority students ( We at that time, had about 4 black kids, 5 Hispanics, 3 mixed kid&#39;s, and 3 Asians), and I watched them be unfair, hateful, and sabotage the psyche of these kids. It was brutal, and disgusting, and I&#39;m not shocked that many of them did not make it( 2 of the Asian kids became drug addicts, 2 of the black kids went to jail, and the rest I haven&#39;t heard of, oh, and 3 kid&#39;s died of an overdose). </p>

<p>They also gave the kids with two teeth in their mouths, that wreaked of clothes drenched in Urine, but dried out in the sun, the freedom to be racist. I heard the words, &quot;Nigger&quot;, &quot;Jap&quot;, &quot;Beaner&quot;, &quot;Kike&quot;, and the illustrious joke of, &quot;What&#39;s the difference between a Jew, and a Pizza?, A Pizza doesn&#39;t scream in the oven&quot;, told to a girl I went to school with. This was commonplace (with fat jokes, and cussing) for this shithole elementary school I went to. It destroyed my psyche, since I wasn&#39;t even supposed to be there.</p>

<p>My family lived about 10-15 miles from the school, and we were only sent there since our neighborhood had just been developed, and they had to get stipend for the students, and they made a deal within my area (I live in a gray area, neighboring 3 cities, so they fought to get certain people into their schools), unfortunately I had to go to this school. Half in the kid&#39;s in my neighborhood got to go the other school, that was nice, educated, better socio-economic status, but I had to go to school with these ghouls.
I will never forget being in 5th grade, and our friend Jamie (Asian Kid), had a nervous breakdown in front of us, and lamented and yelled that, &quot;I wish I was white! I know if I was white, I wouldn&#39;t be treated like this&quot;, as he collapsed in a heap crying... it was messed up, and brutal. The truly insane part is these people that made his life a living hell, as well as mine and others tried to be my friend in High school, forgetting, or pretending to not remember calling me a million names, treating me like trash, and making my life hell. It&#39;s a mental issue, I must assume. I even had one of them when I was in high school lament to me, &quot;Yeah right, FakeJamesWestbrook, you have to be my friend.. who else would have you&quot;? To which I replied, &quot;We&#39;ll see&quot;, and I never spoke to this person after that, but come to find out, it&#39;s been about a decade since I&#39;ve seen this trash, and I hear they still ask about me, wonder about me, and these people tried to get me locked up, or destroyed, since &quot;Their town decided I was worthless&quot;, and they had to make it true... insane really.</p>

<p>I look back at that time, and I ponder it, and I&#39;ve realized, &quot;They&#39;re trying to make you crazy&quot;, so you can&#39;t function, so you cannot think, so you can&#39;t compete. In this area I grew up in, I recall all my friends hated their sibling. Every single family did.  They hated their brother&#39;s and tormented him (not jokes, but real brutal stuff, like actual beatings, torture). I recall back when I was 10 years old, and this kid (Didn&#39;t like the little shit), named Tom, and his older brother Jim(Jim was about 4 years older than him), and they were arguing, and all of us kid&#39;s were there. Jim took his little brother Tom, and literally fireman tossed him down into this ditch, that was about 8 ft down, and covered in &quot;Sticker bushes&quot; (The sharp thorns of BlackBerry  bushes, in fall and winter, that are sharp as hell, and cut your skin up, and itch like crazy, blood is always drawn. If you&#39;re raised in the woods, you know what I&#39;m talking about), to hear his yelp and scream, still haunts me. Then he didn&#39;t even help him out, we had to try and get him with a rope, as all the older kid&#39;s just watched. My own older brother was a tool, and twisted my ankle, nearly breaking it, and breaking it was his goal..(He changed since he left that area). It was kind of insane.</p>

<p>It must have been the area, or the populace, but this was a middle-upper middle class area, with some poor area&#39;s around. I realized that it was all a plan, to make us all crazy, and bitter, while the elites teach &quot;family values&quot;, and loyalty like, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, and the rest of us, back bite, and fight, and betray our friends for things that we&#39;re taught matter, that do not, and never will. </p>

<p>Do you agree? Do you understand? I can see all the line&#39;s now, and how we&#39;re raised in America... the Media, the Television, the lack of ethics, and morals put out there... they&#39;re making us crazy on purpose. The United States lately feels like a trap, so you can get into prison, and they can own you. Just my thoughts, anyone else see this? I&#39;ve noticed as much as Americans are &quot;bitching&quot; about illegal immigrants and all that, they&#39;ll still help an &quot;illegal immigrant&quot;, or an &quot;immigrant&quot; before they help out a fellow American... somehow fooled that, the skin color of the immigrant (if he&#39;s from Ireland, or the UK), mean&#39;s more than someone born and raised in the United States... this will be our downfall... Do you really think that, Russia, UK, Korea, China, Nigeria, other countries really want us to prosper and stay on top? Are you that dense? But you trust them, over fellow Americans... just shows how crazy they&#39;ve made us.. have people here cheering for &quot;Putin&quot;..insane... just my thoughts.</p>

<p>Also, I was a, &quot;90&#39;s kid&quot; (born in 1986)... just my thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep going. You&#39;re getting there. Read studies about why children are separated into grades in school and encouraged to only associate with one&#39;s own grade. Pep rallies and sports rivalries feed into the same bloodthirsty culture (grew up in Texas, so it&#39;s practically a religion). There are lots of ways to separate people.

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point. I recall being raised in my neighborhood, and I had friends a few grades younger (like 2 grades), and a few grades older. I recall all of a sudden I get into Jr. High, I wasn&#39;t &quot;Allowed&quot; to be friends with my neighbor anymore. It was like, &quot;You talk to John? he&#39;s in 5th grade!&quot;, and I&#39;m sitting here like, &quot;Yeah, but we played little league together last year on the same team, and I&#39;ve lived next to him, and got baby sat by him, since I was 5 and he was 3..., like wtf?&quot;, and I always fought against that. I stayed loyal to all those kids I grew up with, though in high school I became a football jock, and they were all assorted other things. I stayed true.. everyone else, I felt bought in, and severed ties, they&#39;d kill to have now in our older ages..</p>

You lost me at the &#39;immigrant&#39; bit.  I just don&#39;t understand it.  We are supposed to be divided into tribes? We should feel more for people because we grew up watching similar television?
The whole idea that we be pitted against each other by people we&#39;ve never met...?
Maybe that&#39;s the reality, but Im not going to play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man.</p>

<p>I think my point wasn&#39;t the whole &quot;immigrant&quot; issue, my point is that I&#39;ve noticed we view other Americans (same race, and others), as competition, even though you were raised with them. You don&#39;t trust them, same elementary, high school, some college, but you don&#39;t trust them. Usually trust is earned over time, but within us, we don&#39;t do that. The longer we&#39;ve known other Americans, the longer we dislike them, or they betray us, for some trivial thing, or that other trivial thing. But, when we meet an &quot;immigrant&quot;, we don&#39;t feel threatened, or the need to &quot;compete&quot; with them, so we&#39;ll &quot;help them out&quot;, since we don&#39;t feel it&#39;s going to hurt or affect us, though since we don&#39;t know them, their loyalty is most likely to their host country, until they&#39;re here enough years to be assimilated into &quot;American mindframe&quot; which many never do, but their kid&#39;s may... it&#39;s something I&#39;ve seen forever. Hence why I created my own rules, and ethics, and edicts for dealing with people and friends. I have them conform to my new &quot;Roman ideology&quot; before I deal with them, and since doing this, I have friends that will feed me, clothe me, and want the best for me... which most Americans don&#39;t have... were taught to be in competition, and hate our own siblings and trust the government and the banks... I had a theory it&#39;s like that, since they make us &quot;hate our siblings&quot; by the media, and how were socialized in schools... just my thoughts, also thanks man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. Sorry for misinterpreting that and thank you for clarifying.  That&#39;s a really interesting thought and I can agree with it.</p>

<p>From experience , limited as it may be, I don&#39;t worry about immigrants in that respect. They&#39;re guests, not competition.</p>

<p>But I have been taught, and do feel sometimes, that for people of my nationality, there are only limited spots.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll have to put some thought into that. Thank you for giving me something to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to public schools and private schools and public schools are definitely terrifying in that people desperately need help who aren&#39;t getting it. In private school there is still bullying and posturing but at least everyone has some sort of tool set to survive.</p>

<p>It seems like that&#39;s the biggest issue in a resource based economy. When people don&#39;t even have the mental faculties to educate themselves or be healthy they are going to be exploited by the upper class.</p>

<p>My best friend had an older brother that literally almost killed him several times and tortured him physically and mentally in between. From what I know my other friends hated their siblings as well. There was a lot on tension in general. Families that weeny in welfare had parents that worked two jobs. I myself was a bit of a latchkey kid. </p>

<p>Surprisingly the school did have a program for the handful of students that were actually interested in learning (aka nerds) but those of us in it were treated like freaks by the rest of the kids and even the teachers.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it was all a <em>plan</em> to tear apart families, it was just the rural norm in the Reagan 80s as working class towns fell apart</p>

Was it because I called out the hypocrisy of southern religious life, or their religious devotion to sports? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>...so you can kind of see where the older generations are coming from, or, where they <em>came</em> from. True stories: </p>

<p>We moved from town to the country, where we had ride a school bus. First day, my grade-school azz was overjoyed that there&#39;s an empty seat up front. As a matter of fact: Several seats, all on the same side. The other side is full of kids that I only later realize are all white. They erupt in laughter. &quot;She thinks she&#39;s an en! Kid&#39;s an en!&quot; Come to find out, the kindly Cajun bus driver thought it would <em>reduce incidents</em> if he segregated us, back when desegregation was new and Texas was, in fact, a few years late in fully adopting it.</p>

<p>Fast forward to third grade, when rural Texas was <em>finally</em> forced to fully desegregate. <em>ALL</em> of the little white girls are in one classroom. <em>ALL</em> of the white boys and <em>ALL</em> the African-Americans (boys and girls) are in another classroom. By virtue of my unusual first name which no one can pronounce, I&#39;m thrown in with the boys and blacks. My little white friend girls come looking for me; a terrible mistake has been made; they intercede on my behalf, I&#39;m switched to the white-girls room.</p>

<p>Next year, after the classrooms are ipso factso desegregated, a little black girl writes on the chalkboard near her desk. It starts with &quot;Lordy-lordy...&quot; Our Southern Anglo female teacher <em>completely loses her ish</em> for about an hour over the fact that the Lord&#39;s name was taken in vain. Forget culture, forget intent, forget a little girl&#39;s feelings... The.Lord&#39;s.Name.</p>

<p>This stuff sort of shapes who we become. And we all pretty much become Pharaohs, and their support team(s), or Slaves, and theirs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lead poisoning and violent behaviours go hand-in-hand. This isn&#39;t an accident, it was by design.</p>

<p>Childhood lead exposure (lead in the bones) and violence link:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.precaution.org/lib/covanta_41.pdf">http://www.precaution.org/lib/covanta_41.pdf</a></p>

<p>Inner city kids, exposed to lead through car exhausts in the 70s and 80s and affordable housing paints containing lead are the main victims of this and went on to become the perpetrators of violent crimes in the 90s.</p>

<p>Most of the kids that you mention weren&#39;t crazy, they were poisoned. Although I guess you could say they were both poisoned <em>and</em> made crazy as the cherry on top.</p>
