<p>This can be taken one of two ways:
1) They are in on it.
2) They aren&#39;t fully capable of providing security, and the promises they make shouldn&#39;t be trusted, e.g. Russian hacking and their ability to vet refugees.</p>

<p>OP&#39;S conclusion is based on the premise that the FBI claims it can prevent all terrorist attacks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>they also have a list of dozens of training compounds active in the united states and refuse to do anything about it. I live near 2 in texas. a buddy of mine works at a gunshop where they tried ordering 10 AKs/ body armor/ ammo. They were reported to the FBI but the compounds are still there a year after the fact. </p>

<p>They&#39;re in on it OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Washington post is BS. Just look who owns them. Also try to realize the difference between local stories and national stories. Locals usually get the best information and by the time it hits national it&#39;s so watered down its not even funny.</p>

<p>2) I&#39;ve seen the one in sweeny.  I&#39;m a vet, not a a bias idiot. after my buddy&#39;s story I went looking for myself. 10-15 men, all fighting age. ZERO women and children. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fine though, you can continue to act like we don&#39;t have a problem. </p>

<p>Move along, nothing to see here, sheep.</p>
