        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have noticed this again and again, especially since the most recent election. It&#39;s like you&#39;re not allowed to see the gray area.</p>

<p>When everyone is pushed to extremes by this mechanism, society becomes this dichotomy that is easy to control. If everyone is forced in to one of two categories by the mechanisms of public shame, with no grey area allowed in between, then the owners of our country can predict easily what the two sides will do. It makes the two sides have more power than the middle just by sheer population, which means conflict is inevitable between the two sides, and thus the country. </p>

<p>The worse the economy gets, the more people become emotional for answers, and the more these two extremes become prevalent. </p>

<p>The disallowing of the existence of centrist/moderate opinions, combined with the hard economic conditions, create the foundation for a civil war, or at the very least fractionalizing the society in a way that&#39;s consistent with divide and rule. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it more as the democrats moving to the center right pushing the republicans more and more to the right, shifting the Overton window to the right, and creating a backlash on the left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The left doesn&#39;t exist anymore (de facto, as in they don&#39;t have a voice) though as the Overton window moves to the right, that&#39;s the whole point. We&#39;ve got this unapologetic ultra-right, the moderate-right (who call themselves democrats and carry SJW moral values to convince themselves they&#39;re progressive) and then there&#39;s the <em>actual</em> left, which is almost completely ignored. As is the classical right, those conservatives who aren&#39;t on board with Neo-conservatism but are treated as not existing.</p>

<p>The true axis isn&#39;t left/right, it&#39;s orthogonal to that, it&#39;s authoritarian vs anti-authoritarian. The left-right is just a way to split up the anti-authoritarians in to two camps that hate each other. And then the authoritarians have a left and a right that compete and this is what the MSM puts the spotlight on, to give the appearance of competition, when in fact the whole thing is sold out to the authoritarian perspective on both sides. It seems more and more people are starting to put this together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I generally agree, but what do you think of the idea that you have the concept of &quot;centrism&quot; inverted? </p>

<p>Meaning, the majority of people stuck in partisan politics and the phony Rep vs Dem paradigm represent &quot;the radical center&quot; (I&#39;m stealing this phrase and political interpretation from someone, I can&#39;t remember who atm...I want to say Vijay Prashad, but I&#39;m probably wrong) all of whom are almost fanatically attached to Neoliberal economic/domestic policy and Neoconservative foreign policy, whether they realize it or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say <em>they</em> have the concept of centrism inverted. They&#39;ve skewed &quot;centrism&quot; to mean &quot;pro-authoritarian, but moderate on social issues&quot; when really it means something much more genuinely moderate. We&#39;re given two false options that create a false center. The real  center is something that would eventually destroy the existing authoritarian structure, which is why the media must pretend this viewpoint does not exist and why there is little political representation for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. I definitely agree with you that authoritarianism vs anti-authoritarian is a much more valid way to think about it than Left vs Right.

    <div class="md"><p>The atmosphere you&#39;re describing is of course entirely artificial; the American public has long been groomed for the binary, simplistic argument of &quot;Us v Them&quot;. The astroturfing committed by both sides of the spectrum has shown both how easily manipulated people are, and yet... </p>

<p>And yet, it shows how by playing such a massive, obvious hand, the many people who may have been goaded into supporting political affiliations and candidates this year are beginning to understand that all is not as it seems. Slowly but surely, I feel as though things are beginning to change. That we&#39;ve reached a turning point as not just an American population, but as a world population. </p>

<p>Information wants to be free, and increasingly more and more people are beginning to listen to that little bug in their ear, the itch they can&#39;t scratch, the voice in the back of their mind; the gut feeling and natural instinct that tell them all is not right in the world and <em>they are tired of it</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said, there is a cultivated/groomed &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality. But we must also acknowledge that it is taking advantage of a genetic brain structure and thus behavior we actually do have innately in our DNA, called tribalism. It used to be best for &quot;our&quot; tribe to succeed and fight against &quot;them&quot;, those other tribes. But now that we&#39;ve evolved to a global community, this attitude is no longer as useful. Or the &quot;them&quot; is not who we are told it is, and instead we have our natural protectionist urges turned against those that aren&#39;t actually hurting us, in order to better serve those that actually <em>are</em> hurting us. Like some kind of Stockholm Syndrome that we haven&#39;t been smart enough to see through yet. However as things get worse, more people are guaranteed to wake up because there&#39;s simply too much information available via the internet for those who look. </p>

I&#39;d imagine that an average Joe, should he decide to wake up and dig up some truth, faces an overwhelming arrays of data and just gives up, because it&#39;s too much to take. I doubt that most of us have time to actively research news articles that we are not sure about and the like. Plus all those issues you guys seem to have with Net neutrality that I keep reading about. Such massive arrays of information might be available soon enough with the way things are going.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree we are in a deluge of information that is hard to sift through and ends up confusing people and making them feel overwhelmed so they just retreat in to what they think they already know and set up emotional barriers and stay there.</p>

<p>The thing is that many people have become unable to differentiate between fluff information and real information. I&#39;m talking about real information, stuff that teaches you about how the world works in ways you didn&#39;t comprehend before. Information is not &quot;Russia hacked the election&quot;, that is over-simplified misinformation that is deliberately misleading. </p>

<p>I think there is a fear that we might lose the actual information and be surrounded by fluff, without most people even realizing the truth is no longer available. </p>

<p>But in reality, the internet is incredibly free. Even in China, millions of people use VPN and explore the internet outside what the government wants them to see, and they&#39;re one of the most repressive countries in the world in that regard. </p>

<p>Most people deep down want to know the truth, I think. And technology is just increasing the speed and availability of information, and while they&#39;ll try and control that and put caps on it, I don&#39;t think they can put the cat back in the bag. Even the fact we&#39;re having this conversation right now is amazing, and I don&#39;t see that ability disappearing completely. While it may not be on the front page of reddit like it used to be, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s impossible to find. So even when things go bad, there&#39;s plenty of good, real information available. It&#39;s just that people need to know to go looking for it, which means they need to realize the mainstream media culture is bullshit, and start ignoring it. Which is happening at lightning speed with how much they screwed up this last election. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no shortage of obstacles, but I am convinced things are moving in the right direction in the long-term. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The crowd is so incredibly easy to lead, if you can identify the right pressure points. So I don&#39;t think that people would en-masse commit to a search for truth. Most are satisfied as they are with their day-to-day lives, which they don&#39;t want to change in favour of truth. Most people, if presented with clear evidence would choose to ignore it, if those around them do not support this notion. We are desperate to fit in, and this is what causing such nuisance nowadays. People get stuck in echo-chambers and wall themselves off, reinforcing their beliefs with other like-minded people. This in turn creates people incapable of not only taking criticism, but also being unable to think critically at all. So my point is, if people deliberately ignore all the information that&#39;s out there, technology itself wouldn&#39;t really help, unless it is forced from above the food chain (I mean some smart tech-savvy president, or something like that). So I remain rather skeptical of the topic.</p>

<p>I also can&#39;t help but fear that truly important information becomes more and more scarce. Technology makes it possible to know what everybody eats for dinner, flooding the whole internet with useless junk that people consume. But the truth gets buried, and sometimes even altered without a clear trace. Can&#39;t help but think about 1984 by Orwell, so excuse my pessimism in this regard.</p>

<p>As for the rest, I sure hope you&#39;re right and I&#39;m wrong, great points all around</p>

<p>I agree.  Right now, at this very moment, 10 out of 25 entries on this sub&#39;s mainpage are explicitly against the left.  The rest are neutral.  0 are against the right.</p>

<p>The mods have facilitated the takeover of this sub by t_d and <a href="/r/altright">/r/altright</a> since before novemeber.  Let&#39;s not bring that fake equivalence bs when the facts are staring us right in the face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the genius things about this election is they made counter-culture mesh with the donald people, because they were both the only ones pointing out clinton&#39;s corruption. Then which when he was elected president, overnight those same counter-culture outlets are now pro-establishment outlets. It did a serious number on the alternative media, and this subreddit, as you pointed out. </p>

<p>I think you can get upvoted in this sub for pointing out the right&#39;s flaws if you do it in a good way, but it&#39;s much harder to make the frontpage on this sub with that content than it would&#39;ve been a year ago. </p>

<p>The sub shifted from an general anti-authoritarian perspective to more of a right-leaning bias, by conflating the two with that trick I mentioned earlier. You are not wrong about that. I&#39;m also thinking of Voat, Ben Garrison, and a few other outlets that somehow turned from anti-authoritarian to anti-left, which creates a space for the authoritarian right to speak through those outlets. </p>

<p>It&#39;s honestly been pretty scary to watch the media get torn apart over the last year. It&#39;s not all dead though, this sub has real moments of truth that you would never see on most of reddit. I long for a return to the anti-authoritarian perspective rather than the anti-left one we see moredays now. </p>

<p>Another example of this is <a href="/r/anarchism">/r/anarchism</a>, which I used to love but gradually became an anti-right subreddit after it was filled with SJWs and people started being banned for saying things about 3 years ago. Now it&#39;s anti-right and it&#39;s amazing how often pro-authoritarian views are voted right to the front because they agree with a leftist agenda. On <a href="/r/anarchism">/r/anarchism</a>. That&#39;s the same trick I mentioned earlier, but they conflated the anti-authoritarians with the anti-rights, thus giving the authoritarian left a space to spread their wings under the guise of being anti-authoritarian. </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite clever if you really think about it. Evil, but clever. </p>

<p>Agreed. This type of pushing is exactly how Soros and the CIA were able to initiate a civil war in the Ukraine just a couple years ago. They polarized the shit out of everyone using the media and the economy (with Russia likely doing the same thing), and it flowered in to a civil war that split the country in half, with US claiming the western side and Russia essentially claiming the eastern side. </p>

<p>We are definitely being pushed in to these corners, they&#39;re trying to make us fight each other. Probably so we don&#39;t fight the <em>actual</em> power structure. </p>

The people should do the same, how to go about that though...</p>

<p>I think the whole left-right paradigm is bunk, and we really need to focus on authoritarianism vs anti-authoritarianism. Because it&#39;s the accumulation of power and resources at the top that end up making things to bad, almost every time. Absolute power attracts corruption, regardless of if it&#39;s rightist or leftist. That&#39;s my 2 cents</p>

<p>I am okay with debating right wing people, conservative issues that i mostly dont support. Its interesting because some people I respect alot own guns and I totally understand that want for freedom and access to something useful as a gun, economics is always interesting... etc. But Trump and his followers are just a no no.

But yeah, american politics make it easy to put people into boxes because its just not in a very optimal state. I would like for there to be a trump like politician that bring the good and the hope that you see in him, but does not have all the narcissistic baggage. I would like there to be a different state of parties where one can respect the republicans and what they are going for instead of needing to dismiss them as annoying anti-liberals. </p>

It does not need to be an emotional thing. We never really know who people really are, not even in our family sometimes. Politics is alot about trust and trust can be abused.

<p>Yes, this is really the point I&#39;m trying to make. I guess I mean more &quot;truthist&quot; than &quot;centrist/moderate&quot; but that&#39;s not a word, haha. Ideally a moderate would be most in line with the truth, but I can see why that wouldn&#39;t always be the case now I guess.</p>

<p>I listened to Bill Burr podcast and he was mad about this same thing, getting called a partisan hack by both sides in different instances. I&#39;m really not attached to the words &quot;centrism&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot; in particular, I just didn&#39;t know how else to convey the idea really. I&#39;m more in line with the truth than anything else, I&#39;d like to think. I don&#39;t care too much for these labels, all of which basically have had a century of being soaked in propaganda and bias, which makes them hard to use cleanly. Point is, you clearly understand what I&#39;m getting at here, and the real problem is the media/society applying social pressure like shame to keep people from considering options that aren&#39;t extreme, but could work very very well if implemented. They only seem extreme from the perspective of this crazy system we&#39;ve got right now, but they&#39;re working fine and are considered perfectly moderate/centrist in other countries. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all kind of becoming semantics at this point, but I think we&#39;ve arrived at the actual idea. Whatever -ism you want to call this, I don&#39;t know what is most fitting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You don&#39;t exist and are fence-sitting and wrong.&quot; - US Media &amp; Politics</p>

<p>I&#39;d call you a sensible human being. It&#39;s by design there is no -ism that lets you feel comfortable. And if you made your own and it became popular, the media would smear it so much that many would only know it by the smear definition. This is all by design, and keeps happening over and over. I&#39;m pretty sick of people who abuse us having control of our messaging system that creates our cultural narratives, because they&#39;re constantly reshaping ideas to benefit the power structure and disempower those who want to do the opposite. It&#39;s honestly pretty disturbing how much they can jerk around the meanings of words and phrases for their benefit, and how much cultural penetration those false narratives have</p>

<p>Actually that comes down to individual choices rather than some divide of the sexes (ties in nicely with the OPs theme). A starting point for further reading <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-gender-pay-gap-is-a-complete-myth/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Our culture is so worried about being politically correct that instead of staying at the nice, equal balance we had after the civil rights era made such tremendous strides it&#39;s now turning the other way around, where men and white people are starting to be seen as enemies by a growing portion of the population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I am sure you are in favor of equal pay for equal work, and you probably would advocate fighting a little against potential disadvantages based on old patriarchial habits when they exist and are irrational.  </p>

<p>If you have stats taht show that the wage gap isnt real or if you have study results showing better performances by male bosses even in progressed company situations, then we can talk about those in detail.  </p>

<p>but the equal opportunity thing is probably something we can agree on, right? Then you probably arent a &quot;conservative&quot;, at least by the current american standard.

    <div class="md"><p>Lel. I am not american and not really a fan of any of the parties. In germany our mainstream parties which are way lefter than the american democratic one is too conservative for me still.  </p>

<p>I am aware that the often cited gender pay gap figure is not really accurate, but there still are issues in quite a few areas of economics, and I am just in favor of looking for solutions. A somewhat meaningful quota (25%) for women in leadership positions is a good example, as a temporary measure to get peoples heads out of their asses. Problem is just that its fighting sexism with sexism and we dont really know how much &quot;good&quot; it will effectively lead to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that this is a problem. The electorate was rabid for fresh extremes and very much over the moderate establishment. There must be a moderate middle way here that at least socially holds respect for the ideals of both sides-- I would argue that economics must also maintain some balance. I don&#39;t want any American to feel like they&#39;re getting totally hosed by psycho extremists from either side. A continuing issue I have (and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m partially biased in this, as we all are) is what I see as hatred of progressives and left-leaning ideals from the right&#39;s fringes, and certainly no respect for their existence as even plausible. My issues with conservatives, aside from the real right psychos in their midst, are things to be debated and discussed, and are quite tame. I understand the necessity for both ideological sides in this country but don&#39;t consider myself a moderate. I do strongly feel that they hate me far less than I hate them. But I guess that&#39;s what any distinct individual would claim. It&#39;s a tough one. </p>

<p>If anything, this election and political climate has shown just how necessary subsequent parties are here, and how little clout extant ones currently have in being taken seriously. I&#39;m not talking about extremist left or right ones, but practical ones. </p>

<p>This is super key, creating a community feel of acceptance toward differing opinions. However the MSM is trying its hardest to make sure people feel attacked from every side, and ignoring or silencing voices that try to bring people together and calm our fears. The media needs to be fixed before the culture will be humanistic again, currently it is very corporatist and anti-humanistic. </p>

<p>This is also why we have a 2-party FPTP system, instead of a many-party system. It is easier to control by those in power. </p>

<p>The reason I post on Conspiracy is because in the other subs my posts get deleted by the mods. This, along with a few other subreddits, are the only place I&#39;ve found on reddit that can tolerate my opinions these days, apparently. Which just goes back to the whole media corruption thing, because they&#39;re beginning to become good at controlling the internet as well. I also post here because this is literally the dictionary definition of a conspiracy, where people are colluding in back rooms on a grand scale to mislead literally hundreds of millions of people in to acting and thinking in ways that are against their own interest and empower the already-powerful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a pretty good reason for bringing up the concept on this board, thanks. What do you consider the MSM at this point? Are spots like breitbart or maybe dailykos now included? I say this because while divisive political opinion can dominate big media (certainly does now) in alternative more indie media it&#39;s even more extreme in forcing the reader to chose sides and totally disregard the notions of everything else. Such sites (again I blame the conspiracy-pumping right sites for this, and recently the left if you believe the Russian phishing/distributing/influence thing is actually real) have even less of a responsibility to be responsible in what they report and claim, not to mention being respectful of differing sets of beliefs, and are under far less critical scrutiny. </p>

<p>The biggest problems I see are the general politicizing of media in general, no longer content with social/moral judgments and spin, as well as the increasing politicizing of actual facts and reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I trust Salon as much as I trust Breitbart. Semi-alt semi-establishment.</p>

<p>US media is 95% owned in all forms (TV, movies, magazines, radio, etc) by just 6 companies. The 6 boards and CEOs of those companies, run those companies. So those 6 boards run 95% of US media. </p>

<p>I agree the spin and bias in the media is the problem. The reason this exists now whereas it didn&#39;t before is because of the 1993 telecommunications law which undid a lot of the checks on truth telling in the media, and the 2013 NDAA which legally allows propaganda. This was the final nail in the coffin. </p>

<p>Until those bills are undone or repealed or made no longer relevant (by the MSM becoming irrelevant in lieu of millions of microcultures) we will continue to find ourselves in an echochamber of ideologies that are designed to take advantage of us. It sucks that we&#39;re all being had for fools at our expense because our government is so corporate-owned, but it&#39;s just how it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just being a moderate. Talking to one side means you may be a secret supporter of them. People from one side reading what you write also means you must somehow be supporting them. /s People actually get crap for who follows them on twitter, not people they also follow and chat with, but just the people who follow them.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/mtracey/i-cannot-control-who-follows-me-on-twitter-db077552e973">https://medium.com/mtracey/i-cannot-control-who-follows-me-on-twitter-db077552e973</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s incredibly annoying to even have to write this post, but I keep getting the same line of attack over and over again, so it’s worth the 6 minutes or so that this will take. Please read this sentence very, very carefully: I cannot control what anonymous trolls do on Twitter. I have no ability nor desire to micro-manage the online activity of random people, who can claim to be anything or anyone. Some of them may follow me, some of them may not. I have no idea. I do not monitor this.</p>

<p>It’s amazing how frequently critics and interlocutors will cite my Twitter following as somehow discrediting evidence against me, as if it’s something I actively control or direct. I do not. It’s not surprising that some amount of Trump-supporting or “alt-right” oriented people have followed me as of late, given that I just spent a very long time criticizing the Clintons on a regular basis. This does not mean that I have any affinity with the “alt-right.” I do not. I denounce them, such as they exist. Trying to tie me to the “alt-right” by dint of their unsolicited interaction with my tweets is just incredibly sleazy and disingenuous.</p>

<p>If you wish to attack me, please cite something that I have actually done or said, rather than citing the online behavior of random people over whom I have absolutely no control. This “attack rationale” is becoming increasingly prevalent, and it’s pernicious. Its essence undergirded the “Bernie Bro” craze, which held that the candidate himself was somehow responsible for the trollish internet activity of people who purported to be his supporters, but whose identity could not be verified. How unbelievably stupid. Jeremy Corbyn has been made to deal with the same nonsensical claims. It’s a distraction spearheaded by cynical naysayers who have a pre-existing political grudge.</p>

<p>The only reason to resort to this attack is if you have no other tenable argument. I’m not going to go through and individually vet every one of my Twitter followers. Anyone who would expect me to do that is either a moron or a cynic. I welcome critique, but only of things that I’ve actually written, said, or done. All else is just tripe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think there&#39;s more reason for such attacks, namely sealing the edges of the echo chambers and pushing polarization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. It&#39;s like in a war, where you&#39;re seen fraternizing with the enemy. Except this isn&#39;t a war, it&#39;s just people&#39;s opinions, but the media and the destitute state of the economy has them convinced it&#39;s a war. So they see it as a fight of ideologies that battle for power, rather than logical thing about what actually makes sense and explains the situation properly. That&#39;s another frustrating thing, is it makes people give up on the search for truth, because they think they&#39;ve found the answer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope this seriously is a serious question and not some muh your rayciss non-sense. Being pro-White is not about hating anything. Nationalism is not hating the others, it&#39;s loving your own. Good example of this is your home. You keep your doors locked &#39;cos you want to keep your family safe because it&#39;s more important for you than other people in your city. But you don&#39;t hate other people. Do we hate Iranians in Iran or Somalis in Somalia? Of course not.  We care about our own race and want a bright future for us. If White is W and Other is O then W+W=W and O+O=O. But W+O is also O and if W+O is bigger than 1 eventually there is no W left. Could you just imagine, just try to imagine what amount of propaganda was need to totally replace the polulation of a country that size? Before 1965 immigratin act America was 90+% White and 80 years wrom there were less than 50%. If this would be done in any non-White country it would be called a genocide and rightfully so. Think about Whites from Europe moving to Nigeria, living off their welfare and replacing the Nigerians. I would be totally opposed to that!! Like in any other country. All people deserve to exists and stay majority in their countries, don&#39;t you agree? Right now it&#39;s White countries and only White countries who are forced to take people in to replace themselves. In 2043 we will be absolute dispised minority, thanks to anti-White media and education. Anti-White media excuses all the time violence against us and Whites are the only group in the world you can openly hate and it&#39;s considered OK. Actually it&#39;s more than OK, it&#39;s encouraged, it&#39;s progressive, it&#39;s trendy. In 2043 when we have lost voting power and non-Whites can vote more and more anti-White policies in place. If I would live in a society of White people I would never be accused of racism. There would be no such thing as affarmative action. Crime rates would be far lower. Murder rates would be same as Whites in Belgium. Whites are tired of being built these cities and then have to flee them. Tired of paying all these taxes and then called racist oppressors. Tired of being called worst people in the world and then being faulted anywhere we go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think i see what you mean. But i think you are looking at things in a &#39;reverse role&#39; view. Essentially white people being replace by others. Once the rest of the world gets it&#39;s act together (if/when white countries allow it) then we will see a great shift of people. Once all nations are equal, people will move freely. African people wont flee to the UK or USA, as they wont need to. With the weather and beauty, chance are white people will move to Africa, look at South Africa for example.</p>

<p>I&#39;m English, half Nigerian, so i&#39;m exposed to all sorts of world views. Your view is not unique, and i understand your fears, but i think your fear will never happen. We are at a breaking point for immigration all over the world, even in the UK, we voted out of the EU (myself included) and one of the issues was immigration we will be having less of it now. I expect a lot less immigration in the near future.</p>

<p>The red vs blue is what keeps the people powerless and keeps the elite at the top.  Anytime someone just starts going gung ho for one party or another they&#39;re acting as useful idiots for the elite.  Their polarizing viewpoints cause a knee-jerk reaction that kicks people over to the opposite side.</p>

<p>The gap between the two will just get bigger and bigger while the citizens of the &quot;most <em>free</em> nation on earth&quot; continue to have no voice in their own government.  I&#39;m surprised they&#39;ve kept the population from wanting to burn the fucker down this long.</p>

A media that is bought and pushing an agenda. I hope everyone is paying attention to the mass information network thats been going on. Especially with russian &quot;hacking&quot;. You see the &quot;progressive echo chamber&quot; Soros was talking about in his email in full effect. Both sides have been doing the bankers and special interests bidding, but america has a real shot with trump. Put up his own money and small donations from the people. Hes beholden to no one. He loves our military, our vets, our people, our law enforcement. He see how theyve been getting abused. Sincerely, i dont think trump is just another candidate left or right. He cant be controlled. He has put together a team of successful people that know their fields better than anyone. We will beholden to no one. For every new regulation 2 must be removed AND he&#39;ll undo all of obamas executive actions. </p>

<p>Aaaand you lost me. He&#39;s clearly backed by the same Rothschild Zionists as the rest of them. Listen to his AIPAC speech. I bet we&#39;ll be invading syria again within the year, and if not I bet they will apply a tremendous amount of pressure on Trump to comply, possibly to the level of JFK-ing him. But I don&#39;t think any of that will be necessary, because Trump wants power so whatever he needs to do to get it for himself, he will do it. His cabinet appointments (mostly all corporatist people backed by those same Rothschild Zionists) should make this especially clear.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible he&#39;s playing the long-con and is actually a rebel who will undo the system, but it&#39;s much more likely given his past that he&#39;s a power-seeker and an actor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, the problem has always been party loyalty.</p>

<p>In 2008, Republicans were saying &quot;Not my President!&quot; While Democrats were saying &quot;That&#39;s not American!&quot;</p>

<p>In 2016, Democrats were (and still are) saying &quot;Not my President!&quot; While Republicans are saying &quot;He&#39;s your President!&quot;</p>

<p>Both ends fail to look at issues, and for all the hate they have for each other&#39;s candidates, they fail to recognise that they&#39;re the essentially the same.</p>

<p>Clinton - Took money meant for Haiti, Goldman Sachs speeches, etc
Trump - Trump University, and screwing the contractors over.</p>

<p>Clinton - Warmongering all her life for the highest bidder
Trump - Praising AIPAC, employ warmongers in his campaign staff, and now warmongers in his Cabinet.</p>

<p>Clinton - Criticised for being super pro-banksters.
Trump - Actually put the banksters into the Cabinet.</p>

<p>No one mentioned anything about abolishing the Federal Reserve. Or auditing the gold.</p>

<p>Both want to fight Iran - a country that has not done anything other than kick out the American backed scum decades ago. Trump, in his utter ignorance, and the &quot;right wingers&quot; blast the millions of dollars that were paid to Iran and speak as if it were a sum given to bribe them. It isn&#39;t. The money rightfully belongs to Iran in the first place and the US unlawfully held its money.</p>

<p>I am especially amused when the likes of David Duke, as well as Jim Stone, think that Trump is &quot;for the people&quot; and keeps making excuses for how pro-Israel is. Still, their following are considered &quot;fringe&quot;.</p>

<p>All involved fail to mention the fact that Trump donated a lot of money to Clinton. As well as the fact that they have the same coveted Blood of the President - they&#39;re descendants of King John of England. All US Presidents are descendants with only 1 exception.</p>

<p>Nothing will change for the better. And with this election, party loyalty caused the Liberals that traditionally shed crocodile tears when it comes to war, to be pro-warmonger Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an illusion of freedom - a show for the masses to debate and fight amongst themselves. Ultimately, the Federal Reserve, CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group owns and controls the US. It&#39;s kind of like throwing a small piece of meat in between 2 emaciated dogs and watching the dogs fight tooth and nail for the bone.</p>

<p>Let me repeat. Nothing will change for the better. The US has never changed since its independence, and is not about to change now.</p>

<p>Same with Obama. Partisan people are only anti-war when it suits their party agenda. Which is extremely sad, that they value their in-group status over the destruction of the lives of innocents for profit. </p>

<p>I agree with what you&#39;ve said mostly, but you have to acknowledge also that part of the problem is the First-Past-The-Post voting system that is implemented in all former British colonies (excluding AUS and NZ) to maximize control. The design of the system reinforces our natural tribalistic side-vs-side urges and amplifies them to ridiculous heights. </p>

<p>So while I think you&#39;re absolutely correct to blame the partisan people of America, I think we must also acknowledge the system is designed to create a hyper-partisan atmosphere. We cannot change human nature, but we CAN change the two-party system that is exacerbating the situation quite badly. </p>

<p>I think the US is going to <em>have</em> to change. It&#39;s arriving at a point that is just as broken as when it declared independence. It may not change soon, but change is ultimately inevitable, and the smarter humanity is when it arrives at this point, the more progress that will be made with a new constitution whenever that day finally arrives. </p>

<p>Getting bamboozled only works if you don&#39;t know the trick. So we just have to learn all their tricks, and tell everyone, over and over. Then they will be defeated until they invent new tricks. Simple as that. It&#39;s going to take some time though, I&#39;m not denying that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, things are getting out of control it seems and a big war is the perfect way to distract everyone and scare them back in to behaving. Also reinvigorates the economy which is 1/5th based on the military-industrial complex and needs constant war to have demand for product, which is why we&#39;ve been at war as a nation for something like 232 of our 238 years of existence. </p>

<p>War is the great neutralizer. War is the human garbage disposal. </p>

<p>But what if they had a war, and no one showed up? </p>

<p>People only participate in these offensive wars because they buy in to the hyper-partisan rhetoric that their side is good and the other side is absolutely evil. Which is almost always a false narrative created by a media that&#39;s owned by the same big money interests that own the military-industrial complex! It couldn&#39;t be more obvious. I&#39;m amazed anyone falls for it anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting... I think there&#39;s a lot of muddying the water when it comes to the word &quot;extremist&quot;. I don&#39;t think they want full-on extremists because those would upset the system (except in the case of a controlled civil war, then the more extreme the better because they&#39;re fighting to the death) and I don&#39;t think they want to push the US in to actual domestic war because the existing order is making a lot of people a lot of money. However I think if the public starts to get too rowdy, and a revolution looks to be quickly approaching, the &#39;elites&#39; would rather start a civil war and control both sides than lose their power to a genuine revolution. So if they feel defensive and are genuinely scared of losing power, it&#39;s in their interests to polarize things more and more because that confuses people and keeps them from looking at the <em>real</em> powerful people who are actually pulling the strings. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the issue of the overton window shifting to the right over the last few decades, but that was covered in other comments in this thread. The extremism/polarization issue is a related, but different, issue that is overlaid on top of it and has come in to play just in the last decade, rather than the overton window shift which has been happening since JFK. </p>

<p>In the end, the anti-authoritarians that were once seen as relatively moderate are now seen as somewhat extreme because both the mainstream left and mainstream right have shifted in a pro-authoritarian direction, leaving the anti-authoritarians out of the conversation entirely, to the detriment of the populace. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I totally answered your questions fully, but I liked thinking about them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I understand it, the center of the Greek political system was decimated by the far-left and far-right.  Like OP states, the center was effectively abolished.</p>

<p>Now the interesting part is that both the Syriza (left) and Golden Dawn (right) settled down and signed an &quot;anti-austerity&quot; pact right after the elections were over.  They stopped the fight once the middle ground had been razed.</p>

<p>And the <em>really</em> interesting part (and the part that is going to get me down-voted around here) is that the leadership of Syriza and Golden Dawn both had confirmed contact throughout the bitterly contested elections with the same shady character, none other that Alexander Dugin, Putin&#39;s favorite neo-fascist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s extremely interesting, I didn&#39;t know any of that. This should be its own post. So is the middle ground rebuilding now that the anti-austerity measures are in place? </p>

<p>Do you think the economic situation was natural that caused the initial division, or do you think both the economic situation and thus the resulting political polarization are both essentially fabricated to divide and conquer the masses in the way you described? Or do you think they merely were riding a natural economic wave that is out of everyone&#39;s control? This is the thing I always wonder </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak to the current state of the middle-ground, I suspect some are trying to rebuild it.</p>

<p>I think the economic situation was both organic and inevitable, more caused by Greek political culture than intentional economic meddling.</p>

<p>However, I think that Russia saw a great opportunity to play Greek politics against itself and stick it to the EU at the same time, and I think they seized that opportunity.  Divide and conquer style politics with the help of Russian funding is playing out all over Europe, Greece is just one example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha I got so far to that point as well, then I realized, what am I being mad at? These idiots who don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re doing? They&#39;re just ignorant, like little children. If a kid comes up and say &quot;Santa is Real!&quot; do you get angry at the misinformation, or do you just laugh? Why treat the politically dumb any differently? They&#39;re not going to change because you get mad at them, they&#39;re too dumb, so why bother getting mad? It&#39;s like cutting yourself because there&#39;s kids starving in Africa. It solves nothing, and actually makes the world slightly worse, and makes <em>your</em> world <em>much</em> worse. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t even find enough shits to get mad at idiots anymore, honestly. They&#39;re just not worth it, I have bigger fish to fry. Might as well get mad at a dog for barking or a cricket for chirping. Some people just are going to remain ignorant, and that&#39;s how it is, and it sucks, but that&#39;s no reason for <em>you</em> to carry that burden on your shoulders. Let the dumb be dumb. Let it be. </p>

<p>You can take a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink. However there&#39;s some damn thirsty horses out there, and I&#39;m more concerned with getting water to the thirsty horses, than spending hours trying to make one stubborn horse drink. If that horse wants to die of thirst for being a dumbass, then fine. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to preach so much here, but this is something I&#39;ve been wrangling with myself. I&#39;m starting to get to a place where I realize some people just aren&#39;t worth worrying about. They have to want it themselves before anyone can save them. And like I said, I have bigger fish to fry. There&#39;s thirsty horses out there who want water but can&#39;t find it! Those people are the ones I care about anymore. I don&#39;t wish ill on anyone, but I&#39;m tired of suffering and agonizing over those who don&#39;t even care to help themselves. Why should I? It doesn&#39;t increase my morality to get mad at a horse that won&#39;t drink, does it? I&#39;m only hurting myself, and maybe even hurting others too. It&#39;s pointless, compared to helping those that actually want it. That&#39;s why I post on this subreddit, because people are actually looking for the truth, even if it&#39;s not what they want to hear. </p>

<p>Sorry that was so long... it&#39;s such an important thing though. We have to take care of ourselves and control our stress levels. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the problem with being moderate in America is that we have gone so far left that moderate is left. </p>

<p>Beyond that no one knows what those terms mean. The left and right of America are not the left and right of the rest of the world. Democrats are not liberals, they are fascists. Republicans are not conservatives or constitutionalists. Libertarians, if they finally put a libertarian that is not a complete nut job in the election, is actually the party of most Americans. </p>

<p>Libertarians in a nut shell: I don&#39;t care what you do but you must leave me alone as well. Stay out of my life and I will stay out of yours. </p>

<p>Definition of fascism</p>

<pre><code>1 often capitalized :  a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition

2  a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control &amp;lt;early instances of army fascism and brutality — J. W. Aldridge&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The closest thing in America to a liberal is a libertarian. The only pay in America fighting for the rights of the individual. </p>

<p>Definition of liberal</p>

<pre><code>1  of, relating to, or based on the liberal arts &amp;lt;liberal education&gt; b archaic :  of or befitting a man of free birth

2  marked by generosity :  openhanded &amp;lt;a liberal giver&gt; b :  given or provided in a generous and openhanded way &amp;lt;a liberal meal&gt; c :  ample, full

3  obsolete :  lacking moral restraint :  licentious

4 not literal or strict :  loose &amp;lt;a liberal translation&gt;

5 broad-minded; especially :  not bound by authoritarianism, orthodoxy, or traditional forms

6 of, favoring, or based upon the principles of liberalism b capitalized :  of or constituting a political party advocating or associated with the principles of political liberalism; especially :  of or constituting a political party in the United Kingdom associated with ideals of individual especially economic freedom, greater individual participation in government, and constitutional, political, and administrative reforms designed to secure these objectives
</code></pre>

<p>I would also argue that Republicans are not conservatives. They, according to the definition, are more like technocrats or corporatists that are still forming a base.</p>

<p>Definition of conservative</p>

<pre><code>1 preservative

2  of or relating to a philosophy of conservatism b capitalized :  of or constituting a political party professing the principles of conservatism: as (1) :  of or constituting a party of the United Kingdom advocating support of established institutions (2) :  progressive conservative

3 tending or disposed to maintain existing views, conditions, or institutions :  traditional b :  marked by moderation or caution &amp;lt;a conservative estimate&gt; c :  marked by or relating to traditional norms of taste, elegance, style, or manners

4 of, relating to, or practicing Conservative Judaism
</code></pre>

<p>Until you know what the words mean the rest of the arguements are worthless. </p>

Nietzsche, Voltaire, amongst many others saw all that is happening now over a hundred years ago. The problem is people only repeat the mistakes of the past and learn none of the wisdom, thus we keep going round in these patterns. Fortunately, little glimpses of the light are gleamed during this process and a higher order of equilibrium is reached gradually. Extremes clash and finally compromise is made in places where only there was a void filled with toxicity and decay through neglect.</p>

<p>The real difference between right and left is nature and hierarchy.  Rightist thought seeks to understand and bolster nature&#39;s existing hierarchical structures to the benefit of the greater social organism whereas the left seeks to overthrow nature and her hierarchies in exchange for a singular, centrally imposed artificial hierarchy instead.  In this way, leftism seeks to overturn nature--unmake creation if you will--by alienating humans from their true roles in society and forcing them into nameless/faceless cog-ism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed this so much lately. I used to talk politics with a friend of mine from California but he stopped  this election because my views have been too &quot;right wing&quot; for him, which is silly considering I&#39;ve always voted left (for what it&#39;s worth). Me being not <em>liberal enough</em> prompted him reject any argument I had because I guess anything but the extreme left is inherently stupid and wrong? I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s scary.  People with power and wealth can use this hard divide for personal gain; I try to reel in my friends to a more moderate and open-minded outlook and explain the dangers I see with being so divided, but nothing seems to stop that train from rolling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that &quot;centrist&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; positions virtually always favor the left, because they are great at labeling any nationalist policiy as &quot;far right&quot; or &quot;radical right&quot;. For instance, they think that if someone wants to stop immigration from islamic countries, that is a &quot;radical&quot; right-wing position. Which to my eyes is a very questionable claim.  To them anything is far-right. So when you advocate for more moderate viewpoints, you are basically advocating for globalism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw your post in another sub as well... CST I think. I really like it. I wish everyone in the US could read it. It&#39;s not long, it&#39;s not complicated. It&#39;s clean and concise.</p>

<p>I just wish more people could create their own beliefs and their own narrative!</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t fully believe or vote fully Republican or Democrat. I am somewhere between and my leaning sways back and forth. I hate that so many people put their full blind faith behind one party or the other!!!</p>

<p>This type of control is also prevalent in other aspects of life too. I was just talking to someone about veganism. I strive to eat a vegan diet for health reasons... But when I say I&#39;m vegan, people immediately think I&#39;m some hippy, animal loving nutcase, because society says that your either &quot;normal&quot; or you&#39;re &quot;crazy vegan&quot;. Well, I am vegan because all my medical problems disappear when I eat a vegan diet... I tried 50 diets to determine this. I spent years of my life experimenting. Unfortunately, people will immediately lose respect for me and have opinions of me based on the fact that I try to eat a vegan diet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I am sure you are in favor of equal pay for equal work, and you probably would advocate fighting a little against potential disadvantages based on old patriarchial habits when they exist and are irrational.  </p>

<p>If you have stats taht show that the wage gap isnt real or if you have study results showing better performances by male bosses even in progressed company situations, then we can talk about those in detail.  </p>

<p>but the equal opportunity thing is probably something we can agree on, right? Then you probably arent a &quot;conservative&quot;, at least by the current american standard. The american spectrum is very different from what it could be or should be. Its not about political debate, but about memes and identity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think i see what you mean. But i think you are looking at things in a &#39;reverse role&#39; view. Essentially white people being replace by others. Once the rest of the world gets it&#39;s act together (if/when white countries allow it) then we will see a great shift of people. Once all nations are equal, people will move freely. African people wont flee to the UK or USA, as they wont need to. With the weather and beauty, chance are white people will move to Africa, look at South Africa for example.</p>

<p>I&#39;m English, half Nigerian, so i&#39;m exposed to all sorts of world views. Your view is not unique, and i understand your fears, but i think your fear will never happen. We are at a breaking point for immigration all over the world, even in the UK, we voted out of the EU (myself included) and one of the issues was immigration we will be having less of it now. I expect a lot less immigration in the near future.</p>

<p>Sure I hope Trump does well, I dont want the world to end just to confirm my suspicions and stroke my ego or something. I just distrust him, have seen so much negative stuff surrounding him and dont consider him capable. I would love to be proven wrong.  </p>

<p>I also hope for the current unverified news about trumps corruption are wrong, but its hard for me to not find it fitting to my image of trump and his campaign and the way russia has been doing geopolitics for the last decade.  </p>

<p>I respect that you want the best for america and saw potential in trumps messages. I just hope you dont see it as a personal insult when I think that you might have been tricked. It does not need to be an emotional thing. We never really know who people really are, not even in our family sometimes. Politics is alot about trust and trust can be abused. But I still hope Trump is a good guy. I just dont think he is, based on the information and perception I have right now. </p>
