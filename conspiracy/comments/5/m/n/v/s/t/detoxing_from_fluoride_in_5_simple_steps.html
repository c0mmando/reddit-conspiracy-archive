       You have amazon affiliate links throughout the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an IM article written specifically to make money from those links.

       It's an IM site littered with Amazon and Clickbank links

       Suddenly a bunch of other accounts came out of the woodwork to whiteknight for him. Must be his alts. Thanks for pointing it out!

       We should make our goal for 2017 to go after fluoride in water. 2018 we can go after glyphosate. 2019 we can go after vaccines. 2020 we can go after chemtrails. Who knows maybe by 2021 we can stop false flag terrorism.

       I just look at the sky on a clear blue day and see the fucking criss crosses. Then they spread and make the sky hazy the rest of the day. I have no idea what they are doing. Best case scenario, weather mod. But I know it's worse than that. I know because I know what they put in our water and food. They are trying to kill us and or make us docile and lazy and brain dead

       Proof? Find your own proof, Holmes. I know they are trying to enslave me. I know they put fluoride in the water and glyphosate in the food. I know what they spray in the sky. I know what they put in the vaccines. Do your own research you lazy sack.

       It's a perspective. In the past we knew all the herbs to cure everything and likely how to eat to remain illness free for the most part. In todays world we all get cancer early and die young. There's your proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       More proof, herbal doctors can cure people from cancer by doing fruit fasting. That's simply not eating the food they give us in abundance and advertise.

       Chemtrails are all over the sky and our bodies are being chemically attacked from all angles, even soap and water, you name it.

       If you want to find out if you have excessive amounts of flouride in your water, you can get a flouride test strip which tells you how many ppm(parts per million) and ppb(parts per billion) of flouride are in the water. If you want to test for chemicals/elements in water like aluminum or lead you can do the same thing. Just get some test strips for those two elements and follow the instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could do this for both tap water and rainwater. To test for chemicals in the air, first make sure you have a very clean container to catch rainwater. Watch the weather to see when it will rain, and watch the skies to see when chemtrails are more concentrated. If it's supposed to rain a day or two after chemtrails are highly concentrated, put your rain catcher outside when it's supposed to rain and test that water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use distilled tap water for a tap water control, and distilled rainwater for a rain water control. You could also catch rainwater and record the results of the tests for a day that chemtrails were non-frequent or non-existent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water in the atmosphere that falls as rain will always contain whatever chemicals, pollutants, or other various particles that exist in the air. It's a good way to test this, I think.

       The issue is, how can one differentiate between chemicals as a result of "chemtrails" and plain old pollution?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't...

       I will look into those litmus tests though! Thank you.

You can't...

      <p>
       Maybe not directly, but if you want to test for an association, you can do the tests with rain from during a time when there are limited chemtrails in the days preceding the rainfall.
      </p>
      <p>
       After you get the results, do a comparison with rainfall that occurred a few days after a thick batch of chemtrails. Be sure to look up the direction of the windstream in your area and look(with a telescope or binocular) in that direction, since airborne particles will travel with the wind, and the original particles could be from a city somewhere along the wind pattern.h
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a ton of factors, but this is a great place to start. Perhaps you could find other water tests that check for the other elements/chemicals that are supposed to be in chemtrails.
