    <div class="md"><p>If you want to find out if you have excessive amounts of flouride in your water, you can get a flouride test strip which tells you how many ppm(parts per million) and ppb(parts per billion) of flouride are in the water. If you want to test for chemicals/elements in water like aluminum or lead you can do the same thing. Just get some test strips for those two elements and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>You could do this for both tap water and rainwater. To test for chemicals in the air, first make sure you have a very clean container to catch rainwater. Watch the weather to see when it will rain, and watch the skies to see when chemtrails are more concentrated. If it&#39;s supposed to rain a day or two after chemtrails are highly concentrated, put your rain catcher outside when it&#39;s supposed to rain and test that water.</p>

<p>Use distilled tap water for a tap water control, and distilled rainwater for a rain water control. You could also catch rainwater and record the results of the tests for a day that chemtrails were non-frequent or non-existent.</p>

<p>Water in the atmosphere that falls as rain will always contain whatever chemicals, pollutants, or other various particles that exist in the air. It&#39;s a good way to test this, I think.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Maybe not directly, but if you want to test for an association, you can do the tests with rain from during a time when there are limited chemtrails in the days preceding the rainfall. </p>

<p>After you get the results, do a comparison with rainfall that occurred a few days after a thick batch of chemtrails. Be sure to look up the direction of the windstream in your area and look(with a telescope or binocular) in that direction, since airborne particles will travel with the wind, and the original particles could be from a city somewhere along the wind pattern.h</p>

<p>There&#39;s a ton of factors, but this is a great place to start. Perhaps you could find other water tests that check for the other elements/chemicals that are supposed to be in chemtrails.</p>
