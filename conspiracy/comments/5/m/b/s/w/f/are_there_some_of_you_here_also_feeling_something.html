    <div class="md"><p>I am not attempting to speak for him, but an empath to summarize it very quickly is someone who is &quot;tuned&quot; or very receptive to the energy all around us. people, animals, space and beyond. They are (go figure) easily able to feel people&#39;s energy, what you&#39;ll commonly hear people refer to as &quot;read people&quot;. Generally intuitive, with varying degrees of a bunch of other stuff. </p>

<p>I would guess that he&#39;s talking about &quot;carrying the emotional load&quot; for his family. Do you ever hear people described as &quot;the person everyone can always go and talk to no matter what&quot;. Same or similar phenomena. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also common as I&#39;m sure you know, someone who takes on a lot of other people&#39;s issues can often feel their own burdens increase. They may be better equipped to persevere, but they feel the burdens the same. I&#39;m sure that guy has his hands full if he&#39;s emotionally supporting four additional people. </p>

<p>The only thing that isn&#39;t ready is the ego, it&#39;s fearful and needs security at all times. Spirit knows exactly where it is going, why, and when. Fear not.</p>

<p>When I was a child I went through a similar thing in the early fall of 2001. I would ask my mother if someone had died everyday I came home from school. I felt something was off, that something was going to happen that would change my life. At the time I was worried that a family member was going to die but as soon as I saw the footage I told my parents that I knew something was going to happen.</p>
