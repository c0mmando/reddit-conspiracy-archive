       Ok, so this guy found out that the kill room is in Pegasus Museum. See his deleted but re-uploaded video below:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQgW9qvOiik">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQgW9qvOiik
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy sells pizzagate T-shirts and is a soldier on the front lines fighting the good fight. Anyway, he tries to pull an interview with Alefantis and gives it a shot by messaging him on instant messenger through Facebook I believe. Alefantis goes bananas and tell hims to call within 10 seconds. The guy freaks and calls. Alefantis then threatens to kill the mans whole family and instant messages family photos of his mom and girlfriend. He mentions that the main part he wants gone is the Pegasus museum part. Alefantis is on full blown threat mode and so the guy takes it down but then he makes another video of Alefantis threatening him:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZQxYQ49p0U">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZQxYQ49p0U
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does Alefantis have access to this guys full name and why does he have pictures of this mans family? It is because he is connected to the spy system through agencies like the NSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis is really pissed about the Pegasus Museum being exposed as the location for the kill room where they kill the kids after raping them. This, obviously, can attract a ton of attention to that museum and Alefantis doesn't want this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am assuming there is more that he is hiding than just the kill room. Anyone have any ideas as to what that might be? Maybe a Satanic ritual room?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
      </p>
      <p>
       Kill room is in Pegasus museum which is in an alley and surrounded by buildings. There is graffiti on a brick that says "kids" with arrows pointing down (underground tunnel?). There was a man on the roof too (maybe spotter?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: word is people are heading out to the museum tomorrow to look around a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 3:
      </p>
      <p>
       More proof this is real.

       That is the point he was making with the text: "FBI liked your video"...he is (or is pretending to be) in contact with FBI.
      </p>

       He is freaking out though. If he really has any power, he doesn't have a blowout on he phone.

       Emoji at the end looks like he is saying comet ping pong is a prostitution place.

       Finally, top 50 most influential people? He talks like an operator...like he owns the world.  But he is just a jagoff running a good cop bad cop, algorithm (where he is both cops--instant anger, instant forgiveness upon cooperation,  but you owe me...constant intimidation, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       And waves? There is a tsunami heading in his direction if it's all true: have we asked ourselves why the video is suddenly back up and our plucky profiteer is back in business? Is there not a possibility some guardian angel who is perhaps higher up than GQ's top 50 put his hand on his shoulder and said, "carry on my son"?

       I don't know what to think of the conversation video. Part of me thinks it's phony. He didn't record the second call when he had the chance to, and if he was really afraid he wouldn't have posted this video in the first place. Also, wouldn't Alefantis have been at least slightly concerned about being recorded before making numerous threats? If that audio had gotten out on YouTube it could have been very incriminating.

       And with kids and a family and using his own account? I'm all for transparancy, and taking the high road while investigating, but this was blatantly sloppy and handled unbelievably poorly. What the fuck did that guy expect to happen? "Oh no, you've caught me, I'll admit everything."
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's play devils advocate for a moment. You're James Alefantis, and maybe you're starting to get a little nervous about all this people digging into your shit. Lo and behold some fucking gung-ho idiot shows his hand by bringing up the Pegasus museum and now you're sweating. But wait, this moron decided to attack your from his Facebook full of PII (personally identifiable information) so you fire back at him with whatever you can to shake him off the trail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr - Calling out Alefantis/ANYONE with all your shit visible to the public is asking for him/whoever to personally attack you.

       To me it looks like alefsntis spotted how naive the guy was and figured a good threat would scare him off like it has in the past assuming alefsntis has done this often in his line of business. The OP, being naive, obeyed but then uploaded a 2nd YouTube video talking about the threat without considering alefsntis would literally shit a container of bricks if he saw it. He is a bit naive but that doesn't make him a bad guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is real, OP hit a nerve with alefsntis. Luckily a few locals are heading down for a tour of the museum tomorrow I hear. Guess we'll find out.

       You have to accept the angle though that Alfantis was already on mass media, denying claims. You'd think if you were that guy, it would end there especially when it's the public's word against your own and the police's.
      </p>
      <p>
       If something goes wrong, well, his life may be the compensation that was sought for. You really can't escape this. People used to readily put their life on the line for freedom and you shouldn't denounce that.

       Are you sure Alefantis isn't in cahoots with this guy and just wants some money from the tee shirts plus the inevitable lawsuits once a few people start making public claims based on this 'proof'?  Also, when people go over there to poke around they'll probably have a pizza too onve the smell hits them.  Ker-ching!

       After some consideration, I think what you did was good move. I read your comment about Alefantus being very flagrant and open about what he did in secret and agree with you that maybe this was a great move to draw him out. Honestly now, this guy was a fucking dumbass to keep all of his stuff up on public social media, and has been the Achilles (lol) heel of Pizzagate and it's investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I apologize  for initially thinking your move was stupid (though it is a controlled risk considering your family/friends) but if it works and parallels the actions of Alefantis than it who am I to criticize it.

       And being contacted on Facebook. After watching that video, Ryan seems really oblivious. If that video is real and JA is innocent, man do I feel bad for that man.. hindsight is 20/20, this guy's life is already ruined innocent or guilty

       How would the video being real prove his innocence? JA even says with the exception of kids everything they say about him is true.

       This may be a stretch, but he's implying that he's into satanic shit and killing people as a method of scaring the dude so he can convince him to take the stuff down?

       Sorry my wording was confusing, if the video Ryan posted was real, as in that really is JA texting him, and if JA is innocent, it's just a normal human being accused and harassed,which is really mest up.

       Not sure if Alefantis would incriminate himself in this way. I'm sure he's surrounded by lawyers &amp; consultants advising him on every move he makes, and going off via text messages through an "official" Alefantis fb profile just makes 0 sense for a guy in his position. Our friend Ryan might have gotten the ultimate shit-your-pants troll. Who knows.

       Everything else has already been said, so I'm going to go straight to a question I have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand why James Alefantis is displayed as the contact when he showed the first round of texts but when he showed round two, the name was gone and it was only the phone number. If it was reversed and digits for the first text, it would totally make sense. Something is off.

       I don't know what to think of the conversation video. Part of me thinks it's phony. He didn't record the second call when he had the chance to, and if he was really afraid he wouldn't have posted this video in the first place. Also, wouldn't Alefantis have been at least slightly concerned about being recorded before making numerous threats? If that audio had gotten out on YouTube it could have been very incriminating if the conversation happened as he described it.

       I'm skeptical also.  However, anger is anger, even rich, powerful criminals do stupid, stupid things.  He also probably feels the heat and it's probably driving him mad.  I have been waiting months.  I think Comet Ping Pong will either close due to "unforeseen circumstances" or will burn down or be sold off.  Mark this post.

       It's not easy at all to fake that with inspect element.. a scrolling chat area with profile pic, links working etc.. he'd have to be pretty fuckin clever to rig that up. And he's been doing legit awesome research for a long time.. why would anyone not take him seriously when he's made real discoveries?

       It's easy, I just replicated it in 30 seconds to make sure fb didn't have something stopping you.. Inspect element &gt; highlight text you want to change &gt; type in desired text &gt; redirect links to desired locations &gt; swap thumbnails and you're good to go.

       Ryan is making a claim that could be libel, and sued in court if he's lying. Selling shirts is a bit on the questionable side, maybe. But how much do you think he'd make selling 100 shirts? Ever tried to sell shirts online, it's near impossible. It's not a get rich quick scheme, or make a bunch of money quick scheme. Nothing wrong with questioning his evidence of the threats, but I don't see the selling of shirts as a reason to immediately discredit his intentions.
      </p>

       I get the disdain for people trying to profit from the investigation. But how is it any different than Reality Calls or David Seaman (arguably some of the best faces for Pizzagate). They literally ask for donations. If you give 20 bucks to either of them for a donation, they get all of it. If you give 20 bucks for a shirt, he might get 3 or 4 bucks. I don't get the separation, in fact, it seems quite a bit less profitable to sell shirts than to directly ask for donations.

       You're right. I find it hard to believe that his friend sitting next to him couldn't get his phone out and record the phone on loudspeaker. Honestly it's possible JA specifically threatened him about recording the conversation and would fuck his family up anyway if the tape got out.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was smart he could've kept up the relationship with and maybe got some more answers. But haven't your family threatened like that must be demoralizing.

       Yeah man, you never know when you're going to hear some noise at night and have to groggily get out of bed, put on your body armor, load your gun and defend yourself from some assassins who have been stalking your post history on reddit and have been ordered to eliminate you because you're getting too close to revealing damning secrets about the global elite.

       Yeah, you're right. The government's never killed anyone. Better to bend over and take it.

       The government is not going to kill you for your post history on reddit. And if they wanted to kill you, they probably could do it before you have time to crawl out of bed and get you body armor on. I mean obviously, ou aren't
       <em>
        that

       worried about being killed by the government. You are still posting here. Body armor
       <em>

       to the bed is the ultimate half measure. Maybe it makes you feel better but it doesn't do shit.

       Not at all. And the fact that you're saying things like this makes it really obvious that you're ignorant about the subject area.

       Next time you talk to a cop, ask them if they have a gun next to their bed.

       Not a great safeguard is it. Reddit stores all comments in perpetuity so if you were "busted" the authorities could unravel your expert trolling across multiple accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean obviously that's not going to happen because no one cares about what you're saying. Point is its not great opsec.

       I also don't think they'd come after me, because I'm not an insurrectionist. I know a violent revolution is worse than the current regime.

       They almost always fail. There are a few situations I might engage in insurrection, but it's things like Stalin-style purges. And in those situations, I think a military coup would overthrow them first.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know all of this, BTW. They know they would lose to an insurrection, quite quickly. I'd say there's a ~50% likelihood that even moderate armed resistance would lead to military coup within a day or two.

       Ever wonder why they backed off the Bundy Ranch situation, in sharp contrast to the way things were handled at Ruby Ridge, Waco, etc.?

       If he is in fact connected to the Clintons and CIA, that means importing, which means unregistered flights, which means lots of private jets, train cars, buses, mafia / cartel connections / port authorities (holy shit!) to move the "people" for the owners and satanists.

        Why does Alefantis have access to this guys full name and why does he have pictures of this mans family? It is because he is connected to the spy system through agencies like the NSA.

      <p>
       It could be any one of the intelligence agencies. NSA does more passive types of surveillance, and they're looking more for insurrectionists. If it came from electronic sources, it's probably them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it came from active surveillance, that tends to be more FBI, occasionally CIA, or other, smaller agencies.

       If I were genuinely convinced there was a child rape/torture room there, I'd grab as many armed men as I can muster and kick down the door with battle rifles ASAP before they can hide evidence.

      <p>
       But I'm not convinced of that, so I wouldn't recommend such a course of action. I've seen a lot of circumstantial evidence that this could be some kind of a setup, such as the false flag attack awhile back. There are probably real perverts there, but the evidence online still seems a bit too easy to me.

       His eyes shift a lot when he is telling facts. I want to believe, but if he was as scared as he should be, there would not be a follow up, nor would he plug his site a few times in conversation, and at the end.

       Have any of you guys ever considered the possibility that the conversation this Youtuber is presenting could be a mishmash of truth and falsehood, that he was able to contact Alefantis, albeit briefly, but that the threats to his family (son, girlfriend, himself), were entirely his invention to spread further provocative lies against Alefantis? Also just simply to get back at Alefantis for threatening to sue him, by making it seem that the real infractor during the call was Alefantis, for threatening him with death, and not himself for querying about Pegasus and about P*zzagate in general?

       There has been no proof posted that this actually took place. The fact that everyone is buying this makes me ashamed of this subreddit. And I believe in pizzagate.

       Not at all. And the fact that you're saying things like this makes it really obvious that you're ignorant about the subject area.

       Being British, I would probably roll over in the night and accidentally shoot myself in the side. Next day on Reddit - "OMFG family said he was into conspiracy theories.  They killed him!!"
