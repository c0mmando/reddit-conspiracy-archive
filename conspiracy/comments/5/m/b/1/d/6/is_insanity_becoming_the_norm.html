       This will be a long and winding post. I have a lot of things floating around in my head that I feel would be most well received by this sub, because as many of you likely know, the average person is conditioned from birth into a controlled world view, and isn't in a position to consider much of what I am going to say since it would challenge them to do something about it and shake up their comfortable slumber.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've given up trying to red pill other people. You either see things or you have blinders on. If you see things, you don't need me to point out the obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been watching things unfold for a while now, having taken the red pill over a decade ago, and it really feels like the craziness has been escalating. I know that the holiday season is hard for some people dealing with life's struggles, but this year 2 long time family friends attempted and thankfully failed at suicide around Christmas, and a direct relative also did commit suicide earlier this year for reasons I am still struggling to grasp at. It doesn't make sense. And my best friend even threatened me because of a reality he fabricated in his mind, because he wasn't willing to have a conversation with me to understand the situation until it got him boiling over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that times are tough. There is a legitimate and growing homeless crisis in my area and all around the country. The population to employment ratio is in the gutter in spite of what the book cookers would have us believe, but I don't think that goes far enough to explain what I'm seeing which is a general lack of thought by most folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       My family and friends know that their iPhones and Androids are spying on them, I've made sure to warn them, but why don't they care? Why am I the only one who cares?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that if I were homeless, I'd go off and live in the woods somewhere, picking berries and sleeping with ferns. Making sure to stay away from the crazies and the gestapo. So obviously there is an aspect of drug addiction that keeps people wanting to stay urban, and probably an equal aspect of those who were born into poverty and remain uneducated, but I still don't think that goes far enough to explain things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now listen, I'm not some nutter who gloms on to every possible conspiracy. I used to listen to Alex Jones, and have since realized he is controlled opposition (A Scanner Darkly). I used to avidly follow Ron Paul until I learned of his Jesuit ties. I am constantly updating my world view based on evaluation of new information. I was on an accelerated learning track my entire life, graduated with a scholarship, took AP classes. I have a successful career I crafted for myself and am debt free. I'm not trying to brag. I'm just telling you that I am of sound mind, not a trend following zombie. And for the record, I am not a shill or a spook. I'm a critical thinking individual who observes and contemplates the world around me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it doesn't seem like most other people are that way. And I'm trying to understand why. I do believe that I'm special, but I don't believe that I'm so special that anyone else couldn't be in my shoes if they put in the work that I have to learn and grow as a person.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here's where I'm going to put my tinfoil hat on and invite ridicule. Let's talk about chemtrails. I've been watching them for years and years. This is the only thing that makes any sense to me, for why people are acting crazier and crazier. There was a NASA whistleblower who came out recently and stated there was lithium in the trails which could explain some of all of this, but I've also seen other documentaries that show elevated levels of aluminum in soil samples in California where chemtrails are prevalent. Aluminum is a known contributor to Alzheimer's disease, and that is where my thoughts continue to key on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between that, the fluoride in our water, the chemicals in our processed food that the FDA greenlights without any scrutiny, the GMOs, and the nanoparticles in our every day household items - we have no idea what is being done to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try my best to combat the effects of these things by eating healthy whenever possible, drinking plenty of water to flush things out, getting a good night's rest so my body can heal, but anybody who has their head in the sand is going to be along for the ride.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at Trump for example. Everybody who voted for him thinks they are awake, giving the finger to the status quo and the neocons. Then he goes and appoints Goldman Sachs alumni to his cabinet. And hello, he's a zionist. Sorry folks, you got duped. The_Donald is such a cesspool of mushheads. Even people who think they are awake are still aiding the globalist agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is this ride? Well, if I haven't alienated you yet, here's another shot at it. Let's get into the homosexual agenda. Before I continue, let me say that I have nothing against people for what they believe or who they are. What I am talking about is the attempt to coerce people into that lifestyle; MTV, pop music with autotuning that makes the singer's voice gender ambiguous, the girls who try to make a guy turn homo to win her affection, all the sitcoms, Disney brainwashing, I could go on and on. It's inescapable, and I see the vast majority of people getting swept up in it. I'm not going to debate whether or not this exists. I know it does. It's no different than someone pushing their religion on to other people. The question is why, and the answer is obvious. Without a traditional family institution, the state gets to usurp the role of parental unit, and the children are raised in a godless society where they don't understand that rights are endowed by a creator. They believe rights are endowed by the state, and they are perfectly groomed for the slavery that is to come when the big brother technology finally reaches fruition. Without a traditional family institution, there is no breeding. Population control. I suspect the chemtrails are also leading to infertility, although I can't substantiate that, and it would not surprise me if they also had something to do with driving people into a lustful frenzy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've watched chemtrails for a long time. They are very easy to spot. Water vapor dissipates, but these just grow, and grow, and grow, until after a couple hours they blanket the sky with a haze that looks like an oil slick. It's pretty darn obvious to me, but then my eyes are open.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let me try and rope all this back into a point. People I love and care about are dying, because they aren't awake. I need to do more to tell them what is going on, or at least to somehow protect them, but I don't really know what I should do. Nobody wants to listen. Everyone seems to be afraid of the truth, because they have no eternal security in their faith. There's nothing to be afraid of when you have the man upstairs in your corner! I'm really not trying to push my religion on you, so I won't tell you specifically what mine is, but if you are someone who believes there is nothing after this life you have no protection against what is being thrust upon us by these spirit cooking occultists. I pray that I will be delivered from these terrible times before they get any worse, but I don't think that will happen yet, because I haven't done much to thwart it, but maybe if we talk about it and get it out in the open something good will come of it.

       When you begin to realize the whole point of this ''place'' is for people to stay sleeping, unquestioning and docile...when you realize the cycles and processes that keep it going depend on deceit and predation to some extent and if one keeps in mind the holographic nature of reality, that predation will include human social structures...but once consciousness sparks to a given level, where one can observe somewhat, one's role as ''prey and pawn'' changes. It does all seem nightmarish but it's equivalent to an uber sophisticated video game. I have all this on good authority :)

       I get what you're aiming at. Stuart Swerdlow comes to mind, but personally I am wary of considering our reality as a holodeck scenario, because that could potentially lead someone to disassociate themself from the consequences of their actions if they believe that reality isn't actually real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider that even if we are living in some sort of advanced virtual reality matrix scenario, that either A) we are all in this together and are still impacting each other as though we were in reality, and thus should behave as such, or B) I am the only person in this universe, and everyone else is imaginary for what, the purpose of testing my character? If so, I wouldn't want to fail now just because I knew it was a test.

       I suppose if we really were just batteries for the machines, or whatever the case may be in this hypothetical scenario, that maybe they would fabricate a reality for each individual, but I don't believe that is true. When I look in someone's eyes, I feel in my heart that I know it's not a computer model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus I refuse to believe that everything I've ever done in my life, ever accomplishment I've achieved, every connection I've made with another human being, was the result of a fabricated reality. I can get on board with the notion that when we die a veil will be lifted, and we'll see what we currently can't see beyond our own two eyes, but I don't think that can be the result of a very advanced computer program or something. It would have to be extradimensional, in which case it begs some questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If 4th dimensional beings can watch us from 4D space as though we were a picture on their wall, equivalent to if a person lived in 2D space where they would only see lines but we could see them while they were unaware of it, then 5th dimensional beings should be able to do the same to the 4th, and 6th to the 5th, and so on, to infinity, back to the source.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it doesn't make sense to me that this would be done to us by our creator, and it also doesn't make sense to me that our creator would allow us to be used and manipulated by forces beyond our control. At least not unless we have embraced those forces and rejected our creator.

       I do believe in the big big picture - we are all one- all the rest is illusion..the anecdotes of people who are dying, the things they exclaim (or sometimes laugh out loud, as though it was all a big joke).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence that we are created vs indigenously evolved, is our poor adaptation to our environment unique in the animal world (backs that give out, lack of melanin in many people that makes the sun dangerous), also things like blind spot in the eye etc. The evidence for programmed like reality is the fact that math and geometry underlies creation, also deja vu and prophecy, people have mutual dreams, lucid dreaming, much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently Jerry Wills on Gaia talking about the supposed portal in Peru, Amaru Muru..the locals wont go near it but he did, its an ancient structure with a strange closed door, supposedly he went through and into another dimension, it was terrifying..but ended up in this all white place where disembodied voices asked him telepathically, who are you? Turned out they had created our universe sort of by accident, kind of like we are experimenting now with the Hedron Collider, they were trying to improve something and created a universe..and they couldnt really control it..but the kicker was that THEY THEMSELVES were created by other beings they didnt understand-- kind of like a Russian doll with worlds within worlds, and who is the ultimate creator?
      </p>
      <p>
       When he came back (it was a terrifying experience for him, felt like hours), his wife asked where did you go? You disappeared! but it was only for a few minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a lifetime seeker, a person who has had extremely unusual experiences my whole life and from a family with unusual 'gifts', I've come to believe in the oneness theory and so that if you are playing 'dark actor' , you are ultimately acting darkly against yourself --the cabal/elites have been tricked into thinking they are exempt or have antidotes or worlds to escape from the effects of their deeds - but not really true. The real creative sauce of the universe is love -- and that is us - but it has a hell of a imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also come to believe that once you 'wake up' to the game nature of everything and can become a bemused observer, the 'dark matrix' forces don't work on you the same way ! Fear creates its own sticky matrix and that is what causes ghosts, unpleasant reincarnations and lots of other mischief. But I guess its kind of fun at some level? Here in 3d after all we like horror movies and war, so makes sense eh?

       the globalist agenda is to conquer. their modus to do so is 'divide'. every time you appeal to an "other" group as a problem, you're advancing this agenda. if you are fighting 'against' anything you are subscribing to slave morality and thus doing exactly what they want. they want to keep us in the dark to the fact that we create our own good-- that we, not their rules, are in charge of our lives-- so they goad us into fighting over who can be less not-bad. don't fall for it, keep waking. peace

       FWIW I voted for Darrell Castle, the only candidate who I could have voted for without compromising my ideals, and was largely uninvolved with the staged Trump/Hillary mudslinging except to point out how neither one of them is qualified to lead, but I think I see your point in that it doesn't really matter who you vote for, because we are in control of our own universes and we define the world around us.

If everyone was awake, truly awake, there would be no need for debate or bureaucracy or choosing sides in a false paradigm. Things would just be well. Those sowing destruction would be outed, and the rest of us could simply live life.

       This is a good question, and I suspect the answer will vary per individual. I haven't put great thought into this before, and I need to also consider that I am not truly or at least fully awake either. We all have misconceptions of some kind, but the first thing I would point to is what many have termed the "Big Lie". There are so many things that go into it, that I couldn't name all of them. But for starters, the false left vs. right paradigm of our two party system. I don't believe that such a system will ever generate a candidate of the people, because it is too finite, and most people don't understand that they need to have a role in the caucus system to get good candidates on the ballot in the first place. Anybody who votes but doesn't know about the caucus system or the electoral college, I would consider not to be truly awake. Voting doesn't really mean much if you don't have good options to choose from. I could go on for a long time about the history of money and how we are manipulated by the hidden tax of inflation, how our buying power is destroyed by money printing, how our money is not technically legal, but that's getting very specific. I'm trying to think of a way to be more general, but I think the basic rule of thumb is that you either question everything and find evidence for what you believe in or you don't.

       i agree with everything you said. to me, also, it feels like a constant zooming-out process, where along the way you realize that what is out is also in, 'as above so below' style. you mention you're religious-- other than mitigating the fear, what role has your faith played in your awakening?

       My initial awakening came because of people who cared enough to give me a push in the right direction. That they were also people of faith was coincidental at the time, I only found that out later. So directly, I would say my faith did not have a large influence in my awakening from the standpoint that what I believe in did not push me in that direction on its own accord. But I do believe that those people were brought into my perspective for good reason, and that we share the same role in what I perceive to be a spiritual war. I have always believed in spiritual warfare, and yes, the aspects of the illuminati and their occultist ways fit well into the existing world view of my opposition. But before I became aware of what is going on, I never really considered my opposition to be actual people. I thought it was all in the spiritual realm, having to do with me internally, and I don't discount that, but I didn't realize the extent to which the enemy works through people in this world, because I never really wanted to believe that people would willingly choose the wrong side. Also I am not really a religious person, as that to me implies ritualistic behavior and structure. I am not against those things, but that's not what my faith means to me. I do not attend church although I have visited many over the years. For me it is about maintaining a relationship with my savior, and that is something that I think is personal for each individual to some degree. Many of those who wear the name of how I would label myself do not wear it well, and I am wary of being associated with wolves in sheep's clothing.

       Dude you sound just like me. All your thoughts put succinctly in the post and I can relate to them all. For me, my awakening and seeing the true darkness within man has actually strengthened my faith, as in my heart there is now no doubt there is a spiritual war going on.  Everything is backwards. What's good is bad, what's bad is good. But I too, like the other poster said, look forward to what's beyond death. I just feel in my heart there's work to be done, and I constantly feel guilty when I'm not productive. I also have two young children who depend on me.

       I hear you. When you begin to witness evil manifesting in the world instead of just being aware that it's out there somewhere, it really drives home how important faith really is, because the alternative can be quite frightening. Of course that's not a good reason to have faith in the first place and isn't my main motivation, but it's definitely comforting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I share your sentiment of feeling guilty when I'm not productive. I have wasted far too much time, and also feel compelled to do more good in the world, but I'm somewhat lacking in direction, yearning to find my place to make a positive impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyroad, you have my best wishes for you and your children. They are the most important thing, more important than being productive. Please be sure they are well equipped.

      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed you were a bit frustrated with the piles of shit going on in today's society.You also mentioned a couple times you didn't know what to do. Someone gave a great piece of advice before. She told me to follow my heart and I'll never regret it. And I thought about it for a while. And then it clicked. When I'm lying on my deathbed I'll be smiling.

       I know it sounds a bit cheesy but it's given me back my purpose. And I'm so grateful now. I won't get into details but things are really good for me right now. I'm finally doing what I love.

       I appreciate your response, kindred spirit. I definitely do follow my heart and my conscience. It is probably the only reason I sleep at night. I guess I just wish I could do more, but maybe I need to accept that the only true good I can do is in my own heart, and if I can win the war inside myself that's more than good enough.

       I get that, I really do, and for the longest time I was OK with that. But something feels different lately, lives are on the line and being lost, people I know and love, not just in the headlines. Realistically I will probably never achieve the perfect inner vision of myself because I am human and inherently flawed, and I don't want to let that be a reason to hold me back either, but I suppose if I don't know what else to do then focusing on myself is the logical choice.

       I think all we can really do is be the best beacon we can be, and be the light for another when crossing paths. There are people in need everywhere. I think I've had an apiphany. I need to be out there, actively engaged, not so involved in my own introspection.

       The main reason why I believe the chemtrail explanation to be implausible is that it's virtually impossible to let's say spray a region and precisely predict where the plume is going to settle. It's too rudimentary in scope and would have major unintended collateral consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second reason is that there are vastly more efficient and effective ways of covertly influencing or manipulating a populace by chemical means. Taint food sources, containers (plastics), products for daily hygiene, medicine etc. merely by allowing or enforcing industries to use certain ingredients. 
3/4's of what you find in a supermarket anywhere on the planet is basically unfit for human consumption, the remaining 1/4 comes at a price that is unaffordable to most to have on a consistent daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for a lot of medicine or just getting decent health care in general. The protocols laid out by the FDA, CDC, NHS, NPAA, what have you ... aren't meant to cure the root cause of illnesses, but to, at the very best, mask symptoms or even downright kill the patients if they're deemed expendable or undesirable (psychiatry, oncology, dermatology etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But I want to stave off that route for a moment and talk about what it is in my opinion that's causing people to go off their rockers. People feel trapped. It's the lack of a meaningful purpose to living the life of a corporate slave whose emotions have been hijacked and reduced to mere channels of exploitation. Humans are validation seeking creatures. Deprive them of the ways to get that and they'll go to whatever lengths that are demanded to attain them. If they're unable to, then they feel inadequate, become depressed, go mad, become suicidal etc. If they attain them, but the pleasurability falls below of what they've expected, they feel cheated and also become depressed, go mad etc.

       People are being forced to live to standards that are unattainable in a make-belief system of smoke and mirrors without at least causing serious harm to themselves or others.

      <p>
       Suicide isn't so much about wanting to die, but an assertion of the will to live if circumstances would've been more favourable, if an accumulation of misfortunes wasn't a death sentence to the relative well-being of an individual.

      <p>
       I hope I am making a little sense here.

       In my experience, on the days where chemtrails are prevalent, they are not targeted. They are layered for a period of time, usually the bulk of a particular day, and the wind carries them all over the county. We don't normally have smog in my area, but on those days there is a pretty blatant loss in visibility as well. It's more of a parts per million type deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I do not know the reason behind the trails because I am not behind it. I am only speculating. Other possible reasoning could be to induce global warming if we are potentially entering a new ice age or simply to dupe people into supporting a global carbon tax to undermine national sovereignty. I don't know, but I do agree with you that there are many other potential means to drug the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       I definitely believe that big pharma has a hand in destroying our minds, altering our DNA which influences behaviors, and I avoid prescription drugs at all costs. As you stated, they treat symptoms, not the causes. They create dependency.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I do want to thank you for being both thoughtful and civil even though we may not see eye to eye on everything. Your insight on why people are going off the deep end makes sense to me and has helped me rationalize what I am seeing a little bit better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although my concern isn't simply constrained to why, even though that is a big part of it, but also why so many people so suddenly. This was never a thing for me until this year, and now it blew up out of nowhere. It feels like something is amiss, because I don't understand what is suddenly different this season than the last few.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like there is something I can't quite put my finger on. For my family member in particular, this was a person who had a family, who was very talented, who had much to live for. It is very difficult to understand, and the only thing that makes sense to me is mental illness even though I could identify no signs of it.

       The trails are not aimed at any one place. They are aimed at covering the sky with white to 'reflect some of the sunlight'
      </p>
      <p>
       it's a stupid idea because they are using nano scale aluminum and it's more of a dull grey than a reflective surface, so what's meant to reflect  turns out to be only metal particles heating up  in the sunlight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The perpetrators believe the particles never land on the surface. I was told this by military personnel on Usenet around 2003.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the particles reach the surface they are breathed and then migrate to the human pituitary gland where they cause a wide range of neuro degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's , ADHD, Bipolarism, Dementia.... Thus you will see a steady increase in mental disorders for years to come.

       I think it's funny how in the link about creating aluminum resistant crops tries to spin it as if it's a naturally occurring phenomenon. As if crops never grew properly before 2008. That's a laugher.

       Per the newswire link - it sounds like I'll want to add a zinc supplement in addition to my detox routine.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is not uncommon to see toxic levels of lead, mercury, aluminum, and copper on lab test results of mood and behaviour disorder patients. Most heavy metals are free radicals that induce oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation) and have a direct affinity for brain tissue. Heavy metal free-radicals have the ability to compromise brain tissue structure and metabolism. Toxic metal imbalances are associated with mood and behavior disorders.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Heavy metals make the body's metal removing protein, metallothionein, work hard to excrete them. In the process of ridding heavy metals, this protein loses zinc which further compromises the ability to transcribe brain proteins including neurotransmitters.

       I feel you too. I do think we are in the age where everything will come to the surface pretty soon, on an individual and collective basis, lies and schemes will be uncovered, that is just the wave we are riding, and I really believe that. Trying to convince people of anything when they aren't ready is futile, but as soon as they have a sliver of an open mind, they may see. Back in the day when scientists were trying to say maybe earth wasnt center of the universe they'd be killed, and even now scientists and academics hold fast to their conclusions long past the time gathering evidence shows them questionable. It seems to be the nature of the matrix here to be tricked and asleep. I believe once you're ''awake'', meaning just open and questioning, the game is over in a sense and you cannot stop an idea whose time has come.

       Thanks for this post.  I've come to the conclusion that everything we see is false and even the alt right, everyone in it is false.  Even abby martin whom I'm in love with, is false.  I know this is sad, but I guess the best you can do is rate people based on how many values line up with your own and use that as a guide to continue listening to them, knowing also that one day they are going to say something that doesn't line up with your value and will seem like left field.  That's when your spider sense goes off and you can say.  Ok, that's the poison pill they want me to take.  Spit it out like a dog that wont' take his allergy medicine even if wrapped in velveeta

       Also, there are some people in this world who DO have a grip on things.  They are the ones with the most info, who've done the best study on these things and tied it together.  I'm glad to share this link to a website I think is important in this way, the

       The alt media, there's a topic I have a lot to say about. Pretty much anybody remotely resembling having a clue knows that the MSM is propaganda, but then they go to the alt media and eat it up like candy. As if the masters of propaganda wouldn't have a contingency plan for controlled opposition. I had a very strong feeling that Trump would get elected, because the MSM was against him and the alt media loved him. So everybody would buy into him being as being a man of the people. Let's stick it to the man and elect an outsider. It's such an obvious setup. If as a society we actually had a clue we would have elected Darrell Castle from the Constitution Party, because he understands that the UN is far more dangerous to our national sovereignty than NATO, and that we need to get back on a gold standard to regain control of our money and prevent the money printers from lobbying to change laws in their favor, because when money is backed by an asset you can't print it from thin air without also adding an equivalent amount of that asset, which has a baked in labor cost to acquire that asset, and is the only reason that money ever had value to begin with.

       But I digress. That's an interesting web site. It does look a little hokey to me, but that's not a logical reason to dismiss information. Never shoot the messenger. I'll give it a look.

       Prescription drugs have a lot to do with the high level of craziness we see around us today. Almost everyone is on prescription drugs that they don't need, and that are screwing up their ability to think rationally. Even small children are on methamphetamine, to keep them controlled.
