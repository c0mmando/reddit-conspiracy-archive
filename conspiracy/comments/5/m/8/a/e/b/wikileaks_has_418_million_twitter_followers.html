    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll bite...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not fighting WikiLeaks or &quot;truth,&quot; I&#39;m fighting the blind allegiance and defense of WikiLeaks.  Treat it like any other media or political organization.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also fighting the idea that if you are skeptical of WikiLeaks (myself, since 2010) then you are some kind of sheep.  It doesn&#39;t have to be the MSM or WikiLeaks.  </p>

<p>Ultimately, I want to know who is pushing that narrative - that it&#39;s one or the other; that the MSM is totally corrupt, but WikiLeaks isn&#39;t.  I also want to know how people know that, given how much WikiLeaks has changed in terms of security and proof.</p>

<p>Every day this sub is spammed with people saying &quot;watch out for shills&quot; or &quot;they are going to say he&#39;s a russian spy,&quot; trying to head off any criticism whatsoever.</p>

<p>So, I want the truth from WikiLeaks or whoever can prove they are being truthful and aren&#39;t holding back any information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt the authenticity of what they leak, well I don&#39;t much care one way or the other, but I think that what they choose to release and when should be viewed as very important. That coupled with the relationships that WikiLeaks/Assange have and the comments they make.</p>

<p>I was sick of Assange before he skipped bail, but I feel bad for his persecution and really take that into consideration. However, I have recently become even more fed up with him/WikiLeaks. Whoever operates their Twitter account is far too political and desperate for attention - like that &quot;severed by state actor&quot; crap when Ecuador denied him the Wifi password, and seeing them offering money for leaks now, specifically from the Obama admin, seems really off to me.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean to say &quot;WikiLeaks is compromised!&quot; or whatever, and I know they&#39;re a target. It&#39;s like u/schoofer says, not black and white.</p>

<p>I saved this comment from another thread </p>

<p>For an organization dedicated to &quot;transparency&quot; and &quot;neutrality,&quot; I&#39;m a bit confused by this AMA... So far, you&#39;ve:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>outright refused to respond to several of the most important issues with such a powerful and unchecked publication like WL (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9uktsw/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9un6hg/">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9umchd/">here</a>, for example), </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9umva5/">championed the citizen journalism on reddit</a> in spite of the <strong>constant flow of misinformation and unsubstantiated rumors</strong> that were created and perpetuated by these &quot;investigations&quot; that fail to live up to your alleged standard of journalistic integrity and ethics, </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9unh7o/">sensationalized non-stories</a> and actively <em>remove</em> context to be most damaging to Hillary&#39;s campaign,</p></li>
<li><p>passively <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9uoxzw/">encouraged witchhunting</a> businesses with little-to-no evidence to substantiate the baffling rumors that you&#39;ve encouraged, </p></li>
<li><p>touted the anonymity of your sources without acknowledging the agendas you further <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9unf8f/">by never questioning the leakers&#39; political motivations</a>, </p></li>
<li><p>openly declared that you time the releases for &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9ujqro/">maximum impact</a>&quot; as opposed to the &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9uncbe/">get it out as quickly as possible</a>&quot; model you also claim to employ (i.e. intentionally waiting until after the primaries were finished to leak the DNC emails), </p></li>
<li><p>hid behind the claim that you never received any leaks about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9uk41g/">Trump campaign</a> even though <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9uoawv/">Assange has said otherwise</a> (not to mention how incredibly convenient an excuse that is, since it&#39;s completely unverifiable; I find it nearly impossible to believe that <em>no one</em> leaked <em>anything</em> about one of the most polarizing figures of modern times, especially considering the breadth of the scandals in the mainstream media...you&#39;re telling us that <em>no one</em> who leaked these stories/tapes/whatever to CNN <em>also</em> sent any of it to you? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9urfmr/">Or was the information just supposedly not of interest or consequence</a>, while Podesta&#39;s family&#39;s taste in performance art and Hillary&#39;s daily musings with Huma were?, </p></li>
<li><p>refused to respond to people questioning your <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9unl85/">merchandising</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9uonlb/">supporting Trump</a> while still claiming impartiality, </p></li>
<li><p>claimed that you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9ukyjx/">research and contextualize the leaks</a> before publications yet refuse to identify the sources and their motivations and do nothing to investigate the opposing campaign for a truly nonpartisan stance, </p></li>
<li><p>repeatedly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9upfon/">failed to</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9umv4l/">accept your</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9ul7e1/">direct role in</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9ujodx/">the election</a>, regardless of your intentions or those of your sources. This isn&#39;t an academic exercise in open-journalism, this is a real life issue with real life consequences that require a level of nuance and counter-investigation to <em>truly</em> remain impartial.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And that&#39;s just to name a few of my burning questions/concerns. While I understand your stance on your sources&#39; anonymity may be genuine in your minds, your claims &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9up6ox/">Every source of every journalist has an intention and an agenda, may it be hidden or clear. Requesting the intention from our sources would firstly likely jeopardize their anonymity, and secondly form a bias in our understanding of the information we received</a>&quot; are inherently contradictory - every source has an agenda and a bias, but somehow WL and your choice/timing of publications does not? And investigating further would form a bias? Or...it would make your decisions more informed and, as you put it, contextualized...</p>

<p>You also say <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5c8u9l/we_are_the_wikileaks_staff_despite_our_editor/d9um1j9/">&quot;Working at WikiLeaks I know we do work with our submissions a lot for validation, <strong>how to present and where and when</strong>.
What we do not do is censor. We believe in full access to information and knowledge for all citizens. <strong>We do not think we are the gatekeepers of information</strong> and your right to know. We publish what we receive that is true, for you all to see. <strong>Your right to information shouldn&#39;t be controlled by others</strong>&quot;</a> yet you <em>become</em> said gatekeepers by default and <em>control</em> the information you release by dumping it all instead of picking and choosing as well as timing it for impact. </p>

<hr/>

<h2>So after all of this, my actual question would be how can we, as ordinary citizens (deprived of <em>your</em> internal communications that would verify your nonpartisanship etc), hold WikiLeaks as accountable as you would have us hold every other leader and publication?</h2>

<p>but, you cannot say they don&#39;t have a huge bias. they are openly bashing and ex-president and the spouse of one who was running for president. </p>

<p>that is them deliberately alienating (pissing off) half of the american public.</p>

<p>so you can&#39;t say you&#39;re surprised to see americans speak negatively about WL, when WL were the ones who brought unnecessary bias into their &quot;reporting&quot;</p>

<p>read the WL AMA from a few months back, see how they responded to the questions about the Bill Clinton shirts. what they report may be 100% fact, they are choosing what to report and what not. and with a huge bias.</p>

<p>When you tell the average American that Wikileaks has been 100% accurate for the past 10 years, the response is almost universal:</p>

<p>They cock their head, blink twice slowly, and then change the subject. <em>People literally reboot to ignore the information you just told them.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wholeheartedly understand and agree. With that said.</p>

<p>The MSM fear mongering has told people WikiLeaks is illegal. They have such a corrupt hold. People think it&#39;s high tech jargon above and beyond their understanding, with computer wars like Hollywood portrays (exploding 4chan van, anyone)</p>

<p>It&#39;s fear mongering. Pandering to drama for ratings. Cherry picking the stories. Cherry picking WikiLeaks stories for <em>just the right time</em> that help them push an agenda.</p>

<p>There is a special place in hell for what TPTB and media mogules are doing to this world. </p>

<p>God bless us all, good luck. We&#39;re gonna need it.</p>
