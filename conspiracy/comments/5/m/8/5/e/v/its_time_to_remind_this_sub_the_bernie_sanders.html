        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m seeing this sub be very pro Bernie lately. When I bring up the fact that he was controlled opposition, had an agreement with the Clinton campaign, or works for George Soros I get buried because people think it&#39;s not true. I just want people to take a look and see for yourself. I hope that people will wake up and stop letting this puppet fool you. I have attached his voting record, donations, and wikileaks emails showing he was in an agreement with the Clinton campaign.</p>

<p>moveon.org donations</p>

<hr/>

<p>Bernie is funded by a man who goes by the name of George Soros. No conspiracy here it&#39;s just hypocritical to take donations from a man who is part of the tip top 1%. And now it has come to our knowledge that he will vote for Hilary Clinton, someone he supposedly fundamentally disagrees with.</p>

<hr/>

<p>NDAA: Bernie Sanders: YES, Appropriates $80.71 billion for overseas contingency operations for fiscal year 2014 (Secs. 4102, 4202, 4302, 4402 &amp; 4502). As well as removing due process giving the government total control over who gets due process &amp; who doesn&#39;t. It permits the military to detain individuals indefinitely without trial. Bernie sanders voted yes on this, not to mention the increase in defense spending?Source: <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/46311">https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/46311</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Cyber Security Act: Bernie Sanders: YES, this bill is very simple to understand, tt literally destroys net neutrality. Generally speaking, net neutrality means that an Internet service provider such as cable or phone company treats all content equally. For example, it doesn’t offer faster transmissions for Netflix videos than it does for those from Amazon Prime. Bernie sanders voted yes to passing this bill.... Had that been passed internet would have been utterly destroyed as we know it.Source: <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/41957S">https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/41957S</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Amdt 2372: Bernie Sanders:NO, This bill is simple to understand why it is needed. It Prohibits the EPA from spying on farmers. And it adds better regulation to school meal programs &amp; provides better healthier food for the kids. It also provides better regulation on what chemicals are put in our food. Bernie sanders voted no on this decent bill. Source: <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/40805">https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/40805</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>USA FREEDOM Act: Bernie Sanders: YES, this bill is also very simple to understand, it extends the patriot act (implemented by bush), The patriot act is a bill that expands federal law enforcement power. It erodes our freedoms by, allowing the government to watch &amp; monitor our phone calls, emails, texts, etc. Basically eliminating the right to privacy in your own home. The fact this bill extends the patriot act is horrible &amp; Bernie Sanders voted for it. Source: <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/50592S">https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/50592S</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Amdt 139: Bernie Sanders: NO, this bill again is simple to understand. This bill prevents the UNITED NATIONS from taking away our fire arms. It basically strips the UNITED NATIONS of any law enforcement in America period. Source: <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/43297S">https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/43297S</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Amdt 1491: Bernie Sanders: NO, again this bill is very simple to understand as well. It extends the STOCK Act to ensure that the reporting requirements set forth in the STOCK Act apply to the executive branch and independent agencies. It prevents companies from evading taxes.

President George W. Bush later used the Iraqi Liberation Act to provide justification for military action for the 2003 invasion. <a href="https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/8577#.VmSrar9oF-A">https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/8577#.VmSrar9oF-A</a></p>

I served as a support person for a dozen or so Vermonters who sat-in in his Burlington office a couple weeks into that war. Not only did Sanders refuse to talk with us via telephone (unlike his Vermont counterparts in the Senate-Leahy and Jeffords), he had his staff call the local police to arrest those who refused to leave until Sanders spoke with them. The following week Sanders held a town hall meeting in Montpelier, VT., where he surrounded himself with sympathetic war supporters and one university professor who opposed the war and Bernie&#39;s support for it. During the question and answer part of the meeting, Sanders yelled at two of the audience&#39;s most vocal opponents to his position and told them to leave if they didn&#39;t like what he had to say.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2001, Bernie supported HR 1954, which extended the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1996.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Following the 9/11 attacks, Bernie voted in favor of H J Res 64 - Authorization for Use of Military Force, which allowed President Bush to use the United States Armed Forces against anyone involved with 9/11 and any nation that harbors these individuals.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2002, Bernie voted against H J Res 114, which authorized President Bush to use military force against Iraq. However, he would continue to support bloated military defense bills that would ultimately be used to sustain the war he allegedly disagreed with.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2003, Bernie supported HR 5010, which provided $355.1 billion in appropriations for the Defense Department for fiscal year 2003 - an increase of $37.5 billion from 2002 - as well as: $71.6 billion for procurement of aircraft, missiles, weapons, combat vehicles and shipbuilding; $7.4 billion for ballistic missile defense; and $58.4 million for foreign aid, which includes humanitarian assistance, foreign disaster relief and de-mining programs.</p>

<hr/>

<p>He also voted in favor of HR 2800 - Foreign Operations Appropriations, FY 2004 bill, which granted $1.8 billion in military and economic assistance to Egypt and $2.2 billion for Israeli military assistance.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2004, Bernie supported HR 4613, which allocated $25 billion for emergency defense spending for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and $77.4 billion for the procurement of new weapons.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2005, Sanders supported HR 2863 - Defense Department FY2006 Appropriations Bill, which provided $50 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2006, Bernie voted for HR 5631, which provided $70 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2007, he supported HR 1585 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which granted $187.14 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan operations.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2009, he voted in favor of HR 2647, which authorized $309 million for research and evaluation, procurement, or deployment of an alternative Missile Defense System in Europe, and also allowed the Secretary of Defense to increase the active-duty number for the US Army to a number greater than otherwise allowed by law up to the 2010 baseline plus 30,000 troops. During the same year, he called closing the torturous gulag at Guantanamo a &quot;complicated issue&quot; and ultimately rejected a proposal to shut it down.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2011, Bernie co-sponsored S. Res. 85, which urged the UN Security Council to take action to protect civilians in Libya from attack, including the possible imposition of a no-fly zone over Libyan territory.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In 2014, Bernie came out in favor of levying economic sanctions (an act of war) against Russia: &quot;The entire world has got to stand up to Putin,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;ve got to deal with sanctions.&quot;That same year, Bernie didn&#39;t object to having his name included - by unanimous consent - in S.498, which backed Israel&#39;s brutal, summer-long military assault against Gaza.Most recently, he vowed to continue Obama&#39;s murderous international drone war.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Bernie also supports funneling weapons into Iraq to fight ISIS as well as airstrikes, and he continues to spread the myth that Iran seeks to build nuclear weapons.</p>

<hr/>

<p>All of this information is publicly available and verifiable with a Google search. But hes for the people right? Bernie Sanders has a terrible voting record that tramples on the constitution and wastes billions of dollars. Sanders is proof that if you speak with a gravely, authoritative voice and tell people what they want to hear, you can gain national attention. Only once every several decades does someone come along who is so cunning, manipulative and masterful at combining nationalism, authoritarianism, propaganda and hatred into one slick campaign. Not sure what is more amazing, how brilliantly he is executing this strategy while working to appear folky or how many people are falling for it. It&#39;s really stunning. Please Bernie is not the savior you are looking for. Read some books about high level manipulation techniques and carefully analyze the lack of substance in what he says.﻿</p>

<p>Written by user <strong>rk3yb0arD</strong> - And no, just because I dislike Bernie and Hilary does not mean I support Trump in the slightest. Thank you very much.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now a bit of research from me that has been common knowledge for MONTHS that this sub has seemingly forgot: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/47397">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/47397</a></p>

<p>Bernie had an agreement with the Clinton campaign from the start. They had leverage on him from the start. He wasn&#39;t even allowed to run until he made the agreement. He has ALWAYS been controlled opposition that answers to the billionaires like George Soros. I want this sub to stop drinking the &quot;Bernie is a good old grandpa&quot; koolaid.</p>

<p>Edit: The brigade has arrived. Now all the comments are flipping in vote counts. 6 upvote comments now -2. It was good while it lasted. This sub won&#39;t wake up and lets the establishment control the narrative.</p>

<p>Or maybe that&#39;s just how you&#39;re reading into it, to confirm your bias. Do you look at Trump with a similar critical eye?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Probably not the fantasy you have invented to preserve him as a good person in your mind. Sorry if you voted for him but you have to get past your sunk cost fallacy that is making you feel attached to him and making you feel like you need to justify why he is good to you. He&#39;s a bad man.</p>

<p>Or this is an Occam&#39;s Razor and the simplest solution is the answer. I supported what Bernie stood for (anti-establishment) while neither of the other two major candidates were/are, even though I did not vote for Bernie. </p>

<p>Yes. I&#39;m very critical of his appointments. I hope he is appoint people that the establishment wanted so he could allow himself to get into office and later with enough backing of the people he could then oust them but yes, a few things definitely concern me.</p>

<p>Now, you should not be comparing Bernie to Trump. Every time Bernie comes up his supporters somehow bring up Trump. He intentionally lost. Get over it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Faggot hasn&#39;t meant a bundle of sticks for several hundred years. It has been used as a derogatory term for homosexuals since at least the 1950s. The modern use of faggot might not have been derived from the bundle of sticks meaning at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kike, nigger, spick, cuck, gook </p>
</blockquote>

<p>All those words have a specific meaning. So does cuck. Cuck is short for cuckold. It originally meant a man whose wife was unfaithful without his knowledge. That usage has become rather rare (although if you&#39;ve seen The Royal Tennenbaums you&#39;ll remember that Bill Murray&#39;s character tells his unfaithful wife &quot;You&#39;ve made a cuckold of me.&quot;). Cuckold is now most commonly used to refer to men who enjoy seeing their wife fucked by other men. </p>

<p>This is entirely distinct from a sexual submissive, who is simply a person who enjoys being dominated. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like really quit your bitching about words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aw, you&#39;re sad I just made you my semantic submissive.</p>

<p>In 2014, Bernie came out in favor of levying economic sanctions (an act of war) against Russia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, that&#39;s laughable.  Economic sanctions are an act of war?  How far is the place you copied and pasted that from reaching in order to smear Bernie?  They&#39;re reaching pretty fucking far.</p>

<p>Not to say that you don&#39;t bring up points, but sometimes the person with the message matters.  Especially when that person hasn&#39;t done their due diligence on the things they state strongly.</p>

<p>You are cherry picking one line out of 50 about how Bernie votes for things for the establishment. You are avoiding who funds him. You are avoiding that he had an agreement with the Clinton campaign. You are trying to gloss past all that by mentioning my username and one line.</p>

<p>And, yes: I read your post, and I picked the most obviously ridiculous thing.  That one thing shows you didn&#39;t do your due diligence.  And you posted this wall as if it was to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>But, clearly, you didn&#39;t do your due diligence and you&#39;re puppets get something that is clearly slanted enought to believe that 2014 economic sanctions against Russia are an act of war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I have 80k karma on T_D. I door knocked for Trump. My opinion is that he was no supposed to win. He moved up to the blue wall where they thought they had the election won and could steal 1 or two states to lock it down. But when he made the blue wall move they had not prepared and he pulled it out. My personal opinion is there was a coup at the fbi and some agents went rouge and stopped the other side from hacking machines. Some shit went down. I think Trump is one of the first people to be elected in a long time that was not picked in advance.</p>

<p>That being said, anyone can be got to. The most decent men can be brought to their knees by threatening their family. I hope he is just playing along and plans to out them all but some things make me wonder if some powerful people aren&#39;t trying to make him toe the line.</p>

<p>Time will tell. I would take Trump over Clinton any day of the week.</p>

The language in which it intends to be developed and enacted doesn&#39;t always equate to the simplified and cherry-picked versions of your specific echo chamber media. You can support a cause, but not any legislation that has built in ulterior motives, even if the overarching agenda is one you agree with.

<p>This isn&#39;t in keeping w the agreement. Since we clearly have some
leverage, would be good to flag this for him. I could send a signal via
Welch--or did you establish a direct line w him?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the context of the rest of the email chain, it seems pretty clear that the two campaigns had an agreement not to go after each other on specific issues, in this case, Clinton&#39;s wealth. The Clinton campaign therefore had &quot;leverage&quot; because Sanders broke the agreement by talking negatively about her wealth. </p>

<p>Such an agreement would be entirely consistent with everything Sanders said when he started his campaign, namely that he wanted the Democratic candidate to win in the general. You can disagree with him that Clinton would have been better than Trump (and I do disagree), but this email hardly proves there was some secret agreement for Sanders to act as a decoy or controlled op. </p>

<p>Not saying I know for sure that he isn&#39;t, but I don&#39;t really get that vibe. He wants a strong social safety net and liberal social policy, and that&#39;s the same thing he&#39;s been fighting for since he was an obscure Vermont politician that no one had ever heard of. </p>

<p>The entire post was ad hominem.  Pretty flagrantly.  He went through my search history, removed context, and put it forward publicly in a tree where I am making one point--namely that OP put a hit piece out on Bernie, copy and pasted it, and didn&#39;t even read at, as well as the &quot;act of war&quot; nonsense--and was using his little hit post to discredit me and what I&#39;m posting on this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha. The Whole quote is important to understand meaning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ad hominem (Latin for &quot;to the man&quot; or &quot;to the person&quot;[1]), short for argumentum ad hominem, is a logical fallacy in which an argument is rebutted by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.[2]</p>

<p>Fallacious ad hominem reasoning is normally categorized as an informal fallacy,[3][4][5] more precisely as a genetic fallacy, a subcategory of fallacies of irrelevance.</p>

<p><strong><em>However, in some cases, ad hominen attacks can be non-fallacious; i.e., if the attack on the character of the person is directly tackling the argument itself. For example, if the truth of the argument relies on the truthfulness of the person making the argument—rather than known facts—then pointing out that the person has previously lied is not a fallacious argument.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis my own. This is the case in which we find ourselves now, technically an ad hominem but a non-fallacious one because the observations on your character do directly relate to the argument you are making. First time I&#39;ve ever seen someone use the term to talk about something other than the logical fallacy, which is entirely different. &quot;Don&#39;t listen to this guy, he fucks kids&quot;   </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s damn hilariously ironic that you are objecting to someone cherry picking your history and posting the results to push a narrative about you personally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, so you were baiting me, eh? You didn&#39;t really want to know anything at all, you sly fox!  And I fell for it!  Oh, zinger!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s recap to see if you have anything of value to say.</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying that the post is not an ad hominem attack because you think me posting on politics, supporting Bernie, supporting Hillary, watching Padres games, being a fan of the Lakers, reading and being active on this subreddit, is an attack on my character that directly tackles my arguments?</p>

<p>My arguments being: </p>

<ol>
<li>OP copy and pasted everything</li>
</ol>

<p>So let&#39;s respond to that.  OP, hours ago, admitted to copying and pasting the entire post.</p>

<ol>
<li>That economic sanctions that multiple countries placed on Russia in 2014 is not an act of war.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, let&#39;s respond to that.  It isn&#39;t.  Beyond that, the person who is arguing it over and over has claimed some other interesting things, like Russia sent nothing but support, and that they were invited in.  This is ironic, because this is a conspiracy board--and that line of thought is directly in line with Russian propaganda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s damn hilarious you thought you had some gotcha moment, when I can&#39;t figure out how the fuck you made such a stupid mistake when it is so obvious throughout posts directly surrounding these ones we are making now.</p>

So, I will--this one time--do your due diligence for you.

<blockquote>
<p>(4) the term “act of war” means any act occurring in the course of—
(A) declared war;
(B) armed conflict, whether or not war has been declared, between two or more nations; or
(C) armed conflict between military forces of any origin; and</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no declared war.  There was no armed conflict between the US and Russia.  And there was no armed conflict between the US and a terrorist group within Russia.  There is no act of war within economic sanctions.  There could be, if there was a declared war, but there wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>So, what is an act of war?  Russia moving soldiers into Ukraine and occupying Crimea.  Exactly what the sanctions were in response to.</p>

<p>Now, there&#39;s also a Casus Belli.  What that is, I&#39;m going to leave up to you.  But this gets a little bit less easy to understand, so you&#39;ll have to want to do the research.  Me?  I&#39;m done educating the bottom of society.  I&#39;m done educating you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, unless a war is declared it doesn&#39;t count. The covert overthrows of governments aren&#39;t acts of war either since they don&#39;t involve armed conflict and weren&#39;t declared. </p>

<p>Using a law dictionary as a semantic distinction is idiotic when we aren&#39;t arguing over what a law means, cornell is useful for laws... not for common parlance.... which is what we are discussing. Do you realize that law definitions are sometimes different than dictionary definitions?</p>

<p>(Hypothetical) Cutting off all imports to a country which then starves isn&#39;t an act of war. Denying all exports and plunging a country into poverty isn&#39;t an act of war either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congratulations on removing context.</p>

<p>Let me make this crystal clear.</p>

<p>Russia invaded Ukraine.  That is an act of war.</p>

<p>Because of that, many countries placed economic sanctions on Russia.  The United States did so, also.  Bernie supported those sanctions.</p>

<p>See the difference?  It&#39;s crystal clear.  Russia invaded Ukraine.  In response, many countries placed economic sanctions.</p>

<p>That&#39;s about as far from an act of war as possible.  Especially considering that that could have actually started a world war, in which case, Russia invading Ukraine would still have been the &quot;act of war&quot; that precipitated a war.</p>

<p>Exclamation point!</p>

<p>Ukraine was overthrown by the western Elites, including the USA funneling over 5 billion dollars to support NEO-<strong>NAZI&#39;s</strong>, who through force and violence(murders and rapes and bloodshet) overthrew Ukraine&#39;s official elected government and took over.</p>

<p>The region known as Crimea who is comprised of 95% people of Russian nationality VOTED in DEMOCRATIC way to separate from Ukraine and join Russian, because they didn&#39;t want to be under <strong>NAZI</strong> rule! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post OP. This is the very reason is never jumped on the Bernie bandwagon... one look at his record and you knew he was a total establishment shill. I was still kind of a leftie back in 08, but one look at Dr. Paul&#39;s record earned him my vote. Now there was a man who stuck to his guns. When he was actively blocked by the GOP establishment (too bad Bernie bros have no sense of history, they wouldve learned something...), I went for Cynthia McKinney, because, she also <em>had a fantastic record</em>. </p>

<p>Bernie was a sellout before he even ran. Of course he was going to bend over for HRC to ram that infamous strap-on up his and his supporter&#39; asses. He was a steamvalve for youngsters who still believe that if they only <em>got the right people in</em> socialism in america would work. </p>

Your boy is a LIAR and you believed all of it, swallowed for him....lmao...sigh...<br/>
Bernie was a better candidate than anyone running and is a better person on his worst day than donnie could ever hope to be and we ALL know it.<br/>
So, instead of feeding the machine, supplying tptb with more division of the 99% how about you set your sights on the Machine and not on people that wanted change as much as you did.<br/>
The Machine is the enemy, not Bernie, for christ&#39;s sake the election is over...what kind of moron is still fighting about Bernie two week&#39;s away from donnie&#39;s big day?<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m confused as to why some of these are included. For example: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Feb 2009) Voted YES on $60B stimulus package for jobs, infrastructure, &amp; energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might think stimulus packages are bad economics but I don&#39;t see how this makes him controlled opposition. </p>

<p>Other ones are kind of misleading. For example: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2006, Bernie voted for HR 5631, which provided $70 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was an appropriation bill. A quick look at the 2005 appropriations shows it was more than $70 billion so he actually voted to give less money to the war effort. That could be wrong though because it doesn&#39;t how the $70 billion was calculated. There was a hell of a lot more than $70 billion appropriated in that bill so it is hard to even compare. </p>

<p>I think you are reading a lot more into the email than is there. I think the &quot;agreement&quot; is just referring to not attacking each other. </p>

<p>Also, why do you think he is controlled by Soros? The only link I can find between the two is that Soros once donated to MoveOn, a third party that gave money to Bernie&#39;s campaign. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you talking about <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/47397">this email</a>? </p>

<p>In the context of that email chain, it would make a lot more sense that Robby Mook was saying they had leverage on him because he broke an agreement the campaigns had not to go after for each other for certain things, in this case, bringing up Clinton&#39;s wealth as a negative. </p>

<p>That seems like a pretty straightforward and common sense agreement to have in a political primary so you don&#39;t beat each other up so much that they&#39;re at a disadvantage in the general. Sanders said from the beginning that he wanted whoever the Dem nominee was to win the general, so I&#39;m really not seeing anything underhanded here. Is there another email chain that references this agreement you&#39;re referring to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump isn&#39;t a fascist?  People keep saying this, but I think it&#39;s really an overstatement.  It depends on what you call a &quot;full blown fascist&quot;. </p>

<p>The definition of Fascism varies greatly.  Google defines it &quot;as an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump is definitely a heavy promoter of Nationalism(Make America Great Again).  And he is currently putting CEOs of some of the biggest companies in charge of the government(as well as military generals).  The Nazis are generally considered &quot;fascist&quot;.  And they were socialists.  The Nazis strategy, VERY similarly to trump, was to unite with the industrialists, and get rid of the bankers/Jews who were skimming(AKA drain the swamp).  </p>

<p>Being Fascist isn&#39;t inherently bad.  And if Hitler didn&#39;t kill the Jews, he wouldn&#39;t have been unarguably bad.  I&#39;m not saying the fact that Trump has Fascist tendencies, is inherently bad.  But to say that Trump&#39;s not a Fascist, in any way, I feel is farther from the truth than to say he is a full blow Fascist.  </p>

<p>Only time will tell.  But if he&#39;s really appointing this cabinet, and is really consolidating the Intelligence agency, and is really going for a SECURITY platform(security never comes without increasing gov&#39;t control), it seems pretty Fascist, at least now.  In a hundred days or so, it will be much more obvious.</p>

<p>Hitler wasn&#39;t just socialist.  He enacted some of the biggest socialist policies in human history, years before anybody else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>National Socialism in not socialism. If anything it was a facist ideology. Naming the party that was an attempt to pervert the meaning of the word socialism and to attract people to the party, since socialism was quite the thing in that age. </p>

<p>Richard Evans, author of a 3 volume history of Germany said: “…it would be wrong to see Nazism as a form of, or an outgrowth of, socialism.” 
Now please do tell me how you are more knowledgeable about German political ideology than the noted historians.  </p>

<p>Nazism is built on the idea of race. Social is built on the idea of class.<br/>
The Nazis dismantled trade unions and he supported handing over the economy to industrialists and monopolies.There was no socialist redistribution of wealth or land under Hitler.
  The economy, one of the linchpins of socialism, was considered to be unimportant by Hitler.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, who are we going to compare it to?  The USSR?  Are they socialist?  Because in reality, they didn&#39;t do much wealth transfer, except straight to the top.  </p>

<p>Hitler confiscated TONS of wealth, from the Jews and used it on government programs.  It was one of the biggest movements of wealth in history, and it was largely spent on government, or &quot;social&quot; programs.  After Hitler took office, that VAST increase in government spending, on MASSIVE social programs, caused the unemployment rate to drop massively, in a short period of time.</p>

<p>If you think Germany&#39;s economy went from one of the worst in the world after WW1, to big enough to take on the Soviets, UK, and USA at the same time, and it wasn&#39;t considered important by Hitler, and it just happened with no effort at all, you must be mad.  Of course he thought the economy was important.  Hitler&#39;s war machine was perhaps his most famous, and important political end, before or after the war started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, Nazism is built on the idea of race and not class. The only beneficiaries were those deemed worthy by the Nazis.<br/>
Hitler outright denied all forms of Marxist Socialism. So comparing their ideology to that of USSR is useless anyway. Hitler wanted the term socialism to mean something completely different that what it meant at the time. According to him, true socialism was not anti-property. He was also a staunch supporter of private industries and initiatives.   </p>

<p>The Nazi party never had a clear economic theory because of Hitler&#39;s early views on the economy:<em>&quot;world history teaches us that no person has become great through its economy but that a person can very well perish thereby&quot;</em>. He later concluded that <em>&quot;the economy is something of secondary importance&quot;.</em>   </p>

<p>He also believed that the lack of a precise economic programme was one of the Nazi Party&#39;s strengths, saying: &quot;The basic feature of our economic theory is that we have no theory at all.&quot; D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;According to him, true socialism was not anti-property. He was also a staunch supporter of private industries and initiatives.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, god.  Can you list a country that is socialist?  I mean, most socialist countries today are &quot;staunch supporters of private industries and initiatives&quot;.  No socialists countries are completely lacking a private sector.  And most of them have, and aim for VIBRANT private sectors.</p>

<p>You seem to be conflating Marxist Socialism, with Socialism.  I did not say that Hitler was a Marxist Socialist.  I said he was a National Socialist.  </p>

<p>Nazism is built on nationalism, not race.  Race, while a part, was largely for propaganda reasons(dealing specifically with Jews, and with giving Germans a unified image to unite around).  Many Nazis did not have Blonde Hair, and Blue eyes.  Hitler did not have blonde hair and blue eyes.  </p>

<p>Hitler has been quoted as saying that his main inspiration in the creation of the Nazis was Catholicism, and the Jesuits.  The incorporation of race, and they mythos of the blonde haired, blue eyed people who were by legend said to come from Antarctica, or various places depending on the particular myth, was simply a nod to the Catholic church&#39;s use of mysticism to control the people.</p>

<p>Once again, most of the leaders of the Nazi party did not have blonde hair, or blue eyes, and were not &quot;pure Aryans&quot;.  Just like how many Catholic Priests, who preach chastity, are actually child molesters.  They don&#39;t believe their own doctrines, because they&#39;re only purpose is to control people.  The Creators of the lies, obviously know they are lies.</p>

<p>It was about the NATION of Germany.  The Continuation of the Holy Roman Empire.  The racial stuff was, as I said, propaganda, only meant for consumption by the masses.</p>

<p>If so, please explain to me why the Communist USSR allied with the Nazis.  Then the Communist USSR fought the Nazis, and allied with Capitalist America.  Then, Capitalist America and Communist USSR defeat Nazis together.  Then, Capitalist America and Communist Russia go to Cold War.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say Bernie is funded by Sotos, however, many ppl trusted him specifically bec he was the <em>only</em> candidate that did <em>not</em> take money from any pacs, lobbyists or special interests (including Soros &amp; Kochs)-- the famous $27 donations from everyday Americans. They almost equaled what HC got from the oligarchy. That is an error on your part. </p>

<p>He was marginalized actively, viciously from his supposed party and still filled stadiums and entertained sparrows on his podium. He did win the primary, but was defrauded by blatant vote machine tampering and many other voter suppression crimes. Complaints were ignored and never investigated. </p>

<p>He was used by HC and obviously he had no power against her oligarchy pay to play and CF crime syndicate.  Remember Seth Rich?  </p>

<p>HC tried to hold congress votes against him during the debates, and he defended those decisions adequately, while she could say nothing of her bad judgment regarding many of  of her flip flop choices. </p>

<p>He is the only one with one goal in mind-- justice and equity for <em>all</em> Americans. Even now he fights for healthcare and SS for vulnerable ppl. Who else is doing that?  </p>

<p>The vote record you mention sounds bad, but there may be explanations you are not offering. We will not agree entirely w <em>any</em> candidate, but Bernie would be more trustworthy to respond to the will of we the ppl than any other option, no question. </p>
