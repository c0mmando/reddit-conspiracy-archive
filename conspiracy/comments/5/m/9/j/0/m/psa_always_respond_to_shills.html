        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of people (and alleged former shills) saying that the best way to deal with a shill is to ignore them. I posit that this is a clever way to make them seem unopposed and more believable.</p>

<p>My advice to all is to take the time to write detailed, evidence-based, and (most importantly) LOGIC-BASED posts. Shills aren&#39;t arguing with you to convince you, they&#39;re arguing with you to convince the audience. Lurkers far outnumber posters on reddit -- I remember when I was asleep, I would look to the comments to see how I felt about a given issue because I assumed the top-voted comments were just how the majority of us smart internet people felt. It&#39;s obvious to me now how bullshit that is (Swartz is spinning in his early grave over this I&#39;m sure) and how manipulated everything has become.</p>

<p>The only way to win is to out-monster the monster. We have to be better at slinging the truth than they are at slinging propaganda. The best way to do this is to explain the manipulation techniques after shills have used them as well as after WE use them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct them too! If anyone displays any psyop technique, call it out! For example, right now I&#39;m playing the rational guy who&#39;s trying to help everyone by getting them to follow a specific protocol. You&#39;re absolutely right to question it and look at the logic of it yourself. Pretend I didn&#39;t tell you the intended outcome and just think about the actual reasoning. I&#39;m sorry if I sound condescending or patronizing, I&#39;m really not trying to, I just want people to start using their heads more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your time is being spent doing research, then yeah - don&#39;t waste it. I get that you have lives and jobs and obligations. We all do. But I think this is about the future of our species. I want to live to see a day when our civilization gets past all this propaganda and conspiratorial bullshit. I think this shit is only going to get harder to stop, not easier. We&#39;ve taken some huge steps forward lately but now is not the time to back down. I, for one, am sick of this shit. I want to fix the planet and that means working on it and thinking about it whenever possible. You don&#39;t have to help me or even listen to me, I&#39;m just some text on your screen, but whether you trust me or not (hint: don&#39;t) this is how I&#39;m moving forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you view shills&#39; goals as being disinfo, then confronting them is a good strategy. </p>

<p>If you view their goal as bogging down constructive conversation and investigation by wasting people&#39;s time who argue with them, them ignoring is the best strategy.</p>

<p>I think its important to understand the distinction, since we see many of both in this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but I&#39;ve been warned and told by mods exactly to do the opposite: to ignore them.  In some ways I agree in many others, that you pointed out, I disagree with the &#39;be silent&#39; approach.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve maintained that shilling gives you an opportunity to show to others by way of demonstration, how they operate.</p>

<p>I point out the technique they use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Straw man argument -- you made up some point of view I don&#39;t have, then said I had it, then you attacked it.</li>
<li>Ad hominem attack--you attacked me, not the content</li>
<li>4D&#39;s  -- Deny, discredit, distract, deceive</li>
<li>Forum slide by way of posting gibberish to take up screen real estate</li>
<li>Forum slide by distracting religious garbage that borders on anti-(semitic, islamic, christian, masonic, other); also coincides with &#39;transfer propaganda&#39; to make this forum itself look antisemitic / other</li>
<li>False victimhood, &quot;it&#39;s a trick, we always use it&quot;</li>
<li>Poisoning the well</li>
<li>Gish gallop (see forum slide)</li>
<li>ALL CAPS INFANTILISM</li>
<li>&quot;tin foil hat&quot; name calling</li>
<li>Unsolicited Mental Health Diagnoses: Questioning my mental health, &quot;are you ok?&quot;  &quot;do you need to talk to a psychologist?&quot; &quot;you&#39;re a fucking schizophrenic lunatic&quot;, etc</li>
<li>Posting quasi science or scientism type reportage from corporate sponsored science to an audience that doesn&#39;t really know how to read science. But since it was used, it looks like you&#39;ve &quot;won the argument&quot; by posting a source no one read or understood.</li>
<li>100 other tricks of pseudoskeptics, shills, trolls and astoturfer forum spies</li>
</ul>

<p>The key thing I believe is like you said, OP, make LOGIC based comments.  Post source.  Back up your claims as calmly as you can.</p>

<p>Equanimity and facts will win the day.  You see they can&#39;t fight the truth.  It always wins and they are terrified by it.  They are terrified by you knowing the facts because then their war is over.</p>

<p>The war by the way is against YOU.  It&#39;s psychological in nature.  They are fighting over your mind and your perception of reality itself--they refer to this as the 4th world</p>

Sometimes, more times than I can count, I upvote and refresh and the points stay the same or reverse which to me is infuriating and dirty pool.<br/>

<p>I just block anyone I identify as a bad faith contributor. I don&#39;t care if someone is trolling because they&#39;re an asshole or if they&#39;re paid to do it, but I don&#39;t need that bullshit in my life. </p>

<p>I think that sort of mentality is part of what&#39;s gotten us into this mess in the first place: we ignore/block &quot;the enemy&quot; and effectively cut ourselves off from hearing whatever side of a debate. That might be effective for making you feel better about not talking to trolls, and I can&#39;t tell you what to do, but by doing it you&#39;re just letting these people&#39;s opinions/potential propaganda go uncontested. I think we need more dialogue with everyone and well-reasoned arguments in order to fix our problems -- and that means making sure EVERYONE is aware of what&#39;s going on and how to protect themselves. When people are using psyops techniques they must be pointed out as such, though not vilified as they are necessary tools at the moment.</p>

<p>I block people who are trolling, NOT people who disagree with me. The people I block aren&#39;t part of &quot;debate&quot; at all, they&#39;re the type who hear me criticize Clinton and then decide it&#39;s appropriate to call me a &quot;trumptard&quot;. </p>

A lot of fluff there, sure, but also lots of contents that gets quickly downvoted and sidelined by dedicated shills/bots and/or agents.
