        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was just watching coverage of the &quot;hate crime tortured teen&quot;... and this female analyst on the segment was accidentally caught on camera quietly laughing about something. This was while they were supposed to be disgusted with this incident. Wolf Blitzer was outraged and disgusted at this time.. and she is laughing off screen.</p>

<p>Of course this could have just been one of those nervous laugh moments where something went wrong behind the scenes.. but I felt like there was more there. Maybe it&#39;s all the craziness going on but it truly felt like a &quot;Truman Show&quot; moment...</p>

<p>Did anyone else see this?</p>

<p>Edit -  Here&#39;s the video - glad lots of people caught this. I am not the only one who saw this. I wish the guy who made the Youtube video would have put out the possibility this showed it was a psyop though.</p>

<p>Edit - This girl is pretty high profile -  maybe this is why she is an analyst on CNN or maybe she is a key person used in psyops -</p>

They hide the stuff they think is &#39;scary&#39; or &#39;too much to handle&#39; from us because they truly believe it&#39;s for our own good. Can&#39;t see how far it sets humanity back in the process, most of us are as clueless and inept as Truman was because of it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is the correct answer. People who report and analyze the news are no more than actors and they talk about supremely depressing stuff every day. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t make it out of reporting the local news to CNN by having a heart of gold. You get used to this kind of stuff and just act the part and report it. In reality they are probably just desensitized to it all and for all we know Bobby the intern brought penis shaped cookies to the potluck and she just got caught laughing at them when she thought the cameras weren&#39;t on her. </p>

<p>THE POWER PRINCIPLE: PART II: PROPAGANDA </p>

<p>It&#39;s a 3 part thing featuring interviews with Noam Chomsky and many others! Really great stuff. Slightly bias towards their own little narrative, but it&#39;s certainly up our alleyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not on you OP, I&#39;m sure you just found a copy of the video you were talking about, but seriously, a video of a phone that&#39;s playing a video recorded by a phone off a TV? And the guy clearly has a pretty decent studio set up, so why he couldn&#39;t do anything better than play the video on the phone is beyond me. </p>

<p>About the content, though, it might be something, but the way she looks when the camera cuts to her almost looks like she was confused about her cue, like she thought the camera was going to be on her a few seconds earlier, smiled nervously (I don&#39;t see a laugh) when she realized it wasn&#39;t, and then tried to regain her composure when it did come to her. </p>

<p>Not that I don&#39;t think CNN is running psyops in the broad sense of the term — I think many of the major players are part of whatever they&#39;re calling Mockingbird these days — but I don&#39;t really see this as evidence of that. </p>
