    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if it was &quot;crazy&quot; per se, as much as very real feeling. A friend and I were standing on this platform over endless sky and clouds. I told the friend that if they stepped out into the nothingness they would not fall, but rather be able to float around. I stepped out to show them and it was crazy how real it felt. I seemed to be able to control how I floated in the dream. I don&#39;t know if it was lucid dreaming or not, I have never experienced that, but whatever it was I had control which was new for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really was amazing. I&#39;ve also been waking up wth the feeling that the dreams I dreamt just before waking were similar, or at least profound in some way. It&#39;s like I wake up and have that feeling of something being on the tip of my tongue, but instead it&#39;s my dream on the tip of my brain. Or I will remember something from it but seconds later it&#39;s all gone. Have you had that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my dreams are so involved and vivid, full color, crazy adventures and premonitions, many i cannot remember and some make more sense to me later.</p>

<p>i just met this guy and had a dream where we took a train to San Francisco and when we got there he said, &quot;i&#39;ll see you in about 2 years&quot;...a couple of days later, he told me in real life that he&#39;s leaving town in 2 weeks to travel the world</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. I have always had vivid dreams as well, but just recently am having a hard time remembering them. I used to always tell my husband all about them because they were so weird, and just realized I haven&#39;t done that in several weeks, maybe months. I also feel as though my spiritual &quot;awakening&quot; has been ramping up tremendously in the past few months, maybe they could be related? Although you would think the opposite would happen. I have had dreams come true in the past. When I was in middle school, I had a dream that my old elementary school teachers held a meeting with my whole class. They told us that one of us was in trouble and eluded to the fact that if we didn&#39;t help them, they would die. This student was standing up next to them but was all blacked out, shadowy and fuzzy kind of. The next day I found out that one of my friends had shot himself and they died later on that day. I keep feeling lately when I wake up that my dreams are giving me very important and specific &quot;keys&quot; to opening up my consciousness more, it&#39;s like I just can&#39;t figure out how to access them. Anyone have any ideas? And please spare me any comments eluding to me being crazy, trust me I realize how nonsensical this all sounds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I had a wild lucid dream the other night...</p>

<p>Some govt officials came to my condo which was part of the &quot;Putin towers&quot; They told me they were there for some type of landscaping I didn&#39;t ask for. I loaded my gun and told them they weren&#39;t allowed but for some reason they went ahead with their mulching. The mulching was such a shitty job with huge mounds of mulch everywhere. Something didn&#39;t feel right after the govt landscaping. I couldn&#39;t sleep and always felt as someone was watching me, so I left my condo and rented an apartment 2 blocks over. One night when I was sleeping at my apt I woke up to explosions. I looked out the window and saw my condo and putin towers in flames. So, I guess the govt must have wired my condo with bombs under the mulch during their landscaping job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Had one two nights ago. A seemingly wealthy woman, Asian, very exotic was standing above a crowd adorned with lavish jewels but her ring was my focus...I felt internal agony. </p>

<p>Gut anguish, like I was trying to scream at her but no sound came out. The ring was glowing, emanating some odd force?</p>

<p>She looked down at me, with shock or astonishment, her ring finger near her face and was then in a cage, like an old fashioned elevator...all the jewels were gone and she was just smoke wafting through the bars of the box as it lifted away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a pretty interesting one last night, I was working at an elementary school and some teachers were discussing whether they&#39;d &#39;go ahead with it&#39; in order to receive universal basic income, healthcare and housing</p>

<p>&#39;Going ahead with it&#39; was forced sterilization. Like would you undergo chemical castration for UBI, healthcare and housing guaranteed for the rest of your life. Cool dream. Ironic it was at a school. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dreamed i saw a man in a white robe, wandering endlessly in a flat desert</p>

<p>Took it to meaning god, because well, after an eternity of wandering and finding nothing, he looked at the kicked up sand where he walked</p>

<p>In the completely flat desert the small upkicks of dirt starting blooming into valleys and mountains</p>

<p>I think it was a man simply hallucinating, because when i looked up at the man, he was a babbling, drooling mess possessed with the shadow of his sole tracks</p>

<p>A wind gusted and i felt terror, just the presence of it. </p>

<p>Felt like that terror was from realizing the man couldn&#39;t be helped, this was his fate. Forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was infiltrating something very important run by something not human, and accidentally locked eyes with some appearing to be human. I felt a real sense of dread, when normally I feel nothing &quot;real&quot; in dreams. The woman&#39;s eyes lit afire and her skin melted off in rage. Everyone around her began to do the same thing. Right as I turned away a voice said I&#39;ll save you and my two year old son was grabbing my arm smiling when I woke up. This was yesterday morning. I had something very important that pissed them off, whomever they were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only 4 hours ago... Took a quick nap (1hr) in the dream i was in the backseat of a car, somewhat autopiloted but car wouldnt decelerate. I reached up to the front, saw my unconcious body in the driver seat with it&#39;s foot on the gas. I pushed the body to the side and off the gas. I knew i was out of body and felt very calm and natural. I even checked to make sure the body was alive and breathing still, and thought, interesting that this is just my vehicle and i was outside of it and in control. Anyway the car winds up crashing, i get out unscathed. I get a ride back with a tow truck driver and we both notice in the middle of a clear blue sky, a majority portion of the sky  is a window into the deep cosmos, galaxies and what not, with two massive entities, one pink, one green, like gas clouds but exhibiting intelligence somehow. Interesting (to me at least)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t really been able to remember a dream since about 3 months ago, but a couple nights ago I had a dream I&#39;ll never forget. I can&#39;t really remember the beginning but from what I can recall, it was after a little party my friend&#39;s (we&#39;ll call him Joe) family threw (possibly for a birthday or something). Since my family is close with his, we stayed after to chat and clean up. That was all I could remember until at one point as I was saying goodbye to Joe, I heard my father yelling, &quot;get down from there!&quot; Joe and I ran out to see what was going on, but we were met with Joe&#39;s father jumping off the roof of his house head first onto cement. I ran away and starting throwing up everywhere due to the horror. It was right then where I woke up sweating and with a vile taste in my mouth. I still don&#39;t understand why Joe&#39;s father would want to commit suicide and the image of the tragedy stays ingrained in my mind.</p>
