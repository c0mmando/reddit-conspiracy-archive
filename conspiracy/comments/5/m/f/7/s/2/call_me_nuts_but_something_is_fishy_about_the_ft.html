<p>Within 15 minutes of news breaking about an active shooter at Fort Lauderdale airport, the police say 9 shot 1 dead. </p>

<p>How often do they confirm these things THIS quickly? ALMOST NEVER. </p>

<p>They have given out no info on shooter except he/she is in custody.</p>

<p>My spidey senses are off the charts - something is weird about this. I am not one to label things false flags because c&#39;mon, but this one smells weird. Watch the race of the perp - we&#39;ll see what narrative the govt wants to push.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting insight. I didn&#39;t notice that before. There&#39;s a &quot;raw video footage&quot; from a cell phone, but the &quot;victims&quot; are heavily blurred so you can&#39;t see anything. Other than that, that man is the only victim that I&#39;ve actually seen a real photo of. I understand it was chaotic, but if there were fire and rescue teams, ambulances and such, and only a dozen or so victims who were hit then why did it take that many hours to finally reach him considering there was an officer standing right near him in some of the shots? If the time passed that much from what you said, that must have been a number of hours of him sitting in the same place waiting for help.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t automatically mean something, but it is another bullet point to raise an eyebrow at in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>Thanks for that insight!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respectfully suggest you follow the timeline of the crime. Yes, they are <em>now</em> charged with a hate crime, but that charge came <em>later</em>. They weren&#39;t originally charged with a hate crime, as I stated in my message. I&#39;m not playing victim here, just stating facts because when they failed to charge them with a hate crime, people were up in arms about it. But that has since changed because they added it on later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>9:20 a.m.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chicago police say authorities are considering whether an attack on a white man that was broadcast live on Facebook falls under hate crimes statutes.</p>

<p>Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Thursday morning that the four black suspects made &quot;terrible racist statements&quot; during the assault but that police believe the victim was targeted because he has &quot;special needs,&quot; not because of his race.</p>

<p>Still, Guglielmi says investigators are looking at whether the assault falls under hate-crime laws.</p>

<p>6 am.
While police officials did not confirm the races of the suspects or victim, video from Chicago media outlets appeared to show someone off-camera using profanities about &quot;white people&quot; and President-elect Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Police say it&#39;s too soon to determine whether the attack was racially motivated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they have to do a more thorough examination of evidence and legal statutes before throwing a charge like that that&#39;s more subjective than not. What&#39;s obvious is the torture-related charges. But there&#39;s arguments to be made (not saying they&#39;re right) that the comments in the video were generalized statements and he wasn&#39;t targeted for that purpose. Pretty much every crime like this isn&#39;t immediately labeled a hate crime without discussion, regardless of the victim&#39;s race.</p>

<p>Seems like a good amount of time has passed since the suspect isn&#39;t around. There&#39;s 2 people blurred out, and people just wandering around. Where are the paramedics, where are the federal agents that &quot;helped&quot; with the situation, where are the police?</p>

<p>There&#39;s not enough information to say it was real/staged/false flag, but it does feel really awkward and strange, and almost like B movie actors.</p>

<p>And why is the media just showing the people on the tarmac? If it all happened <em>inside</em> the airport, it makes no logical sense to show the outside. It makes it feel like there&#39;s really nothing inside, but showing hundreds of anxious people outside makes it &quot;seem&quot; more real.</p>

<p>Bro, there are <em>thousands</em> of witnesses inside the airport. You think they&#39;re all crisis actors? Maybe there was never really an airport at all, it&#39;s just a movie set and the idea that there ever was a Fort Lauderdale Airport has been butterfly-effected into our memories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably a good thing the msm is reporting that sort of stuff with no filter. There are a lot of times CNN or some other will knee jerk out some breaking news based on a chaotic bit of info that&#39;s unconfirmed. Good reporters wait to confirm things before reporting them as doing otherwise can actually be a risk to other individuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good catch cause fox is saying along with governor rick Scott no second shooting though watching it on tv as it went down about an hour after first shooting people are run evacuating from terminal to tarmac. Some say second shooting in garage some say terminal A?? Quite chaotic for 1 man 1 shooting in baggage area to me. I knew something was up right away. Also odd military ID for some reason made me think ok something is off (can&#39;t say why that specifically triggered me but it did in my gut for some reason and I can&#39;t explain it. Trust your gut though cause it&#39;s always right.) This is off guys. Tried to search this guy but come up with federal reserves but &quot;unverified&quot; on military site. No picture or specifics. </p>

<p>However, Air Canada has officially said that no one under that name flew, and no one checked a gun on any flight:</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing in that link that even specifies <em>AirCanada</em>. I really don&#39;t get why people make the gross assumption that a &quot;Canadian flight&quot; must mean AirCanada as the carrier. Do people not realize that domestic airlines fly into and out of Canada (this is regardless of the correction that the suspect was coming from a Delta Alaska flight).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only this but big medicine has been putting out ineffective epi pens that are poorly designed and inhibit adults from saving lives. Concerned parents I have interviewed have reported such problems as </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I was extremely scared and nervous when my child had his allergic reaction. I was trying to get the cap off and fumbled with the child safety measures on it and had a lot of trouble. After I finally got the cap off after a grueling torturous 3 seconds. The point was bent after i furiously removed the cap and made administration difficult. Finally after another unnecessary and horrible 2 seconds I administered the dose. Worst experience of my life. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;<sup>But</sup> my childs life was saved and i was extremely happy. I don&#39;t know what I would do if I didn&#39;t have that epi-pen&quot;</p>

<p>Considering the globalists agenda to kill everyone OP is slowly seeding subliminal messages to normalize deaths of children. Linking these to a mass shooting is symbolic of mass deaths, and shooting is related to IV needle usage. The peanuts usage to symbolize allergic reaction in the throat as peanuts are usually eaten.</p>

<p>Clearly a bigger power is it work. My long post obviously implies the validity of my argument proportional to the amount of time it took to write.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t been here in a while, but this one does seem odd. He went to an FBI office in Alaska and told them the CIA was forcing him to join ISIS, then comes back and shoots up an airport and turns himself in without a fight.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m getting my tinfoil hat on right now.  Ok, the way I see it, the CIA threatens to kill his family and frame him for their murder if he doesn&#39;t shoot up the airport(or maybe people pretending to be CIA).  Maybe there was a specific target, maybe it&#39;s just to further a political agenda.  Who knows, supposedly it&#39;s the CIA.  Anyway, dude goes to Alaska because he figures it would be harder for them to find/follow him there.  He tells the FBI, but they&#39;ve been notified by the CIA about some lunatic that might show up.  They successfully call his mental health into question and he finally complies because he doesn&#39;t see any other way out.</p>

<p>A senior law enforcement official said that Santiago walked into the Anchorage FBI field office in November 2016, after his discharge from the military and said he was under mind control by a U.S. intelligence agency.</p>

<p>The official said he appeared incoherent and agitated, saying the U.S. government was trying to force him to watch ISIS videos.</p>

<p>However, he said he didn&#39;t want to hurt anyone. Still, the FBI contacted local law enforcement, which, out of caution, had him medically evaluated. The FBI closed the probe after reviewing databases and interviewing family the official said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry i just saw your question. I stop talking to him because he was knowingly killing all of his friends PlayStation 2s with a dummy dbz dvd that burned the console lens. Also he was suspended from school for bringing a homemade bomb to school. In regards to his religion his family was catolic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the risk of sounding like a complete nutcase I think the government is covering up something completely different. On the morning of the shooting I was driving down 84 west which is on the flight path into fort lauderdale and a southwest airline simply stopped in midair and hung there for about 20 plus seconds. I know, impossible but it happened. Me and my son nearly shit ourselves and we turned around at the next lights and went back but the airline was gone. It freaked us out all morning then there was a shooting at fort lauderdale and the I95 and the 595 were closed. Hmm, coincidence? Maybe, but something really freaky happened that morning</p>
