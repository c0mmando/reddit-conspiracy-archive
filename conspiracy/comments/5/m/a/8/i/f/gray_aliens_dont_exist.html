        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A German Schutzstaffel officer and a physician in Auschwitz, was recruited by the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to produce <strong>&quot;grotesque, child-size aviators&quot;</strong> to be remotely piloted and landed in America in order to cause hysteria similar to Orson Welles&#39; War of the Worlds (1938). The aircraft, however crashed and the incident was <strong>hushed up by the US military after they realized that the Soviet Union was doing human experiments on children</strong></p>

<p>In 1945, the US government created Operation Paperclip recruiting hundreds of Nazi scientists even war criminals to do scientific research to rival against the Soviet Union.</p>

<p><strong>In early 1950s, Project MKultra was started by the CIA with intention of doing inhumane experiments on children in order to turn them into tools for the US military and US intelligence</strong></p>

<p>The idea of aliens was manufactured by both the CIA and US military in order to create a diversion away from top secret military research that actually involved experimentation on humans and children. Actual fake alien abductions were operated by both the CIA and the military to make it look like aliens were real and the victim&#39;s testimonies were used to spread this propaganda into the public. While the public was busy obsessing about aliens, the US government was trafficking children and even kidnapping some to be used as human guinea pigs as well as torture victims for their Project MKultra mind control program. The program&#39;s aim was to torture children into such trauma that it caused <strong>&quot;Amnesia&quot;</strong> or memory loss. Then they were to take advantage of this state and create multiple personalities and create spies and blackmailing sex slaves/agents. The children were also brainwashed through fear, coercian, delusions and drugs until they were completely submissive and complicit.</p>

<p>The Project MKultra was run by a former Nazi scientist  who goes by the name Dr.Green (false name given to him by the military). They were also other American &amp; even Jewish mad scientists involved in the program &amp; the CIA imported pedophillia into the government in order to blackmail US politicians and control US foreign policy.</p>

<p>Since then US presidents were manipulated by the CIA as well as corporations to follow out orders and invade other countries in order to stop the spread of socialism and communist ideas. Project MKultra is now a black project in the CIA (only known to certain higher superiors and factions in the organization) and has moved to Antarctica away from US jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The CIA is it&#39;s own powerful entity uncontrolled by anything and operates in an utilitarian manner in the dark in junction with the military in motivation to make the US most powerful and weaponized country in the world. This includes making biological, psychological and chemical weapons that requires human guinea pigs and children. Children provided to them by international traffickers and the Clinton foundations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Grey aliens are too humanoid to even be real. They are fabricated disinformation created by the CIA based on 893 article &quot;Man of the Year Million&quot;, the well-known author H.G. Wells had envisioned the possibility of humanity transformed into a race of grey-skinned beings; who were perhaps 1 meter tall, with big heads and large, oval-shaped pitch black eyes. In his 1901 book The First Men in the Moon, Wells described Selenites (natives of the Moon) as having grey skin, big heads, and large black eyes. He also briefly describes aliens resembling Greys brought down to Earth as food for the Martians, who were the antagonist characters in his 1898 novel The War of the Worlds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the notion that those books could have been based off of previous experiences or tales involving greys seems completely impossible to you? That humanoid aliens are solely the invention of modern man? That there&#39;s no way in your mind that humanoid beings could exist anywhere else and become technologically advanced and visit earth? Or that the idea of humanoid beings from the stars visiting humans is also solely the invention of modern man?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they weren&#39;t. Almost all abductions report different alien characteristics.</p>

<p>And many abductions are actually CIA abductions or MKultra operations. Civillians are kidnapped, drugged, hypnotized, memory erased with Electroshock therapy, fondled for their semen to make it &quot;look authentic&quot;, and the aliens may even have been played by children slaves opperated by the CIA MKultra program. CIA also has programs for how to create false information and propaganda like alien abductions or even 9/11 type stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These were introduced by the Nazis after they were brought to the US in Project Paperclip and given head positions in psychological research and CIA. Soviets hired Nazis as well and Soviet Nazis were responsible for Roswell crash. I have even see photos of the Roswell aliens (there is an actual video not shown on youtube), but it was leaked by this online magazine. Everything looked authetic and there were military personnel. The &quot;alien&quot; matched testimony given by a former CIA who claimed the alien looked &quot;Oriental&quot;. The &quot;alien&quot; or really was mutated child, was yellow, skinny, and had narrow eyes with oversized pupils. Head was propertionately bigger. And it looked way too humanoid. It was clearly a human. But yeah Soviet Nazi colloborators with Stalin created a flying saucer type (shit saucer) possibly launched from Cuba and it crashed in Roswell because the plane was bad. But US realized that the Soviets were possibly working on both flying saucer planes as well as human experiments, so they starting those experiments in Area 51.</p>

<p>The military by now possibly already created like some human mutation shit deep underground and make employees think they are aliens lol....</p>

Gray aliens is from H.G.Wells (Author of War of the Worlds) book &quot;The First Men on the Moon&quot; and Nordic aliens are clearly Nazi propaganda lol.....really? White aliens with blond hair?

    <div class="md"><p>Aliens very well could exist. They are no way Reptillian or Gray humanoids. Those are two fictional characters straight out of early 20th century novels.</p>

<p>If there are aliens out there, I could imagine them being bird like beings like the dinosaurs. (Dinosaurs weren&#39;t reptilles, they were birds). </p>

<p>But reports on the Gray aliens are weird. Like how does gray aliens have all these awesome technology yet they can&#39;t even talk and don&#39;t have any genitillia? Then there is claim that Gray aliens are actually androids created by Reptillians. and yet Reptillians look like a dumbass alien race since their head size is propertionately smaller indicating lower intelligence. But somehow they are masterminds? Yeah all false information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. But often it was with adults too. For example,  the famous Betty and Hill abduction was purely military.

    <div class="md"><p>They US and Soviets were competing during the cold war, and after they realized that the Soviets were doing human experiments with children, and possibly even creating child spies, the CIA also started the same program. It was a horrific program that still continues to this day but rather as a black project overlooked by rogue factions of the CIA that also involves former CIA operatives linked with Satanic cults which were also a mind control operation created by the military. I mean the guy who founded the Temple of Set is a former military officers in the psychological warfare department lool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never met an alien (that I can remember) so I can&#39;t say one way or the other, but I will say that I have no doubt that sentient aliens exist somewhere else in the universe than just Earth. Of course we know there is life on other planets and moons, but sentience is key.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simply mathematically impossible that over the course of billions of years with trillions of stars in the universe that Earth, whose star is a 3rd generation star (meaning 2 other stars lived and died with the same stardust before ours was formed), is the only planet where sentient life would have developed. Although that doesn&#39;t require that other life wouldn&#39;t have already come and gone either.</p>

<p>So I have no doubt that aliens do exist, but as for what they are and where they are I have no idea, and I certainly do not doubt that our overlords would attempt to impersonate aliens for the purpose of scaring the population into running to their government for protection.</p>

<p>All I know for certain is if and when I encounter a being of unknown origin I will only have one question. Who do you serve?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Because aliens don&#39;t exist. What existed was malformed mutated children brainwashed by Soviet Union to pretend to be aliens by flying a weird shaped plane into the US. The plane crashed and became the Roswell incident.</p>

<p>Now the US military and CIA are conniving thugs who don&#39;t like to keep the public information on anything unless it benefits them. So when this Soviet plane crashed and the US later realized these &quot;weird malformed beings&quot; were actually humans and not aliens, they didn&#39;t tell the public because they planned to research on the malformed soviet bodies. They covered it up so the US can start experimenting on children like the Soviet&#39;s did in order to create child supersoldiers, spies or other fantasy like shit in preparation for the cold war.</p>

<p>The aliens were just a cover story invented to cover up CIA and military abduction and experimentation on children. Snatched from orphanges, pedo rings, or off the streets, these children were experimented upon in order to turn them into weapons for the US military. </p>

<p>In the 21st century, EVERY empire did human experiments that were inhumane. Nazis had Auschwitz,  Japan had Room 606 or something like that, Soviet Union had their &quot;Kamera&quot;, and US had underground bases under Area 51 and other vicnities for human experimentation.</p>

<p>Cloning
Mind control
Genetic experimentation
Inter-species insemniation etc.</p>

<p>Mostly mind control and turning children into obedient spies/sex-slaves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you should read up on Crowley and his devotees (such as L. Ron Hubbard and Jack Parsons) and pay attention to what he taught/believed and then look at the world around you. Crowleyism is everywhere. So dismiss him personally all you want, but if you deny his still heavy influence on society, then you are unaware of what you are fighting against. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crowley&#39;s teachings have definitely influenced the debasement of society through music and imagery, but the hand that spreads it is much wider and stronger than the CIA. That particular alphabet agency has been a strong, yet mostly covert, influence on American culture though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Complete foolishness to suggest that aliens aren&#39;t real. This is the kind of foolishnesness that causes people to completely disregard the thousands upon thousands of ufo sightings as anything but advanced beings from somewhere else, even though there are references throughout history of beings coming from the heavens. It&#39;s all got to be either easily explainable things like Swamp gas, planes, drones, etc. Or its got to be <em>secret government craft</em> that they somehow developed on their own during the.....well......they just did ok?! (Even though the same kinds of things have been reported throughout history) No they just developed time travel and went back tons of time with their <em>secret government craft that made entirely on their own</em>! </p>

<p>If ever Occam&#39;s razor could and should be applied, it would have to be for the existence of aliens NOT against. Truly the amount of mental gymnastics involved in ignoring all of the connections throughout history and today, and positing everything solely to humans is astounding, and humans within the last 130 years no less. </p>
