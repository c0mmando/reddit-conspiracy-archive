       Here is what we do for Democracy:
      </p>
      <p>
       We have started wars over Democracy

      <p>
       Millions of people have died for Democracy

      <p>
       My childhood friend died in Iraq fighting for Democracy
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM, CIA, and other powerful people are writing headlines, asking us to be "outraged" over Russia hacking and undermining our Democracy
      </p>
      <p>
       My Grandfathers fought and died, in all major American wars, for Democracy
      </p>
      <p>
       Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Clinton, and the DNC
       <strong>
        Undermine Our Own Democracy.
       </strong>
       Where's the outrage now? Huh? MSM? CIA? Congress? FBI? Where is the outrage? Who is going to jail?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thought so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me, who is it that is full of shit?

       For those saying this is normal, it's actually really not.

       To those saying, "there's no specific law against this." This arguably is fraud. Fraud is usually covered under law. Maybe not here -- that's what the post is about.

      <p>
       Arguably, undermining the second most important democratic process in the country could also fall under treason.

       In most countries the parties select their candidates, not the voters. This is how it was in America throughout much of our history as well. Our current system is unusual and has no actual basis in law. The Constitution says nothing about political parties or primary elections, for instance. That's not to excuse the DNC's actions; they shouldn't put up the pretense of a democratic process if they don't plan to be faithful to it, that's dishonest and manipulative.

       In states where state resources are using to conduct a primary vote, the DNC (and RNC and others) are bound by federal and state voter laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite possible that any suppression or rigging in the primaires (esp. in California) violated state and federal law, and someone should absolutely be indicted for criminal behavior.

       I'm not sure if there's any case law on this or not. Typically, evidence is thrown out if the
       <em>
        police
       </em>
       obtained it illegally, usually in an illegal search without a warrant, but in this case, it was not the police (or FBI in this case) that illegally procured it; it was either hacked or leaked by a third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       A physical analogue would be if a third party stole a video tape of a murder, which was then recovered by the police through legal means. There might be a challenge about chain of custody, but I would guess most judges would admit it as evidence depending on circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the wikileaks emails, I don't think they would be thrown out because they were acquired through illegal means, but the defense would almost certainly argue that they cannot be authenticated. While wikileaks might have a spotless record, that's not sufficient for the court. Some of the emails have DKIM verification, which might hold up in court, but I'm not sure it's ever been tested.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also possible that the FBI could try to obtain a warrant to retrieve the "original" emails from DNC or Google servers, but the defense would likely challenge this as well, claiming the probable cause would not have been known without the illegal leaking of the emails in the first place. In any case, it's pretty uncharted territory, and even if there were a conviction, it would likely go through several rounds of appeals.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as I might like prosecutions to go through in this case, I do worry about the potential precedent. Similar to how
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction">
        parallel construction
       </a>
       has been used to build cases originally discovered by illegal means, the government could conceivably masquerade as "leakers," posting evidence on wikileaks or other sites, and then use that as the basis for a legal warrant to obtain the evidence.

       I agree, unfortunately though we have evidence of millions of people being disenfranchised and statistical evidence of election fraud. The overwhelming amount of evidence tells a bleak story about the degree which the Democratic party is corrupt.

       I think he's implying that because the "hack" altered the outcome of the election, contrary to what the informational gatekeepers Google and Facebook put forward with their scrubbed "popular" aka published opinion data, that either (loosely) altering the election or (directly) that Trump himself is a risk with his radical ideas constitutes such risk. I am only guessing though.

       I think he's implying that because the "hack" supposedly altered the predicted outcome of the election, at least according to what the informational gatekeepers Google and Facebook put forward with their scrubbed "popular" aka published opinion data, that either by altering the election (generally) or by (specifically) getting Trump into office such risk is incurred.

       I was also shocked to read the amended legislation that made it legal to drastically decrease the amount of polling locations in many states. The fact is that in many lower income, pro Bernie Sanders areas, people cant afford to wait in line for 6+ hours. Most working class jobs won't give employees off specifically for election day. There are many ways the DNC screwed Bernie out of the nomination, while only some were technically illegal, all were unethical.

       That and ask around. The left is screaming about how Russia helped to get Donald Trump elected through "hacks" now its conveniently changing to "and propaganda" now too. Also half the dems supporters don't believe there was anything unfair about the election bc they didn't bother to see what was in Hillary's emails and to read anything not published by NYT or the Wash Post of Huff Post. Echo chamber to the max just like over at the politics sub.

       When you:

      <p>
       1) Publish rules about how you will choose a product/candidate
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Solicit hundreds of millions of dollars of contributions to choose that product/candidate based on the rules
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Then instead subvert the entire process and choose the product/candidate internally

       This would seem to indicate a pretty clear case of fraud. The RICO Act is typically used to go after corrupt organizations, like the DNC, that engage in orchestrated fraud.

      <p>
       Sanders raised $300M. All of that money was contributed in the earnest belief that the DNC was running a genuine contest. Instead, all that money went towards the creation of a series of theatrical events, designed to make the DNC's chosen product appear more viable.

       We're not talking traditional "machine" politics here - of the type practiced by Harry Reid in Nevada, or, going back in history, Tammany Hall in NY. When party apparatchiks use their office to mobilize voters, it's business as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC's machinations throughout this primary cycle were on a whole other level. Thanks to WL, we have visibility into the corruption in a way that (at least to my recollection) is entirely novel. Yes, parties have gotten away with this kind of dirt in the past, but it was all easily swept under the carpet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of funny that Hillary et al are engaged in such a desperate attempt to rewrite the history of the election, given as there's little practical benefit to be had, other than undermining Trump's legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kind of hope they push him hard enough that he has no choice but to push back. Trump has already endorsed the narrative that Hillary robbed Sanders. If the Dems continue to push that Putin robbed Hillary, maybe Trump sees his way to appointing a special prosecutor for Hillary and the DNC after all.

       It's interesting.  There is SO much more troubling info in Podesta emails, but many people are not even willing to go there and do a few searches.

      <p>
       So project veritas wins in subverting them, because of the format itself: video.  No one wants to read through a million emails.

       Anyone curious about the products of Project Veritas should read a little about O'Keefe's history:

       Two interesting facts:  he has never uncovered illegal activity with any of his other videos, and the Trump Foundation donated $10k to Project Veritas in May 2015.

       Its illegal to give them money to vote a certain way.  If the DNC paid their bus fare, that is money, thus they paid them to vote a certain way.  They aren't bussing republicans around, and unless they have signed statements by every bussed person stating the DNC did not influence their vote, then they just paid for play

       There is enough evidence to prove they tried to manipulate the election. But the way the "legal system" sees it, they where nice enough to bring citizens to vote.

       It is not legal for them to rig a primary vote in some states. Some states provide resources for the primary vote, so the process is bound by voter laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       In states that have a caucus, they can do pretty much whatever the hell they want. But states that have a primary have stricter laws.

       However you want to slice it, it's bad and it's being propagandized. Has been for a long time. Used to make our society think we are a democracy and that democracy is good, but neither are true. Better for TPTB for us to think it is. Indoctrination from schools to media, news, to social media, on and on and on. You see it being used even now.

       Okay. I won't be dense if you won't jump the gun. Societal climates do not support communism right now. Never said it was the wrong one,  just the instances where we've seen communism its never been what was intended and instead a slip n' slide of corruption. Communism would NEVER work in the USA.

       Communism doesn't need to work. The US already have a mix of corporate fascism with socialism, which is more than adequate to achieve the same ends as communism which amounts to an end of the middle class. Many names for many ways to achieve the same goal, which ultimately is feudalism.

       Just because the communist manifest is draped in notions of the greater good doesn't mean its writers didn't understand the detriment of such a system.

       Communism doesn't need to work. The US already has a mix of corporate fascism with socialism, which is more than adequate to achieve the same end as communism which amounts to an end of the middle class. Many names for many ways to achieve the same goal, which ultimately is feudalism. Yes, communism is so near to feudalism that people would be outraged by jumping directly to that stage. Incremental socialism is how they overcome the public backlash from moving in that direction. People are practically begging for it now. Everybody wants a free lunch, but few seem to realize that there still needs to be people making the lunches, and if everybody wanted a free lunch nobody would eat.

       There we are. This is a perfect instance of cyclical politics. I was never and would never disagree with that. Our version of capitalism is also a compromise between democracy and those corporate, fascist, socialist and I'll even throw on totalitarianism, too. That's just where we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think were exactly where we need to be in the grand scheme of it all. I'm not saying I agree with any of it, but the bad guys are falling apart. This is a poor example, but women can drive in Saudi Arabia because of us. I truly believe that our vicious nature (US) is to bring means to some sort of definition of what were both describing.

       The Primaries are for a private company. If the DNC wanted to pick bush to be their guy then they're legally allowed to do so,and they'll pay the price.

       The Democrats did pay the price and now we have Trump as the president. It's already so fucking annoying. The Democrats are going to basically bitch and moan for the next 30 years like they still do over Al Gore.

        Violations within complaints sent to FEC regarding Hillary's campaign, 52 USC 30109(a)(1) and 30116(a)(7)(B)(C)  I've searched FEC.gov for these complaints and the website shows no traces of any of these complaints.  This might be because it's a crap ass government site run by half-baked morons (i'm a web dev and I know how to do site faceted search using apache lucerne and solr...this site's search is seriously fucked!)  Or this could means FEC is colluding with Hillary to suppress... because we have a paper trail that this complaint was sent, along with another one from OKeefe, with no statements to the contrary from FEC

       To say that the Democratic primaries were rigged is an exaggeration. It's not like they backed voting machines or shredded ballots belonging to the opposition, the DNC threw their support behind Clinton because they thought that she gave them the best chance to win the election. That's a very common practice in politics.

       Statistic analysis of exit poll data suggests that votes were tampered with in the Democratic Party presidential primaries in over 10 states. The worst instances suggest tampering to the tune of around 15%. All states on the Republican side show no indication of fraud and most states on the Democratic Party side show no indication of fraud either. It's also been proven many times over that hacking votes is really easy on machines commonly used, and it can be done without leaving any evidence of it.

       Contrary to popular American opinion, US wars are fought for the Federal Reserve, banksters, fruit companies, oil companies, military industrial complex and whoever's paying the politicians. If one does a little bit of research, they'd also find out that the US has waged wars on a lot of Republics in order to impose its will on them, and has supported a lot of dictators because they bow down to the US.

       With that out of the way, why is no one going to jail? Well, you can do your part by reporting to the FBI and state police that you witnessed a crime.

       You're right, but the point is the reasons OP gave are the ones told to us my our elected leaders. So it's more of a " given this is true, why do we act in a way seemingly contradictory" kind of thing. It's more confirmation that some fuckery is afoot

       It wasn't rigged.  There is no evidence at all that they rigged any part of the primary.  The DNC having a preference on who wins the primary is only logical, not remotely evidence of any wrongdoing.  Any organization would have an idea who it wants to lead it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Election fraud is already illegal.  What they allegedly "did" is not election fraud.  You can't make it any more illegal than it already is.

       The DNC is not beholden to you or the American public.  It's a private orginization.

       At the very lease, the actions by Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC leadership prior to Schultz's DNC chair resignation certainly violated internal DNC impartiality rules. And the actions of Donna Brazille in revealing upcoming questions to Clinton's team behind the scenes also violated those same impartiality rules both at the DNC and the Commission on Presidential Debates. And it violated basic journalistic integrity and ethics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did any of this violate federal election law? I think a case could be made here. I think a federal prosecutor should be assigned the task of determining if such violated election law. And I think the Justice Department wouldn't touch this without explicit direction from the Executive to do just that. Because 'prosecutorial prerogative' blah blah.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GOP has engaged in all kinds of dirty tricks with voter registration rolls. And I don't doubt they'd do exactly the same thing the DNC was just caught doing. I mean, Watergate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what we have here is a complete breakdown in basic ethics at the very top of the political party structure. Nobody following these stories should trust anything any of these people in the respective party leaderships says. Because they've all proven themselves liars and crooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question becomes: with corruption endemic throughout the political system, what can citizens do to demand basic representation from elected officials and the bureaucratic structures that surround them? And I don't have an answer to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few show trial prosecutions won't solve endemic corruption.

       You are not going to get anything out of the liberal Obama administration.  Be patient.  There is a new administration coming soon.  As far as what crime didn't they commit that may be punishable.  The DNC mixed funds with the Clinton campaign which is a no no.

       To sue for fraud, you have to have standing. Bernie Sanders would have standing, because he was defrauded. Also, possibly, donors to his campaign would have standing, because they were misled to believe that the DNC was impartial, although it's kind of a stretch. It would be easier if it was Sanders who defrauded them. Then again, people win lawsuits against parties with more indirect connections than that.

       I believe it because, the political dirty tricks attributed to the DNC were in fact conducted and executed by the very conservative operation that conducted the entire election to deliver the what was really a slow moving coup. One group coordinated the entire show, including the faked polling, the narrative and media messaging, determined who got to vote in all the red states and had all the control needed for last minute vote count adjustments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really the only question is,  Did Hillary know how entirely fake and deceitful this election was?  I lean to thinking she was promised a win, just like Romney was promised a win, Romney lost, this time no dirty op or political  dirty trick was left undone. 
And yes, of course the entire media/MSM/ made it all possible.

       I'm sorry and I don't mean to be disrespectful but no, none of that was for "democracy".  Even if that's the narrative, it's not "for democracy". How about just start "for democracy" at home and have the people's vote count? As in "every person's vote has the same weight". As in "democracy"? Even" third world countries" hold more democratic elections than the US.

       See, that's the point. It's fraud. Fraud is usually covered under law.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you hire a lawyer, a doctor, a real estate agent, most anything, and they tell you they are doing one thing and do another - it doesn't matter that "they are a private organization and can break their own rules." It's fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not any law specifically covers this -- well that's up for the courts to decide -- but something is not legal simply because "they are a private organization and can break their own rules." A lot of people are saying that, but it isn't true.

       The DNC will get away with it because it was the candidate selection of a private organization. Unless actual vote tampering or fraud can be found favoritism no matter how unethical isn't illegal unless it goes against a contractual obligation.

       Ofcourse a HRC presidency would've been disastrous, but trump is the sidekick anti-hero where anti-establishment sentiments could congregate. Angry needs an alternative choice, AKA controlled opposition.

      <p>
       Lets talk about the obviously fake russia hacking story - a lie. Lets also try to equate this bullshit story with trumps success(legitimate). That'll get trump supporters revv'ed up to collect liberal tears.

       I would be more than outraged if I lived in the U.S. I don't understand why people aren't in the streets with signs. I feel like there should be people flocking to support Bernie right now and in numbers that can't be ignored.  The fact I don't see anything makes me sad Canada is associated with America so often.

       Some of the most upvoted posts of all time on Reddit are the post-election posts supporting 'it should have been Bernie' theme. I think we got screwed. It should have been Bernie. Instead we got Clinton vs Trump forced down our throats and ended up with Trump.

       Why are we going to accept an election outcome that is KNOWN to be tampered with by the Russians when the election was the closest in history? With Trump LOSING by 3 million votes? Is this the death of democracy? Hint? Yes it is...

       In most countries the parties select their candidates, not the voters. This is how it was in America throughout much of our history as well. Our current system is unusual and has no actual basis in law. The Constitution says nothing about political parties or primary elections, for instance. That's not to excuse the DNC's actions; they shouldn't put up the pretense of a democratic process if they don't plan to be faithful to it, that's dishonest and manipulative.

       So project veritas wins in subverting them, because of the format itself: video.  No one wants to read through a million emails.

       It wasn't rigged.  There is no evidence at all that they rigged any part of the primary.  The DNC having a preference on who wins the primary is only logical, not remotely evidence of any wrongdoing.  Any organization would have an idea who it wants to lead it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Election fraud is already illegal.  What they allegedly "did" is not election fraud.  You can't make it any more illegal than it already is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC is not beholden to you or the American public.  It's a private orginization.

      <p>
       The RNC made
       <strong>

       <strong>
        horrible of a choice Trump was

       to represent it and you don't seem to care.  The DNC made private statements about who it would prefer to run it and it's apparently that was so egrigious it warrants changing the law.  Grow up.
