       Secret Civil War raging. I'm glad I know and see it, instead of living a life of propaganda-driven delusion. Not sure how I can help the White Hats, but I'm sure you know how to find me if you think of something.

       Absolutely. Honestly I'm not sure if 40,000 people on the Internet researching pizzagate etc. Could have done it without the credibility and bravery of the insiders or retired helping.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the whole investigation
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       organic, but it's an organic investigation that's slowly and deliberately being fed information. So I guess if anyone is reading this who isn't an investigator, but a leader... Thank you

It looks like to me the 'resistance' saved the election from being rigged, but seem to have reached a cease fire with the Clintons since then. Trying to find more.

       Good point.  There is so much spy vs spy and turduckens of psyop subterfuge no one knows what's real anymore, but everyone knows this: that the media is trying really hard to shape opinion and that the media is controlled by the National Security State.  This is really all people need to know.  To be shown that there is a dome, the labyrinth, to be exposed to the knowledge of the matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some have already blue pilled themselves back to sleep.
       <strong>
        They are the dumbest people on earth--people who were made aware of media collusion via podesta emails, and chose to ignore reality thereafter.
       </strong>
       These are the same people who still think Clinton is not a criminal; who still think Obama is a good president; who still think there is "fake news"; and who still think we are at war with Russia, or that Russia hacked wikileaks; or that Russia had ANYTHING to do with our elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here's the thing.  There was no 'coup' or 'countercoup'.  Here's what really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       On 9/11, the COG plan was started.  THAT was the coup. And it was successful.  They suspended the consitution.  OR--the CIA became privatized.  It's one OR the other and they won't say which.  Basically they created 2 sets of laws, one for the .1% and the other we have to abide.  Of course over these last 16 yrs, this has meant that the .1% get to do whatever they want to us, spy on us illegally, pass illegitimate laws, hack into our systems without a warrant, use drones on americans, use drones illegally overseas, move arms to the enemy, move drugs, engage in child sex trafficking, and use the state dept and privileged (as in only available to spies / intelligence) to expropriate mining rights, stolen gold, and other political powers in Haiti, Libya, and abroad for private interests such as war profiteers, bankers and the clinton foundation
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus Obama was essentially Bush 3, and Clinton would have been Bush 4.  They are all supranational fascist corporatists, and they formed a fifth column that was waging war against humanity itself to bring about a one world government.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they failed.  THAT was the true countercoup
      </p>
      <p>
       and it was because of YOU.  Not any 'white hat spies' Don't you DARE give them credit.  They've been content to follow fucking orders for the last 16 yrs.  What have they done for us?  We figured this out.  Not them.  They fought us over FOIA.  WE had to have investigative reporters.  WE had to develop assets of public intelligence from within the private US intelligence security state.  WE had to locate and flush out white hats, they did nothing for us otherwise
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm not talking about the long list of intelligence whistleblowers.  They were the heroes of this movement that got the ball going.  THEY are the white hats, not these 'other subvert people' Steve Piezcnic claims exists (but don't).
      </p>
      <p>
       "WE" are the white hats.  Quit giving them credit they absolutely did not earn.  "WE" have done the research for decades, and whistleblowers have come out to confirm this research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whistleblowers are the real heroes here.  NOT these imaginal "white hats" that don't exist.   Please stop giving into ICONS and acting like a bunch of jesus fish victims waiting around for a messiah that will never come.  YOU are the messiah.  We who work for truth are the messiah we've always waited for.  Give yourself credit and never forget that unless they quit their job and become a whistleblower, they will ALWAYS be a liar working on the deathstar.  Until they come out and publicly say, "yep, these people I work with are a serious problem...they are responsible for most of the suffering in the world", then you should not believe them because they have no integrity coming from shadows

       Yes. The campaign was a massive psyop. Hillary was the caricature of a politician, the scarecrow. Every super-hero needs a super-villain (storytelling 101). A supervillain she is indeed (and needs to hang).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump will oversee America's demise, will sign us into a neo-bancor (globalization ad infinitum) and will prosecute the war of civilisation against Islam. About globalization, it won't be te first time a president does the exact opposite of what he promised as a candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we know most (if not all) "islamic" terror attacks are false-flag clandestine ops (starting with 911). Someone is pitting the (Christian) West against the Islamic world. I wonder who that could be? I'd surmise they surround Trump and specialize in storytelling.

       When you understand the historical background of pizzagate (ritual abuse and murder of children) you'll be connecting important dots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Testable prediction: the institutionalized pedophilia / ritual child abuse and murder has been planned for release. The masses will soon discover that most in government/power are child molesters/murderers. The economic crash will be concomittant. That's how they'll bring down America. This has been the plan for a long time.

       I mean, I think that was a bit of an exaggeration. We had some leaks coming out, and I think it hurt Hillary just enough that they couldn't steal the election and make it look clean.
