<p>No, it just needs someone who speaks English as their first language to notice that the sentences seemed to be structured strangely in certain circumstances. For example, one person asks if they&#39;d play Dominos better &quot;on&quot; pizza or pasta. You don&#39;t &quot;play Dominos on pizza&quot;, that&#39;s not how prepositional phrases work. Consuming a particular food does not affect a person&#39;s ability to perform in a game of Dominos. This is why a code seems likely. It&#39;s not clear what the code might be, and based on the context in this case I would say the code seems more likely to be referring to drugs, but it still appears to be a code regardless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The weird thing is that even people who are completely innocent are liable to make up bullshit to try to defend against even the mere POSSIBILITY of this stuff being true. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the weirdest thing about the extreme opposition to this stuff. People don&#39;t know if person X is a pedophile and they can&#39;t possibly know, but they make shit up to defend against it and pretend that it&#39;s impossible. As if pedophiles are impossible to exist unless we have crystal clear video proof of it. Why? Why make shit up to defend people you don&#39;t even know about something you could never possibly know for sure? I don&#39;t mind it if someone says &quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case&quot; or &quot;the evidence doesn&#39;t support that conclusion&quot;, but so many people arguing against it appear to be just assuming that it&#39;s impossible. </p>

<p>We live in a world where Bill Cosby is a serial rapist, where pedophilia is known to be a problem in other countries&#39; governments and in industries around the globe, but so many think it&#39;s impossible that the US government could have problems with pedophiles too? Crazy! Dennis Hastert is the longest serving Speaker of the House of Representatives and he&#39;s an admitted, convicted child rapist! Of course there can be child rapists within our government! There already has been! Look at the coverup conspiracies surrounding pedophilia within the Catholic Church, why is it impossible the US government could be guilty of similar conspiring? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying that you believe that the we live in an infinite universe, which statistically means that extraterrestrials exist. Now that must mean extra dimensional entities exist. .. and from their perspective our plane of existence ( a measly 3 dimensions) would appear &quot;flat&quot;... so basically you are saying that you believe that our world is flat?

    <div class="md"><p>Okay.. two options here: 1) You&#39;re just pulling my leg. 2) You are serious.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re serious... that means... you are trying to fast talk me on the internet? You know it doesn&#39;t work like that, right? Do you really want me to respond to that gibberish? I mean, I can...  It&#39;s rife with logical errors. Not the least of which is:</p>

<p>Aliens existing necessitates extra dimensional space existing and then assuming that there is some sort of &quot;entity&quot; that exists therein. </p>

<p>Maybe you mean they exist in some - non-Eucledian state? Fuck, if I know. I don&#39;t think you really mean anything...</p>

<p>I mean... that&#39;s a hell of a jump with absolutely no reasoning provided.  Maybe you just forgot it. Crazier yet, though... you confuse geometric dimension with what appears to be sci fi demension... and wager a guess at how such a creature would perceive a 3d object.  </p>

<p>Honestly, this is just way to bonkers to really discuss.</p>

<p>But lets assume everything in your rambling comment is true. I believe in an infinite universe, aliens exist.  This somehow necessitates &quot;extra dimensional entities.&quot; You know how they would perceive us, and they would think that the world looked &quot;flat.&quot;</p>

<p>How on earth do you think that means that I believe the earth is flat? Are you, seriously, saying that because we would employ a different subjective term to describe a round sphere.... it&#39;s not actually a round sphere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For anyone interested, I had the great displeasure of being employed by some of the most &quot;premier&quot; &quot;gentleman&#39;s&quot; clubs in the great state of Texas for over a decade. (Calm down losers, I was security) and I got to become personal with people on all sides of the spectrum. (It&#39;s funny how it&#39;s more about how much money you have not how you got it) so either they felt like they trusted me or that I was just too small to matter?

    <div class="md"><p>Because your allegations sound like bullshit. I&#39;ll take the example of the voat thread that has been linked to on this sub. The guy there claims that some guy is a pedophile and films weird videos with children because he has teddy bears in his apartment. That&#39;s the most ridiculous shit I&#39;ve ever heard. How do you go from some guy likes teddy bears to he uses teddy bears to calm children down when they&#39;re upset because they had to film blackmail videos. Do you ever step back a moment and think &#39;what the fuck&#39;? It just sounds like utter and complete bullshit and IT&#39;S NOT EVIDENCE.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The &quot;obvious&quot; code words required massive jumps in logic to make them into &quot;obvious&quot; code words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it just needs someone who speaks English as their first language to notice that the sentences seemed to be structured strangely in certain circumstances. For example, one person asks if they&#39;d play Dominos better &quot;on&quot; pizza or pasta. You don&#39;t &quot;play Dominos on pizza&quot;, that&#39;s not how prepositional phrases work. Consuming a particular food does not affect a person&#39;s ability to perform in a game of Dominos. This is why a code seems likely. It&#39;s not clear what the code might be, and based on the context in this case I would say the code seems more likely to be referring to drugs, but it still appears to be a code regardless. </p>
