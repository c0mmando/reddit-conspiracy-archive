        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some of us can see the subliminal messages in media and they are aimed at demoralizing the population. They bombard us with fear and present dysfunctional behavior as normal all the way from sitcoms to cartoons. The short term answer is to turn off the tv. </p>

<p>I have studied how it works but it takes too long to explain. Let&#39;s just put it this way. The elite are coming into your mind through media and planting eggs in it which will later hatch into something terrible. All this is done under the guise of &quot;harmless&quot; cartoons, commercials, sitcoms, music, and other mass communication. </p>

<p>These hatched eggs aim to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Destabilize your self worth and reduce self esteem to the lowest point possible. </p></li>
<li><p>Keep you in a state of fear and panic. </p></li>
<li><p>To teach you that the authorities know better than you. </p></li>
<li><p>Increase distrust and separation between people with the eventual goal of breaking up the family unit. </p></li>
<li><p>To make you think everyone is successful and if you&#39;re not, then you are a loser. </p></li>
<li><p>Brainwash you into thinking aggressive behavior resolves disputes. </p></li>
<li><p>And anything else that serves the elite interests. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone who stopped tv tells me they felt better. I know I did. I stick to the best shows but I never watch tv regularly although that westworld show probably damaged me. That show is a prime example of media poison. </p>

<p>This is just a big heads up. The methodology in play is insanely deceptive and they bank on you not knowing about it. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Think about how violent Tom and Jerry is. We used to all watch that as kids. Some of those kids turned into thugs that listened to gangster rap which promoted violence and self enrichment through crime. Then you have the Kardashians who squeeze an insult into every per sentence which is then seen by men and women across the country who replicate the behavior overtime. The news is a full blown fear festival. Adult swim is just about the grossest I&#39;ve personally seen. Cops is about a bunch of dudes destroying the criminals lives live on TV. Those criminals were selling crack to make it in an economy where the elite hog all the money. The good guys in the movies are killing the bad guys and riding off in the sunset as if it was the right thing to do. Every game is about competition or killing all the bad guys. In games, pretty much everyone outside of you is a bad guy and so you have to kill them. Where are the truly cooperative games where players team up to accomplish difficult tasks. Game of thrones is a show full of psychopaths. Even the good guys on that show display some sort of mental darkness in their attitude. Those soap operas are down right shamelessly promoting a cold hearted attitude mixed with extreme selfishness. Ronald McDonald is a clown who lures children into McDonald&#39;s to eat the shittiest food ever made. I wonder what that does to the mind and body. </p>

<p>Good God almighty is it bad. All these spills over into our society the minute we wake up in the morning. This has been spilling into our society for decades. It&#39;s confusing the people and destabilizing society. I remember my 10 year old cousin asking me why the government allowed the NWA rap song which promotes murder into the economy. I didn&#39;t have a clue. I figured they just didn&#39;t care but now I realize this is intentional. </p>

I cut it out long ago and when i&#39;m at someones house who is watching for instance law and order or listening to violent rap I get a visceral reaction. Intersting too how much clearer my thought process is since cutting the extraneous. A little quiet time to ponder and be mindful is like free healthcare, physical and spiritual.</p>

<p>Amen to this!!gotta watch the ingredients in the back of foods we purchase too. If you don&#39;t know what a bht/bha is that&#39;s in your food.... well who does? I looked it up in the store on my phone - promptly put it down and walked away. &quot;We&#39;re not sure&quot; was all I needed to see before I dove in to &quot;figuring it out&quot;. No thanks love, probably some weird chemical enhancements? </p>

<p>Nope</p>

<p>We just don&#39;t know what we&#39;re doing to ourselves when we blindly trust what we buy  (or see on tv!!)</p>

<p>Notice how the robots transform into psychopaths once they started to fight back. The look on their faces says it all.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The physical/psychological violence is the poison.</p>

<p>Correct.  TPTB also tend to directly associate that violence w/the protagonist of the story so that the viewer subconsciously sides with, identifies, and internalizes that violence and negativity within themselves - often without even knowing it they&#39;re doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, exactly. This element of it is so deep and so disturbing. I saw a timid, very pretty lady in a movie kill a &quot;bad&quot; guy at the end and she burst out screaming out of fear. Only about an hour later in script time, she was celebrating with wine and in the best mood ever with smiles ear to ear. Did she not contemplate that she just murdered someone? Was she really that happy about the whole thing? Any naive mind would see this and think the lady probably did the right thing in both killing someone and for celebrating the death. To top things off, the mirror neurons replicate everything that happens so the viewer sees himself in the position of the lady in first person view. This acts as a sort of &quot;practice&quot; period which primes, or readys the mind for murder. When you show all this violence to 300 million people, it&#39;s going to spill over into the reality of some of those people especially those from already very poor, struggling neighborhoods. It&#39;s just too much poison and some people crack under it all and do something they later regret. </p>

<p>The mind is a garden. It would be luscious without the government constantly dropping poison into the soil. People would be a lot healthier, happier, and more fulfilled if it was to get cut out in time. The government wants barren wastelands of people&#39;s minds to punish and enslave the goy. </p>

I did acid in college with my roommates, and late into the night we watched Tom and Jerry and <strong>freaked out</strong> because we all saw the same thing: a frame or three where the colors went weird and Tom and Jerry looked absolutely INSANE, with their eyes swirly and the colors inverted and such.  </p>

<p>I thought I had hallucinated it but nope, 2 other roommates saw it too.</p>

<p>We speculated on why this would be.  We thought immediately &quot;subliminals&quot;.  We thought maybe it was a &quot;trigger&quot;, that this color combo was done to &quot;turn on mkultra agents&quot; (yes we were into mkultra stuff even 25 yrs ago), or that it was done (as subliminal) to enrage people or &#39;drive them insane&#39; for some reason...to provoke them into a state of high anxiety.</p>

<p>This has stuck with me sense.  I can&#39;t quite lose it.  I don&#39;t know which cartoon but I strongly suspect T&amp;J is peppered with this stuff since it&#39;s a hyperviolent cartoon depicting and suggesting all sorts of physical and psychological abuse.  I mean why the fuck can&#39;t the cat, dog and mouse leave each other the fuck alone or just leave?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really glad I came across this story, I dropped acid about 2 years ago was the last time and was watching Hey Arnold for about 10 minutes till I had to walk away. The colors in the show are all so dull and create a depressive environment the plot line to the characters, the fat kid who is always a dick to everyone who thinks they are his friends but they hate him and all the other subtle depressive stuff in children&#39;s cartoons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve found psychedelics unlock a lot good and bad, but no regrets other then wanting to chase a dragon.  I looked in a mirror at age 19 on 5-meo-mipt and I saw my body grow old and was shown what the future holds for me physically.  I saw a young man grow up, get fat, get skinny, then get old, get grey, wrinkles formed and then turned to dust all in the matter of minutes and it was myself.  I  had witnessed the passing of my physical life.  Now, my soul has gone far past that point and I&#39;ve proved that half of what I saw then was true and I assume the rest will be too.  At the time (maybe 2001?) I saw Bill Orielly on TV and the altered state I was in I could see that he was a devil.  Horns grew from his head and he was a scary beast of a man.  That was before the truth and horrors of CIA psyop fox news 00&#39;s and 10&#39;s had happened.</p>

I could see in each of my friends the way they reacted and responded to everything. Like there was a formula they followed and I could identify what it was. It made me really aware of how bad some of the people were to. Now it&#39;s something I&#39;ll do by myself or a select few people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the mental gymnastics is something we all face. You are not alone.</p>

<p>An easy trick taught to me by an old timer, derail your brain with happy thoughts. When you feel dumb or bad over something, tell yourself it&#39;s okay. Because you know what? It is okay. We&#39;re all on this planet together and figuring it out as we go. </p>

<p>She also told me when you go to sleep, tell yourself that you want to dream about something good... like a positive trip, at the beach on a warm summer day</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about derailing yourself and programming our brains, the way TV did us in, we do it to ourselves and fight through it.</p>

<p>it gets better over time. Not every day has to be good! We don&#39;t have to be the best all the time. Go with the flow and just be good, all it takes. Take care !</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a high school social studies teacher who opts for media bias reports in lieu of current events. Students analyze the &quot;news&quot; from whatever source they wish and write a three paragraph report each week highlighting the ways the media attempts to bias us. After about the first month each school year many students hate watching the news because they feel intellectually disrespected. Some choose to just stop watching and consuming MSM news altogether while others seek out new and less bias sources for news (many end up turning to Reddit). </p>

<p>My example is always &quot;The Simpsons.&quot; I like the show because it&#39;s funny. When I was younger and the show was starting out I wasn&#39;t allowed to watch it because my parents felt that the show always painted Homer in a negative light, and bumbling and incompetent man. As an adult I definitely see that, and see that since the show began we have started to see more movies and television shows which portray the mother as the smart and responsible parent while the father is the doofus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree about the brainwashing. I liked westworld though. I kind of thought it was telling people to wake up. I think we were supposed to relate to the robots. Trying to get us to Realise our world is artificial and repetitive, seek to break out to a new more real reality. I dunno maybe not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is good that you have self awareness of this, I came to the same conclusion, that&#39;s why I do not watch to much tv or do not use fb. hatred and violence is spread very deeply in our systems to the point, that is horrible. </p>

<p>We have to change that for our self, that what is call being mature, no?(correct me if wrong please) .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t watched Westworld, I&#39;d like to try. I&#39;m just so over Tv it&#39;s hard to convince myself it&#39;s not <em>all</em> bad.</p>

<p>Mr robot was cool. It&#39;s definitely one of the better shows I&#39;ve watched in a long  time. I&#39;d recommend the trailer, it gives a good idea of what it&#39;s about. Expect twists. A fun watch. I think we have similar thoughts on TV and radio, so if you think Westworld is cool I think I&#39;ll take a look </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fucking hell man the siding with the criminal angle kills me. There is nothing of benefit to gain from siding with a person like that unless you plan to be one yourself.</p>

<p>The rest of the write up is great though. How many decades has the government had to perfect psy ops on the population? It should concern you especially after this past election and the insanity going on how many don&#39;t question what is presented to them. I checked with news overseas and its insane how people get lied to, don&#39;t even get me started on the military.</p>

<p>Some of the points DO have merit but others are iffy.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Destabilize your self worth and reduce self esteem to the lowest point possible. (True [This is obvious when you come back to the TV to check things out])</p></li>
<li><p>Keep you in a state of fear and panic. (True but there is a need to know when knowledge is of merit and that involves using your brain) </p></li>
<li><p>To teach you that the authorities know better than you. (As this past year has shown VERY TRUE!)</p></li>
<li><p>Increase distrust and separation between people with the eventual goal of breaking up the family unit. (True [Feminism is an example])</p></li>
<li><p>To make you think everyone is successful and if you&#39;re not, then you are a loser. (Well you can&#39;t be a conspiracist as a broke person so you need to fund yourself somehow. It helps having $$$)</p></li>
<li><p>Brainwash you into thinking aggressive behavior resolves disputes. (It actually does but only when necessary of course)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Great that there are people who can see this. 16 years ago I had an inkling there was something going on with how the world was presented and the bravado of the war at the time but had no where to turn to. I look forward to more writeups from you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually. I&#39;m not siding with the criminals here. I&#39;m trying to point out that everyone considers themselves the good guy without any consideration of the bad guy. IE - Poor man in Mexico sells drugs instead of making the typical $5 a day in regular work thanks to the government. Is he a bad guy or just desperate? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes this is true but what do Mexicans do with no money, a family, and the neighborhood cartel who hires them by force. The gov of Mexico is way worst than America. We need to fix the source of the problem instead of the symptom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True unfortunately we have to help ourselves first. It does nothing to have no capital of our own to make a change here first. Foreign governments are not keen on outside interference and besides they don&#39;t abide by the same rights we do (human or otherwise).</p>
