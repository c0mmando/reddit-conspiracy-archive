They figured out mind control on many levels through this program and I have no doubts they bombard us everyday with rf aimed to control our emotions and thought patterns.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t need RF to target your mind when lots of media and news organizations are mostly bought and paid for by the CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but they have both.</p>

<p>Mockingbird is meant to control the masses, while MKULTRA-style technology gives them a way to create &quot;lone gunmen&quot; that can be activated at will.</p>

<p>They support one another. A mass shooting is a national terror story which is filtered through the mockingbird-subverted media in order to maintain public fear or distract from political scandals.</p>

<p>The technology is portable, wireless and invisible. And as effective as they are at controlling the masses, they are equally effective at manipulating individuals. It can be as dramatic as a shooting, or it can be as subtle as inducing &quot;schitzophrenia&quot; to discredit a dangerous economic theorist.</p>

<p>It looks like  Eric T. Karlstrom made this up based on his two other unsubstantiated estimates:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) It can take up to 10 years for physical symptoms to manifest from chronic EMF exposure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False.  It does not take ten years for TIs to realize they have been attacked by directed energy weapons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(2) Be very careful going to local law enforcement: 42% will commit you for psychiatric evaluation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in how serious your are. But you ain&#39;t gonna get a real actionable following from an anon network of like mindeds. You gotta go to those you trust who still are capable of critical thought, in person. It&#39;s person to person, to all those here who feel a revolution will spontaneously happen because of info on the net? Well they&#39;re half right, but real momentum comes from groundswell. The net is the Data, the people are still the blunt tool that is applied. The mentality of &quot;we&#39;ll post the proof, someone else will take action&quot; leads to those with the resources to take action first (The ones we seek to bring to justice) They (so far) are the only ones in the field getting thier hands dirty, and in a bad way. What will call our brothers to arms? Have you seen enough yet? are you moved to action yet? Because the MIC is, The 7th Floor group is, it&#39;s status quo for them, action is new for many of us but if you expect change, stop looking to your left and right, YOU must lead the charge brothers, I must lead the charge. Get ready, time to leave your comfort and enter the history books. This is where words meet action. This is where you put your freedom where your mouth is. Good luck fellow patriots, this may be the time to stand for what you believe in. Stand and fight, don&#39;t sit and blog. </p>

<p>Sexually Disturbing Tailored Pornography</p>

<p>The Summary of the Senate Torture Report disclosed the disgusting revelations that in the secret torture prisons the targets were forced to perform homosexual acts on each other against their will and religion in order not to be beaten or killed. This is a common break down tactic of belief systems and the human will. In no-touch torture the techniques are more psychologically specialized for each target. Most common examples include homosexual targets that are forced with voices that are derogatory to their lifestyle and similar mental images. Almost all targets are forced to view child pornography in their minds. And vice versa is true, that heterosexual targets are forced to view homosexual sexual acts like in the secret U.S. torture prisons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does it not seem more likely that serial killing is highly correlated with severe mental illness such as schizophrenia, for which one of the chief distinguishing symptoms is the hearing of voices?  </p>

<p>My skeptical side is more inclined to believe <em>a mentally ill person heard voices and decided to kill people</em> vs <em>a person was brain-washed by the government in order to kill people</em>.</p>

<p>James Holmes, while not diagnosed, has generated much discussion: <a href="http://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/04/27/prosecutor-2-exams-found-james-holmes-to-be-sane/">Defense: 20 Doctors Agree James Holmes Has Schizophrenia</a></p>

<p>I guess my main issue is that you&#39;ve provided 5 cases in which the individual in question claims to have been brain-washed.  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2015-the-year-of-mass-shootings/">PBS reports</a> there were 372 mass shootings in the US in 2015.  You have listed 5 cases here spanning 4 years.  If we say there was an average of 300 mass shootings in the US per year on average, then the sample here is about 0.42% of such attacks.  In my mind, that is not a compelling degree of evidence for such an extraordinary claim.</p>

<p>My main qualms are
* You give 5 accounts where the killer claims they are being controlled by the government.  The number of assumptions required to believe in this hypothesis far outweighs the number of assumptions to believe one random person has an undocumented mental illness.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam&#x27;s_razor">Occam&#39;s Razor</a> makes me inclined to believe in the latter case.
* If I understand you correctly, your suspected motivation for the government orchestrating these attacks is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in reality he is furthering a gun confiscation agenda which the Government wants.
I am not sure that&#39;s a really valid claim.  In 2016, (the National Rifle Association)[<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000082">https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000082</a>] is the 8th largest outside lobbyist in congress, providing critical financial support to Republican candidates.  Given that Republicans are running the federal government roughly half the time, I&#39;m not sure why they would be so motivated to push a <em>gun confiscation agenda</em> given they rely so heavily on pro-gun money to survive.
* However, if we assume that you are correct in ascertaining the government&#39;s motivation here, I do have one question for you, <a href="/u/zenmasterzen3">/u/zenmasterzen3</a>, if you were in the position of shady government official, and have the power of brain-washing at your disposal, is orchestrating mass murders the most effective way for you to further this agenda?  Even Sandy Hook and the Orlando Shootings, two of the grisliest and mass murders in recent memory had virtually no lasting policy effect.  Mass murders simply do not affect policy in any lasting way.  Would you not prefer to use your brain-washing in a more effective manner? (Like brain-washing members of Congress to directly further your policy agenda, brain-washing supreme court justices, etc).
* If we agree on the last bullet point, that brain-washing Congress would be a highly effective strategy in making lasting changes at your will, then we can consider the following.  435 in the House and 100 in the Senate.  Given that we are seeing first-hand testimonies of mass shooters being brain-washed at the above-established rate of 0.42%, we should expect approximately 2 first-hand testimonies of Congressmen lashing out against their brain-washing predators and going to the press.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I ask you, <a href="/u/zenmasterzen3">/u/zenmasterzen3</a>, do you have sources for at least one Congressman reporting that they have been brain-washed by the government?  If so, then maybe you are on to something!  </p>

<p>Have a good evening, I hope you can help me see a bit more clearly where you are coming from.  I am quite likely overlooking/oversimplifying the case you are making here, so please correct me and counter my points as appropriate.  I really do not mean to act condescendingly or to belittle your case here.</p>

<p>And yet credible people claim this is the pattern, staged mass shooting (or mind controlled shooter) and gun legislation enacted. Example, Brigadier Serong, whose job it was to train soldiers to carry out mass shootings (such as at post offices) during the Vietnam war</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘‘There was an almost satanic accuracy to that shooting performance,’’ Serong pronounced, using words that still echo around crank internet sites. ‘‘Whoever did it is better than I am, and there are not too many people around better than I am.’’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Whoever did it,” he continued, “has skills way beyond anything that could reasonably have been expected from this chap Bryant ... If it was someone of only average skills, there would have been many less killed and many more wounded.”</p>

<p>Former CIA Officer: “Every Single Terrorist Attack In US Was A False Flag Attack”</p>

<p>The most recent intelligence whistleblower is David Steele, a 20-year Marine Corps intelligence officer, and the second-highest-ranking civilian in the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence.</p>

<p>Steele, a former CIA clandestine services case officer, had this to say:</p>

<p>“Most terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We’ve become a lunatic asylum.”</p>

<p>Mass murders simply do not affect policy in any lasting way</p>

<p>They do in Australia and Europe. It took only one false flag attack in Australia to confiscate all the automatic rifles. I wonder if we (I&#39;m Australian) are pussies or stupid?</p>

<p>we should expect approximately 2 first-hand testimonies of Congressmen lashing out against their brain-washing predators</p>

<p>Different brainwashing methods. The target is not aware of them in all cases. For example, this technology was bought by DHS for their airport mind scanners:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the fall of the Soviet Union, Smirnov moved from military research into treating patients with mental problems and drug addiction, setting up shop at the college. Most of the lab&#39;s research is focused on what it calls &quot;psychocorrection&quot; — the use of subliminal messages to bend a subject&#39;s will, and <strong>even modify a person&#39;s personality without their knowledge.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/09/mind-reading/">https://www.wired.com/2007/09/mind-reading/</a></p>

<p>We do know that some congressmen know about the technology and have threatened to use it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A day earlier, the press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, had spoken of Republicans expressing disagreement with the President&#39;s policies, threatening &quot;If they can sleep with their conscience, let them try.&quot; He cautioned that, while they were free to &quot;say whatever they want,&quot; penalties might ensue, &quot;but we never discuss it in public.&quot; He suggested that they would &quot;suffer in their private purgatories.&quot; Pressed for an explanation, he responded &quot;I can&#39;t tell you. If I told you, it wouldn&#39;t be a surprise.&quot; </p>

Two months before the shooting, they said, he was admitted to a mental-health facility after showing up at an FBI field office and telling agents his mind was being controlled, complaining that the government was forcing him to watch Islamic State videos</p>

<p>The nobleness of the lion.</p>

<p>and the bad</p>

<p>the lack of seriousness of the ape.</p>

<p>the spider weaving its infernal snares to catch unaware victims.</p>

<p>and then ..
Since it hides in darkness and avoids the light, the owl also came to symbolize Satan, the Prince of Darkness. Lucifer.</p>

<p>the owl is a filthy bird, because it pollutes its own nest with its dung. It loves to live around tombs and decaying structures. When the owl ventures out into the daylight, the other birds attack it. The scene of the owl mobbed by other birds is common in manuscripts and is often carved on misericords. This was generally understood as the just hostility of the righteous toward the wicked. </p>

<p>then find a lot of animals made from stone or wood but never say what they were created for . symbolism in the occult is everything to these people . be careful around that person.</p>

<p>What they acknowledged was, after a tremendous amount of study, they had technology or in better words, had figured out to breakdown and re-build, (brainwash) a human being. </p>

<p>Problem with it is it isn&#39;t too far a leap from that point to suggest it was used as a Manchurian Candidate situation. </p>

<p>Kinda makes you wonder how many shootings and other rather assassinations were conducted as a result of this. </p>

<p>Naomi Klein goes into this subject a little bit in her book &quot;<a href="http://www.naomiklein.org/shock-doctrine">The Shock Doctrine</a>&quot;. The way she describes it, they were pretty good at breaking a person down, but the &quot;rebuilding&quot; part of their brainwashing was a failure, and that&#39;s the main reason why MKUltra was discontinued in &#39;73. </p>

<p>Then again, we can&#39;t know whether or not Naomi Klein was aware of everything they did and didn&#39;t do.</p>
