       Reminder of Last Prophet's words from Apr 2016

       <strong>
        The day of Hillary's father anniversary: UNFOLDING EXTREME MOCKERY: Hillary votes counted 100 times each in NY
       </strong>
       <br/>
       There was a time (long ago) when people knew what legit election results meant: paper ballots, votes counted at each ballot box by representatives of each party, results of each ballot box published immediately after on the same spot.
       <br/>
       The extreme mockery BushClinton "running" for the 7th consecutive mandate (1992 to 2016), served as "Bush vs Hillary Clinton, the next head to head race":
       <br/>
       it had to be cancelled because such "races" can't be staged when rally attendances struggle to break out of double digits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk of attendances: that's again the reason why the act "Trump impeached" will be only staged after the inauguration day or the alternative act "Obama's presidency extended to a third term".
      </p>
      <p>
       Nov 23, 2016
       <br/>
       <strong>
        UNFOLDING EXTREME MOCKERY according to the script exposed worldwide only by Last Prophet
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The ballot boxes closed Nov 7, weeks after they opened, an EXTREME MOCKERY of german illuminazis about US citizens reduced to beasts.
       <br/>
       2 weeks later this extreme mockery continues, this time as "votes continue to be counted".
       <br/>
       We are now 2.4 million votes away from the end, 66.6, as exposed Apr 20, 2016, the day of Hillary's father anniversary and "coincidentally" a milestone in Endless Deception.
       <br/>
       No, I don't mean Prince's "death", although the agendas of that fake death were more important than for the previous major episode of the series, David Bowie.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Obama's term extended or Hillary proclaimed winner before Trump inaugurated: ANSWER:
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Hillary will be proclaimed the successor of GW Bush, the real 44th president but she will NEVER be normally inaugurated.
       <br/>
       Reason: to avoid having around 1,000 instead of nearly 1,000,000 (as for Obama 2009) in Washington DC to attend it.
       <br/>
       In other words: Obama and Trump will be stripped of whatever titles they have.
       <br/>
       That leaves only two possibilities, and it all depends on Aleppo:
       <br/>
       1. Obama's term extended;
       <br/>
       2. Trump inaugurated.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why most probably "ISIS will attack Washington D.C" hours before the inauguration
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The script "Trump backtracks on everything except for the terror and genocide agenda" (resumed to two words: Wall and Registry) started the day after he became "president-elect".
       <br/>
       This creates an audience problem also for the inauguration of the role formerly known as "anti-establishment billionaire" and subliminally as "the king of bankruptcy".
      </p>
      <p>
       Nov 30, 2016 - Last line's last words: illuminati revisit human cattle's "brains" with this surrealistic artwork: "
       <em>
        Trump names king of bankruptcy to commerce secretary
       </em>
       ".
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         Notes
        </em>
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Nov 23, 2016 - While the nation’s attention has already shifted to Donald Trump’s moves as president-elect, his share of the total vote continues to decrease.
       <br/>
       Hillary Clinton’s popular vote lead surpassed 2 million or about 1.5 percent of the overall vote on Wednesday morning, with 64,225,863 ballots now counted in her favor.
       <br/>
       There are still a few million ballots left to count, and they’re expected to be disproportionately for Clinton.
       <br/>

       Nov 30, 2016 - Wilbur Ross, considered “king of bankruptcy,” named commerce secretary
       <br/>
       Ross, who has a $100 million art collection, will be in charge representing U.S. businesses
       <br/>
       Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor considered the “king of bankruptcy” for buying beaten-down companies with the potential to deliver profits
       <br/>
       He maintains an art collection worth more than $100 million that includes works by the Belgian surrealist Rene Magritte

       <strong>
        Computing votes: Contrast Hillary 2016 with McCain 2008 and Romney 2012
       </strong>
       <br/>
       McCain 2009 and Romney 2012 had their votes multiplied each time by more or less 10 times.
       <br/>
       For Hitlery 2016 the script is reversed. No, I don't mean "Hillary wins".
       <br/>
       The original script ALSO had Romney and McCain as winners but, unlike Hillary, only to be stripped of their titles after completing the mission of disarming the citizens.
       <br/>
       The script was modified to have "president Obama" first time in October 2008 and again November 2012, at the very last minute, in fact "as votes were being counted".
       <br/>
       What I do mean: this time Hitlery''s official votes won't be computed by applying a multiplier to the real votes. They are already in script:
       <strong>
        66.6 million
       </strong>
       votes.

       As a matter of fact, I can guarantee he'll label this post spam. Im actually convinced this is a super sophisticated AI program whos end game is merely to distract and deflect from genuine research.

       Just because you were reduced to the point where you can no longer understand what is not fed to you by the illuminati does NOT mean it is incoherent ramblings.

       Anyone who has not yet been reduced to a Beast can easily verify, by timestamp, that Last Prophet predicted those "well established headlines" LONG before they would be echoed by the illuminati media.

       I agree with Matt Marriott's Big Bang prophecy.
      </p>
      <p>

       MAKE NO MISTAKE: US will first default on social security payments, starting with the termination of food stamps for 45 millions, mostly blacks.
       <br/>
       Days later it will be the turn to default on debt payments, days after the resurrection of Obama Bin Laden.
