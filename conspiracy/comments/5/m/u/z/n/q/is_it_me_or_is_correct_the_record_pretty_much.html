    <div class="md"><p>I hate to say it, but I think you may be right.  I anticipated the shills to disappear shortly after the election but they are more prevalent then ever.  Each day it seems like more open minded forums are banned/shut down.  The range of acceptable discussion continues to narrow.</p>

<p>We are living in a dangerous time.  Once the internet becomes controlled I would not be surprised if their next move is to close libraries and try to make everything digital.  That way, they can have complete control of the narrative and can edit whatever they do not like.  Books represent a physical medium of the truth and well, they can&#39;t have that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who was accused several times of being a CTR shill just for posting comments critical of Trump, or defending aspects of Clinton that were being blown way out of proportion (and I don&#39;t even like Clinton), the fact is that CTR was never &quot;all over <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>&quot; the way Clinton haters thought/think they were.  There just genuinely are a lot of people (like me) who favored Bernie in the primary, who dislike Trump, who dislike Bernie or busters, who recognize that for all her legitimate faults, there&#39;s a LOT of bullshit spread about Clinton, and who don&#39;t think comments like &quot;should&#39;ve been Bernie&quot; are helpful or meaningful.  The subreddit was pro-Bernie when Bernie was still in the race... then he dropped out, endorsed Clinton, and the majority opinion in that subreddit shifted to the second best choice who was still in the race.  It&#39;s not shocking or confusing, and the fact that you still think the subreddit is still flooded with shills this far after the election where it makes absolutely no sense for them to still be paying shills, just sorta proves that it was never really flooded with shills in the first place...  The reality is, the majority of Americans, and especially among the demographics likely to use reddit, favored Clinton in the election.  We&#39;re not paid shills, we&#39;re people with political opinions you disagree with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, that&#39;s the thing: shills are paid to make the smartest-sounding certain-of-themselves arguments that appeal to a certain demographic, who then parrot those same talking points all over the place. They use bots to artificially upvote those comments (and downvote dissenting opinions) so the average user will think that those smart-sounding very-sure-of-themselves arguments are popular and safe. It&#39;s tough to call out shills because so many of them are actually real people who just blindly follow the popular smart-sounding arguments because they think they&#39;ve discovered a life hack to staying informed without spending too much time on it.</p>
