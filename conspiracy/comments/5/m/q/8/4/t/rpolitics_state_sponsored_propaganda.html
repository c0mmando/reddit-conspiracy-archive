        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Not sure if this is well known or not but if you go to r/Politics &gt; Controversial  (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/controversial/">https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/controversial/</a>) you will notice the most popular &#39;Controversial&#39; posts will typically get removed after 6 hours and tagged with &quot;bot removal&quot; flair, without having broken any rules. The top controversial posts are usually the posts that have lots of votes/comments, but with low scores due to near even upvoting/downvoting. Shouldn&#39;t these be the most important posts to allow continued exposure and discussion on? </p>

<p>Interestingly enough this rule was implemented May 2016, just as Trump became the Presumptive GOP nominee (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4j5wh0/may_2016_metathread/">https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4j5wh0/may_2016_metathread/</a>).</p>

<p>Seems like blatant censorship to me. Nearly everything anti Hillary/Obama/Establishment or pro Trump/Wikileaks are automatically removed within 6 hours. Any way we can expose this more?</p>

<p>Here are a few recent example posts that were at the top of Controversial, before being removed. I am sure they are removing hundreds of others everyday that do not fit the narrative: </p>

Sorry that I won&#39;t bend a knee for her holiness, but fuck the echo chamber they have set up is worse for the progress of the community silencing discussion is a tool of totalitarian regimes but i guess the tolerant left is only kind if they get their way.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve found myself wondering that a lot recently as well. There is some element of coziness historically between politicians and, say, Wall Street for so long - quid pro quo of corporate America/Wall Street takes the heat publicly and politicians public image preserved while they continue their favorable regulations an &quot;oversight&quot; - I see Donald Trump as possible being a pied piper; not like DNC leaked email meant, but like a way to put in a corporate puppet this cycle knowing a huge market crash is coming and D can stay clean and R can stay clean since they never really embraced him and can claim he hijacked the party and that&#39;s not really what they stand for (or at least they can spin that with relative ease).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great idea. If you think about corporate America, this is a win-win-win situation.</p>

<p>If Donald Trump exercises more than a few ounces of independence after he institutes a large amount of the long running Republican agenda, he can be scapegoated and the Republicans get exactly what they want but still come out looking better than when they went in. Amazing really how well that works.</p>

<p>At the end, the Republicans are more pro-business and the Democrats slide over too. </p>

<p><em>Correct the Record believes it can avoid the coordination ban by relying on a 2006 Federal Election Commission regulation that declared that content posted online for free, such as blogs, is off limits from regulation. The “Internet exemption” said that such *</em>free postings do not constitute campaign expenditures*<em>, allowing independent groups to consult with candidates about the content they post on their sites. By adopting the measure, the FEC limited its online jurisdiction to regulating paid political ads.</em>[1]</p>

<p>CTR plainly states that their massive funding goes towards free online posting.</p>

<p>In late March 2016, Politico noted that, while the Clinton campaign was focused on the primaries, CTR, along with Priorities USA Action and American Bridge 21st Century, were looking forward to a possible Donald Trump nomination. CTR had been researching Trump for months, preparing for the 2016 general election.[2] </p>

<p>Even in the second half of 2015 Correct The Record had <a href="http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandidateCommitteeDetail.do?candidateCommitteeId=C00578997&amp;amp;tabIndex=1">3M in disbursements</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard to believe that CTR is still running in some capacity. Eventually earnings reports will come out and prove that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not all $10 million went to posting on social media. And the stated goal of CTR was to &quot;confront social media users who post unflattering messages about Clinton.&quot; Why would they still be doing that months after the election? Also, how far do you think $10 million goes?</p>

<p>Russia spends over a billion dollars on propaganda in a given year. Yet I never see this mentioned here, and never have I seen someone here entertain the idea that maybe they have a presence on American websites like reddit. Even though it&#39;s known they hire English speakers.</p>

<p>The idea that this sub is &quot;non-political&quot; is hilarious. The users here clearly strongly favor Trump and Republicans. For example, this sub ignores Trump&#39;s many Russian ties, but is willing to make up fake shit like Pizzagate which has far less evidence (if any). What a joke.</p>

<p>Do you think CTR is the reason why Trump was the most disliked candidate (and now the most disliked POETUS) since those metrics have been tracked? You people only see what you want to see. Cognitive dissonance. He is disliked because he is an unqualified fool with a 3rd grade vocabulary. I would reply to everyone, but the downvotes only let me reply once every 10 minutes, so I won&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was he the most disliked?  Seems not despite MSM hammering it into us for over a year.</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t Russians living in Russia. We focus primarily in conspiracy theories here. In our country.</p>

<p>You think the US Govt doesnt outspend the Russians on everything including online propaganda?  CTR was most likely born from already existing Pentagon, CIA and NSA programs where they hire people that sound like you to try and influence and change discussions away from &quot;dangerous&quot; ideas.  We cannot see them nor the Russian programs as we do CTR right in front of us thus the discussion.</p>

<p>If Trump had one we&#39;d talk about it too. But as the establishment didn&#39;t want him to win they of course didn&#39;t help him and we haven&#39;t yet found a conspiracy theory to discuss in that light.  Time will tell as he sits as POTUS and we see if they can get him to become another of the souless monsters TPTB love to put in power.  Maybe he already is one.  We don&#39;t have his lifetime career as a politician to ascertain that.</p>

<p>There are plenty of stuff that Russia does in the US, like influence the election, which have plenty of evidence for it. But instead, this sub talks about &quot;pizzagate&quot;, which has literally no legitimate evidence. </p>

<p>You have no evidence the US government has paid internet trolls like Russia. </p>

<p>Trump does has Russia backing him, or at least enough evidence of it to warrant discussion. He clearly support policies which would help Russia, vocally like Putin and appoints advisors with strong Russian ties. Russia released information on his opponents and has internet trolls. It isn&#39;t hard to see them using their trolls to support Trump. Of course, he was a conservative man who opposed Clinton, so r/conspiracy can&#39;t target him, but on subreddits for open discussion, he should deserve as much, if not more, scrutiny than Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were setting it up over a year ago... on <a href="/r/Maine">/r/Maine</a> there was a weird post like 18 months saying they were a reporter and wanted to conduct interviews with people that had experience being a moderator... I said I had moderated many forums in the past and they started sending me private messages to see what kind of websites I had some sway in... I didn&#39;t foresee this kind of shit happening so I was just baffled at how shitty of an article/radio interview they would end up publishing... cause that is a really fucking boring subject matter... they eventually gave up... then months later I got another message from a different account... again wanting to do a radio interview and focusing on some comments I had made in the past about some less than moral behaviours I had engaged in. </p>

<p>Now I have to guess that the first one wanted to get me to influence forums willingly with my moderator powers... and the 2nd one was digging for blackmail to make me comply not-so-willingly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Politics was one of my primary destinations to discuss / debate politics on Reddit over the last four years. Was an often ugly and disagreements and often off-topic and stupid. But that&#39;s the Internet. That&#39;s people conversing anonymously. Overnight after the Democratic Nomination I&#39;m shouted down at every turn and it&#39;s a solid wall of hate. That&#39;s not natural Internet conversation. That communities can be so thoroughly hijacked is the biggest risk to Reddit as a platform, and the admin should be on top of working out strategies to prevent think tanks and paid for special interest from manipulating the platform. I keep chewing on the idea that efforts to monetize Reddit may instead have led to creating tools to facilitate sub takeover instead.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>they had a stick about it during the height of the general election. their claim was something like &quot;since we have so many posts right now about the election, we are going to allow our users to help us &quot;police&quot; &quot;bad threads&quot; so if you go against the echo chamber, and your post gets downvoted below 50% or has 0 post karma it will be deleted after 6 hours. It even happens to links from their usual safe space sources like ny times, wash po, huffpo - but if the article is about something logical like &quot;5 reasons why hillary lost&quot; most users there know they just have to downvote anything they dont like and it will never see the light of day</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Valid points about some people&#39;s hypocrisy in terms of skepticism and willingness to then call something the truth with little to no evidence. I&#39;d prefer we all be skeptical about everything, including our own conspiracy theories. However, I think the big difference between subs like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> and this sub is that I can actually see varying opinions here without having to scroll down to hidden comments. There certainly is an element to truth that every sub is a echo chamber. But things like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is on a completely different level than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> which is unfortunate considering <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> should be a non-partisan place for political discussion but instead has turned into an intolerant propaganda machine for the Democratic Party. Whether or not the Democratic Party (or government officials) are involved in that, I don&#39;t know. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a crazy idea to suggest there is some nefarious activity there. And the fact that we can hear both arguments for and against this idea is why <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is such an awesome sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Bot removal&quot; is also a way for r\politics mods to remove content with no attribution (so no one except for admins know who made the removal).  I&#39;m guessing that by removing the posts, the content of the article becomes harder to find during a search (requiring exact key words be used to locate the article).</p>

<p>The rules changes which r\politics made last May also included the &quot;temporary suspension&quot; of self-post Saturday--which the mods claimed would be given back sometime after the election (I guess it&#39;s still too soon for that).  </p>

<p>As for the Why and Who (from 2 articles):  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mark S. Luckie, whom Reddit hired earlier this year [Feb. 2016] as its first-ever head of journalism and media, is tackling some of these problems. He’s helping news and government organizations understand better ways to use the platform. (He had a similar role as Twitter’s manager of journalism and news before leaving the company in 2015.) <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/06/mark-luckie-on-his-new-job-at-reddit-diversity-on-the-platform-and-today-in-blacktwitter/">http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/06/mark-luckie-on-his-new-job-at-reddit-diversity-on-the-platform-and-today-in-blacktwitter/</a></p>

<p>Luckie’s new role will entail working with media organizations, as well as government organizations, to understand how they’re currently using Reddit and what their needs are from the platform, Luckie told me. He’ll then take that feedback and build it into Reddit’s product, with the goal of making Reddit more accessible to a broader community of people.</p>

<p>“A lot of it is delving into the community and figuring out how news spread within subreddits,” Luckie said. “I’ve been on Reddit for 8 years now as a lurker. It’s crazy. I don’t think I’ve done anything for eight years, including Twitter. Now, I want to look at it in an official capacity. I’ll delve into data, analyze the links going in, profile pages — all of this stuff that can be used to quantify news. I’m a spreadsheet kind of guy. I want to get in there and get my hands my dirty.” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/16/reddit-hires-twitters-former-news-manager-as-head-of-journalism-and-media/">https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/16/reddit-hires-twitters-former-news-manager-as-head-of-journalism-and-media/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, yeah--it seems perfectly clear that ALL this was planned in advance of the election.  It was the goal of the US government to take back control of the internet/media before the election began (with a clean-up operation after).  Would&#39;ve been much easier if the Queen of Corruption had won--then we&#39;d all have Fake Liberal, pro-war news shoved up our asses 24/7/365.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what do you expect when the mods themselves are among the biggest shit posters in that sub? Its not like they have bipartisan mods and actually take a reasoned approach what they remove. Their rules are carefully written to allow them to remove anything. They have a list of &quot;unacceptable sources&quot; such as non main stream sites that lean right (go figure). They also ban WSJ for its paywall. However my favorite is &quot;rehosted content&quot; such as if the MSM picks up a story originally published on an &quot;unacceptable source&quot; or WSJ its banned for being &quot;rehosted&quot;- AKA properly citing its source. Not to mention removing all articles about hillary &amp; media collusion by saying &quot;its about the media, not politics&quot; </p>

<p>Fun place to swing by and drop off a couple posts... but the 10 minute limit between content makes it hard for any meaningful discussion to occur without a coordinated assembly of various accounts. </p>

<p>Reddit itself is primarily liberal, and as we&#39;ve seen this year politics are polarizing and people usually gravitate to info that confirms their opinions. What happens is liberals invite liberal articles while conservatives down vote, but conservatives are outnumbered. This means liberal content is more visible, deterring conservatives and attracting liberals. Rinse and repeat every day for a year and you get a board with a liberal bias. </p>

<p>Do you guys also think Drumpf is funding The_Donald with shills? Or do conservatives just like reading and upvoting conservative content?</p>

<p>It&#39;s so weird how r/soccer is full of soccer fans isn&#39;t?! Also what about big comedy finding all the shills in r/funny!</p>

<p>The DNC or whoever your blaming wouldn&#39;t waste the time or the money required to corner a narrative on ONE political forum 4 years before an election, come on guys even pizzagate was better then the whole CTR thing, especially post election </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Republicans are painted pro-business effectively, but we&#39;ve had record domestic drilling and unending war entanglements in the last 8 years, among other examples. The Corporate duopoly just does a good job of pacifying anti-corporate voters by throwing them a enough pro-environment or pro-social issues bones that don&#39;t ultimately rock the corporate boat. There&#39;s a reason the anti-Russia stuff is bypartisan....both parties never met a war they didn&#39;t like. Cha-Ching.</p>

Anytime I post a question or statement that doesnt fit the narrative on politics, between the hours of about 9 and 4 I get downvoted and mostly negative comments, but every day around dinner the votes start to come back up and I receive more positive comments.
