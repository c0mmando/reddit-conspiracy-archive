    <div class="md"><p>Why wouldn&#39;t he at least give an explanation? He says for <em>one</em> call he was given a deadline of 10 secs to call and though he had a buddy (who presumably had a phone) in the room he didn&#39;t manage to get any of it. Then he goes on to say they had &quot;multiple phone calls&quot;, after they call they hung up and kept texting for a while before having another call! What could possibly have stopped him from being prepared to record the second one? If something did, he could at least explain why, but he just totally skirts the issue.</p>

<p>Either he&#39;s just trying to drum up business for his shitty pizzagate merchandise website (seriously what even) that he never fails to mention in any video even when his life and the lives of his whole family have just been threatened, or he&#39;s working with JA out of fear of voluntarily to misdirect/scare people off investigating. &quot;This isn&#39;t our fight, leave it to the authorities.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you think about it what he did was smart. He complied by taking down the video and did everything James told him to do. Making the conversation public was a way safer move then keeping quiet and trusting James to keep his word.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean. I was saying making a video showing what Alefantis texted and said on the phone is the safer decision over not making any of that information public and instead trusting that Alefantis would keep his word about not harming him and his family. If it&#39;s real, an investigation into the phone call records will reveal if it was legitimately Alefantis making those threats. If not then the video is a bunch of bullshit, and the YouTuber is in no serious danger at all. Personally, I don&#39;t really care if the phone call and texts or real or not they have absolutely no relevance to the investigation and really don&#39;t mean anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m confused. If the conversation is real how can it be used to strengthen the gravitas of PizzaGate in any way? You could argue that James made these threats because he was acting irritably after being wrongly associated with child trafficking just as much as the opposite. There&#39;s no basis for this entire encounter in a formal investigation of PizzaGate if there ever is one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember the Louis Theroux Interview with Jimmy Savile where he admitted he only said he didn&#39;t like kids because of the accusations against him?
Not saying this is the same as if what has happened to JA would make any innocent person go all out fuck the world.</p>

<p>Weird thing to say, if this is true, but I imagine the Youtuber added that statment for effect.</p>

<p>&quot;The producer who worked with Jimmy Savile on Jim’ll Fix It had recommended against him being recruited for the programme due to the presenter&#39;s dislike of children.</p>

<p>Roger Ordish said that Savile had little fondness for children, despite the programmes he worked on often being aimed at them.  </p>

<p>After his death in 2011, it emerged that Savile was a prolific paedophile and sexual abuser.   </p>

<p>Mr Ordish, who worked on Jim’ll Fix It for its entire 20 series from 1976 to 1994, told BBC Radio 4&#39;s Today programme: “He did openly state ‘I hate children.’ He said it publicly to newspapers.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what he meant was the details are true, like the information people are sharing but that the pedophile stuff is all bullshit. He was saying that he is scared for his family, so I think saying &quot;everything they say about me is true&quot; is another way of saying &quot;all of these people have my information&quot;. But, that&#39;s just my interpretation, it&#39;s kinda hard to say for sure because earlier in the conversation he says &quot;it&#39;s all bullshit&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Hindsight is 20/20 though. Pretty easy to say these things after the fact, but when someone you have publicly suspected of high crimes like running an underground, underage sex ring gives you a 10-second ultimatum to call him, you too would freak the fuck out and fumble your way through the surreal encounter. Granted, you specifically talked about the second call, but I feel at that point you too would potentially just want that episode to end peacefully, without further hickups.</p>

<p>Of course, he could have calmed down, set himself up to regain some leverage by properly recording the entire session, but you make it sound like the whole thing is fake because he didn&#39;t have the nerve to do all that, which I think is a bit of an overreaction.</p>

<p>He could have done better but hasn&#39;t. I don&#39;t see any reason to hold that against the guy though, do you? Though I agree that there is at least a potential for something else going on, I just don&#39;t see enough reason to suspect anything serious. The possibility that he just suddenly realized he&#39;s in way over his head at that point seems to outweigh the possibility that this is a sales ploy (his admittedly weird-ass merchandise) or that he was coerced to make that video by Alefantis beyond what we are already shown in the video.</p>

<p>The final appeals of &quot;guys, don&#39;t go to that property, leave it to authorities&quot; just strikes me as a frightened dude covering his own ass at that point while still letting his followers know he was threatened, thereby giving him additional public coverage, as anything suspicious could quickly be picked up on by them now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you watched his video? I don&#39;t think &quot;hindsight is 20/20&quot; applies here because this would be my immediate first thought and to hear him tell it, it was his too.</p>

<p>How would he need to have the &quot;nerve&quot; to record the conversation? Unless they&#39;re both in two-party consent states which is something he could have mentioned in his reasoning. He didn&#39;t mention it at all in his discussion of trying to record one of the calls. Wouldn&#39;t it take more &quot;nerve&quot; to have that conversation and not make a record of it?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not &quot;holding it against him&quot; because he &quot;could&#39;ve done it better&quot;, I&#39;m saying the total failure and absence of any serious attempt to explain it should raise suspicions in people considering this &quot;evidence&quot;.

<p>Perhaps I misread your conclusions as stated more definitively than you actually meant to. If it all happened as he said it happened, I can agree with your viewpoint that it would have been wise and smart for him to get the entire thing on tape and video and to give that material to a couple of friends for safekeeping, etc. I can also understand how someone with slightly less cool than that could be left out of his wits at that point, after seeing how deep of a shit he just fell into.</p>

<p>Either way, I can see your points and wasn&#39;t trying to invalidate them, they are certainly valid. Just adding the perspective that rather than pulling wool over our eyes, he could simply have fucked up the encounter by not preserving the evidence it would have produced.</p>

<p>Or the fact that this guy is an active pizzagate reported who approached Alefantis for an interview? All of a sudden he just loses complete interest in obtaining evidence that could break the investigation right open and prove irrefutably Alefantis is guilty of something? No, I mean my conclusions pretty definitively. I know very few things for sure but I&#39;d say I&#39;m convinced this guy isn&#39;t being entirely honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we believe what happened the JA is the desperate one and would give much longer if pressed as he has something the youtuber wants, i.e. removal of video.</p>

<p>Youtuber had the power but he gave it up just because he appently went on Facebook, saved and posted a couple of pictures easily obtainable on YT&#39;s family.  That is peanuts compared to all the pictures and digging a lot of us have been doing into JA&#39;s and family/Associates life.</p>

<p>Scared away after one incident tells me if this is true then the YT&#39;er shouldn&#39;t be investigating if they cannot take their own medicine at the smallest dose.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know what JA is guilty of and maybe he has some skeletons in the closet to get to where he is, no doubt.  But being a pedophile is a bit of a stretch.  I was red pilled and followed this since the beginning mainly due to the fact we know the elites and particularily Washington DC are a nest of blackmail and children play a big part in that.  The code words are absolute bullshit, everyone knows Cheese Pizza means CP.  In researching these groups I have found MAA or MAP means Minor Attracted Adult or the newer Minor Attracted Person, Ice Cream/ice cream and cookies can mean drugs same as candy or a young boy, or whatever you fucking want it to mean.  Spaghetti and meatballs also can mean a boy or yf, Young Friend.</p>

<p>The code is why Pedophiles have been laughing at us, we don&#39;t know shit.  Extra Spicy means Hardcore or very extreme special, this is well documented on the Chan forums online that still cater for Pedophiles.  Extra Hot etc.</p>

<p>I fail to believe a bunch of middle age people like the Podesta&#39;s, JA, and others are upto date or even aware of Pro Pedophile groups use of symbols and codes.  The symbols are legit but there are many more than those published.  Conformation Bias as mpst of these online pedo&#39;s unless part or Pro Pedo movements donot use the logos as much, if rarely, they are more into using Child actors or models as avatar&#39;s.</p>

<p>The Pro Pedo movement by NAMBLA is dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ryan is making a claim that could be libel, and sued in court if he&#39;s lying. Selling shirts is a bit on the questionable side, maybe. But how much do you think he&#39;d make selling 100 shirts? Ever tried to sell shirts online, it&#39;s near impossible. It&#39;s not a get rich quick scheme, or make a bunch of money quick scheme. Nothing wrong with questioning his evidence of the threats, but I don&#39;t see the selling of shirts as a reason to immediately discredit his intentions.</p>

<p>I get the disdain for people trying to profit from the investigation. But how is it any different than Reality Calls or David Seaman (arguably some of the best faces for Pizzagate). They literally ask for donations. If you give 20 bucks to either of them for a donation, they get all of it. If you give 20 bucks for a shirt, he might get 3 or 4 bucks. I don&#39;t get the separation, in fact, it seems quite a bit less profitable to sell shirts than to directly ask for donations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In his situation 100% my immediate instinct would be to immediately find a way to record it, especially if I was a citizen journalist petitioning this high profile suspect repeatedly for an interview. He briefly discusses why he couldn&#39;t record it, he never says anything like &quot;it didn&#39;t occur to me&quot; or &quot;I panicked&quot;.</p>

<p>I agree with your kind of thinking, it&#39;s the reason I don&#39;t think changing the Besta Pizza logo after someone pointed out it was a kiddyfucker symbol means shit, or everyone related to this turning their social media on private. But it&#39;s this logic, what would someone <em>actually</em> do in this situation, that leads me to conclude there&#39;s something fishy here.</p>

<p>Unfortunate, but Ryan clearly didn&#39;t expect Alefantis to request a phone call.  Rya was simply asking for an online chat -- which he never thought he was going to get.</p>

<p>Further.. </p>

<p>...to hoax a facebook account would be really easy to prove.</p>

<p>Ryan would be headed for a quick and hard fall if he was actually hoaxing Alefantis&#39; facebook.</p>

<p>tell you what... </p>

<p>rather than speculating about the phone call.. prove to us that the Alefantis&#39; #killroom is not in the Pegasus museum, as Ryan claims:</p>

<p><a href="https://streamable.com/kg5cb">https://streamable.com/kg5cb</a></p>

<p>otherwise, you just apper to be a pretty typical dis-info agent tryng to distract from the content of the revelations - just like all the atrotophers are doing with Assange.</p>
