       Why wouldn't he at least give an explanation? He says for
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       call he was given a deadline of 10 secs to call and though he had a buddy (who presumably had a phone) in the room he didn't manage to get any of it. Then he goes on to say they had "multiple phone calls", after they call they hung up and kept texting for a while before having another call! What could possibly have stopped him from being prepared to record the second one? If something did, he could at least explain why, but he just totally skirts the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either he's just trying to drum up business for his shitty pizzagate merchandise website (seriously what even) that he never fails to mention in any video even when his life and the lives of his whole family have just been threatened, or he's working with JA out of fear of voluntarily to misdirect/scare people off investigating. "This isn't our fight, leave it to the authorities."

       Well, if you think about it what he did was smart. He complied by taking down the video and did everything James told him to do. Making the conversation public was a way safer move then keeping quiet and trusting James to keep his word. Now, if James does anything we'll know why and that puts him in a position of power over James and allows him to continue making content about the subject from this point on.

       How is it smart to make these serious allegations with nothing to back them up? Without a recording, given everything else he's provided can be easily faked, exactly what leverage does he have on Alefantis?

       I'm not sure what you mean. I was saying making a video showing what Alefantis texted and said on the phone is the safer decision over not making any of that information public and instead trusting that Alefantis would keep his word about not harming him and his family. If it's real, an investigation into the phone call records will reveal if it was legitimately Alefantis making those threats. If not then the video is a bunch of bullshit, and the YouTuber is in no serious danger at all. Personally, I don't really care if the phone call and texts or real or not they have absolutely no relevance to the investigation and really don't mean anything.

       Incriminated himself how? By telling the guy to remove the video in a threatening manner? How does that implicate his involvement with a high profile covert child sex trafficking operation more than it implicates him as a person who doesn't want his reputation destroyed by a made up story?

       If this happened (which I doubt) he obvious wasn't in total control. I would find that conversation as reported (if it ever happened) to be highly relevant to the investigation. Not least cos it's relevant to investigators that the pedocracy might come after your mom and kids if you put videos about it on youtube and/or contact one of the suspects.

       I'm confused. If the conversation is real how can it be used to strengthen the gravitas of PizzaGate in any way? You could argue that James made these threats because he was acting irritably after being wrongly associated with child trafficking just as much as the opposite. There's no basis for this entire encounter in a formal investigation of PizzaGate if there ever is one.

       Remember the Louis Theroux Interview with Jimmy Savile where he admitted he only said he didn't like kids because of the accusations against him?
Not saying this is the same as if what has happened to JA would make any innocent person go all out fuck the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weird thing to say, if this is true, but I imagine the Youtuber added that statment for effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The producer who worked with Jimmy Savile on Jim’ll Fix It had recommended against him being recruited for the programme due to the presenter's dislike of children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Roger Ordish said that Savile had little fondness for children, despite the programmes he worked on often being aimed at them.
      </p>
      <p>
       After his death in 2011, it emerged that Savile was a prolific paedophile and sexual abuser.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr Ordish, who worked on Jim’ll Fix It for its entire 20 series from 1976 to 1994, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: “He did openly state ‘I hate children.’ He said it publicly to newspapers.”

       I think what he meant was the details are true, like the information people are sharing but that the pedophile stuff is all bullshit. He was saying that he is scared for his family, so I think saying "everything they say about me is true" is another way of saying "all of these people have my information". But, that's just my interpretation, it's kinda hard to say for sure because earlier in the conversation he says "it's all bullshit". It's hard to know what he is referring to when he says "everything they say about me is true"

       There was another person there with a phone. That's an iPhone, it has a voice recorder. Even if you aren't on speaker if you turn the volume up it will catch something. Who in that situation thinks "oh no I don't have time to install a purpose-built app, well I guess I just won't even try".

       Hindsight is 20/20 though. Pretty easy to say these things after the fact, but when someone you have publicly suspected of high crimes like running an underground, underage sex ring gives you a 10-second ultimatum to call him, you too would freak the fuck out and fumble your way through the surreal encounter. Granted, you specifically talked about the second call, but I feel at that point you too would potentially just want that episode to end peacefully, without further hickups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, he could have calmed down, set himself up to regain some leverage by properly recording the entire session, but you make it sound like the whole thing is fake because he didn't have the nerve to do all that, which I think is a bit of an overreaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       He could have done better but hasn't. I don't see any reason to hold that against the guy though, do you? Though I agree that there is at least a potential for something else going on, I just don't see enough reason to suspect anything serious. The possibility that he just suddenly realized he's in way over his head at that point seems to outweigh the possibility that this is a sales ploy (his admittedly weird-ass merchandise) or that he was coerced to make that video by Alefantis beyond what we are already shown in the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final appeals of "guys, don't go to that property, leave it to authorities" just strikes me as a frightened dude covering his own ass at that point while still letting his followers know he was threatened, thereby giving him additional public coverage, as anything suspicious could quickly be picked up on by them now.

       I'd be more inclined to believe he says "don't go to that property" because if he did the opposite and told people to go he crosses the line of harrasment and could land himself in some actual real life trouble.

       Have you watched his video? I don't think "hindsight is 20/20" applies here because this would be my immediate first thought and to hear him tell it, it was his too.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would he need to have the "nerve" to record the conversation? Unless they're both in two-party consent states which is something he could have mentioned in his reasoning. He didn't mention it at all in his discussion of trying to record one of the calls. Wouldn't it take more "nerve" to have that conversation and not make a record of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not "holding it against him" because he "could've done it better", I'm saying the total failure and absence of any serious attempt to explain it should raise suspicions in people considering this "evidence". I could tell you Obama called me and confessed there are aliens living under Antartica, if I fail to provide easily obtainable proof without any explanation of why I failed to acquire that proof, you would be a rube to believe me.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Don't go there" = fine. "This isn't our fight" is the line that got to me.

       Fair points on all counts. And I am certainly suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps I misread your conclusions as stated more definitively than you actually meant to. If it all happened as he said it happened, I can agree with your viewpoint that it would have been wise and smart for him to get the entire thing on tape and video and to give that material to a couple of friends for safekeeping, etc. I can also understand how someone with slightly less cool than that could be left out of his wits at that point, after seeing how deep of a shit he just fell into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I can see your points and wasn't trying to invalidate them, they are certainly valid. Just adding the perspective that rather than pulling wool over our eyes, he could simply have fucked up the encounter by not preserving the evidence it would have produced.

       Or the fact that this guy is an active pizzagate reported who approached Alefantis for an interview? All of a sudden he just loses complete interest in obtaining evidence that could break the investigation right open and prove irrefutably Alefantis is guilty of something? No, I mean my conclusions pretty definitively. I know very few things for sure but I'd say I'm convinced this guy isn't being entirely honest.

       If we believe what happened the JA is the desperate one and would give much longer if pressed as he has something the youtuber wants, i.e. removal of video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Youtuber had the power but he gave it up just because he appently went on Facebook, saved and posted a couple of pictures easily obtainable on YT's family.  That is peanuts compared to all the pictures and digging a lot of us have been doing into JA's and family/Associates life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scared away after one incident tells me if this is true then the YT'er shouldn't be investigating if they cannot take their own medicine at the smallest dose.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really know what JA is guilty of and maybe he has some skeletons in the closet to get to where he is, no doubt.  But being a pedophile is a bit of a stretch.  I was red pilled and followed this since the beginning mainly due to the fact we know the elites and particularily Washington DC are a nest of blackmail and children play a big part in that.  The code words are absolute bullshit, everyone knows Cheese Pizza means CP.  In researching these groups I have found MAA or MAP means Minor Attracted Adult or the newer Minor Attracted Person, Ice Cream/ice cream and cookies can mean drugs same as candy or a young boy, or whatever you fucking want it to mean.  Spaghetti and meatballs also can mean a boy or yf, Young Friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       The code is why Pedophiles have been laughing at us, we don't know shit.  Extra Spicy means Hardcore or very extreme special, this is well documented on the Chan forums online that still cater for Pedophiles.  Extra Hot etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fail to believe a bunch of middle age people like the Podesta's, JA, and others are upto date or even aware of Pro Pedophile groups use of symbols and codes.  The symbols are legit but there are many more than those published.  Conformation Bias as mpst of these online pedo's unless part or Pro Pedo movements donot use the logos as much, if rarely, they are more into using Child actors or models as avatar's.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pro Pedo movement by NAMBLA is dangerous.

       I don't buy that. If I had a 10 second countdown to call someone and ESPECIALLY if I had a friend with another phone right next to me... or one of the many cameras in David SELLmans house that he uses to record these videos... I would not think "hmmm let me go download an app I've never used before and try to get it to work properly before I talk to this guy, whom I believe is a murder and child rapist, that just threatened me".

       On one hand, I think it's good more people are opening their minds about human trafficking, especially the concept that pedophilia crosses income, gender, and partisan boundaries.  On the other, I think it's a little dangerous to start making accusations based on supposed code words, symbols, hipster artists' work and "edgy" social media comments...

       Ryan is making a claim that could be libel, and sued in court if he's lying. Selling shirts is a bit on the questionable side, maybe. But how much do you think he'd make selling 100 shirts? Ever tried to sell shirts online, it's near impossible. It's not a get rich quick scheme, or make a bunch of money quick scheme. Nothing wrong with questioning his evidence of the threats, but I don't see the selling of shirts as a reason to immediately discredit his intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the disdain for people trying to profit from the investigation. But how is it any different than Reality Calls or David Seaman (arguably some of the best faces for Pizzagate). They literally ask for donations. If you give 20 bucks to either of them for a donation, they get all of it. If you give 20 bucks for a shirt, he might get 3 or 4 bucks. I don't get the separation, in fact, it seems quite a bit less profitable to sell shirts than to directly ask for donations.

       If he makes even a fucking dollar he's going to die in court. He's already absolutely on hook for libel and harassment. It's a building and growing case. I'd be amazed if arrests aren't made soon. It's a time bomb. The pizza shop LLC alone will be able to OPEN AND SHUT prove tangible damages, and the DIRECT LINK TO INSANE YOUTUBER. It's not even a court argument. It's just fork it over fuck bag.  That's not even addressing the personal grievances Alefantis can file.

       The sale of T shirts is a huge case point. Intent to profit from libel and slander is as low as it goes.

       He might even be able to court subpoena some of these other psychotic idiots (it'd be very very difficult).

       I completely disagree that's why they stay ahead of you.  They stay ahead of you because they are professionals with way, way more tools than any of you.  They don't even bother with PG unless someone does something dumb (like the guy who went to investigate) because it is so far off base, they know nothing will ever come from it.

       nah man.  Somebody who has thousands of people out there claiming he is some kind of pedophile has now decided his best course of action is to start phoning people and threatening them.

       But he offered a half-assed explanation for not recording and didn't blame it on "not being able to think properly" or mention anything of the sort. Besides he didn't know he and his loved ones were being threatened til he was already on the call.

       It's is not easy to find a call recorder that works well in the App Store. I've tried before. Most app recorders are not designed to work while in a call. I figure it has to do with liability since there are a lot of privacy laws that prevent secretly recording phone conversations...

       I don't know. It was moving so fast. Do you have time to think that quick? He said he had someone there at the time. Also guys do you remember someone yesterday writing a post about hypothetical what would you do if you where in a situation? Sorry I've written this on each post about this cause it's crazy that I swear this guy posted yesterday evening about what to do. It had to be him. To coincidental. Crazy!

       In his situation 100% my immediate instinct would be to immediately find a way to record it, especially if I was a citizen journalist petitioning this high profile suspect repeatedly for an interview. He briefly discusses why he couldn't record it, he never says anything like "it didn't occur to me" or "I panicked".
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with your kind of thinking, it's the reason I don't think changing the Besta Pizza logo after someone pointed out it was a kiddyfucker symbol means shit, or everyone related to this turning their social media on private. But it's this logic, what would someone
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       do in this situation, that leads me to conclude there's something fishy here.

       The conspiracy is how the fuck this site tolerates it anymore. And why he doesn't sue. The FBI probably told him not to. There are at least  2 under cover security there day in day out I'll bet money on that. I mean some lunatic showed up armed....

       How naive do you have to be to confront the "49th most influential person in D.C." for an interview about illegal mafia style subject matter that he is a part of and not expect to be threatened?  The fact that he didn't record the call makes it even more suspicious.  He also said to just "leave it to the police".  I hate to break it to him but the most influential people in D.C. have the police in their pocket.  Unfortunately going to the police will likely just tip of (Alefantis and friends) about who is investigating them and what they know.

       It would have taken 10 seconds for his friend to video it on his phone.  Zero Excuse.  It reminds me of the Comet Ping Pong visit where a woman and her boyfriend claimed to see a group of old men going into the back room then coming out later with children going in and out all the time.

       After the Epstein case I have lost all hope for convinctions of the rich and powerful.  You can have over 34 confirmed victims and the Senate saying the FBI have overwhelming evidence to prosecute Federal sex charges and then the person (Billionaire) gets away with pleading minor state crimes without letting the victims even know they.  The victims even talk about the FBI having video evidence of the victims having underage sex with prominent elites that Epstein saved for blackmail.  All in the court documents.  Must have been some big names involved.

       about doing a phone interview with anyone, in any kind of capacity at all, I would have something already set up on my phone that I could quickly and easily get to so I could record a phone call at a moment's notice. It's bascis common sense and preparation.

       Do you people have any intution at all? Can you not see that this kid is visibly and genuinely shaken. Unless he is an incredibly adapt young actor there is no way he could nail all the nuances of this video. Same with the text messages..

       I base my beliefs of evidence, logic and critical thinking. Human beings are notoriously shitty lie detectors, believing you don't need the above because of your "intuition" is deluded and hubris and how you end up getting duped/being a useful idiot.

       Ryan didn't have time to download and install a call recorder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunate, but Ryan clearly didn't expect Alefantis to request a phone call.  Rya was simply asking for an online chat -- which he never thought he was going to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further..
      </p>
      <p>
       ...to hoax a facebook account would be really easy to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan would be headed for a quick and hard fall if he was actually hoaxing Alefantis' facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       tell you what...
      </p>
      <p>
       rather than speculating about the phone call.. prove to us that the Alefantis' #killroom is not in the Pegasus museum, as Ryan claims:

       otherwise, you just apper to be a pretty typical dis-info agent tryng to distract from the content of the revelations - just like all the atrotophers are doing with Assange.

       The whole thing reeks.  We have (as far as I know) the only person literally trying to profit from the scandal by selling merchandise with a perfect opportunity to finally have the
       <em>
        first actual criminal act that could open an investigation
       </em>
       and he somehow fails to do so?
      </p>
      <p>
       If this actually happened, it could have opened the door for the entire 'scandal' to be blown wide open as there would finally be an actual recorded crime occurring, rather than just conjecture and circumstance.
      </p>
      <p>
       But nope, recorder didn't work, buy a pizzagate shirt, thanks.

       These questions are definitely valid so let's keep pushing. We have to be critical of our own communities in order to remain vigilant. I wouldn't throw this out just yet though. We either prove or disprove this.

       a week or so ago David Seaman made a video which he soon took down again... It suggested he was feeling unwell, short of breath, since a stranger shook his hand at some event. I never saw this but I read about it, concern for him being 'taken out' was the subtext (again). I think it was bogus AF and similar to what this guy Ryan is doing.. Upping the drama ups their clickbait bites and their dollars. And if there is one thing I have learned lurking at Voat recently , it is that PGaters    cannot .   get.   too.   much.    drama.
