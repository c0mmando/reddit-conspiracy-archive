    <div class="md"><p>How was MSM against Obama when he first started? I do not think that was the case at all. When you had Roy Jones Jr. crying in a Manhattan hotel room (staged) during HBO&#39;s 24/7 show leading up to his fight with Joe Calzaghe on election night in 2008, the dye was cast in Obama&#39;s favor for sure. How MSM could be critical of the guy does not represent itself as a fact at all at that time in my opinion. His whole entire presidency has been a media cakewalk as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, they are not needed. It&#39;s a system that has gotten (or better yet, always was) so rotten to the core that what we actually see on TV, hear on the radio and read in a newspaper or online is just window dressing. What&#39;s an alternative? Individuality. I can&#39;t think of anything other than &quot;you&#39;re responsible for your life and the life of your little clan (family), and that&#39;s it. This idiocy of controlling the big picture of humanity has to stop. We the people have been getting bent over and f-ed for hundreds, if not thousands of years. I myself cannot recall my past-lives yet, so I cannot be sure. But I have a hunch that I was never rich and entitled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that reincarnation is a truism. Nothing ever died, it just changes form. I&#39;ve read a lot about it, and honestly just this week bought 2 books on Reincarnation and Karma (one by William Walker Atkinson and another by Paramahan Yogananda). Reading a book now by the Dalai Lama called &#39;The Middle Way&#39; that speaks of reincarnation and the law of karma (action). </p>

<p>Just last night I spoke with my dad about astral projection, and he was very cautious/resistant to me trying for it. He&#39;s heavy Roman Catholic and prefers to not know about the Eastern practices. I&#39;ve hady own frustrations, in trying to but not being able to recall past lives, but itay take more meditational practice omy part to actually recall things such as past lives. So, I remain hopeful. It&#39;s the active search for more than what exists to the 5 senses in this shit-rigged game that keeps me going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless you&#39;re a complete cynic and believe everything is just theatre people look at the character type. He&#39;s a narcissist and entrepreneur with a personality larger than life. </p>

<p>That means he has the ability to do things against all odds and &quot;can be&quot; motivated by positive feedback. If he can get into the history books with a positive reputation he will take that chance.</p>

<p>There are far worse character traits for people in control or to work for.</p>

<p>Obviously that doesn&#39;t guarantee a positive outcome. Giving him a fair chance should be modus operandi. We can still roast him in the future which I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll do when he blunders through the porcelain collection in DC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump could be the spearhead of an elaborate coup - did you consider that?  He&#39;s a perfect distraction for the media / public and establishment - but if you put the right intelligence behind him / behind the scenes, combined with military might, he becomes a legitimate force.</p>

<p>By the way - you can be a puppet, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the &#39;cause&#39; is bad.  Trump could be a puppet/distraction that is employed by a different opposing faction to TPTB.  This scenario makes more sense to me than &#39;the establishment is using double reverse psychology and slandering themselves and destroying the credibility of their best weaponry (media) and their own PR, in attempt to fool the public&#39; in probably the worst thought out attempt to retain power.  </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s election could mean many things unknown; but one undeniable fact from his election is that it united the public in a weird way.  I think more people than ever before are realizing that the media can&#39;t be trusted, the establishment are incompetent/liars, the system is flawed, and we actually do have power to make change and shape the world (even if the election was an illusion).  Uniting of the public is the opposite of what TPTB want.</p>

<p>No he didn&#39;t. You&#39;ve extrapolated that from what the media has told you to think. Someone saying they <em>can</em> do something is not an assault or an admission of having done it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Grabbing genitals without consent is not sexual assault by default. It only becomes assault if the move is unwanted. It&#39;s not like men are making out with a girl and say &quot;hey, would you mind if I grabbed you by the pussy?&quot;.  You just make your move and hope it&#39;s the right move.  </p>

<p>As far as jumping from conversation straight to the pussy-grab, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a bold and dangerous move.  But the reality of two people is that body language is key to knowing what is and what isn&#39;t appropriate.  Some men and women like a forward and direct approach.  But as I said, it&#39;s a risky move. Could land you with a sexual assault charge.  Personally, it&#39;s not how I roll.  But then again, I&#39;ve grabbed my fair share of kootch and boob without getting notarized approval first.  But that&#39;s because I read the body language correctly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to take emotion out of your evaluation.  Concepts like good and bad really don&#39;t apply well to world leaders because they are tasked with difficult decisions that sometimes involve raining down fire and brimstone on innocent lives.  </p>

<p>A better approach is to simply evaluate if they are effective and if they are working to implement good policy.  Social concepts like being loud-mouthed or rude are also mostly irrelevant because their job requires a different set of social skills than the average person.  Kind of like how the alpha dog has to nip at the underlings.  Such behavior can be necessary to maintain order.  </p>

<p>All that being said, I did not support either presidential candidate. But I&#39;m willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt and am saving my judgement for after his first 100 days.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say look at what you know:</p>

<p>You&#39;re right to be extremely critical of the MSM. Alternative news is the only place you can get the truth, the problem is figuring out what that is.</p>

<p>Most of the time, if you look at what the government says and the media is parroting that exactly, than probably something is going on.</p>

<p>Like with Russia, there is still no evidence yet they are acting like it&#39;s all confirmed and we should just trust them because it&#39;s real. But, why?</p>

<p>I think even most people that voted for Trump kinda feel the same way you did. I think the thing that resonated with his supporters was that they didn&#39;t want a known criminal in office. To me the MSM attacking him relentlessly just further proves that he was in fact the right decision for our country.</p>

<p>All this being said, use your own judgement and the evidence and information at your hands to make your own educated and informed opinion. Looks like you&#39;re already on the right path though, not trusting the MSM is a huge factor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that the entire MSM, the opposing party, and even most of his own party are against him should tell you a lot. The Republicans tried to push him out the same way the Democrats pushed Bernie out.</p>

<p>The Koch brothers supported Jeb, and when Trump won, they said they weren&#39;t going to support Trump and wouldn&#39;t run attack ads against Hillary. The die-hard Republican owners would rather back the Bush-clone-Clintons, owned by fellow globalist Soros.</p>

<p>Many Trump voters are former Bernie supporters. They want someone not owned by the Soros/Koch globalists, someone like Trump/Bernie instead of Bush/Clinton.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a loudmouth because that is what got him media coverage and ultimately elected. Hillary&#39;s a loudmouth, too. Remember her screaming that half the country are deplorable misogynistic racists?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump could be the spearhead of an elaborate coup - did you consider that?  He&#39;s a perfect distraction for the media / public and establishment - but if you put the right intelligence behind him / behind the scenes, combined with military might, he becomes a legitimate force.</p>

<p>By the way - you can be a puppet, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that the &#39;cause&#39; is bad.  Trump could be a puppet/distraction that is employed by a different opposing faction to TPTB.  This scenario makes more sense to me than &#39;the establishment is using double reverse psychology and slandering themselves and destroying the credibility of their best weaponry (media) and their own PR, in attempt to fool the public&#39; in probably the worst thought out attempt to retain power.  </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s election could mean many things unknown; but one undeniable fact from his election is that it united the public in a weird way.  I think more people than ever before are realizing that the media can&#39;t be trusted, the establishment are incompetent/liars, the system is flawed, and we actually do have power to make change and shape the world (even if the election was an illusion).  Uniting of the public is the opposite of what TPTB want.</p>
