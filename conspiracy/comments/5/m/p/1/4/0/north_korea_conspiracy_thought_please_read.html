       So it seems basically everyone thinks North Korea (NK) is bad and dangerous, right? Well why is that? I have an idea, and it's just a thought, so keep an open mind.  We know NK is one of the few last countries that have not and refuse to conform to the use of centralized banks that run the US and UK and ect. Everything we know about NK is from Mainstream Media and our government, and what if they were lying? I think maybe North Korea could be rebels against this system of financial tyranny that now runs most of the world and that they are actually the good guys. Maybe whenever people visit them (and that's rare because i think you have to have permission to get in the country), they go into this emergency mode and act like the people coming are spies and they try to mislead them. North Korea could be one of the last hopes against the NWO (New World Order) and the NWO have manipulated most people to believe NK are the bad guys. This has been going on for decades and i think we don't know anything about North Korea or their real history, just how a lot of people don't even know their own countries real history. Just a theory though, what are your thoughts?

       I'll read the rest later, but my view on NK is that it's rehearsal for the 1984 NWO. They must be studying NK to see what works and what doesn't.

       True, i haven't thought of that. It very well could be an experimental state for what they want to do to the rest of the world, this would explain why they're so cut off from the rest of the world and make visiting so complicated. Thanks for the idea!

       Well okay but referring to what i stated in the post, visitation there is rare and you need permission, so they can prepare for when you visit and 'put on an act' so to speak, for whatever reason i don't know.

       That is true indeed. However, being out of the Rothschild group doesn't make NK a good place.

       Lybia was the example that royally fucked up their NWO plans. It's really sad that no one defended them like Russia did with Syria.

       I think youre in the wrong sub if you really believe that everyone here just believes what they read from a few books and MSM. We've been lied to for so long that now almost nothing but actual being there is completely sidereal proof anymore.

       Didnt say they werent and I agree with you. Just saying that some people have a harder time believing than others, thats why we are here. I love reading Conspiracy theories, not because I believe all of them, but because they are better than a book and there's free coffee. Why do you come here?

       Definition of 'fact' = "a thing that is indisputably the case". Your biased opinions and beliefs are not factual. Check the population stats?? Seems irrelevant to my theory, and you know that North Korea supposedly doesn't have access to the internet? So how would anything you see on the internet teach you anything about North Korea? It's such a closed off country, why not admit you don't know what is going on?

       They're nowhere near as stupid or alouf as perceived. They actually feed off of this narrative and use it to get away with murder.

       It's important to not get caught up in the idea that because a deceitful government or media shines a negative light on them then that within itself must mean that the opposite is true.

       I don't think they are much of a threat to the NWO, but I don't think they are all a bunch of brainwashed people controlled by an evil dictator. I see how the media works... so I know anyone that they wholeheartedly hate is probably being slandered for a reason.

       American planes dropped 635,000 tons of bombs on Korea --  that is, essentially on North Korea --including 32,557 tons of napalm, compared to 503,000 tons of bombs dropped in the entire Pacific theatre of World War II.2 The number of Korean dead, injured or missing by war’s end approached three million, ten percent of the overall population.

       Bingo.  My thoughts exactly.  They don't wanna play ball like the rest of the world, so the US bullies them.  I watched this documentary on nk on Netflix,  i believe.  Changed my perspective a bit. And the most sickening part was that one Rogen/Franco movie the Interview. It was basically a propaganda comedy about viciously murdering a world leader!  Not one that's already gone.  And yet,  nobody saw a problem with that.
