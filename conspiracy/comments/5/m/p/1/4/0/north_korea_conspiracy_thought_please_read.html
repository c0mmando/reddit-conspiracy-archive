        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So it seems basically everyone thinks North Korea (NK) is bad and dangerous, right? Well why is that? I have an idea, and it&#39;s just a thought, so keep an open mind.  We know NK is one of the few last countries that have not and refuse to conform to the use of centralized banks that run the US and UK and ect. Everything we know about NK is from Mainstream Media and our government, and what if they were lying? I think maybe North Korea could be rebels against this system of financial tyranny that now runs most of the world and that they are actually the good guys. Maybe whenever people visit them (and that&#39;s rare because i think you have to have permission to get in the country), they go into this emergency mode and act like the people coming are spies and they try to mislead them. North Korea could be one of the last hopes against the NWO (New World Order) and the NWO have manipulated most people to believe NK are the bad guys. This has been going on for decades and i think we don&#39;t know anything about North Korea or their real history, just how a lot of people don&#39;t even know their own countries real history. Just a theory though, what are your thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, i haven&#39;t thought of that. It very well could be an experimental state for what they want to do to the rest of the world, this would explain why they&#39;re so cut off from the rest of the world and make visiting so complicated. Thanks for the idea! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo.  My thoughts exactly.  They don&#39;t wanna play ball like the rest of the world, so the US bullies them.  I watched this documentary on nk on Netflix,  i believe.  Changed my perspective a bit. And the most sickening part was that one Rogen/Franco movie the Interview. It was basically a propaganda comedy about viciously murdering a world leader!  Not one that&#39;s already gone.  And yet,  nobody saw a problem with that. </p>
