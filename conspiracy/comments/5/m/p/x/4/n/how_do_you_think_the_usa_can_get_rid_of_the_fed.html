    <div class="md"><p>Sadly the country is more divided than I ever remember, just read some yahoo comments, I&#39;ll bet there was less hate for each other before the civil war. Now lets say somehow we came together as citizens, what sort of action could be taken?

The only possible way I could see it happening would have to be nobody in the country going to work or paying taxes.

    <div class="md"><p>everyone must stop using and accepting money. a strike works to exert financial pressure but still ultimately operates within the paradigm of debt and repayment as the fed, so you&#39;re right that wouldn&#39;t work. the only way to win is not to play the same game. we need a paradigm shift where we work because we want to, not because we are forced to balance these fake &#39;debts&#39; by acquiring equally fake and meaningless credit. so it actually doesn&#39;t require a stoppage of critical jobs at all-- merely a change in our conception of the system, which will result in its weakening as non-participation grows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree with you but it&#39;s difficult for me to understand the structure of that. Again if you need surgery, how you going to compensate the hospital? If you&#39;re talking about some form of bartering for everything else, that&#39;s old school! My grandfather was a shoemaker, he used to fix the farmer and his families footwear for eggs and butter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup the structure and means of transitioning to a money-less system is the most puzzling part. i don&#39;t know what would happen to specialized jobs like surgeons, though it seems plausible that, in a system where all knowledge is available, we&#39;d have even more people able to perform specialized services. </p>

<p>a system like this requires a fundamentally different understanding of value -- right now, value is expressed in terms of what the person providing the service gains for themselves in doing so. and this is almost always material things. without money, the value would be service to others, being needed, which is a much more spiritual reward.</p>

<p>this seems like a better system to me, but of course participation in it must be voluntary, and that&#39;s where monetary/ material value-production has the upper hand-- people are forced into the system whether they like it or not (because, hey, we gotta eat, right?), and the high rate of participation makes it seem legitimate. but attaching value to self, individually, breeds comparison to the &#39;objective&#39; value of others, breeds competition, breeds resentment, hate, etc. as long as material value is attached to the atomic self (&amp; thus ego) and not the self-in-relation-to-others, we will stay mired in conflict and inefficient. money is power is ego built on a foundation of sand. all acts of spiritual (in a very very broad sense) service help crumble it. but, again, you&#39;re right it&#39;s hard to imagine the transition. the only thing to do imo is keep eyes on the prize.</p>

<p>No you don’t actually.  What’s worse is that you don’t, and you couch your shallow, self-centered actions under the delusion that you <em>do</em> care about them.  That’s a special kind of deluded.</p>

<p>You would rather let a billion people in the future die just to help a few dozen that you see right in front of you today.</p>

<p>That’s not caring about people.  That’s caring about yourself and your own interests.  That’s a far different thing.  That’s pandering to the dictates of a shallow, near-sighted mindset that’s unable to understand the future consequences of current actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus.  I just read the previous response I gave to you.  That was quite a LOT a bit harsher than I really intended.  I&#39;m actually very sorry for that.  Seriously.  I didn&#39;t mean it to be <em>that</em> harsh.</p>

<p>I got a bit pissed at your beginning your response with the unnecessary &quot;Sorry guy&quot; comment.  It <em>was</em> indeed unnecessary and snarky on your part, and it came from your not understanding the real scope of what I was saying and meaning in my response, but I think I responded back to your arrow shot with a cannon - and that wasn&#39;t very necessary.</p>

<p>Look, my point is that what we&#39;re trying to do here is have and create a better world  - for ourselves, for our children, for everyone...and if my intention is to help people, then it&#39;s not really about <em>me.</em>  It&#39;s about the species.  It&#39;s about the planet we live in and all the other species that live on it as well for that matter.</p>

<p>Because of this, then that means that if I&#39;m faced with the prospect of having to potentially sacrifice my life and the life of some people I might be caring for and even love so that even MORE people than my immediate circle can live and breathe and prosper in the future - a future that I may nonetheless not even be alive in - then I think I might be willing to make that sacrifice.</p>

<p>If The Big Bad Mean Man says &quot;do things my way or I&#39;ll kill you and your family&quot;, and I know that if I <em>do</em> do things his way, then MANY MORE than just me and my family will suffer and die, but if I fight him and resist and me and my family end up getting killed but it ensures that I end up putting an <em>end</em> to the reign of The Big Bad Mean Man...then, hard as it may be to do, I think I might be willing to go through with sacrificing myself...for the sake of the many in the future that encapsulate <em>more</em> in the overall scope of things than just me and my immediate (and even extended) family.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about me.  It&#39;s about <em>us.</em>  And I&#39;m thinking about us to such an extent that I&#39;m trying to help as many of us as I can in as best a way as possible.</p>

<p>Being willing to sacrifice a few of us now so that many more of us can live and prosper in the future is something that I wouldn&#39;t be unwilling to do.</p>

<p>This is ultimately what I was getting at in my previous response.</p>

<p>Then if that “greater good” really does involve betterment for the human species in general? then God dammit...MAN THE FUCK UP.</p>

<p>I love my nieces almost more than anything.  They literally make my heart cry with love when I think about them.</p>

<p>But if I knew that something I did would kill me and my family/nieces but would actually <strong>save</strong> a great portion of the species in general and keep a great portion of humanity from perishing or from great future harm or slavery, etc?…then I’m not saying I’d be fucking <em>happy</em> about it - OF COURSE FUCKING NOT…but thinking about it objectively, I’d simply <em>have</em> to acknowledge that the sacrifice would be better for all of humanity as a whole, and if my perishing would help the species…then fuck it.  <a href="http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Come+at+me+bro_2172ed_3818729.jpg">Let’s do it.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought I heard about &quot;auditing the fed&quot;. They &quot;audited&quot; the defense department right? Found out there were $6 trillion or something missing? Nothing changes. At the end of it all, they&#39;re all in the same boat. And honestly I don&#39;t really see the president elect going out of his way that much to completely restructure the center of the global economy for the benefit of the common people. But like you said, we&#39;ll see how it goes. </p>

<p>I believe it was to introduce a competing currency, backed by silver, have them work side by side then slowly phase out the old one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Executive Order 11110. </p>

<p>Quotation from Wikipedia: &quot;The order allowed the Secretary to issue silver certificates, if any were needed, during the transition period under President Kennedy&#39;s plan to eliminate Silver Certificates and use Federal Reserve Notes.&quot;</p>
