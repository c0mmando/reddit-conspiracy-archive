       I had a little heated talk with a manager at my job. Ended up putting in my 2 weeks and so be it. 3 years later I apply for the same job and that manager says that he rehired me due to thinking people deserve forgiveness. Because of his forgiveness benefitting me I'm more forgiving now (changed my views). Am I corrupt?

       Nah I'd say you're a complete tool for going to work under the same manager you clearly had issues with. Corruption requires power. You have the opposite of that.

       Thats because you take it literally. Figurative language is something liberals don't seem to be capable of understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberals who are not good conversationalists in real life miss it completely. It could be a symptom of not having many conversations growing up or spending too much time talking through devices, instead of in person.

       Did he change his mind before or after there was a leak that benefited him?  He is the definition of an opportunist, I cannot understand what happened to this sub or how you can believe Trump isn't going to sell you out for his and his cronies benefit. Drain the swamp? Remember that one...?

       But is he?  For instance, Obama's entire administration, diplomats, etc were picked over his head even before he was elected.  Now Trump is getting flack for taking time AFTER actually being elected to personally assemble the same.  I love that Trump is not giving pay-for-play-ambassadors any leeway.  January 20th, they are out!

       Yeah usually candidates have this all sorted out before hand so when it comes time to transition they can focus on other shit. Either Trump is an irresponsible moron or really didn't think he'd win. He's not being exemplary, he is being unprepared. He should have had his list months ago.

Also has a long history of politics, including being in the Clinton White House. So tell why a transition manager should not... pick people for the transition?

       Most would agreee that corruption leading to the deaths of thousands to appease defense contractor sponsers would be worse than exploiting tax loopholes. So, using existing evidence, it's hard to argue that Trump has or will come close to that level of corruption.

       What relevance does that have? Other people's shadiness and greed have no relevance to Trump being greedy and shady. You're not supposed to measure someone's actions against someone else's to determine if it's acceptable or not.

       Wow, the mental gymnastics. Somehow this isn't pay to play because Tillerson is already rich? Really? Did you use that same logic with Hillary Clinton? Jesus Christ you people are hypocrites. Do you realize it, or do you just not care and think your'e fooling people?

       I'd rather we make amends with Russia than continue the stupid sanctions. Such a path could possibly lead to civil war in Russia, which would force the oligarchs to go on even bloodier excursions out of the country to distract the people. I can only pray the intelligence community and the administration don't turn their sights towards trying to corner China like this administration tried to corner Russia.

       This logic only works when it goes to plan. If you believe the MSM is the hand of the criminal elite, this election did not follow their script.

       Yup. Hate to say it because i love this sub but it really has been full of donald trump supporters lately. I dont know if its because of alex jones backing him (who is a joke and nobody here should take him seriously) or because of the whole wikileaks thing with hillary and the_donald users saw this as a pro trump / anti hillary place. Misleading headlines with no sources and clickbait articles that are pro trump are getting thousands of upvotes here now.

       I think we are in the middle with Trump. He isn't a complete shill, he faced too much opposition. Yet, he isn't a complete outsider as the vote would have either literally been rigged or he would be dead. He is going to move us in the right direction on some issues and is going to either not advance or keep moving in the wrong one for some.

       While I agree, here's the thing about that
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Trump has spoken out against Snowden as a traitor, in so many words.  It would be highly suspect if he was pardoned.
       </li>
       <li>
        Our 3-letter agencies are known to go rogue and do what they want.  He has at least one agency against him, and that's more than enough.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Even if he was pardoned, which I think would be a "good for morale" gesture, I don't believe Snowden would be safe to return.

       This. Honestly, I still expect a JFK like movement again in the coming years if he strays to far from the interests of others. I pray it doesn't happen, but I know the agency still has the capability if it wishes too, even if it is no longer the agency of the 60s.

       Trump has referred to Snowden as a traitor but more disturbing is  his Office of National Intelligence pick Dan Coat, who has publicly advocated for Snowden's execution and has vehemently defended the NSA's spying programs.

       I'm still suspicious of his motivation. It looks like the leaks were designed to discredit the NSA, and protect the CIA (his former employer). Putin had to tell him to quit leaking as a condition of his asylum.

       Trump &amp; Clinton and this latest election, especially the divisiveness, was just TPTB really letting us think that we "made" any real choices in November. This shit was laid out from the top a long time ago and they're laughing at us no matter if it's R or D in power t the moment.

       I like Trump, and see him as a step in the right direction, but he is not going to work on the behalf of the people in every decision, a fool would believe that. Honestly, if he prevents a cold war, I will see him as a success, but as others have said, he will suck up to the Israeli agenda and definitely still has ties to the upper class. He seems to be part of a minority of the upper class who still want to make money, but have other ideas on how to do it. Hopefully they don't fuck us over as much.

       Trump will lose in 4 years if he doesnt thoroughly investigate Hillary/Clinton Foundation &amp; promise not to have Assange extradited to US -- Snowden/Manning also need to be absolved of any crimes they have committed b/c they had the best interest of the ppl at heart.  These are the reasons he won.  He will be a 1 term president if he doesnt follow through.

       Democrats are still busy blaming Russia/Wikileaks/FBI/etc for loss -- Bernie was the strongest candidate till he started towing party line &amp; ignoring corruption &amp; defending his party.  There is not one democrat that will win in 4 years unless Trump doesnt follow through.  If he doesnt even Anthony Weiner could run &amp; beat him 4 years from now.

       Yeah usually candidates have this all sorted out before hand so when it comes time to transition they can focus on other shit. Either Trump is an irresponsible moron or really didn't think he'd win. He's not being exemplary, he is being unprepared. He should have had his list months ago.

       He just named a CEO and oil baron with no policy or diplomacy experience and a vested interest in Russian oil brokerage Secretary of State, one if not the highest diplomatic positions in our government. How is this not the biggest "pay to play" there is?

       I'd rather we make amends with Russia than continue the stupid sanctions. Such a path could possibly lead to civil war in Russia, which would force the oligarchs to go on even bloodier excursions out of the country to distract the people. I can only pray the intelligence community and the administration don't turn their sights towards trying to corner China like this administration tried to corner Russia.
