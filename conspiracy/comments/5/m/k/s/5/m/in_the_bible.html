<p>Even so, you gotta appreciate the earthy truth here, the kind of thing  most people would never imagine appears in the Bible. Some women are size princesses, obsessed with getting fucked by the biggest cock around, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s been that way since the beginning of time. No different than the swordsman stud constantly on the prowl for the perfect rack or ass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>C&#39;mon, man! Nobody who was illiterate could&#39;ve written that book (or any book!); it&#39;s self-evident. It&#39;s not the &quot;illiterate&quot; who are making the divinely inspired (or so John claims) prophecies, it&#39;s one guy. </p>

<p>I&#39;d argue that there are probably great truths in much of the mythology you cite; just not sure if they are divinely inspired truths. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, obviously the author was literate, so I used the adjective &quot;most&quot;.  Most people (the faithful) at that time, were illiterates.  Hence, scribes.</p>

<p>John of Patmos was what we would call today a crazy person.  He was banished by the Romans to the island of Patmos for being a nutcase.  He wrote that crap after banishment and the church didnt even make it part of the bible until hundreds of years later. Guess it worked as better closer?  Fear and such?  Locusts, fire, whores....damn good ending!  Maybe the thought they&#39;d do a sequel someday.</p>

<p>Imagine if someone wrote that today and gave you a copy of the manuscript.  Would you believe it or call them crazy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like everything today, man....ambiguous. People can either see what they want to see, call it a myth, or there&#39;s actually some connection between a so-called madman&#39;s prophecies and what we&#39;re seeing unfold today. No satisfying answer for you....sorry. </p>

<p>Personally, all I can tell you is Jesus Christ has never failed me. Not everything has always played out the way I wanted, but when the chips have been down, my faith in Him has always led me to a better place. I&#39;m not here to evangelize, just to tell you the way it is, the way it has been for me personally. For you, it may be something else, I cannot and would not say. </p>

<p>Appreciate you following up, tho. Best wishes and may God Bless America in the year to come. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Book of revelations= propaganda to keep people of the times in line religion in general was created to control and gain money , use your head the Bible is a work of fiction created by tptb of the time Jesus is a fictional character in a story book the Bible is nothing but entertainment in this age , but yeah whatever floats your boat sure Trumpets and shit end of the world (even though every generation through out time thought they where living in the end time) look at it like this buddy ,it may be the end of the world as we know it in the scence that the world is changing (earth changes which have been happening since the beginning of time ) technology is changing (as usual) politics and policy is changing (as usual)  but the world is not going to end all of the sudden , I have been on earth a very long time and this end of the world religious babble has yet to occur and I have heard it over and over again from all types of people that where absolutely convinced/ brainwashed by religion , so in my opinion and many others who do not feed into religion Nah the world will continue to turn ,round or flat ,inner or terrarium matrix or paradise, imagined or whatever, this mother fucker will keep going. </p>
