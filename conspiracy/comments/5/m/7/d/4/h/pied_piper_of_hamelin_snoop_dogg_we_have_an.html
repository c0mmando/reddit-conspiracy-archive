<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Here_Comes_The_King">His Reddit user account</a></p>

<p>Here, we have an extremely accessible celebrity, who admits to having sold his soul to the devil and is photographed throwing Illuminati gang signs. He has taken a useful and healing herb (marijuana) and perverted its use to such an extreme that his true followers would be unable to function in society.</p>

<p>It&#39;s some kind of joke that his fans don&#39;t even hold him accountable, because he&#39;s too high to make sense. He has effectively used a pot pipe to lure away and capture a huge faction of the population.</p>

<p>If this isn&#39;t true, (and he loved his fans) he would be speaking out to expose the Illuminati and the crimes which he certainly knows about. I wonder if he could share his viewpoint on being used as a mind control programmer and what he knows about the satanic death cult that controls us all?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Interesting response to this post. I have to wonder how the downvoters reconcile his use as a tool for the Hillary Clinton campaign?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:2</strong> Can someone please help me understand the upvote algorithm? How is a 26 vote post, at 54% upvoted only 2 points?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pied piper connection is a stretch. But whether or not snoop was too high to intentionally &quot;pervert the use of marijuana,&quot; you can&#39;t say that overall, his advocacy of weed use hasn&#39;t helped the overall public acceptance of the use of it being used as a healing herb in our society/culture.

    <div class="md"><p>You really think the alcohol/pharma industry and doctors like the fact that a cure-all miracle drug is becoming mainstream? Not to mention the feeling of being &quot;numbed to oblivion&quot; is not a characteristic attributed to a wide variety of different forms/strains of ingesting cannabis. But for people who are in chronic pain, why is herbal treatment better for the elite&#39;s agenda than opiates?

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that we have to look back very far to see how prohibition can be used to marginalize, legalize, and take complete control of a substance.</p>

<p>Profits and tax revenues for alcohol are huge. The industry is highly regulated. You can only buy from approved vendors, and they have a strict monopoly on the supply. Bars pay the same (or more) for a bottle of liquor as direct consumers.</p>

<p>Legalization will be a way to pacify home growers and to completely control and profit from commercial production. I think that the quick legalization of medical marijuana is their way of getting ahead of the trend, so that they can build the database of users and keep a tight grip on control of the substance.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think opiates are going anywhere. New addicts are created at a rapid pace, and as the black market for marijuana diminishes, opium poppies will fill the void. The CIA will never run short of product.</p>

<p>overuse of pot does lead to drowsiness and lethargy, but moderation, as with anything - is key</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. So why do we not question an open Illuminati operative who has adulterated the beneficial aspects of this drug, and created a massive following of users who lap up his dumbing-down and promotion of being stoned 24/7? Sure, it&#39;s a great life for him; but the glorification of this lifestyle only serves to further enslave a generation.</p>

<p>The hardest part of coming to terms with the conspiracy is accepting that our idols are false, and that they are programmed to turn everything good into evil. I&#39;ve seen this play out in my own family, and it&#39;s an effective way of disabling people and turning them into wage slaves and leeches upon society. Take a guess as to who carries these people while they make a life&#39;s work out of their enlightenment?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An interesting exploration on &quot;drugs&quot;:
<a href="https://auticulture.wordpress.com/2016/10/27/the-serpents-promise/">https://auticulture.wordpress.com/2016/10/27/the-serpents-promise/</a></p>

<p>Premise - &quot;Consciousness-altering drugs, and most especially psychedelic substances, are a form of concentrated death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How much does expanding our consciousness enhance our day-to-day capacity to function in the world and relate to other people at an ordinary level? And how much are we simply increasing our ability to talk endlessly about abstract subjects and fly off into imaginary/imaginal realms, bringing back shiny trinkets (songs, poems, paintings, books) to show off how “evolved” our consciousness is to the world? Be honest now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Drugs and alcohol induce higher conscious artificially, with no preparation of the nervous system. If enlightenment is our natural state as humans, then these sorts of “aids” take us in the opposite direction. They blast us into an unnatural state that at the same time closely simulates the natural one, and hence offers the feeling of attaining “greater reality.” They also lead to the corresponding comedown and, generally speaking, the desire to recreate that state. They are forms of self-traumatization similar to those practiced by MK-ULTRA-like programs of abuse, designed to fragment the psyche and so harness the energy within it. They may create a veritable übermensch of astral capabilities, but it is only a fragment that is being empowered.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In simple terms, the gains of psychoactive substances are heavily taxed. Most experimenters, unaware of this fact, continue enjoying the gains with little or no clue as to the back-taxes that are building up. By the time they do realize it, there may be nothing left to do but declare bankruptcy.&quot;</p>

I think that pot is used in that culture to show people that want to use it what &quot;using it&quot; means. According to hip hop, smoking weed is all about partying, excess, same as getting drunk, but illegal so much more hard core of course. In my personal life I use pot for chronic pain and mental/emotional/spiritual guidance and therapy. I think &quot;they&quot; want the people to see that pot is only good for stoners and thugs who want to let loose and party, so people don&#39;t know the real healing power with proper use.

<p>Tell me honestly whether you are just forum sliding or if you&#39;ve looked at the extensive evidence of these stars believing they are Illuminati, and just aren&#39;t capable of making the connection. If the case of the latter, I may spend some time googling up some information for you.</p>

<p>Seriously? You are sole mod of some 27 subs, where you (alone) make bizarre ad-hominem posts, mostly attacking Hillary Clinton&#39;s appearance, or posting pedophile-related content (including Pizzagate topics) with the NSFW tag; sometimes even duplicate posting into multiple of your own subs. Not sure what your objective is; but your comments are full of condescending one-liners and overall sniping which contribute little (if anything) to the conversation.</p>

<p>With an intense resistance to the evidence, you have resorted to a base, oversimplification of known activity to discredity my claim that Snoop Dogg, and other rappers, are actively promoting the Illuminati symbolism and agenda. This same Snoop Dogg who was instrumental in helping your &quot;walking corpse&quot; secure the support of his horde of stoner zombies (granted they could break the inertia and make it to the polls). Instead, you have tried to limit the conspiracy theory to the very well-known practice of exchanging sex with producers for a chance at fame. If you&#39;ve spent more than a week on conspiracy theories, you&#39;ll know that this is a small scratch on the surface of what really takes place; and that these producers answer to a higher power in order to secure their success.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost as though you have built a phony library of posting history to build up enough credibility to assert some sort of influence? I just don&#39;t understand why (short of promoting disinformation) that you&#39;d post what you have and then work so hard to limit the discussion regarding the prevalence of Illuminati control over hip hop and pop culture, in general. And you are adamant about your claims with a strong resistance to discussing the evidence. Sorry, but it doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Those aren&#39;t the only two choices. You are shortchanging yourself by putting on the blinders to the blatant symbols and imagery. Certainly you are aware of Project Paperclip and MK ULTRA? This is documented and directly speaks to what is happening in the public arena. I&#39;d share, but you rejected my offer of evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... and you don&#39;t like weed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I voted for the legalization in Florida, and have become almost annoying in my nagging the veterans in my life to get their prescriptions. I have also begged my brother to get some cannabis oil for his epileptic daughter. Personally, I have no interest in it; but I&#39;m a naturalist and gardener who thoroughly appreciates the healing properties of herbs, including THC.</p>

<p>And as a proponent of the benefits of weed, I am disheartened to watch an Illuminati operative use his influence to disable a faction of the population with the toxic religion of gun violence, violence against women, and a complete chemical escape from reality. It sickens me to watch these stars throw satanic worship and Freemason symbolism in the faces of their followers (who don&#39;t even realize that they are being controlled). Can you not see the harm that this does to the culture? I mean, Snoop is clearly an intelligent man, with a solid grasp of grammar and vocabulary, yet he dumbs down his discourse to the point that it is insulting to any of his followers with a basic education or grasp of the English language. Instead of promoting education and making a positive difference in society, he glamorizes the &quot;gansta&#39;&quot; life and the fantasies of wealth and fame that only come with the circumstances that brought him to where he is.</p>

<p>Now, either Mr. Dogg is a complete tool, or he knows exactly what he is doing. Either way, it doesn&#39;t speak well for his worshipers. He has grasped onto a weakness in his devotees (the self-deceit that marijuana solves their problems), and uses it to enrich himself. No average person can function in this world being stoned out of their minds all day long. He has his fans so boondoggled that they can&#39;t fathom the idea that he is no dummy and is adeptly using the Illuminati formula to control and subdue them.</p>

<p>I understand why this post is so unpopular. It&#39;s a tough pill to swallow.</p>
