        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As followup to interest in the Sandy Hook FOIA post, here is some more info regarding Wolfgang Halbig&#39;s inquiries into Sandy Hook. </p>

<p>Halbig was leading the charge to file FOIA request for various school records pertaining to Sandy Hook Elementary School (SHES) such as maintenance and records for the school, receipts and contact for contractors performing work to the school, as well as police dash cam tapes and audio from the day. </p>

<p>If everything was indeed real, and the school was running, there should have been volumes of financial data, which is a matter of public record. However, many of Halbig&#39;s FOIA requests were denied. An appellate hearing was held and several witnesses involved with the school were examined.</p>

<p>A great excerpt of the school district&#39;s maintenance supervisor being examined. </p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1cumfVWpVCc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1cumfVWpVCc</a></p>

<p>(Update to Halbig&#39;s inquiry: Halbig has shut his website &quot;sandyhookjusticereport.com&quot; down after receiving alleged threats to his family. He is interviewed about this on the Richie Allen Show 10/6/16)</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe3sLE21eDo">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe3sLE21eDo</a></p>

<p>Still with me? </p>

<p>Here are some of Halbigs Original issues with the SHES &quot;massacre&quot; below. (Quoted from <a href="https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2014/02/25/sandy-hook-massacre-was-a-contrived-event-says-former-state-trooper-wolfgang-halbig/">https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2014/02/25/sandy-hook-massacre-was-a-contrived-event-says-former-state-trooper-wolfgang-halbig/</a>)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When the police arrived at Sandy Hook Elementary School (SHES) that morning, they parked ¼ mile from the school’s front door instead of doing what first responders are supposed to do in an active shooter event, which is to neutralize the threat as quickly as possible so as to save as many lives as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Paramedics and EMTs (emergency medical technicians) were not allowed to enter the school. Instead they were kept waiting in the Sandy Hook fire station nearby, 500 yards down the road from SHES.</p></li>
<li><p>Trauma helicopters, which can provide the quickest and best medical services in an emergency, were not sent to Sandy Hook. Life Star, the medical helicopter service at Danbury Hospital’s Trauma Center, told Halbig “we were never called, never asked.”</p></li>
<li><p>Where were the ambulances to transport the wounded to hospitals?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did police declare 26 people to be dead within the first 11 minutes of the shooting, when according to Connecticut law, only a doctor can declare someone to be legally dead?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did the FBI classify the Sandy Hook massacre? This has never been done before. Even the Columbine School massacre was not classified information. To this day, the FBI report on Sandy Hook remains classified information, not releasable to the public.</p></li>
<li><p>Why did the State of Connecticut wait ELEVEN whole months to issue its official final report on the Sandy Hook shootings to the American public? Note that the final report does not include the FBI’s still-classified report.</p></li>
<li><p>Police transmissions don’t lie because they are made by sworn and trained law enforcement officers. On the morning of Dec. 14, 2012, recorded police transmissions said “We have multiple weapons inside the [SH] classroom — a rifle and a shotgun.” But nobody could find the shotgun in the school. Instead, a shotgun was found in the black Honda parked outside the school.</p></li>
<li><p>At 9:45 AM that day, a police officer found a surviving kindergarten-aged girl in the hallway. The officer sent her back into Room 8 — a crime scene with students and teachers shot dead. What police officer would do that?</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, that morning, two Connecticut state troopers entered Room 10 and found an unharmed boy hiding in the bathroom. The troopers ordered the boy to stay in the room — a room with dead people. “That’s not police protocol.”</p></li>
<li><p>Having investigated and given expert testimony on many school shootings, Halbig says “I know what tears look like.” But the parents of slain Sandy Hook children, as we’ve noted here on FOTM, did not cry. (In the now famous case of Robbie Parker, the father of allegedly slain 6-year-old Emilie, he went from laughing and joking to pretending to choke back tears in the blink of an eye.)</p></li>
<li><p>Sandy Hook’s medical examiner Dr. Wayne Carver refused to let the parents see the bodies of their slain children, and instead gave them photos of the bodies, which is “unheard of.” Halbig knows about the inconsolable grief of parents and is himself a parent. Parents whose children had been shot dead “would kick the door down” demanding to see the bodies.</p></li>
<li><p>Why was Sandy Hook Elementary School torn down? This is not the case with  any of the other schools where shootings had taken place, including Columbine School.</p></li>
<li><p>Who installed the new security system at SHES? This should be a matter of public record.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(This new security system was bragged about in a SHES news letter prior the incident)</p>

<ol>
<li>The shooting-to-death of 26 people would leave 45-60 gallons of blood. Who cleaned it up? What biohazard company was hired to clean the crime scene?</li>
</ol>

<p>(Receipts, records, chain of custody for biohazard cleanup?)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why is there not even one lawsuit by a Sandy Hook parent against SHES for negligence? Halbig has never ever seen a school shooting without parents suing the school for negligence. </p></li>
<li><p>Why are there so many fund-raisers for the Sandy Hook shootings? Halbig: “I’ve never seen so many fund-raisers” in the case of Sandy Hook. One fundraising alone, by United Way, netted $17 million, from which “every [SH] parent got a big chunk of money.”</p></li>
<li><p>Alleged shooter Adam Lanza, 20, is said to have Asperger syndrome — a high-functioning (in academics) form of austism. Halbig points out, however, that like those with autism, children with Asperger have “very very poor motor skills” and “very poor muscle tone.” How did Asperger-afflicted Adam Lanza with “very poor muscle tone” carry a rifle, a shotgun, a handgun, and bullets? How did Asperger-afflicted Adam Lanza with “very very poor motor skills” shoot 26 people dead — not wounded — in less than five minutes, firing one bullet roughly every two seconds?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(An amateur shooter, with no formal training or experience, and adrenaline pumping, would not be able to shoot, lethally hit targets and reload quickly, while cycling between 3 different weapons. Below is a link of Keanu Reeves shooting for time in a &#39;3-gun trial&#39; while training with professionals for John Wick 2; essentially, this is how Lanza would have to be moving)</p>

<p>Parents were not given photos from which to make ID&#39;s. As a matter of fact there is no evidence that any parent or family member ID&#39;d their own loved one.</p>

<p>All IDs were carried out by LE or the Coroners Office based on descriptions and photos provided by family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response. These questions were from Halbig&#39;s initial issues with the case, so many of them have been covered since. </p>

<p>The coroner ID procedure was worded incorrectly by the site I sourced the questions from (I believe.) I forgot to note that while trying to organize the info, so thank you for the correction. </p>

<p>The link about the blood cleanup was very well put together, I recommend everyone take a look.</p>

<p>Regarding the lawsuit, that link references a case that was quite some time after Halbig&#39;s initial presentation of the issues, so he wouldn&#39;t have been able to take that into account. I haven&#39;t had a chance to look into the legitimacy of the lawsuit yet, so i cant comment at the moment. Just the same, thanks for keeping things accurate. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>These two clauses have nothing to do with each other. A police officer reporting a death isn&#39;t declaring that person legally dead. Are you under the impression that no one in Connecticut is allowed to report on deaths besides doctors? How would a police officer right up a report for a homicide?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is there not even one lawsuit by a Sandy Hook parent against SHES for negligence? Halbig has never ever seen a school shooting without parents suing the school for negligence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they are really hard to prove. All the suits from Columbine against the school district were dropped. The precedent really isn&#39;t there. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did the State of Connecticut wait ELEVEN whole months to issue its official final report on the Sandy Hook shootings to the American public? Note that the final report does not include the FBI’s still-classified report.</p>

<p>In your law enforcement experience how long are these reports supposed to take? Columbine&#39;s took almost <a href="https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/Columbine%20-%20Governor&#x27;s%20Commission%20Report.pdf">two years</a>. </p>

<p>Some of these don&#39;t seem all that weird if you understand how certain processes actually work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the main point, which is that as of the date of the date these questions were written, the FBI report was still classified.  </p>

<p>Why are they classified? We know the identity of the alleged shooter, and his alleged motives; what remaining information is so sensitive to require a classified label? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. Like i said, these were questions quoted directly from Halbig&#39;s initial query years back. </p>

<p>I wanted to give an accurate representation of his initial issues, instead of cherry-picking the ones that were harder to debate or debunk. </p>

<p>I try to give the whole story, even when it would be detrimental to my argument. Unaltered truth is favorable to a well tailored argument, because it allows people to evaluate the evidence for themselves instead of trying to persuade or deceive them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the delayed response: </p>

<p>It is extremely curious for officers to walk into a room and say, &quot;yeah they&#39;re all dead, everyone take your time.&quot; Which sets off a lot of alarm bells. Its very uncommon practice.</p>

<p>I have many LE members as friends and family (sheriff, police, state police,) and they have all advised this is not common unless the victim is very obviously dead. (Most recently a traffic collision involving a wooden fence board through the passengers head. Paramedics still responded and performed compressions until arrival to hospital, although the vic had no brains left)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were two children rushed by ambulance to the hospital, but they didn&#39;t survive. There were also two injured teachers transported.</p>

<p>Before the building was secured, the initial triage was performed by police with EMT training, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-YeEgq5sO7NdWlLeF9mYXEtVUU/edit">Sgt. William Cario</a></li>

<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-YeEgq5sO7NNWIwcTdaaVh0d1U/edit">TFC William Blumenthal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The police rushed two injured children and one injured teacher out to ambulances, which approached the school as soon as it was secured. Later, a kindergarten aide with lesser injuries was also transported.</p>

<p>After the building was secure, Sgt. Cario picked the most experienced paramedics to enter the building.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I realized that at some point those victims presumed dead would have to be officially pronounced dead. We also needed to impact the fewest number of EMS personnel and that we needed to preserve the integrity of the scene Looking around I recognized two other senior paramedics that I believed had the experience and training to handle this situation tactically. I told Cassavechia I would bring himself, Paramedic Bernie Meehan, and Paramedic John Reed into the school, which was secured by that point. They were told to bring minimal equipment. As we walked to the school I tried to prepare them for what they were about to see. I told them of the number of victims and the nature of the wounds. I told Cassavechia, &quot;This will be the worst day of your life.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-YeEgq5sO7NdGxINGZJbVJ4cWM/edit">Matthew Cassavechia, Director of Emergency Medical Services at Danbury Hospital, and a tactical paramedic operator since 2006</a></li>

</ul>

<p>The medics were in telephone contact with Emergency Medical Control
Physician D. Pat Broderick at Danbury Hospital. They were shortly joined
by Dr. Richard Kamin, EMS Director for Connecticut&#39;s Department of
Public health.</p>

<p>All the other children had &quot;injuries not compatible with life&quot; and were
declared &quot;dead right there&quot;. All the victims were checked four times,
including once with an EKG.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ID84PGV.jpg">Here is an adult wounded by the same kind of ammo (NSFL).</a> Now imagine a six year-old hit by 3 to 11 of these bullets.</p>

<p>Almost all the children had their faces blown off. Noah Pozner had an <a href="http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/168707/wrestling-with-details-of-noah-pozners-killing/">open casket because only his lower jaw was blown off.</a> covered by a cloth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to agree.  As someone who has worked in software development for a search engine, I know there is nfw that there is any kind of &#39;bug&#39; in the visit date of a web crawler.</p>

<p>And when I read that the google metadata showed that the United Way page set up for SH was visited the DAY BEFORE the &#39;event&#39;, and checked it out myself, it is a irrefutable fact that the united way page was created BEFORE the event even happened!</p>

<p>That kind of &#39;bug&#39; could happen in the first <em>day</em> of a search engine release, but not after 10 freaking years.  </p>

<p>Then there are all the other anomalies, like the fact that the &#39;christmas trees&#39; which were supposedly donated AFTER the event, but somehow there are pictures of THAT DAY of the firehouse, and a load of christmas trees poorly hidden in the back yard of the firehouse.</p>

<p>The truth IS going to come out, and I predict it will happen in the next 2 years at most.  Way too many bs things that happened for criminals like Lenny Posner to get away with harassing innocent people for much longer.  I can&#39;t wait to see him doing the perp walk on his way to jail.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Here are some of Halbigs Original issues with the SHES &quot;massacre&quot; below</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LMAO all of them indicate he&#39;s pretty much as intelligent as a lump of sand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the police arrived at Sandy Hook Elementary School (SHES) that morning, they parked ¼ mile</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LMAO wrong.</p>

<p>watch the dashcams.</p>

<p>look at the aerial footage.</p>

<p>done.</p>

<p>next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nstead of doing what first responders are supposed to do in an active shooter event,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh pray tell. What experience do you or dickshit Halbig have as first responders?</p>

<p>Please tell me what they <em>must</em> do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which is to neutralize the threat as quickly as possible so as to save as many lives as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, a first responder of <em>any</em> kind&#39;s first task is to secure their surroundings not charge in like some videogame hero. Got that? </p>

<p>Good.</p>

<p>Next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paramedics and EMTs (emergency medical technicians) were not allowed to enter the school.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A first responder&#39;s very first task is to secure their surroundings.</p>

<p>This means waiting until everything is clear. That is pretty much the first thing taught to you in any first-response situation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead they were kept waiting in the Sandy Hook fire station nearby, 500 yards down the road from SHES.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course this is <em>completely</em> false as the names and response-times of a half dozen different medical personnel - inlcuding nurses, emts and paramedics are easily accessible.  One can easily read their statements as to their arrival and their being escorted onto the scene.</p>

<p>Next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trauma helicopters, which can provide the quickest and best medical services in an emergency, were not sent to Sandy Hook. Life Star, the medical helicopter service at Danbury Hospital’s Trauma Center, told Halbig “we were never called, never asked.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would they use a helicopter when there were adequate medical facilities less than 12 miles away and ambulances were already on site?</p>

<p>Nah, lets wait for a helicopter to scramble, fly over, find a suitable landing site, load up a much more complex rig, and fly back to the Lifestar helicopter base 3x the distance than what what the Ambulance would need to drive.</p>

<p>Or be on the road and at the hospital in ~15 minutes.</p>

<p>Next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where were the ambulances to transport the wounded to hospitals?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There weren&#39;t very many wounded. They didn&#39;t need a fleet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did police declare 26 people to be dead within the first 11 minutes of the shooting, when according to Connecticut law, only a doctor can declare someone to be legally dead?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;legally dead&quot; definition wasn&#39;t made by the police. </p>

<p>Saying &quot;yes, these are most definitely dead&quot; is not the same as a legal pronunciation. </p>

<p>There were also EMTs on site capable of making such statements. </p>

<p>Next.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did the FBI classify the Sandy Hook massacre? This has never been done before. Even the Columbine School massacre was not classified information. To this day, the FBI report on Sandy Hook remains classified information, not releasable to the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t really care what the FBI has to do with anything. It&#39;s actually extremely irrelevant. And of course that ignores the 100+ pages of their report they&#39;ve released.</p>

<p>This is getting boring. It&#39;s like Halbig actively tries to be this stupid</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did the State of Connecticut wait ELEVEN whole months to issue its official final report on the Sandy Hook shootings to the American public? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>LMAO Investigations take time. </p>

<p>Real life isn&#39;t CSI</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that the final report does not include the FBI’s still-classified report.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>109 pages were included from the FBI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police transmissions don’t lie because they are made by sworn and trained law enforcement officers. On the morning of Dec. 14, 2012, recorded police transmissions said “We have multiple weapons inside the [SH] classroom — a rifle and a shotgun.” But nobody could find the shotgun in the school. Instead, a shotgun was found in the black Honda parked outside the school.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right, but mistaken 0-hour reports happen constantly.  It&#39;s almost like people running around shouting things during a chaotic situation return chaotic inaccurate results.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At 9:45 AM that day, a police officer found a surviving kindergarten-aged girl in the hallway. The officer sent her back into Room 8 — a crime scene with students and teachers shot dead. What police officer would do that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because according to the statements of the officers involved, they didn&#39;t know there were bodies in that room.</p>

<p>I guess his other option was to escort her through an unsecured area, maybe use her as a shield.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, that morning, two Connecticut state troopers entered Room 10 and found an unharmed boy hiding in the bathroom. The troopers ordered the boy to stay in the room — a room with dead people. “That’s not police protocol.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually it was <strong>two children</strong> (you fail) and they were both escorted out by Officer Smith.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having investigated and given expert testimony on many school shootings</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And was he as painfully shortsighted through all of them?</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see what shootings he gave &quot;expert testimony&quot; on. It&#39;s interesting that he&#39;s the only one saying this about himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Halbig says “I know what tears look like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great, so do I. </p>

<p>There are plenty of unfortunate photographs of teary eyed family members.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the parents of slain Sandy Hook children, as we’ve noted here on FOTM, did not cry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, like these?</p>

<p><a href="https://chrishernandezauthor.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/article-sandyhook3-0114.jpg">https://chrishernandezauthor.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/article-sandyhook3-0114.jpg</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(In the now famous case of Robbie Parker, the father of allegedly slain 6-year-old Emilie, he went from laughing and joking to pretending to choke back tears in the blink of an eye.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah man, almost like such intense emotional trauma does really fucked up things to a person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Parents whose children had been shot dead “would kick the door down” demanding to see the bodies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>really likes to speak on peoples behalf, doesn&#39;t he?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why was Sandy Hook Elementary School torn down? This is not the case with any of the other schools where shootings had taken place, including Columbine School.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the community decided it was a good idea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The shooting-to-death of 26 people would leave 45-60 gallons of blood. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A fully grown human has little over 1L of blood. A child considerably less. Do your math please.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s even making the assumption that every ounce would spill it. </p>

<p>Which it wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>But any picture of the large amount of blood and gore that would be present was collectively  agreed to not be shown. You&#39;d think if this was a hoax they&#39;d dump some theater blood around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who cleaned it up? What biohazard company was hired to clean the crime scene?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clean Harbors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is there not even one lawsuit by a Sandy Hook parent against SHES for negligence?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe they didn&#39;t blame the school? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Halbig has never ever seen a school shooting without parents suing the school for negligence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Halbig says lots of things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are there so many fund-raisers for the Sandy Hook shootings?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dunno. </p>

<p>Why are there so many bakesales?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One fundraising alone, by United Way, netted $17 million, from which “every [SH] parent got a big chunk of money.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost like it was a really shocking event that a lot of people felt strongly about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Halbig points out, however, that like those with autism, children with Asperger have “very very poor motor skills”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not all of them.</p>

<p>I see Halbig is an expert on Autism too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and “very poor muscle tone.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not all of them. At least not enough to prevent them from lifting a few things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did Asperger-afflicted Adam Lanza</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And just how afflicted was he mr expert?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>carry a rifle, a shotgun, a handgun, and bullets?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So heavy! Wow! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did Asperger-afflicted Adam Lanza with “very very poor motor skills”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How poor?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>shoot 26 people dead — not wounded — in less than five minutes, firing one bullet roughly every two seconds?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think being in a confined space, with a lot of people without weapons, most of them being children likely pushed up against walls and corners helped.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(An amateur shooter, with no formal training or experience, and adrenaline pumping, would not be able to shoot, lethally hit targets and reload quickly, while cycling between 3 different weapons. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[citation needed]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Below is a link of Keanu Reeves shooting for time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And he did all that damage in 40 seconds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>essentially, this is how Lanza would have to be moving)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or he could have just walked normally through the halls and rooms and shoot the large group of people huddled together.</p>
