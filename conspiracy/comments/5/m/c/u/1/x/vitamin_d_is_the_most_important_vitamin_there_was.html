        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Recommendation for vitamin D intake was miscalculated, is far too low, experts say: <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150317122458.htm">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150317122458.htm</a></p>

<p>I say the recommendation is still too low. If you think about it, the optimal dose of vitamin D would be whatever you are capable of making by spending some amount of time in the sun every day. After all, that is what our skin is designed to do. Our ancestors were outside in the sun every day. Consumption of vitamin D rich seafood also played a very important role in early man: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257695/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257695/</a> </p>

<p>Today, we are cooped up indoors and our seafood is poisoned, therefore, we must supplement (or sparingly consume seafood low on the food chain due to bio-magnification of toxins). </p>

<p>So, how much would our bodies produce if we acted like our ancestors? About 5,000 iu per day: <a href="https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/how-do-we-know-how-much-vitamin-d-you-make/#">https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/how-do-we-know-how-much-vitamin-d-you-make/#</a></p>

<p>I bought a supplement that contains 10,000 per dose, which I take every other day. Don&#39;t forget that getting sunlight for vitamin D is only effective late spring, summer, and early fall. Winter months will only give you UVA rays, which do not produce vitamin D. Don&#39;t forget that most sunscreens only block UVB, the good sun rays. </p>

<p>My pain and depression are gone, so I thought I&#39;d share this with you guys. Stay healthy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is when you go out you need to wear sunscreen. That limits Vitamin D production.</p>

<p>We also wear a lot of clothing and not a while lot of skin is exposed.</p>

<p>Most black folks in America are also deficient in Vitamin D because their skin has more melanin.</p>

<p>Fish, cheese egg yolks etc are also good sources of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thing is, our clothing blocks a lot of our skin. Vit d3 is produced especially heavily in places like your butt, which is obviously going to be covered at all times. Your face + arms are NOT enough to get adequate amounts of vitamin d, especially since you have to be outside for most of the day to get any tangible benefit. Supplementing with d3 is pretty important in developed worlds.</p>

<p>Intermittent exposure to the sun increases risk of skin cancer, but occupational exposure decreases risk. There is also evidence that high vitamin D levels decrease melanoma risk. This means that if you get a good dose of sun every day (for example, if you work on a farm), you develop a tan, which is the regulator of how much vitamin D you get and it also protects you from damage. The key seems to be getting the correct amount of vitamin D consistently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You forget that we are in r/Conspiracy! I believe that the American Medical Association deliberately endorses foods that make people sick in order to ensure that Americans are dependent on doctors/medical care, and you are quoting from a &quot;mainstream&quot; source that is part of the conspiracy! There are tons and tons of studies that show that legumes are bad for you. While legumes are indeed high in nutrients, they are also really high in toxins that are difficult for the body to eliminate. Soybeans are the worst of the legumes. <a href="http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/170-scientific-reasons-to-lose-the-soy-in-your-diet/">http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com/170-scientific-reasons-to-lose-the-soy-in-your-diet/</a>  Now, the exception to the no soy rule -- as seen in the article that I had previously posted -- is fermented soy. Fermenting seems to somehow neutralize the toxins of the soy. Back to the conspiracy... I believe that Monsanto is paying the AMA to endorse soy, wheat, and other grains that it makes GMO seeds for. I have no direct proof, but here is an article that shows that the medical associations are corrupt: <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303678404579533760760481486">http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303678404579533760760481486</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dr. Greger is a vegan doctor, not a &quot;mainstream&quot; source.  </p>

<p>There are no &quot;toxins&quot; in soy. This soy panic is not unlike the belief that <em>corn</em>, the staple grain of the civilizations of the Americas for so many thousands of years, was full of toxins causing a horrible disease called pellagra which I urge you to research as is an illustrative case study. </p>

<p>It is the same as suggesting that wheat or corn or rice or any other grain is essentially toxic and &quot;bad for you&quot; when it has everything to do with methods of consumption, preparation, genetic modification and excessive quantity.   Asians consume soy, not just fermented soy, regularly for an extremely long time and have not seen rates of heart disease or cancer until they began adopting a western diet.  </p>

<p>I sympathize with your concerns greatly but you are wrong here on this issue, it happens.  I use to be on a ketogenic diet, everyone is wrong on these things sometimes and I have nothing personally invested in arguing with you about soy lol.  If soy was bad for me then I would not be eating it as I have no need to BELIEVE soy is good or bad for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a deliberate conspiracy, but an unwitting one.  The medical profession is more and more a business than a profession. </p>

<p>Business-oriented people who work for Big Pharma are focused towards profits, and not-so-much towards helping the general public stay healthy, so that they won&#39;t need to buy expensive drugs and treatments.  </p>

<p>Much scientific research is conducted with money from special interests, which means it&#39;s intended to prove something which will benefit that special interest.  My own masters thesis work was paid for by an industry which hoped to benefit from the results of my research, and they did; no fudgery required.  This is probably the case 99% of the time in my experience.  But I have heard whispered rumors of threats and intimidation, when research didn&#39;t go the &quot;right way.&quot;  Nothing I or anyone could prove of course.</p>

<p>At any rate, no university, which lives on grants from the private sector would want jeopardize it&#39;s relationship with private industry by conducting controversial research, unless altruistic principles over-rule all else.  I can&#39;t say this never happens of course.  One can only hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sunburn is caused by too much UVB. The reason you don&#39;t get sunburn in the winter is because there is very little UVB. UVB is also responsible for vitamin D production. This is not an either/or scenario. You can get plenty of vitamin D production and get out of the sun before a sunburn.  I have no idea why you commented with this stuff. You clearly didn&#39;t understand my post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you scrolled down this far, congratulations. </p>

<p>Vitamin D is actually a lot more than just a vitamin. It is known to act as a hormone. Besides the whole thing about calcium and healthy bones, Vitamin D is required for your immune system to function at it&#39;s best.</p>

<p>I learned this about 6 or 7 years ago. Every year, I used to one or two colds. They&#39;d knock me flat on my ass and last for a couple of weeks. I tried a few different things like echinacea and vitamin C.</p>

<p>Nothing really made much of a difference. Then, after learning about the connection between Vit D and immune function, I started taking 400 iu every couple of days.</p>

<p>My guess is that, during the winter, the sun is a lot weaker and we go outdoors a lot less and cover up a lot more. Vit D is a fat soluble vitamin, so there&#39;s a delayed drop in levels. You&#39;r lowest levels will probably be at the end of winter, just before the weather starts warming up.</p>

<p>Every year it seemed like this was the exact time I&#39;d get my worst cold. What happened after I started supplementing? The difference was like night and day. I&#39;d still get colds, but not as often. Also, they&#39;d last for about 10 days instead of 2 weeks... and the symptoms were a lot less severe.</p>

<p>Vitamin D is cheap. You can get a lot of the benefits just by taking it 2 or 3 times a week. I&#39;d guess that one bottle of vitamin D tabs could last you a couple of years. It would pay for itself many times over from savings in cold medicines that you&#39;ll no longer need.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;m pretty sure vitamin D helps with seasonal affective disorder as well. </p>

<p>As for the hormone thing. A hormone is any chemical that acts as a messenger within the body. I honestly can&#39;t write much about this off the top of my head.</p>

<p>But if you want to know more, do a google search using the terms &quot;vitamin D hormonal functions&quot; and see what comes up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Weston A Price Foundation has been saying this for decades.  And Dr. Price discovered it traveling the world studying nutrition of various cultures and the incidence of dental carries (cavities).  He was able to manifest amazing cures for very sick children by dosing with high vitamin butter oil from grassfed cows and quality cod liver oil.</p>

<p>We have known a long time to take ours and watched governments speead disinformation and actively try to terrify people about Vit A overdose based on crap studies that used synthetic Vit A given in absence of Vitamin D3 as it naturally occurred in Cod Liver Oil.</p>

<p>Now they have made laws that the oil has to ve filtered out and synthetic vitamins put back in and Norway keeps the good stuff at home.</p>

<p>If you search hard enough one can fond a couple virgin oil brands in the US though I don&#39;t think the fermented one is good as many think. I cant stand it and as a result haven&#39;t taken my high doses for healing being so deficient idiot doctors even realized it.  It was also expensive with the only good brand but now I found another and I am doing this.  The one time I managed it I had mood and thyroid disease improvements and myopia was halved!</p>

<p>The evolutionary theory says that humans were dark-skinned when they first entered Europe 30-50 millennia ago, but due to conditions  of much less sunlight striking the skin, those with lighter skin pigments were actually healthier due to higher levels of vitamin D.  Over time, the healthier individuals reproduced more offspring and eventually dominated the population of the region.</p>

I thought I was being healthy before but I was getting colds and flus probably every other week. My immune system was robbed by the pharmaceuticals I was putting in my body. I have been off everything now for over 2 years and feel better than ever. This and changing my diet to non-GMO/organic/hormone free/local, not drinking tap water, staying away from chemicals found in toothpaste/soaps etc. </p>

<p>The reason people get skin cancer is because they allow their skin to burn occasionally, then they allow their bodies to enter a vitamin D deficient state. This combination is what causes skin cancer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, you need magnesium in order to absorb D3 and calcium, so magnesium is the critical thing to take with D3. Do not take calcium unless your blood work shows you need it. Most Americans get enough calcium from food. Too much calcium causes things that aren&#39;t supposed to be hard and brittle to become hard and brittle -- like our arteries. K2 is an essential nutrient found in animal fats. Most Americans are deficient and need to take this, partly due to the low saturated fat craze we&#39;ve been on the last 30+ years, and partly because the unnatural diet animals grown for food tend to be fed means the animals can&#39;t make the K2 for themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a huge stretch to consider aluminum a heavy metal: it has a low atomic number, low atomic mass, and low density. Furthermore, the designation of heavy metal is not actually that useful, except as a scare word.</p>

<p>To your main point though about sunscreen, aluminum is not absorbed through the skin in any appreciable amount. Also, it accumulates more in bones than in the brain. As well there is disagreement about the toxicity particularly the dose-response. Meaning low levels have never been shown to be that bad... of course high doses are a problem like anything. Bioavailability from oral ingestion of most forms is also very very low. I would not freak out about it but feel free.</p>

<p>I was talking about vitamin D with a girl I met in Australia, and I wonder if there&#39;s any truth to what she said. She said that it takes time for the vitamin D from the sun to be absorbed through the skin, so you should wait 8 hours after being in the sun before you bathe. Has anyone else heard this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this goes so much deeper than just vitamin D. Once you really start looking into nutrition - official recommendations (recommended daily values for nutrients, as well as macronutrient recommendations ie. the food guidelines), what doctors are taught in medical school, the corporate interests involved in shaping what we are told to eat - it&#39;s really scary and depressing how wrong (intentionally or not) the government and special interest organizations have gotten everything.</p>

<p>For a start: Cholesterol is a precursor to vitamin D. The low-cholesterol movement is one reason so many are deficient in vitamin D (in addition to the sunscreen recommendations). Chris Masterjohn is a researcher who writes a lot about this. Here is an article he wrote, just to start with:</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.cholesterol-and-health.com/Vitamin-D.html">http://www.cholesterol-and-health.com/Vitamin-D.html</a>)</p>

<p>Then, learning more about cholesterol leads to a Robb Wolf post about cholesterol and mental health:</p>

<p>(<a href="http://robbwolf.com/2012/11/01/cholesterol-mental-health/">http://robbwolf.com/2012/11/01/cholesterol-mental-health/</a>)</p>

<p>Tie this in with Statins, drug companies, the USDA, corporate lobbying, etc. etc. </p>

<p>Chris Masterjohn also talks about Vitamin K (important along with vitamin D):</p>

<p>(<a href="https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/2016/12/09/the-ultimate-vitamin-k2-resource/">https://chrismasterjohnphd.com/2016/12/09/the-ultimate-vitamin-k2-resource/</a>)</p>

<p>I find it all really overwhelming and really disillusioning, and I&#39;ve been looking into this for about 10 years now - it just gets worse and worse. It&#39;s hard to even shape my thoughts into a coherent narrative, because there are so many tentacles and offshoots, such a big web.</p>

<p>I had a vitamin panel done with some blood work and was found deficient in vitamin D. The vitamin panel was an extra test that insurance wouldn&#39;t cover. I was suggested to take 5,000 iu once per week.</p>

<p>While vitamin D is rather harmless to take extra, at some point there becomes a level where it may become toxic or have negative health consequences if you severely over do it. I don&#39;t know where that cross over point of danger is, but want to urge caution.</p>

<p>Typical daily over the counter doses are 400 iu, please consult your doctor if you feel you need more than like 1000 iu per day, especially regularly.</p>

<pre><code>One of the undisputed benefits vitamin D provides for you is improved bone development by helping you ABSORB calcium. This is not news -- we have known about vitamin D and the absorption of calcium for many decades.

But there is new evidence that it is the vitamin K (specifically, vitamin K2) that directs the calcium to your skeleton, while preventing it from being deposited where you don&#39;t want it -- i.e., your organs, joint spaces, and arteries. A large part of arterial plaque consists of calcium deposits (atherosclerosis), hence the term &quot;hardening of the arteries.&quot;

Vitamin K2 activates a protein hormone called osteocalcin, produced by osteoblasts, which is needed to bind calcium into the matrix of your bone. Osteocalcin also appears to help prevent calcium from depositing into your arteries.

You can think of vitamin D as the gatekeeper, controlling who gets in, and vitamin K as the traffic cop, directing the traffic to where it needs to go.

Lots of traffic -- but no traffic cop -- means clogging, crowding, and chaos everywhere!

In other words, without the help of vitamin K2, the calcium that your vitamin D so effectively lets in might be working AGAINST you -- by building up your coronary arteries rather than your bones.

There is even evidence that the safety of vitamin D is dependent on vitamin K, and that vitamin D toxicity (although very rare with the D3 form) is actually caused by vitamin K2 deficiency.5

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that the American Medical Association deliberately gives bad nutritional advice in order to ensure that Americans are sick and reliant on doctors/medical care. Three years ago I was diagnosed with a rare disease. Since it is rare and poorly funded, doctors don&#39;t know much about it and I was basically on my own to figure out how to cure myself. I hopped on PubMed -- the National Institute of Health&#39;s section where research papers are published -- and started reading studies about different things. After reading all these studies, plus an assortment of books, and curing myself (almost, I am 90% better now), I am convinced of this conspiracy. Low Vitamin D levels are the hallmark of many chronic diseases, including my own, as well as many types of cancer. I believe that the lack of routine testing for Vitamin D levels, and sweeping the importance of Vitamin D under the rug are deliberate by the AMA to make sure people do get sick. Vitamin D is only one of dozens upon dozens of things the AMA doesn&#39;t quite get right.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracies and unsupported claims aside; I have a personal story to tell:
Every year for the last 2 decade or so, I found a number of recurring health problems appearing around December, and fading away around March or April.  Disrupted sleep patterns, high glucose levels, rashes, sore joints and many other things were getting worse every year.  I had thought that perhaps I might be short of vitamin D, so I was taking 2-3000 IU per day, but I didn&#39;t see much improvement.  Melatonin seemed to help to some degree, particularly for disrupted, sleep, but the other problems seemed to be getting worse each year.
This year, I tried taking 10,000-15,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day.  So far, as of mid-January, I am seeing very few if any of the previous symptoms.
This is not a scientific study, but it&#39;s certainly very meaningful to me.</p>
