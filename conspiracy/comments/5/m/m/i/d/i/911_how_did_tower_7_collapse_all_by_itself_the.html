<p>The way the WTC collapsed near the top quarter of the structure and completely demolished the remaining 3/4 of healthy steel structure, entirely to dust, is not explainable with Newtonian physics.  The NIST model (the official government explanation) blatantly violates fundamental principles of energy conservation, which is taught in high school physics.</p>

<p>The falling mass was simply too great for any of the floors below to stop, so they collapsed one at a time, just really fucking fast. The columns survived the longest, but they were basically made irrelevant when the floors around them broke their connections. </p>

<p>There is physical evidence to back this up. A welders study of debris recovered from the towers showed that truss connectors below the plane impact zones in both towers failed by bending down or shearing completely off at a rate of 96 percent vs less than 40 percent above the impact zones. That means that floors below the collapse initiation point <em>overwhelmingly</em> failed by being overloaded by debris falling from above. </p>

<p>Show me the math. Because the math I know (was taught) doesn&#39;t work. </p>

<p>Sure thing. </p>

<p>The trade towers were an open floor plan design. The columns were concentrated in the center of the structure and at the perimeter with nothing but open floor space between them. Each of the 110 floors of the building were tied to the core and perimeter using truss connectors. You can see them in this picture, they are the little metal lips that the trusses are bolted to. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.debunking911.com/construction.jpg">http://www.debunking911.com/construction.jpg</a></p>

<p><em>Each individual floor</em> of the trade tower could support roughly  29 thousand tons of static load on those truss connectors. Any more than that and the connectors fail and the floor collapses. You sit 30 thousand tons on the 110th floor, the truss connectors fail and it drops onto the 109th floor. The <em>columns</em> working in concert and properly braced could support the entire weight of the building, but each floor had a limit to how much it could hold. Think of a bookshelf. The entire bookshelf itself might be able to hold 500 books, but each individual shelf can only hold 100.</p>

<p>Got it? Good. Moving on. </p>

<p>Each floor of the trade center had roughly 31 thousand square feet of office space and was carrying roughly 80 pounds per square foot of static load. That means that any single floor of the trade center weighed around 2500 tons on the morning of 9/11. When the top portion of the South tower collapsed at the plane impact zone, it became 30 floors worth of unsupported mass moving downward. That 30 floors at 2500 tons per floor was roughly 75,000 tons of load. It was <em>2 and a half times</em> what the first intact floor was built to support, and it was <em>dynamic</em> (moving), which amplifies the load by at least a factor of 2. The first intact floor can&#39;t support the mass crashing down on it, the truss connectors fail and the floor collapses. That mass now has 31,000 square feet of open office space between the core and perimeter columns to drop through before hitting the next intact floor. That next floor has the same weight limit (29,000 tons of <em>static</em> load), but the mass hitting it is now <em>77,500</em> tons of <em>dynamic</em> load (representing the initial 30 floors plus the first intact floor that just collapsed). It fails even faster than the first. This sequence repeats all the way to the ground. </p>

<p>The columns are merely pushed out of the way as the floors tear their connections and collapse around them. </p>

<p>Which part do you disagree with? The weight capacity of the truss connectors? The per square foot load of the towers? If you have better, more accurate information, by all means let&#39;s hear it. </p>

<p>And the wmds? Bet you have an answer for that too</p>

<p>Iraq? I bet they did it</p>

<p>Just really all coincidence that the two sons of two oil baron families were having breakfast together while it happened. 
And they get flown out of the country while every other plane is grounded. </p>

<p>The world&#39;s most convenient terrorist attack ever. </p>

<p>We will just discount the first hand reports of explosions in the basement. Of the &quot;pulling &quot; of building 7 and who made billions off this </p>

<p>We will ignore Cheneys stand down orders and how it just happened to coincide with an international drill of the exact thing at the exact same time.</p>

<p>Much convenience. So coincident.</p>

<p>Go tow some other non scientific bullshit. Your world view will be crushed soon. Get ready </p>
