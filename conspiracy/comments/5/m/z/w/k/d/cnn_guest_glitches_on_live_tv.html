Mr O&#39;Keefe says during his analysis &quot;if you believe the election results&quot; and then it happens. You might want to go full screen and watch it frame by frame but the glitch is clearly localized to Mr O&#39;Keefe. Nothing outside of his silhouette glitches at all. I guess someone had to do a quick overwrite to make him say &quot;you should believe the election results&quot;, which clearly shows up as a localized glitch on screen. This is my first post on this thread and just wanted to get it uploaded quickly so I apologize if I broke any reddiquette. What do you guys think this is? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what to think.. either poorly timed satellite transmission hiccup... or a really sloppy edit. Maybe if you could find the same broadcast from a different TV it would be more clear what happened... I see lots of freaky artifacting now that broadcasts are digital. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it wasn&#39;t a live broadcast, it could easily have been a sloppy morph-cut (the technique which left weird artifacts in the Pilger Assange interview). His vocal melody in that section also hints at the fact that some significant part of what was actually said was cut out.</p>

<p>Morph cut is an Adobe plug in that is pretty new on the market. For some shots it works flawlessly, for more complex transitions it still leaves a fair amount if visual artifacts or glitches. If you&#39;re half asleep on the couch you won&#39;t notice them, but when you&#39;re actually watching it becomes pretty obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you caught something here.  I would be less skeptical is this was Wolf Blitzer (and andrea mitchell?  or is that dana perino?) and the timing of the glitch wasn&#39;t so corrective.  the reason this strikes me as strange is because of what he is saying.  in the one hand he is parroting state talking points about: </p>

<p>&quot;the majority of americans... who voted&quot; </p>

<p>which is punctuated to make it seem like the majority of americans voted AND voted for hillary clinton.  when really that statement is only honest when NOT punctuated.  </p>

<p>&quot;The majority of americans who voted&quot;...</p>

<p>So that&#39;s on point with the propaganda.  What&#39;s NOT on point with the propaganda seems like a slip that he was/ they were attempting to correct here- where he said &quot;If you believe the election results&quot;, implying that there is some reason NOT to believe these particular election results.  He has messed up the propaganda by associating two talking points that are contradictory and not to be used in association with each other-</p>

<ul>
<li><p>that the election was hacked by the russians and therefor not valid</p></li>
<li><p>that hillary actually won the DEMOCRATIC election (popular vote).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It looks like an ordinary transmission/reception glitch to me, albeit unfortunately timed. It&#39;s difficult to say for sure based on the quality of the video, but the artifacts appear to be completely square, which is consistent with it being a video error. IMO, it only appears localised to O&#39;Keefe because he was the only person moving during the glitch - the error correction / frame prediction in video codecs prevents artifacts from showing up in other areas because those areas didn&#39;t change in the frames just prior/after the glitch.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll want to look up connection vs connectionless protocols and why each is used.</p>

<p>In short, imagine a phone call. If you lose 1 second of audio, do you want the call to pause so that 1 second can be resent? No, you just want the audio stream to continue.</p>

<p>Now imagine a web page. If you lose 1/100th of a text page, do you want to pause the page loading so that 1/100th can be resent? Yes, because you&#39;re already waiting for it to load and you want the final page to be the intended text.</p>

<p>Multiple recipient audio and video streams are connectionless because streaming is intended to be in sync to a schedule. If your TV paused and buffered like Netflix everyone would be watching shows that were slightly offset time wise. It would be a nightmare for broadcasters. On the other hand, like the Netflix example, when your stream is for one person it is okay to pause and buffer if data is lost.</p>
