<p>Why are humans so obsessed with labeling and categorizing their fellow humans.</p>

<p>It only further pushes a divide between us by creating sublet groups of humans that can be classified by one term which is asinine in itself because you can&#39;t fully describe someone or their views with one word.</p>

<p>Every time I see someone classify themselves or another human with a label I cringe at the thought of further segregation and divide we already experience. Yeah it&#39;s an easy way to classify someone with a certain set of beliefs but I truly feel it&#39;s disadvantageous and only makes it easier for humans to hate someone else.</p>

<p>Have labels for people ever done us any good? No not really. </p>

<p>She had a post about not interrupting children when they talk. That seemed stupid to me, because really, you shouldn&#39;t interrupt people when they talk in general. Why the specific post? </p>

<p>She claimed it happened more in children, but I work with all children and most adults really try to listen to children.</p>

<p>But, since she was a mom, she knows all, right?</p>

<p>She ended up getting super pissed and saying I need to respect that she didn&#39;t want to hear my opinion. It was so ridiculous so I called her out for wanting an echo chamber, and she agreed, that&#39;s what she wanted.</p>

<p>That seemed stupid to me, because really, you shouldn&#39;t interrupt people when they talk in general.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think there are (at least) two schools of thought on interruption&#39;s role in dialogue.  And some people have opposite takes on it.  I, for one, think that interruption can be helpful in a productive dialogue if it serves as interjection to add context , direction, information or sometimes even affirmation to a person&#39;s point.  Even when it is not helpful in the context of the point being made by the primary locutor, it pre-empts that person to let them know that their point is not being properly communicated.  Again, what I&#39;m talking about is not necessarily interruption in terms of cutting the speaker off, but simply a natural component of active dialogue which seeks to add to a conversation and break up a monologue.  But at the same time, there are people who view this interruption of their spoken thought as distracting and rude.  I think these are different mindsets and personality types and there are often communication problems between people with differing opinions on this.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But again, those are two subjective perspectives from opposing points of view.  You two may have entirely different experiences, or you may simply have entirely different interpretations of similar experiences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She ended up getting super pissed and saying I need to respect that she didn&#39;t want to hear my opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>were you possibly being combative and not listening to her complete perspective?  Because it seems like not listening was exactly the point she was talking about, so she may have been particularly sensitive to your rebuttal on the subject.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is wrong with people? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe what&#39;s wrong with us is that communication is difficult and we are reactive to other people and their opinions which don&#39;t translate entirely into our belief systems.</p>

<p>It is rude.  It shows that you don&#39;t have the patience to let them get their entire thought out and that you&#39;re really not listening to the point of trying to understand what they are saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I disagree. And you and I would probably have trouble communicating unless you are willing to only speak in singular thoughts and short paragraphs.</p>

<p>I think that fact that you&#39;ve made an objective judgement on something with multiple perspectives re-enforces that potential communication issue.  Saying &quot;It is Rude&quot; vs saying, I find that type of conversation difficult because it doesn&#39;t allow me to finish my thought.</p>

<p>Again, I tried to be clear that the purpose of interruption can be TO show that you you are listening and trying to understand what the other person is saying.  But I feel that you didn&#39;t address that, and rather you dismissed it in your broad conclusion- showing me that you were not really listening to the point of trying to understand what I am saying.  </p>

<p>But again, i suspect you and I would have communication issues. I&#39;m a fan of active listening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stand by my statement that interrupting people before they are finished speaking is an extremely rude thing to do.  And I say that as a person who has, in my youth, often interrupted people to try and do as you are saying, to let people know that they aren&#39;t getting their message across, or even to agree with them.</p>

<p>My mind works fast.  I have always tested in high levels all through school.  I have a t-shirt I wear frequently that says &quot;is there any way we could speed this up?&quot;  </p>

<p>but my mind and what I want to say will often cause me to interrupt and I have learned (I&#39;m closing in on 50 years old) that to not interrupt is a show of respect.</p>

<p>I moved to Alaska twenty years ago.  Native Alaska people speak very, very, agonizingly slowly.   It drives me fucking crazy.   But their viewpoint is, they speak slowly to you as a sign of respect, that they are thinking over their words before they blurt them out because they do not want to appear that they are not listening and taking in all that the other person is saying.  They do not want to give the impression that they are speaking without thinking.    </p>

<p>When I learned that this is how they conduct conversation, it set me back quite a bit and humbled me.   It made me rethink how I was communicating with other people, and how interrupting them to say &quot;yes I feel that!&quot; or &quot;no, it&#39;s this way!&quot; was indeed rude, because I was not giving the other person the time to fully express themselves and yes, they might be slower than me to put it all out, but that&#39;s ok, because I have the time to sit and respect what they are trying to communicate.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I say interrupting is rude.   If there is one thing we as humans have plenty of, it&#39;s minutes and seconds and hours.   It costs me nothing to sit and listen to full thoughts from people, and it shows respect that you are willing to sit and and listen to all of what some person wants to say.  They may be telling you something that takes more than a paragraph to express.   It may be that they want you to sit a moment and think about what it is that they have said before you blurt out what you wanted to say.</p>

<p>Interrupting someone means that you think what you have to say is more important than what the other person is trying to get across.   </p>

<p>I am willing to give the other person room to speak their mind, free of my thoughts, so that I can understand the entire message of what they want to say regardless of my thoughts on the matter.  I know that if I do this, and show courtesy to them, that they are more likely to then sit and listen to my thoughts.</p>

<p>Talking over another person can rarely be seen as helpful.   How would you like it if what you were trying to say, which you knew exactly, if I was insistent on throwing my viewpoint in every half paragraph?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a sign of respect to the person you are having a dialogue with to let them get their thoughts out.  It&#39;s a courtesy, something that is entirely lacking in modern day discourse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it pre-empts that person</p>
</blockquote>

<p>think about that.  what it does is shut down the person.  you are saying, when you interrupt, that what they are saying doesn&#39;t have the value of what you want to say.  Would you like that done to you?  It&#39;s condescending to think that you are smarter and know how to communicate better than the person you are speaking with.  When you interrupt, you are saying that you don&#39;t value what they are trying to express and that your thoughts are have greater value than theirs.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t get far in life with that kind of viewpoint.</p>

<p>We can all learn from each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>ok. i suppose that says something about you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when you interrupt someone, for whatever reason, you are shutting their voice down so that you can be heard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>again, I disagree.  It&#39;s not necessarily stopping their point from being made.  it&#39;s potentially adding depth and insight to the level of communication.  Communication isn&#39;t one sided and requires input and output from multiple parties.  Again, I prefer active listeners who interject during a conversation, because it lets me know whether they&#39;re understanding me, and are actively engaged in the discussion.  I think monologues are disrespectful of my time and level of understanding. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You won&#39;t get far in life with that kind of viewpoint.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a particularly respectful.  I pointed out that you and I would have trouble communicating with each other, but that wasn&#39;t a dig on you.  And I feel like you&#39;ve misunderstood my point and are being accusatory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, the only thing to consider is this. A lion cannot take on 50 wolves. He is strong enough to take down individual wolves but he can&#39;t go up against all the wolves. </p>

<p>The elite know this. The problem for them is that we are uniting at rapid speeds. They pretty much know its over although they have some vague hope that a war with Russia will help. The only problem with that is that Obama has 11 days left in office.</p>

<p>The whole thing is as bad as a criminal robbing a bank and being on a high speed chase by the the law. The criminal knows he made a serious mistake that will have grave consequences. Even if nobody goes to jail, the loss of power alone will squash their Godly quality lifestyles which is as bad as us going to jail. Its the power that they hold so dear. It&#39;s the ability to control the actions of society that they are going to lose first and that will be devastating. </p>

<p>All we have to do is put in a little bit of effort since there are so many of us that it adds up quickly. But.... once we gain the power, we have to scramble to reverse decades worth of damage which will be fun at least but still, work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in the day, when I still embraced organized religion, I used to go to daily Mass. When the elementary students attended that Mass, the priest would make every effort to address his comments to them in a format that they could readily understand.</p>

<p>One of these homilies went like this:
&quot; I was standing in line at a convenience store, waiting for my turn to pay. I was in a hurry, so I got my money from my wallet so that when my turn came, I would be ready. As I stood there waiting, I looked at the 2 one dollar bills in my hand. One was brand new. It looked like it had just been printed. It was crisp and clean, and all of the corners were sharp. The other one was crumpled and dirty. One corner was torn off, and someone had even written on it. God only knows where it had been. But as I looked at these, I realized that even though they looked very different from one another, they both had the exact same value.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should make a distinction between labels and models.  Labels are descriptive.  You can apply a bunch of labels to something and you&#39;ve just decorated that thing with more information.  Models on the other hand, are typically stereotypical representations of a class of a thing.  They infer a design (which is usually incomplete and ill-fitting), and the qualities associated with that design.  It&#39;s in bad models where the real logic fails happen, not in labels.  I&#39;m not trying to make a nit-picky argument here about what words mean.  One can pick whatever jargon they want.  My point is that there&#39;s a fundamental difference between decorative information and with hierarchical/model information.  It&#39;s in the hierarchical models where one sees ill-fitting duality, and the conformance of belief systems to false models.     </p>

<p>Not to belabor the point.  Typical uses of language tend to fail at communicating the distinction, often because people choose to see things as binary when it&#39;s not at all like that.  This leads to all sorts of avoidable miscommunication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Even among the ancients the more grown-up knew that the source of right is power, that right is a function of power. So take some scales and put on one side a gram, on the other a ton; on one side &quot;I&quot; and on the other &quot;We,&quot; OneState. It&#39;s clear, isn&#39;t it? - to assert that &quot;I&quot; have certain &quot;rights&quot; with respect to the State is exactly the same as asserting that a gram weighs the same as a ton. That explains the way things are divided up: To the ton go the rights, to the gram the duties. And the natural path from nullity to greatness is this: Forget that you&#39;re a gram and feel yourself a millionth part of a ton.”

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a useful side to labelling – or categorizing, and that&#39;s that it makes people less intimidating; because, even though they&#39;re weird, if you can categorize them, they&#39;re at least <em>known</em>. Without being able to categorize, the strange is scary and unknown, and society hates that. This is the danger of trying to fuck with the categories. At a certain point, society will stiffen and those on the fringe will be the first to go.</p>

<p>Not to the general public there isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>To the ad &amp; manufacturing industries, the media, and any other group that utilizes demographic profiling, it&#39;s awesome because it easily allows target marketing towards specific demo groups.</p>

<p>It sucks for the general public though because it really does create an &#39;us vs them&#39; mentality that isn&#39;t socially healthy.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/eSqZGTNrPi8">Divide &amp; Conquer.</a> That song is like 30 years old and painfully relevant.</p>

<p>Unity as an individual was kind of a common theme in a lot of 80s punk rock but attitudes changed when multiculturalism replaced individualism in the late 80s.</p>

<p>Social academics &#39;flipped&#39; the way people were supposed to treat each other. Rather than being seen as equal individuals, people were collectivized, labeled, and lumped together and told to see people not as equals but as strict members of whatever label they happen to fit into.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re &#39;black&#39;, you&#39;re supposed to act &#39;black&#39;, if you&#39;re &#39;gay&#39;, you&#39;re supposed to join the gay &#39;community&#39; and do whatever the leaders of the community tell you to do. If you&#39;re an &#39;atheist&#39;, you&#39;re told to hate &#39;Christians&#39;, etc...</p>

<p>All that stuff is kind of designed to use a lot of &#39;no true Scotsman&#39; fallacy bullshit to convince people to adhere to the rules or get treated as a traitor to the cause.</p>

<p>Reddit is especially bad for the use of labeling since that&#39;s the point of subreddits. It is useful to find people that relate to the stuff you like but the downside is that it encourages in-fighting between different sub-reddit communities.</p>

<p>Why are humans so obsessed with labeling and categorizing their fellow humans.</p>

<p>because it helps us categorize and store patterns.  I hear what you&#39;re saying, but by realizing that we all fall into patterns that can be organized (but not defined purely by) labels it gives me the context to recognize patterns and make faster an more accurate predictive models.</p>

<p>yes, it is an over-simplification in a way, but it&#39;s technique which allows us to to analyze and make informed decisions.</p>

<p>This is the only answer since they are the only ones who need a label since they are the ones who are oppressing and controlling humanity.</p>

<p>They need to be labelled because we as humanity need to not only identify and categorize the cause (<em>if you cannot identify and categorize the cause then you won&#39;t understand the problem</em>) of the problem itself (<em>which would be a massively negative system of control and oppression built around negativity</em>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider this: labeling and stereotyping are shortcuts for the brain to make split decisions.   I.e. You know the swastika is popular amongst new-nazis so when a gang of white dudes with swastika tattoos come in the bar you leave.
It&#39;s just a double edged sword in places with many ppl like America.  It helps us individually to make split second decisions and it also keeps us driven apart.
So I think labels are natural and helpful, but they are being coopted by tptb to wedge us apart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s how the mind works, the brain characterizes input by isolating characteristics. This can best be described by the stupidity of saying, &quot;don&#39;t judge me bro. &quot; you are, if your a critical thinker at all, making judgements all the time whether you admit it or not. Humans make judgments or are discriminating based on criteria developed through life experience and training. This is where the Tabula Raza really is a true psychological phenomenon. </p>

<p>BTW: Discriminating means to choose based on merit or quality. It didn&#39;t used to be a character fault to be discriminating, and if you like and dislike people for whatever reasons you may hold you are, in fact, discriminating on whatever basis criteria you personally believe has merit. If you like our dislike products for whatever reason, you are also being discriminating.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree to an extent... I&#39;ll admit I do this sometimes. But isn&#39;t all language labels? At what point do you decide a label describes a thing as it is, versus the thing as it is observed? It makes it really hard to have a conversation about another person, when you constantly need to monitor your language so as to not use labels to refer to them in a way that might cause emotional turmoil.</p>

<p>I suppose I need to be better about mocking the ideology rather than the person for having it, but it&#39;s kind of a hassle to have to word everything so deliberately. It doesn&#39;t compress well into real conversations either. </p>

<p>&quot;TRIGGERED LIBERAL&quot; vs &quot;your ideology that seems to be backing your non-argument is based on regressive and harmful ideas to how a society should function, and you seem like you are kind of emotional as a result, and as a result I feel this conversation isn&#39;t going anywhere, and that you need to grow up&quot; just comes off as condescending when I try it, apparently. </p>

<p>Either seems to lead to non-arguments on the other-side of many of the discussions I try to start, but I tend to find the later is even less productive. Because it&#39;s usually already established that I&#39;m an asshole to the other side, but become a condescending asshole, that starts a whole new discussion. And yes.. I know these people are idiots. Oops: I mean, people who don&#39;t know what they are talking about and don&#39;t refute logical arguments on the basis of those arguments, and seem more concerned about how they perceive me to be as a person rather than an actual discussion.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget about: racist, sexist, bigot, and racial categorization with an implication of how someone thinks. (&quot;Hey white guys!&quot;)</p>

To exist in a world of good and bad is to exist in a world of judging. To step out of that world is to awaken. There is no judger, for if there ever were, real peace would be forever unknown. </p>

<p>Fortunately, through confusion, suffering, and thus, awakening, judgments/thoughts/conditionings are no longer controlling our conscious state of being. When we now partake in discussion, we&#39;re losing the &#39;little me&#39; who has to be right and has to be the winner of the debate.</p>

<p>Rather, we&#39;re awakening to and caring for the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a nice thought, but without labels we no way of understanding each other. A label and a slur aren&#39;t the same thing. The trick is to accept people for who they are without letting those labels cause you to think of them negatively. Allowing negative thoughts into your mind will only cause that negativity to manifest itself in you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of labels we are divided, because some people are willing to see what&#39;s in front of them where as others are unwilling. The only way to unite everyone is to remove the reasons behind why the unwilling are afraid to look. This fear stems from insecurities, which stems from lack of knowing, which stems from lack of someone being willing to care enough to set them straight. Labels often serve to give someone a sense that you don&#39;t care about them so they must be used carefully, but it&#39;s one thing to refer to someone else as what they are for sake of understanding, and something different entirely to refer to label them directly. A person knows what they are, they don&#39;t need another person to tell them, but someone else might need that information. It&#39;s all in how you use it. Labels aren&#39;t inherently bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could it be that we are hardwired to do so by nature? 
Humans always want to be separate from nature because somehow nature isn&#39;t good enough for us, even if we have shown over and over again what kind of imbecile morons we as a species are.</p>

<p>Without inner profiling, we would all be dead. Let a lion into your compound and it kills all your folk. Second time round, stop the lion. Or as some people would prefer, let the lion in yet again, because we don&#39;t want any profiling. Duh.</p>

<p>This pattern is true even for the most minute things. If something causes something negative, you will remember it in order to avoid the same next time. </p>

<p>Heck there is also positive categorizing, for similar reasons. Humans who mainly do things that are liked, will also be categorized. It means you want them around you, you want to hire them and in general you will be correct [with few exceptions]. </p>

<p>Categorizations are important for our survival and cannot be eradicated. They can only be made illegal, but our brains will do it anyway.</p>

<p>One of these homilies went like this:
&quot; I was standing in line at a convenience store, waiting for my turn to pay. I was in a hurry, so I got my money from my wallet so that when my turn came, I would be ready. As I stood there waiting, I looked at the 2 one dollar bills in my hand. One was brand new. It looked like it had just been printed. It was crisp and clean, and all of the corners were sharp. The other one was crumpled and dirty. One corner was torn off, and someone had even written on it. God only knows where it had been. But as I looked at these, I realized that even though they looked very different from one another, they both had the exact same value.&quot;</p>
