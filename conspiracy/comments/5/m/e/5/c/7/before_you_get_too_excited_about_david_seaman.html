       David Seaman is
       <strong>
        exploiting
       </strong>
       youtube, r/conspiracy, and r/the_donald (among others).  If you've wondered why David is not straight on his facts, why he seems to be manufacturing rivalries, why he always needs donations, and why he seemed to pop up from nowhere...here's your answer.

       All of my comments on his videos now are "get a real job motherfucker." He just keeps pushing all these new social media platforms hes on like "find me on Gab, vid.me, whatever." He also plays up minor setbacks like the CIA did them. He had two back to back videos about "reptiles are in my Paypal!!!" But I had to verify my account with actual ID after a hack attempt on my account too. I couldn't figure out why he would play that up so much until the end of the second video where he tells everyone "and that's your money in there so make sure to donate more and yell at paypal to give it all to me! Bye for now!"

       Who cares?  He is actively researching child pedophiles while being bullied, censored and harassed.  Who cares if he self promotes? He has to make money.  He is doing a service.  If people don't like him, don't watch him.

        Until now, the record has been 5,000 unique visitors to view a press release within 24 hours. This press release was also picked up by the Chicago Tribune and a very large number of popular online news sites including Fark, Twitter, Facebook, defamer, google finance, reddit, gawker, buzzfeed and stumbleupon.

        Until now, the record has been 5,000 unique visitors to view a press release within 24 hours. This customer had a fairly bland product and he knew that he needed controversy in order to create online buzz. He got more controversy and attention than any of us could have ever imagined. We estimate that this press release was seen at least 400,000 time online since most of the online press releases did not link back to us or our hit counter.

       I was about to get upset this wasn't at the top until I realized it was posted only an hour ago. Honestly, if I don't see a 180 on my front page tomorrow saying "whoops this guy tricked us to make money and we believed him, we'll try to think more critically next time", I'm done with this sub.

       Seemed like a great guy at first. Others are bringing forth new PG research and this guy just does self promotion. Do some stuff on the USS Liberty or 911 or any other false flag. He loves Israel? later dude..

       We have been incredibly wrong with this expose of David Seaman. Myself included. All this nonsense is detrimental. People are exposing David Seaman? Wow that really helps our cause. The guy has obviously put in significant work. His videos are getting many views. That helps us all. Trying to be cool and "expose him" is stupid and helps no one. Actually he does deserve to promote himself. We need to focus on spreading info and reaching people who are asleep. I think David Seaman is doing both to a large audience. For that he gets a big "thank you" from me. I am actually glad he wrote a book on self promotion. It means has skills to reach people on these subjects. At the end of the day, that is what really matters..

       You need to stop looking at the person and instead the information with the person. If it's relevant then use it as reference. Never put belief in anything unless you're forced to make a decision. Let people watch him and once his information is needed, we'll know if it's up to the standard it's supposed to be. Accumulate information and stand by.

       You don't have to listen to him, let others do. Especially if you have disbelief in him. However, remember that nobody can hold all the cards to the solution. Never fully believe anyone and never fully disbelieve someone.

       Exactly, all I'm saying too. But totally neglecting him could end up devastating. Ignore the posts and let other participate. That's what I do, and then I participate that I feel is more relevant for me to know.

       David threatened to sue me and a tiny news publication the one time I wrote an article that was 100% factually accurate. I said he doesn't do anything to research besides read reddit and watch youtube videos, then repeat that information while begging for money. I wrote an article saying exactly that in 2009/2010 and he refused to respond to ANYTHING I said, except I was a troll, he'd sue me, and go after me in other ways. He said Obama planned to indefinitely detain conservatives using a provision in the amended NDAA. I challenged him and he never once responded to any point I made about how he was flat out wrong (the NDAA prevented Americans from indefinite detention). Then he posted a picture of me on his google plus page and asked his "anon" friends to go after me. How can you help any cause if you run and hide from anybody who challenges you with substantive information? He latches on to the conspiracy of the day, floods the internet with it, spams his content, begs for money, gets fired, claims it's a big conspiracy and his life is in danger, it turns out he was completely wrong about everything, he talks about bitcoin for a while, and repeats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quick question: why can't he work AND then do a 15 minute video repeating information he read on the internet? Why does he need your money? I'm just saying. He can say whatever he wants, but he's fooling you all by getting you to pay his bills.
