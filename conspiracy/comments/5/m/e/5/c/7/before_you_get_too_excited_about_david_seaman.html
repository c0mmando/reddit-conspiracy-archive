<p>A. Services</p>

<p>B. Web sites</p>

<p>C. Books</p>

<p>&quot;As I recall the following points are provided throughout the book:</p>

<p>Create real outrage</p>

<p>Establish a positive connection with the public</p>

<p>Always remain accessible to the media</p>

<p>Have an enemy and publicize your rivalry</p>

<p>Exploit the viral aspects of YouTube and Vimeo</p>

<p>Create a viral group on Facebook</p>

<p>Network with others in your field</p>

<p>Appear in-demand at all times</p>

<p>Befriend the print media, especially trade magazines</p>

<p>Be seen as a controversial expert, not an average Joe&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of my comments on his videos now are &quot;get a real job motherfucker.&quot; He just keeps pushing all these new social media platforms hes on like &quot;find me on Gab, vid.me, whatever.&quot; He also plays up minor setbacks like the CIA did them. He had two back to back videos about &quot;reptiles are in my Paypal!!!&quot; But I had to verify my account with actual ID after a hack attempt on my account too. I couldn&#39;t figure out why he would play that up so much until the end of the second video where he tells everyone &quot;and that&#39;s your money in there so make sure to donate more and yell at paypal to give it all to me! Bye for now!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>34,000 Hits To A Controversial Press Release Within 24 HOURS</strong></p>

<p>Until now, the record has been 5,000 unique visitors to view a press release within 24 hours. This press release was also picked up by the Chicago Tribune and a very large number of popular online news sites including Fark, Twitter, Facebook, defamer, google finance, reddit, gawker, buzzfeed and stumbleupon.</p>

<p>Until now, the record has been 5,000 unique visitors to view a press release within 24 hours. This customer had a fairly bland product and he knew that he needed controversy in order to create online buzz. He got more controversy and attention than any of us could have ever imagined. We estimate that this press release was seen at least 400,000 time online since most of the online press releases did not link back to us or our hit counter.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this a preposterous tactic? Well, sure it is, but now millions of people know about his shotgun rack. TMZ gets to call him a sleazeball, and he gets free advertising for a product that must appeal to someone -- to people who have shotguns in their bedrooms. Everyone wins,&quot; said <strong>David Seaman</strong>, author of Dirty Little Secrets of Buzz and a <strong>controversial stunt planner</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have been incredibly wrong with this expose of David Seaman. Myself included. All this nonsense is detrimental. People are exposing David Seaman? Wow that really helps our cause. The guy has obviously put in significant work. His videos are getting many views. That helps us all. Trying to be cool and &quot;expose him&quot; is stupid and helps no one. Actually he does deserve to promote himself. We need to focus on spreading info and reaching people who are asleep. I think David Seaman is doing both to a large audience. For that he gets a big &quot;thank you&quot; from me. I am actually glad he wrote a book on self promotion. It means has skills to reach people on these subjects. At the end of the day, that is what really matters..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>David threatened to sue me and a tiny news publication the one time I wrote an article that was 100% factually accurate. I said he doesn&#39;t do anything to research besides read reddit and watch youtube videos, then repeat that information while begging for money. I wrote an article saying exactly that in 2009/2010 and he refused to respond to ANYTHING I said, except I was a troll, he&#39;d sue me, and go after me in other ways. He said Obama planned to indefinitely detain conservatives using a provision in the amended NDAA. I challenged him and he never once responded to any point I made about how he was flat out wrong (the NDAA prevented Americans from indefinite detention). Then he posted a picture of me on his google plus page and asked his &quot;anon&quot; friends to go after me. How can you help any cause if you run and hide from anybody who challenges you with substantive information? He latches on to the conspiracy of the day, floods the internet with it, spams his content, begs for money, gets fired, claims it&#39;s a big conspiracy and his life is in danger, it turns out he was completely wrong about everything, he talks about bitcoin for a while, and repeats.</p>

<p>Quick question: why can&#39;t he work AND then do a 15 minute video repeating information he read on the internet? Why does he need your money? I&#39;m just saying. He can say whatever he wants, but he&#39;s fooling you all by getting you to pay his bills.</p>
