        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">235</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-06 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Loud_Volume.html">Loud_Volume</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There really is so much information on this I&#39;m going to try to keep it short and summed up. The cycle we are entering is a natural cycle, and earth has undergone it before.</p>

<p>Only this time, humanity will succeed and enter the golden age. Last time this was possible it failed and backfired in a negative way and Atlantis fell.</p>

<p>Biblical prophecies in EVERY religion are coming true. This is the end times FOR DARKNESS. We are entering a period where love and light will reign supreme and the negative low heavy vibrations of fear, anger, hatred, will no longer be the norm.</p>

<p>Cosmic changes are happening to all our immediate planets, not just earth. This is hard for me to say because I used to buy into global warming, but after additional research it appears global warming is part of a natural cycle as we enter into this new age.</p>

<p>Earthquakes, solar activity, volcanoes, all increasing in frequency as mother Gaia changes and adapts to a fifth density living where she naturally belongs.</p>

<p>We are seeing the earth purged and healing itself. Thousands of animals are dying day per day as we undergo this shift.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/animal-deaths-birds-fish-end-times.html">http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/animal-deaths-birds-fish-end-times.html</a></p>

<p>If you look at earthquakes after 1967 (when they were first started to be recorded) we have had a steady increase ever since then we as near this golden age. The rise in earthquakes cannot be disputed by saying it&#39;s because more earth quake sensors have been installed. Global earthquake sensors have been in place and have been able to record 2.5+ Richter scale earth quakes.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/512wD6y.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/512wD6y.jpg</a></p>

<p>As the earth enters this new age, the ramp up of the battle between light and dark enter a whole new arena.</p>

<p>The negative clamps that have held a fear based control system upon mankind (archons) are losing their power upon mankind and cannot control the new era we are entering.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVLCYMezi0">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8sVLCYMezi0</a></p>

<p>With this golden age comes cosmic changes. Earth has been getting repeated hits of light (for lack of a better description) to help us undergo these changes and shake loose these negative cabals</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theeventchronicle.com/metaphysics/spiritual/70-year-old-prophecy-earth-will-soon-swept-extraordinary-rapid-waves-cosmic-electricity/#">http://www.theeventchronicle.com/metaphysics/spiritual/70-year-old-prophecy-earth-will-soon-swept-extraordinary-rapid-waves-cosmic-electricity/#</a></p>

<p>Because the negative forces are losing their grasp on mankind, they are pulling out all the stops possible to restore their negative control upon man.</p>

<p>This is not working. This shift WILL HAPPEN, no matter how hard the darkness tries to restore its control. They have lost. And they know it.</p>

<p>Khazarian illuminati have been getting broken up and arrested. It&#39;s rumored Hilary Clinton is under house arrest (explains her lack of appearances) it&#39;s also rumored David (correction, was John) Rockefeller is dead, it&#39;s rumored George Soros is dead.</p>

<p><a href="http://conspireplanet.blogspot.com/2016/07/benjamin-fulford-says-khazarian-mafia.html?m=1">http://conspireplanet.blogspot.com/2016/07/benjamin-fulford-says-khazarian-mafia.html?m=1</a></p>

<p>Here is some backstory on the khazarians 
<a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/03/08/the-hidden-history-of-the-incredibly-evil-khazarian-mafia/">http://www.veteranstoday.com/2015/03/08/the-hidden-history-of-the-incredibly-evil-khazarian-mafia/</a></p>

<p>As deep underground bases are collapsed and destroyed that once held safe locations for these evil beings, they are increasingly running out of places to hide. And will face the justice they deserve.</p>

<p>No longer will we live in a third dimension where the wheel of karma takes longer to affect you. Your immediate actions will immediately have an effect and will no longer take a long time to reach you.  No longer will we be subjugated to control, fear, and anger.</p>

<p>Satan does not exist. But Moloch and Baal do. Both extremely negatively oriented beings that certain cabals have worshipped on earth and seek to gave them power. Hell does not exist, but light and dark does. This is a classic battle of light vs dark we are witnessing in front of our eyes play out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theeventchronicle.com/intel/the-khazarian-mafias-globalist-nwo-agenda-to-destroy-every-nations-sovereignty/#">http://www.theeventchronicle.com/intel/the-khazarian-mafias-globalist-nwo-agenda-to-destroy-every-nations-sovereignty/#</a></p>

<p>In these times of seeming darkness, hold the vibration of love and help further break the chains of control. We have been kept so negatively aligned that it has been easy to control us, manipulate us, force us into the will of these negative influences. That time is no longer. For THOUSANDS of years this energy clamp on mankind has kept us down.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.unicusmagazine.com/html/Antidote4Archons.htm">http://www.unicusmagazine.com/html/Antidote4Archons.htm</a></p>

<p>As we enter this new age always remember this. The darkness IS WEAK. They are NOT STRONG. Light is a positive frequency that transcends the negative low vibrations that these things feed on. </p>

<p>They are actually very weak and we can easily, easily, free ourselves from their control (as we are doing now) always remember that light and love hold a higher place than fear and negativity.</p>

<p>I will wrap this up by saying we have an abundance of help with us right now. We are not alone in this universe, and disclosure is only a matter of time now. We are being watched over, monitored, and helped, by countless positively aligned ET&#39;s. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cosmicharmony.com/LightWorkers/ETWisdom/ETWisdom.htm">http://www.cosmicharmony.com/LightWorkers/ETWisdom/ETWisdom.htm</a></p>

<p>Remember that WE ARE ONE. We originate from source consciousness. We are a part of God. We have a direct link to the divine (pineal gland) and we all share a divine link to the source, with all of creation.</p>

<p>Our souls cannot be destroyed. We are light. We are spiritual beings having a physical experience. We chose to incarnate on earth at this time but because of the limitations of incarnating here we have a veil of forgetfulness that has removed our knowledge of our past lives. This can be accessed.</p>

<p>Treat others how you would like to be treated. Be kind, spread love and positivity and joy. Refuse to participate in fear vibrations. We are in this together, and we live in amazing time. Don&#39;t forget that. This is a VERY powerful time to be alive on earth. </p>

<p>I love you, I love source, and I love mankind. Let&#39;s keep our heads up as we purge this earth of the fear and negativity and enter into a new Age of Enlightenment. A new age of golden consciousness.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and feel free to share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For more information on this type of subject I highly highly recommend to get a subscription with this streaming service called Gaia. It is the first streaming service I&#39;ve found that focuses around spirituality, consciousness, ET, ancient history, and more.</p>

<p>A lot of this information in my post is from David Wilcock and his show Wisdom Teachings which are found on the Gaia network.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gaia.com/series/wisdom-teachings-david-wilcock">https://www.gaia.com/series/wisdom-teachings-david-wilcock</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So glad to hear it benefitted someone! I really wanted to share it with you guys, it&#39;s such an amazing service. I have yet to watch a show I haven&#39;t liked yet.</p>

<p>I highly suggest checking out wisdom teachings by David Wilcock, it&#39;s a truly enlightening show, as is everything on that service.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything except the 5th density part. Mans golden age should be a part of 3rd density. Each density is broken into 7 sub categories and each sub is broken into another 7 subs and it goes on for eternity. I think we are moving into a 3.3 or 3.4 density of sorts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only say that because at one point earth naturally was in the fifth dimension/density. I&#39;ve researched into it and it appears mother Gaia (earth) is indeed going into the fifth dimension but before doing so she is purging herself.</p>

<p>I agree though with what you say. I need to research more into the dimension of earth as I still need more research and information on the subject.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply friend. I enjoy seeing your name around here, as others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might seem weird, but have you noticed that in the past few years there is a random explosion of people turning this way?  Shedding fear, reaching out to each other with positivity?  People were reacting to Clinton like she was a foreign body, evil, to be pushed out.  People reacted to her like a visceral evil.  On the flip side, people are connecting on hard to explain levels to aid each other for no better reason than because.</p>

<p>It is very hippy-ish, I agree.  I grew up repub and something happened around George W to change my perspectives and I feel others might be feeling some of the same things.</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t there, it&#39;s ok.  Do what feels right to you.  But do think about what it is in you that feels right, and pursue it.</p>

<p>From the mouth of Benjimin Fulford.</p>

<p>A very interesting figure in the world of conspiracy.He had an editorial job with Forbes in Japan from what I remember I think he also has interesting family connections.His conspiracy theories are some of the most far out that you will come across.Chinesse ninjas at war with the illuminati,Japanese assassins ,the white dragon society he claims he is involved in it all.</p>

<p>He is obviously a nut right?</p>

<p>Then how did he land this interview with Rockerfella himself?
He claims he could of had Rockerfella brought to him in chains if he wanted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe he is a force for good. It&#39;s easy for people to dismiss what he says because of how &quot;far out&quot; his work is, but it&#39;s easy to verify and make the connections if you can get a global picture of what&#39;s happening now.</p>

<p>If you tie in what he&#39;s said with what&#39;s happening now to earth (new Age of Enlightenment) everything he says makes sense and rings true.</p>

<p>My intuition doesn&#39;t go off when I listen or read about him. I think he is genuine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, the whole idea of the &#39;Khazarian Mafia&#39; that Fulford talks about as an all-controlling entity of power is not going deep enough. There isn&#39;t one ultimate source of the negative on this planet. It&#39;s an amalgamation of thousands of years of negative/misinformed societies doing little things towards a larger collective goal (as weird and misguided as it may be...the Magnum Opus, or Great Work). </p>

<p>Fulford, to me, is a stooge. If you have details, share them. If you have sources more specific than &quot;Japanese Cabinet Sources&quot; and &quot;sources at the Pentagon&quot;, expound upon who they are. If all of this planetary shifting of energy is happening, why can&#39;t people like me feel it? I have researched this stuff for years. I don&#39;t see a positive glimmer of hope for the collective of humanity in our near future, based on real analysis (economic, political, esoteric, metaphysical, environmental, psychological, social and philosophical). Not some Asian White Dragon family that&#39;s never been seen or heard from outside of one lucky Canadian&#39;s privileged ears. It&#39;s a long, new age psy-op we are living. Little shards of truth mixed into a heaping pile of fantastical bs by way of people like Benjamin Fulford. there probably are little bits of truth in what he says. Take the talk regarding D.U.M.B.&#39;s.....I think him saying they are being collapsed is bullshit. But the mention of them means they exist. So that is the conveyance of a truth there, but the feel-good lie is that these white knight saviors are collapsing the literal earth to &quot;save people&quot;. Get the heck out of here. I don&#39;t believe that that is happening. I&#39;d need proof to believe something like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;If all of this planetary shifting of    energy is happening, why can&#39;t people like me feel it?&quot;</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s a spiritual shift my friend. Which starts as a personal experience. And in my own experience, it requires faith - or an openness to possibilities, to facilitate the shift from within.
Be open to guidance from the spiritual realm. They reach out through coincidences with timing, or in other words, seeds of providence. In my own life, I took these moments of providence with sincerity and paid attention to where they were pointing. For me, the simple act of letting these moments come and acting upon them, changed my life. The personal shift happened, and then I began to notice it occuring in others. Because with everything, what you pay attention to, is what you become conscious of.</p>

&quot;I&#39;m going to use a secret technique involving indirect questioning to avoid scaring him off and to allow him to speak his mind and he will reveal more with what he doesn&#39;t say&quot; First question &quot;Are you the leader of the shadow government and what do you think about one world government?&quot; Fucking lol. </p>

<p>And he&#39;s a stuttering mess, his reasoning is weak, and obviously aside from a little medallion he offers 0 evidence. The ONLY thing he has going for him is the fact that he interviewed a fucking Rockerfella. But maybe, it takes a doofus like this to have the balls to try it, and maybe being in Japan David R. felt like he should do a few local interviews before he met with the Emperor while he was visiting Japan. IDK, I know nothing about this guy other than this interview, and that apparently THIS GUY is the source of some of the front page material here? Pretty fucking skeptical. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theroist napoleon dynamite .</p>

<p>Your right,but if you dig into his credentials you would be surprised.</p>

<p>He was the editor and chief for Asian affairs at Forbes magazine from 98 to 2005 and has 15 published books written in Japanesse ,so he certainly no dummy and as you&#39;ve seen he managed to land a one on one interview with Rockefeller himself and confront him over the world government.</p>

<p>Most  intriguing to me is his family history.Apparantly he is the great grand son of George Taylor Fulford he first Canadian fatal automobile accident victim on record,&quot; also &quot; one the largest single shareholder in General Electric and was considering buying General Motor.Allegedly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To sum it all up basically:</p>

<p>We are entering into a new age of evolution for mankind. We are entering into the golden age, which is the spiritual age of consciousness where we remember what we are, who we are, where we came from, and how we are truly connected to each other and this earth.</p>

<p>It entails a new paradigm of thinking and state of being. And encompasses all things positive, world peace, technological advancement, betterment of mankind.</p>

<p>This won&#39;t happen suddenly but it is happening now. I hope I provided a new perspective to help you.</p>

<p>My sources are gathered from a lot of material I&#39;ve read and researched so I can&#39;t point to just one source. In my original post I gave several sources though and if you wish to have more information on one subject of this I can narrow in on that and provide you with more information.</p>

<p>Because of the scope of this, it&#39;s hard to include everything and address everything so I did my best to sum it up in this post and in this reply.</p>

<p>Much love and thanks for asking</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you elaborate on what you see as the connection between luciferianism and gnosticism? Gnosticism, to me, is a clearer interpretation of what Jesus&#39; preached: the kingdom of God is in man (All of Mankind).

    <div class="md"><p>The gnostic interpretation of the bible is essentially monism. </p>

<p>God as it were is unknowable to them, God is the creation, we are all of the creation, therefore we are all god. Furthermore gnosticism goes on to advance the notion that the so called creator god of the old testament is actually a demiurge (lesser god or subconscious ego) that has imprisoned humanity. It&#39;s taught that Lucifer, the light bringer, has saved man from his own ignorance and will deliver him to godhood. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the best way to live in accordance with that is to follow the advice of the Christ</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not quite. The bible is not simply a guide for how to live in the best way here on earth. It is first and foremost a set of instructions for your eternal salvation. </p>

<p>Be certain, the deceiver wishes to confuse you about this one, simple, truth. </p>

<p>The son of god is the son of man. The only requisite for salvation is your sincere and devoted belief. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Isn&#39;t this true, regardless of whether you are gnostic, catholic, etc.? Man is created in God&#39;s image; we are all a piece of the divine.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s true, then we are all co-creators to a certain extent. And if that&#39;s true, then our subconscious ego, the demiurge, has created much of the world in it&#39;s own image, however this image, as it is ego-driven, is flawed. It is not truly divine. A higher &quot;reality&quot; exists. A divine plane. </p>

<p>Realizing this and seeing the 3d world as being more or less illusory -- to understand that there is something purer beyond it  -- is a form of liberation.</p>

<p>I guess I just don&#39;t see the problem with it? I grew up Catholic and most of it didn&#39;t resonate with me. Gnosticism does to a certain extent. </p>

<p>Also, what exactly do you mean by &quot;the song of god is the son of man&quot;? Specifically the son of man part. Break that down for me.</p>

<p>And what must one&#39;s &quot;sincere and devoted belief&quot; be in? Which iteration of the bible? Which translation? Wouldn&#39;t we have to go back to the original texts and learn Aramaic to truly understand what it is we are supposed to believe in?</p>

<p>That&#39;s quite a stretch. I can &quot;create&quot; a toaster. I don&#39;t expect that toaster to share in my own nature. To be &quot;of god&quot; is not to be &quot;god&quot;</p>

<p>I said, &quot;the son of god is the son of man.&quot; That simply means that the son of god was a real man.  </p>

<p>Your belief is not in books and translations is not needed. Although those books have proven their worth time and time again as prophetic works. </p>

<p>The only sincere and devoted belief you need have is in the knowledge that the son of god lived, died and was resurrected so that you could know eternal salvation. </p>

<p>Good point. I wouldn&#39;t call myself a gnostic, but I would say that it intrigues me because of the idea that an individual can come to know God (and our true godly nature) through revelations rather than needing the intermediary of the church.</p>

<p>I do see extremist gnosticism as an elevation and exaggeration of the ego. I see the need for humility; it seems gnostics do not. </p>

<p>Out of genuine curiosity, I&#39;m wondering a few things:</p>

<p>you say belief in books is not needed...so where do your beliefs come from? And on what ground do you exclude others? </p>

<p>Who/what is Jesus to you, and how does this differ from the gnostic perspective of Jesus as a messenger of the Light/True God?</p>

<p>You do not need the &quot;church&quot; to know God. You can come to know him through prayer alone. I am very much against organized religion as it were.</p>

<p>The real church is the simply the fellowship of believers. No fancy buildings, no alters, no collection plates. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Before there were books, there was the spoken word God. Trust me, I read the written text with humility, knowing it was transcribed and translated by a man. But if you believe those words to be the divinely inspired word of God, you believe that core of the content cannot be corrupted, despite semantic breakdown and manipulation over time. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>To me Jesus (not his actual name btw) is what he says he is, he is both the father and the son. He is, and remains, the one and only human incarnation of God. </p>

<p>This differs from gnosticism because gnostics propose that Jesus was just one of <em>many</em> ascended masters who had come before him and more will come after him. I can assure you, the &quot;age of aquarius&quot; with have it&#39;s incarnation of &quot;the christ.&quot; I wouldn&#39;t be suprised if it asks people to call it &quot;Mitra.&quot; </p>

<p>As an interesting aside, watch the Matrix trilogy again, the films are an absolutely picture perfect telling of the gnostic philosophy.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s not how proof works. That&#39;s called Faith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just to say.. The vast majority of what people consider to be &quot;proof&quot; these days, is what other people have told them, whether they heard it or read it from others, and then they have &quot;faith&quot; that it is true, because so many others do the same thing.. have &quot;faith&quot; that it is true, and so therefore it is accepted as &quot;fact&quot; or &quot;proof&quot;. While simultaneously, you can get millions of people who believe in God, based on their own personal experiences, and not what others tell them, and the same people who have &quot;faith&quot; in their &quot;proof&quot; will look at those who believe in God and ask, &quot;Where is your proof?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its just that its hard to put it into words, and if you do put it into words it comes out like the OP. Sounds nonsensical if you havent been exposed to it. You literally have to take a journey into the inner realms of consciousness to understand what is being said. The external world is illusory, it is nothing more than a projection of our consciousness that we cocreate. If you start diving into meditations/mystical experiences/psychedelics its becomes easier to understand and interepret. There is no physical evidence, its all anecdotal but from my own personal experience Ive felt moments of transcendence beyond the physical as have many other people in this day and age. Stuff that correlates with what op said, we live in a dualistic universe, light vs darkness, good vs evil, nothingness vs something. Truly the proof can not be fed to you, you have to find it inside your self. Sorry if this is of no help, just wanted to shed some light on my perspective. I guess it could help you in a sense that you should start searching inside. If you really want a full blown mind fuck do DMT. I havent done it yet, but from what ive heard and can imagine thats a sure fire way to expose you to different realms of consciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, my comment wasn&#39;t very helpful and I&#39;m sorry about that. I have only recently come around to this sort of thinking in the past year and I&#39;ve only <em>just</em> started speaking out about it. I still have a lot to learn about communicating these ideas.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to help you. And believe me, I&#39;ve been the &quot;regular dude who believes in some kind of consciousness but ain&#39;t quite sure&quot; before. I was that person for the majority of my life so far. The change in me took several years. I wasn&#39;t trying to change my consciousness. I was just trying to live a joyful and fulfilling life. A few years ago my skepticism for this esoteric stuff started to soften, and I found myself more and more willing to entertain their notions. As time went on, I began to change. My awareness of everything deepend. At this point it gets very difficult to describe exactly what I experienced, because you just dont really <em>get</em> it until you&#39;ve experienced it. But thats kind of what I mean when I say no one can give you this truth. You can only know it by doing the internal work necessary to allow for the expansion of your consciousness. How your internal work gets done is up to you. This is where things like meditation, yoga and journaling come in handy, or any activity that helps you tune into your emotions or your body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their is innate understanding of conciousness that can only be reached through deep meditation and connection with yourself and the world that surrounds you.</p>

<p>Psychadellic Mushrooms have been known to safely kick-start these sorts of journeys. If you mind your set &amp; setting and enter with proper intent it&#39;s an experience that some need only once.</p>

<p>You will experience a deep connection form with all of existence and most especially other life forms. A sense of community and caring envelops not just you but the entire group that partakes on the journey together. I was presented with a lot of things my subconscious had been sealing off from my waking self and forced to address some deep rooted personal issues that had been holding me back without my knowledge.</p>

<p>IMO this is where bad trips set in. If you run from your issues the trip will go south. The key is to never fight it and always seek to be humble and learn.</p>

<p>These experiences aren&#39;t necessary to reach the state of awareness that OP is talking about but they CAN help exponentially. Especially with neurotic tendencies such as nail biting/smoking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t consider it &quot;proof&quot;, but if you look at ancient civilizations; there could be a claim made that there is some sort of &quot;collective consciousness&quot; that we no longer are privy to.</p>

<p>I&#39;m at work so I can&#39;t really link well, but look up the Egyptian pyramids, the &quot;Old Equator&quot;, and trip reports from people who take DMT or ayuhuasca (sp).

<p>Seek out this information and you&#39;ll understand the context better.  I&#39;m finding that almost everything in my life can be reevaluated with different context.   There&#39;s truth everywhere and we dismiss it in mockery.  </p>

<p>To the OP: have you looked into the sparkles?  Heightened consciousness humans are able to see them and apparently they are vacuum voids full of untapped energy that we can possibly unlock with emotions and positive intent alone.  The doubt and fluoride keep it all hidden right before our eyes. It ties in exactly with all of this information you have given and even if it seems hoaxy there are many accounts of people seeing them and thinking they have medical conditions with no metaphysical interpretation whatsoever.  They are also more common in children.  </p>

<p>I believe we will access our powers through this Ascension and now we know where to possibly keep an eye out.  Keep your eyes open for glints of light.  </p>

One bit of proof I can offer you is that many people are having near death experiences (die and dr brings them back) and they are being told on the other side the a mini evolution is under way and that things will improve drastically once people push hard enough so its totally in our hands. This entire process of fixing the world, which might be in its early stages, is what triggers the evolution. Once the evolution hits, things are going to get a lot prettier overall.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the new age cult trying to comandeer spirituality with borderline retarded thought processes that are so vague and unimportant that they could go until the end of time without making any intellectual progress. Its like a paradox where someone tries to pretend they are compassionate and understanding but they are either so stretched to their limits that their help is basically useless and/or they never really were interested in helping to begin with.</p>

<p>How can you honestly say that all the evil shit that happens on this planet alone is just the byproduct of a demented, schizophrenic, hive minded overlord who supposedly loves us but would without a doubt watch a person be gang raped and not even try to help. This is all ok though because the same &quot;Source Code&quot; that allows all this evil is actually just a misunderstood good guy who only wanted to kill and rape and allow you to be hurt because he loves you. How fucking stupid can you be? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to understand it or use logic with the asinine conclusions these people make because they are in no way prepared to face the evil of this world. These people might be able to change a flat tire but they sure a shit wouldn&#39;t know what to say about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict let alone how to resolve this issue peacefully. No most of these people don&#39;t want to fix anything, they just want to look like a good person thats &quot;deep&quot; and connected to some spiritual side on their facebook timeline. </p>

<p>Sure you can argue that these people are trying to be positive but even then it falls short of having real connection or weight to it. I for one disown these supposed beings and promote the execution of this source code or any wretch trying to keep this hellhole in operation. I believe everyone is their own infinitely powerful being and there are forces at work trying to opress us all. We are literally being scammed into obscurity.</p>

I think people do get sucked into the &quot;feel goods&quot; that this stuff can come with all wrapped in the right buzz words, but it&#39;s a seriously sinister origin and an even more sinister destination.</p>

<p>It is basically everything that WE oppose as truth seeking people at odds with the Elite world powers. This IS the religion of the elite and they are doing a subtle but fantastic job of selling it to the newly awakened masses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the information and thoughts. Appreciate it.</p>

<p>Personally, I tend to believe that things like Moloch and Baal do exist, but I&#39;m curious as to why you say Satan does not exist. For my own insight, what is this based on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan is classically portrayed as the polar opposite of God.</p>

<p>So you think of God, and Satan, the classic light and dark. This has been wrongly taught, and was a made up invention of the church (Satan, that is.)</p>

<p>No such thing as hell exists, and no such being named Satan rules over such a dominion where you perish forever in the pits of hell and fire. This is a made up fear mongering story made up by multiple religious bodies that sought to keep its members in fear and control. This doesn&#39;t mean all churches are bad, or religion is bad. I&#39;m merely saying that Satan is a made up figure.</p>

<p>Now Here&#39;s the distinction. </p>

<p>Baal and moloch do exist, but they are not Satan or reign over hell or any of that. They are merely NEGATIVELY aligned beings that prefer service to self over service to others. They have sunk to such a low density (1st and 2nd density) that they cannot operate on our third dimensional reality. But they can interfere from the outside and manipulate people&#39;s realities to suit their needs.</p>

<p>Think of a scientist with gloves on working outside of a box or something. He can&#39;t put his arms or body directly into that area but he can use other means to work in there.</p>

<p>This is a crude explanation and I feel I&#39;m not doing the best job explaining it. But think of moloch and Baal the opposite side of love and light. I hope I helped</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I totally get what you mean now. Satan and Hell as a construct of modern(ish) religion.</p>

<p>The density explanation of why Moloch (et alia) can&#39;t directly operate in physical reality is something I hadn&#39;t heard before. I had always assumed they were just operating in a &quot;different&quot; plane or dimension, but lower densities make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1st and 2nd density is mineral and plant/lower animal consciousness. These beings are not of those densities. The highest density one can reach while being of service to self orientation is 5th density(source, law of one by ra).</p>

Scientific? Let me read the pier reviewed scientific papers.
String theory is another failed interpretation of our reality.
You want to help? Try promoting empathy, logic and reason. All human. All at the reach of any human.
Trying to help promoting fanaticism in gnostic theories is quite a stretch. Accepted by which gurus, BTW?
Why not just say: join my god and he/she/it will help us evolve. It is exactly the same concept you are trying to promote.

    <div class="md"><p>Just so you know, telling people this is a terrible idea around these parts.  It&#39;s unhelpful, ignorant and rude but more importantly, it&#39;s been pointed out as a tactic shills have used to discredit conspiracy theorists and others with kooky ideas.  So on a forum about conspiracies full of people who have suffered this tactic in the past, you might actually be lending the OP credence by saying something like this, as ridiculous as that sounds.<br/>
Anyway, just my two cents on that to explain why regulars here are kneejerk downvoting you even if they too think OP is crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole Ascension/shift theory is interesting. It&#39;s been around for a long time. Even Isaac Newton predicted there would be some &quot;end of the world&quot; change thing happening in 2060, which is pretty close to now in the grand scheme of things.  Other sources that predict a shift soon: Researchers like David Wilcock, David Icke, Kerry Cassidy, ET contactees like Alex Collier, Tolec, Corey Goode, Simon Parkes. Channelers like Laura Knight-Jadczyk, Darryl Anka, Dolores Canon. The list goes on and on. Many of these sources are pretty hostile towards each other, but they all agree that there&#39;s some magical shift to a higher dimension of existence happening. This phenomena, true or not is rather interesting. Either it&#39;s happening or there is some conspiracy to make people think it&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>But personally, having followed this type of fringe information for many years, I&#39;ve grown quite jaded and cynical. They are constantly making predictions that don&#39;t come true. This shift was supposed to happen in the 80&#39;s according to old-schoolers like Edgar Cayce.... then it was supposed to be 1999, then 2012, the date is always getting pushed off. Given that, there&#39;s little reason to keep taking them seriously.</p>

<p>If there are ETs watching out for us and helping us, why is there not a shred of repeatable empirical evidence? Why don&#39;t they present themselves and communicate with us like adults, like equals? All the excuses like &quot;it would scare peepul&quot; are empty nonsense.</p>

<p>I appreciate the positive, hopeful sentiment, but the world doesn&#39;t need more empty fluff-bunny love-and-light drivel about invisible things are supposedly happening, when people have enough concrete mundane problems flooding our real reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The repetitive and unfulfilled predictions are a matter of concern. However, it could be an issue of scale. People keep saying it&#39;s just around the corner, but things may be proceeding in terms of centuries rather than decades. One should also take into account that negative forces may be derailing attempts at worldwide &quot;enlightenment&quot;.</p>

<p>Assuming there&#39;s something to Jesus&#39; teachings...he was saying that the Kingdom of God was coming within his generation&#39;s lifetime, yet some centuries after, the Western world was plunged into the Dark Ages. We&#39;ve only seen a rediscovery of classic philosophy and science in the last 200 years or so. Much before this, there are stories of Atlantis and an almost enlightened people. Look what happened to them.</p>

<p>Maybe as a species we&#39;ve always been getting close only to be thwarted. Maybe at this juncture we&#39;re the closest yet. Maybe we&#39;ll see it through this time around?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I&#39;m going to say is that multiple channeled messages from ET&#39;s have told us we are not totally ready as a whole to accept the appearance of ET&#39;s.</p>

<p>Think about how badly that would scare some people and completely shatter their world view.</p>

<p>You may think such a thing is asinine but truly think about it. Think about your average citizen and their world view and understanding of life. </p>

<p>Then out of no where they see an alien and it completely crashes and shatters their world view in seconds.</p>

<p>That would send people into psychosis.</p>

<p>This is why disclosure is a gradual thing otherwise there would be a mass temporary psychosis and that&#39;s the last thing they want or need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cabal/Antichrist. Ascended Masters/False Prophet. You&#39;re being lied to. You are not God. You are not Christ Consciousness. Moloch would not exist without Heylel and there would be no playbook without an end goal. New Jerusalem is the correct term for this new age, and when Jesus returns, this time it&#39;ll be personal. Do not be deceived. Jesus is the way, the truth, the life and NO MAN comes to the Father but through Him. Jesus is the light which defeats the darkness. The &quot;enlightened ones&quot; are the fallen angels who forgot their first estate. The cabal are the Nephilim offspring, hence the Illuminati bloodline. You can delete God from the argument because you find it divisive and you&#39;d rather not change your heart and mind to the true source, the true creator because Heylel promised &quot;ye shall be as Gods!&quot; We are in the Tribulation, and no one can deny that fact. Jesus will return at the last trump, on the Feast of Trumpets, what the new agers call the Event, and you will see what the truth actually is. Seek first the TRUTH -  not the watered down, palatable, god-less truth that is pleasing to your ears. Read the book of Enoch to truly know of the judgment to come!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, and I agree. We share similar view points :)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve really been getting into this stuff lately, it&#39;s pretty much the only thing that motivates me. Here are some recent reads and shows that have helped me reach these conclusions</p>

<ul>
<li><p>recently found a streaming service called Gaia, 10$ a month and has shows that cover all these topics. Amazing service</p></li>
<li><p>law of one by Ra</p></li>
<li><p>Theee Waves of volunteers by Dalores Cannon</p></li>
<li><p>Seth speaks by Jane Roberts</p></li>
<li><p>You can check out BASHAR videos on YouTube, he is channeled by Daryl. </p></li>
<li><p>journey of souls by Michael Newton, amazing perspectives and a quick read because I couldn&#39;t put it down</p></li>
<li><p>the shack</p></li>
<li><p>A good starting point I recommend everyone is conversations with God for sure.</p></li>
<li><p>Edgar cayce touches on a lot of good material </p></li>
<li><p>also a lot of information I&#39;ve found is just through browsing the Internet and typing random spiritual questions that pop in my mind into google.</p></li>
<li><p>other interesting subjects are numerology and astrology </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope This helps :)</p>

<p>It seems to me your theories and rhetoric align to the law of one. I am currently reading it and finding it extreeeeeemely interesting (to say the least). I was wondering, do you know if since some similar knowledge came about? I think the most recent interesting read relating to it that I read was that confession of an elite family insider from AboveTopSecret, but would you care to direct me to similar interesting information? The links you provided point to more specific events but I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s some newer law of one style readings out there.</p>

<p>Thanks and much love to you and everybody in the universe!</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t. This sub doesn&#39;t even account for 1% of the population. And for the 99%+ who aren&#39;t &#39;woken up&#39; they are too far gone to even be woken...

    <div class="md"><p>I read everything you wrote and I admit it still sounds crazy. But it all clicks. Archons and the soul net. If you haven&#39;t read about the soul net you should . When I started reading about the archons it made me fear something that I&#39;ve honestly thought about a lot in my life so deeply it&#39;s scary . The thought that we are in some horrible repetitive re incarnation loop that we have no control over.  And that no matter what anyone tries to do  we can&#39;t break free. I mean really ,if there are these highly advanced beings,what actual weapon do we have against them . We don&#39;t have telepathy,or magical powers. </p>

<p>Anyways . I have memories from before I came to earth . I thought I was just having false memories. Then I read other stories that were identical to my experiences. A lot of people remember things too . And I remember right before i was coming to earth my memories fading and remeber feeling like I was lied too. Betrayed . And swore to myself I&#39;d remember. And yet I do. Apperantly to the soul net /archon and kharma stuff,it says the wheel of incarnation will repeat until your lesson has been learned . But every time we die we get our memories erased ,forcing us to re incarnate infinitely. Apperantly we are ,oddly enough like the matrix movie showed&quot; energy&quot; sources for some group of beings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for replying. It is very scary at first and I remember when I was first researching it how lied and betrayed I felt but I feel there&#39;s some things that are misinterpreted </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if I buy into the stuck into reincarnation wheel of karma because I always thought that&#39;s just how reincarnation worked. I do believe archons/reptilians manipulated humans to get what they want but I&#39;ve been wondering if the whole stuck in reincarnation thing is really just how souls naturally work and people misinterpret that, because we are meant to evolve over life times.</p>

<p>Thanks for reaching out and remember, we don&#39;t need to be afraid, because honestly in the grand scheme of things the darkness/archons are VERY WEAK, which is why they have to feed off our negative energy. They are like leeches, and should not be feared. They control so little but want us to think they control this whole world when the opposite is true.</p>

<p>Archons are weak forms of energy and we can easily easily defeat them or not buy into their negative matrix.</p>

<p>Still a lot to learning I need to do but I hope in helping. Thanks man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it difficult to trust New Age ideology (self-consciousness agenda, the <em>we are gods individually and collectively thought pattern</em>, aliens as our savior, etc.) It sounds like a deception to separate us from the true creator know as Yahweh/Jehova (Hebrew God). This seems like luciferian thinking to me.  Luciferians believe in independence from God and in being self sufficient and in &#39;spiritual&#39; self discovery that promotes the idea that <strong>you/we</strong> are gods. From this perspective, the new age clearly seems evil.  </p>

It&#39;s unhelpful, ignorant and rude but more importantly, it&#39;s been pointed out as a tactic shills have used to discredit conspiracy theorists and others with kooky ideas.  So on a forum about conspiracies full of people who have suffered this tactic in the past, you might actually be lending the OP credence by saying something like this, as ridiculous as that sounds.<br/>
Anyway, just my two cents on that to explain why regulars here are kneejerk downvoting you even if they too think OP is crazy.</p>
