<blockquote>
<p>Christian evangelist Jack T. Chick claims that Baphomet is a demon worshipped by Freemasons, a claim that apparently originated with the Taxil hoax. Léo Taxil&#39;s elaborate hoax employed a version of Lévi&#39;s Baphomet on the cover of Les Mystères de la franc-maçonnerie dévoilés, his lurid paperback &quot;exposé&quot; of Freemasonry, which in 1897 he revealed as a hoax intended to ridicule the Catholic Church and its anti-Masonic propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More upvotes! Too bad this thread is being destroyed by r/politics...</p>

<p>The guys at voat are doing great work. They uncovered an old ABC article with this gem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Beirut, two Hezbollah double agents pretended to go to work for the CIA. Hezbollah then learned of the restaurant where multiple CIA officers were meeting with several agents, according to the four current and former officials briefed on the case. The CIA used the codeword &quot;PIZZA&quot; when discussing where to meet with the agents, according to U.S. officials. Two former officials describe the location as a Beirut Pizza Hut. A current US official denied that CIA officers met their agents at Pizza Hut.</p>

<p>From there, Hezbollah&#39;s internal security arm identified at least a dozen informants, and the identities of several CIA case officers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very intriguing stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know right! Yeah, the dude sounded sus to me, maybe a bit shilly, so I looked at his post history, saw the above linked comment saying how he voted for Clinton. So I called him &quot;Clinton voter&quot;, which sounds silly, but really what kind of Clinton voter hangs out here? If you voted for Clinton, you&#39;re likely not on board with anything we discuss here. </p>

<p>Then he shoots back saying he is definitely not a Clinton voter and asked me to go through his post history to confirm it. He also claimed that he even &quot;owned DCLeaks for one year&quot;.</p>

<p>where the hell do you get that idea from?  I worked in all sorts of restaurants for fifteen years, from a busboy at 15 to an executive chef at 30, and the owners always had plenty of cash.    Restaurants can be insanely lucrative if you run them correctly.</p>

<p>And a lot of successful business owners buy other properties and put them to work earning them money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A local, non-chain, niche  pizza shop owner is well connected. No problem with that. 
The problem is- how did/why is a local, non-chain, niche pizza shop owner got so connected to where money isn&#39;t an issue for him...ESPECIALLY when a number of his connections are our elected leaders, representing us? There&#39;s provide a good life for your family-rich, buy a luxury car-rich, have a nice home or 2-rich...but then there&#39;s having direct access to power-rich. How does a ping-pong pizza guy get all these types of rich, plus?
If ping pong &amp; pizza alone could get you that high up on the totem pole, everyone I knew in college would already be as &quot;successful&quot; as this joker (possibly even more successful, because there&#39;s a high probability they wouldn&#39;t have creepy erotic murals painted on the walls of their kid/family friendly ping pong &amp; pizza shop).    </p>

It was the hero Paris who shot an arrow into the heel of Achilles... is that a tip to translate his first/last name to French?  He makes the same reference in the name he gave his LLC that he used to buy Pegasus... &quot;Castellum Achilles&quot;.   Fort/watchtower/stronghold Achilles .... the &quot;safe place for his weakness&quot; perhaps?   This guy and his friends seem to be very fond of secret codes and double meanings, especially in relation to their hobby.

<p>If you had a million, you could buy a subway.  Even if it underperformed, after 5 yrs you&#39;d be able to buy another subway, even it it underperformed, you&#39;d be able to buy 2 more subways.  Etc.</p>

<p>The rich get richer.  </p>

<p>Money begets money.  No money begets no money.  The dividing line seems to be about a joint yearly income of 300k to be able to take risks.</p>

<p>Illegal Mexicans cohabitate several families in violation of mutifamily ordinances.  After pooling resources, they get a taco truck, then they get 2, then they have a restaurant, then they have 2.  Then they have a small cell of people in mixed immigration status.</p>

<p>This is why people are annoyed in america.  People break the rules and we let them.  </p>

<p>If white people do this, their own people (republicans, mostly) fight them.  &quot;Look at all those damn hippies in that one art loft.  Having sex with each other and doing drugs and selling art.  I&#39;m calling the zoning board!!&quot;</p>

<p>This is how stuff happens.  I&#39;ve seen it many times.  Try to start an intentional community and the moment it is successful, it becomes a &quot;cult&quot; and then gets busted up, infiltrated, etc.</p>

<p>Why should anyone provide access to citizen investigators?  People even turn Law Enforcement etc down if they don&#39;t have a warrant.</p>

<p>If there was anything i&#39;m sure it is long gone from all businesses and venues involved soon after they realised it was serious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know.  Maybe it isn&#39;t ready yet and it&#39;s just an investment like his numerous other properties around Washington DC.  I have followed Pizzagate since the beginning had numerous accounts on Voat always supported it but there are some things since Voat started clamping down that I have looked into and they have narrowed the hunt to not try to stop child sex trafficking but limited it to Alefantis and co.  That is wrong to do.  They don&#39;t care about the kids anymore just a hobbyist conformation bias witchhunt.</p>

<p>I have spent the last two months looking into pedos and I know the code words do not hold up, even looking on the chans where the original came from and the language pedos use on there is not the same.</p>

<p>Why would past middle age people know the pedo code? Then email about it.  I believe the other dodgy emails are much more incriminating like the farm and pool, the bring all children email and many more.  Map means minor attracted person, previously MAA Minor attracted Adult used in the pedo community, not semen.</p>

<p>Cheese Pizza we know means CP.  pizza on its own can just mean CP. the rest is also bullshit.  Code is what you want it to be.</p>

<p>I believe the best thing to do is demolish Washington by legal means and start again without all the freemason history, occult lay lines, street design, Obelisks etc.</p>

<p>Break free from the Bloodlines, Bilderburg Group, United Nations, European Union and start all over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it was 380k or thereabouts.  It looks like a decrepit piece of junk, so that gives you an idea of how expensive that area is.  It&#39;s basically a ghost dog shack, a pidgeon house on top of a roof (GTA reference).</p>

<p>Who knows what he wants it for.  Maybe it&#39;s not public because it&#39;s not finished.  After all, if it&#39;s a museum, then building pieces takes time.  Question is, zoning.  That area does not look zoned for commercial property; but maybe it&#39;s mixed use zoning.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s kind of none of our biz at this point.</p>

<p>We should stay focused on crimes we can prove, like Podesta and Clinton&#39;s and Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that Alephantis is very much part of this dealth cult mafia, but we can&#39;t prove it so time to backburner him and focus on the other stuff.  I&#39;m saying this as a person who <del>believes</del> <em>knows</em> that pizzagate is real and that podesta and clintons are very much involved in some capacity, and so is Obama.  This shit goes to the top.</p>

<p>Alephantis is a relatively little fish or maybe he&#39;s just a catfish hanging out in the muck, but he&#39;s not doing anything or going anywhere with the so called evidence we have</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Note:</p>

<p>Did some digging on Castellum Achilles LLC, and I may have stumbled over why a museum wouldn&#39;t advertise.</p>

<p>The LLC (Limited Liability Company, it&#39;s just a legal term like INC) owns a number of structures, in particular, one  located at 3518 11st NW, Washington DC, 20010.</p>

<p>There are four matters of public record for this structure, that involve demolition of a number of interior elements (non load bearing walls), replacement of an interior staircase, and replacement of balcony railings.</p>

<p>Pulling up more details shows that this is an apartment complex/house of some description. (Old from what photos I&#39;ve found.)</p>

<p>The permits were first issued in 2015, but as of 6/3/2016, the work had not been completed and was still ongoing.</p>

<p>Looking up  Castellum, I find it to be a property management company.  Those are typically tasked with the administration of rental, industrial, and commercial properties.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ll then be able to see every packet of information sent from any device connected to the wifi.</p>

<p>If the muesum has wifi, you can rename the Rouge AP the same name and it will trick devices into thinking it is the real museum wifi. Bam! You can see every search and every password and username due to SSL strip.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t anything to this as everone in your link has pointed out.  It&#39;s based on the instagram of the owner who posted photos of both his crazy gay lifestyle and also photos of his daily social life including photos of his god daughter and his friends/employees kids. It&#39;s fear and persecution of a rich sexually liberated gay man who likes modern art. All of this &#39;evidence&#39; requires assumption of guilt to be incriminating.</p>

<p>The only link I&#39;ve found to cp while reading this stuff is his connection to the podestas through the owners relationship with david brock(which ended so badly in 2008 there was a lawsuit involved) and his donations to the Clintons.</p>

<p>Podesta left a black and white napkin with a &#39;pizza themed map&#39; on it in a rental property and the snoops on 4chan decided that was code. They found a color code used by gay men in the 70s, Black refers to BDSM and White refers to mutual masturbation. That didn&#39;t fit the narrative so they photoshopped the entry for white to make it say it refers to pedophilia instead. Even though it took 2 minutes of googling to debunk the code at the base of all of this it is still presented as proof to this day.</p>

<p>At best I think they found a code that points to Podesta arranging a gay hook up but considering how pointless speculating on email has been thus far even that is a stretch. </p>

The fact that he&#39;s influential in the DC modern art scene?  The fact that he owns a restaurant that&#39;s family friendly during the day and a performance space/bar at night? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been following this shit show since way before the shooter and you haven&#39;t found anything even circumstantial. The only circumstance in which any of it is at all incriminating is guilt of the accused and in this country that isn&#39;t how it works. Meanwhile pizzagaters are doxxing and threatening all of his employees, friends and family members.  This is the definition of a mob mentality and they don&#39;t want the truth they want vengeance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a lot of indirect links to pedophilia. The sign on Besta Pizza is a good match for the pedo symbol from the FBI document. The one for Terasol across the street also looks alike.</p>

<p>The artist Majestic Ape jokes with the audience about sex with boys, during a performance at Comet Pizza. Majestic Ape has videoclips showing Sai Baba, someone suspected of child abuse. They also have a website called &quot;Baba&#39;s Mountain&quot; where they urge kids to run away from home to Baba&#39;s Mountain. Alefantis has defended his artists and has not distanced himself from Majestic Ape.</p>

<p>Alefantis&#39; Instagram profile pic is a symbol for gay people but also for pedo&#39;s, since the statue in the picture depicts someone who was in a relationship with an older emperor at the age of 13.</p>

<p>Alefantis&#39; Instagram account is weird and has references to sex mixed in with pictures of children.</p>

<p>Alefantis&#39; restaurant next door, Bucks Fishing and Camping, might be a reference to a pedo documentary called &quot;Chickenhawk&quot;. In the documentary the pedo&#39;s are referred to as &quot;bucks&quot; and they talk about going fishing and camping with the children to have sex with them.</p>

<p>Alefantis is good friends with Tony Podesta, who has pictures of naked teenagers in one of his bedrooms and other paintings of children which are not that bad in themselves, but they belong to a wider range of pictures which depict child abuse.</p>

<p>So no smoking guns, but yes there definitely is circumstantial evidence. I would not let my kids go to Comet Pizza.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only lurked on voat but god can they make some crazy leaps of speculation. The thing is i&#39;m in DC and socially 2 degrees removed from JA to the point we&#39;d probably say hello to each other on the street. All of my friends that i know him through have been named, doxxed and &#39;investigated&#39; (read harassed and threatened) by these people. I keep reading these posts expecting my name to be singled out at any time. If I had joined instagram 4 years ago as they invited me to I definitely would have been by now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering how much money they have - they <em>could</em> afford a proper wifi implementation that will negate and drop any rogue APs online....</p>

<p>Considering their historic security stance, this might be the right vector to attempt.</p>

<p>The thing is, that if they do find the AP - and it captures nothing/goes offline - that will at least tell us that they are adjusting their security stance to reduce their surface area...</p>

<p>Does Stratfor offer security services? It would be interesting to find out if they have contacted/contracted any service companies that actually can lock their shit down. </p>

<p>I imagine they are fucking scrambling over all this.</p>

<p>What happened to the guy/firm that was responsible for the HRC email servers?</p>

<p>Further, we should petition for the FOIA to apply to private corporations.</p>

<p>John Podesta was using gmail -- we should be able to FOIA Google for information from Podesta&#39;s email - or anyone who works for the USG/Lobbiests etc.</p>

<p>The fucked up thing, is that the government claims that we have no reasonable expectation of privacy in a plethora of matters - yet why is it that they can claim that all the USG has complete expectation of privacy?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re affiliated/servicing/employed by the USG, and you use a <em>PUBLIC</em> company&#39;s services, then you have the same &quot;no reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; for the emails/services that you use to conduct government business on the ostensible behalf of the taxpayers - then you should be subject to FOIA</p>

<p>Who said there are tunnels?</p>

<p>The original &quot;kill room&quot; notion was based on comments of a different place - a metal room with a row of fans at the top of the right. This structure has nothing to do with that. </p>

<p>Pretty sure they show it in photos being constructed. Did you watch the original video?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Alefantis&quot; says the trenches are for plumbing. You can see plastic PVC pipes in the trench.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t he allow pizzagaters to tour the building? He allowed them to tour his restaurant and even gave them coffee? Why the total 180, with death threats.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the spray paint arrows that say &quot;kids&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It says kids 4 6 (sex).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you take the speculation about pedocrimes out, what is that he&#39;s being accused/harassed for? Being gay and having a gay friends? Supporting art? Remodeling?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you trying to make this about homophobia you bigoteer? Nice why to try to trick homosexuals into defending a potential pedophile human trafficker making death threats.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve never said &quot;If you touch my food I&#39;ll kill your girlfriend and your mom&quot;</p>
