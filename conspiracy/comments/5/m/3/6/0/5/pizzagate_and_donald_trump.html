       Interesting double standard in this Sub. I'm sorry but there is no smoking gun on Pizzagate. There are a lot of things that point towards it being true, and it probably is, but there's no proof for now.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Identical situation:
       </em>
       Trump - Wikileaks - Russia connection, you think it's a coincidence that Wikileaks released nothing on trump the whole election cycle? There is a lot of things pointing towards there being a connection there, And your counter-argument is, "Where's the smoking gun?".
      </p>
      <p>
       Same exact situation with Hillary being involved in Pizzagate, she probably is involved but no one is crying "where's the smoking gun". It's very obvious that this sub and it's most active members are defending Trump. Why? What is your agenda?

       That's like saying Pizzagate isn't real because Snopes debunked it, part of the conspiracy is that Snopes is in bed with the establishment. This is the conspiracy theory logic that is constantly used here, but I just don't see it being used on Trump and wikileaks

       Terrible metaphor. JA said it himself, not a third party... But you're right, we don't know. More evidence on the side that he is not in bed with Trump and the Russians, than they are in bed. So, that's kind of on you to develop evidence claiming otherwise.

       Well my original point was that this sub seems to not even try to develop that evidence, I don't even see any shitty half-assed attempts. Meanwhile the sub makes at least 100 horrible attempts per day at trying to connect the dots on pizza gate. That makes me think the sub is shifting to the right but maybe it's because the MSM is making all the shitty attempts from the left

       ) thread about r/conspiracy becoming very right wing and all I got were defenses of Trump and mentions of Pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I looked into Pizzagate and found it about as convincing as the Trump-Russia connection. Which further proved my point. We challenge the liberal agenda (as we should) but don't challenge the conservative agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not denying my agenda. This is the sub that gave me the critical thinking skills to actually take Marx seriously. Having a marxist lens makes the rightward slant of this sub very easy to see.

       I would have more respect for your stad if you took a few hours to research the evidence, and consider the surrounding cases before you pass judgement and declare a Capitalist propaganda campaign on favor of Trump. Frankly the approach you've taken is rediculous and a little insulting to someone who's been following this since October.

And on top of that, you have not provided a smoking gun either. You can put this to bed if you want, maybe I missed something.

       No one gave Wikileaks any intel on Trump. Wikileaks doesn't do the hacking inasmuch as they rely on people to dragnet for them and come forward with intel. That's why they periodically ask people to come forward with info on twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump is good at swindling and moving around money to dodge his taxes and avoid paying his employees, he's probably pretty good at covering his tracks in general. Probably doesn't make his password "p@ssw0rd," so he's harder to "hack."
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't really see the whole "pro Trump r/conspiracy" hubbabaloo users keep posting about here. There are pro Trump articles and there are anti-Trump articles. I think the general consensus here is, Fuck the global elites. Trump runs in circles of elites, so sometimes he comes off as establishment, but he also goes against the GOP and DNC grain, making him come off more "anti-establishment." But believing that r/conspiracy is like r/the_donald is naive and untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the "evidence" pointing to a Russian connection is entirely hyperbolic and anecdotal, and choosing to not believe it doesn't mean people inherently support Trump, or take everything Wikileaks says at face value. It just seems the most sensible conclusion. Maybe it will change Friday, but...

       Pizza gate is anecdotal, 100%, and I agree there is no smoking gun, but unlike the "Wikileaks Russia Trump" connection, there are people doing "investigating" (if you can even call a lot of it that, since it's clear some people are just outright lying and spreading disinformation) and compiling the argument for their narrative. Subjective and speculative, yes, but still based on a certain logic; like "given this Person A's Relationship with Person B at Location C" yadda yadda.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there has been no subjective or speculative investigation into the Wikileaks/Russia/Trump connection. Like I would gladly watch an hour long YouTube video of someone wildly connecting all these dots, but there aren't any dots out there. The government and media have their words and promises, and that's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm waiting on all the smoking guns, but the problem with really well orchestrated conspiracies is sometimes there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       no smoking guns, just dots to connect and blanks to fill in.

       I think you are right.  It is fuck the global elites.  If Trump is useful for this, then so be it.  Hillary, like Obama, is a lap dog for the global elites.  If Hillary would have won the election, then nothing would have changed for us.

        No one gave Wikileaks any intel on Trump. Wikileaks doesn't do the hacking inasmuch as they rely on people to dragnet for them and come forward with intel. That's why they periodically ask people to come forward with info on twitter.

      <p>
       You don't know that no one gave Wikileaks any intel on Trump. The conspiracy being proposed is that they are in bed together so why would wikileaks publish it?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's like saying Pizzagate isn't real because Snopes debunked it, part of the conspiracy is that Snopes is in bed with the establishment. This is the conspiracy theory logic that is constantly used here, but I just don't see it being used on Trump

       People don't understand Trump. He's like one of those multidimensional shapes that doesn't seem to fit into our 3D world. Every time we think we get a handle on him he's somewhere else, refuting the conclusive view we just came to have of him. Probably why he went through 3 wives and why his children have obvious mental health issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       My whole point is, I weigh the facts and evidence. Maybe when Uncle Sam has their intelligence briefing on Friday, there will be some bombshells, and we can start turning over new stones. As it exists now though, there is no evidence to believe Wikileaks/Trump/Putin are in bed together, and there is no smoking gun on Wikileaks. We can speculate, but as my Uncle used to always say "if the queen had balls, she'd be the king." "What ifs" without any substantiation don't really help serve anyone's greater mental awareness, and can often spread more fear and anger than they can actually solve anything.

       99% of the posts on the sub are speculation. That's the point of this sub. Pizzagate is speculation, Trump/wikileaks/russia is speculation. Maybe this sub just does whatever the MSM isn't doing, so it appears to be unfairly rightward leaning. Who knows. I just hope the we fry Trump when it's time

       I think you're going to end up disappointed. Trump will be a lot of things, but "fried" likely won't be one of the. He's styling himself after some of the great names in history and he's about to kick off the 9th crusade and take some land back for Israel.

       When Wikileaks has something on Trump, they will release it.  They are very agnostic in this respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Wikileaks withheld some Russian documents a while back.  That is the only time I can recall there being an issue.  I assume, if true, that it is because Assange may need to flee to Russia some day.  It is very prudent of him to not burn that bridge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding Wikileaks and Trump, Assange had no way of knowing that Hillary would lose the election.  I thought she would lose if the election was fair, but I thought she would win because it was rigged.  I think it WAS rigged, and Trump should have won by a much large amount.  I predicted Hillary would win, though, and was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am hoping more information about Pizzagate will come out once Trump is in office.  The House Committee still has a subpoena to the FBI for more information regarding the Hillary emails, and 27 emails were withheld by the FBI in violation of the subpoena.  There are the contents of Weiner's computer that still need to be made public.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you probably know, Weiner, Jeffrey Epstein, and Bill Clinton are all buddy-buddy, and they all prefer, shall we say, females on the younger side of the spectrum.  I hear that Trump does, too, so he might help cover all of this up so he is also not implicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going after Hillary and her ilk does not necessarily mean we like Trump.  I support Bernie, but Trump is very useful to keep Hillary out of public office.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hope that Trump causes the US government to implode, either intentionally or through shear incompetence.  It does not matter to me.  Either way, it is not worth saving because it is not in place to serve the American people.

       The entire media establishment was against Trump after the Republican primaries were over.  That is when I sided with him.

       This historical pattern of pedophilia being ignored in high places, Catholic Church, Boystown Nebraska, Penn State, Jeff Gannon, Jimmy Savile, and Dennis Hastert, has me open to the idea of Pizzagate being real according to the plentiful circumstantial evidence made available so far.
