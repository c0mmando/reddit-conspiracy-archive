    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve remained skeptical on the pizza gate stuff, but the fact he owns that Pegasus museum, the blue house right on the other side of the alley from it, and the kids graffiti out front?? I&#39;m very impressed by the citizen investigating going on. If this actually does lead to something, every person out there who&#39;s been looking into leads is honestly going to be a hero. The question is whether or not a proper criminal investigation can occur before everything relating to this stuff is scrubbed. I assume all those involved are doing everything they can to destroy evidence right now. </p>

I was thinking when I initially read the previous user&#39;s &quot;try using drones to surveil&quot; comment that it seems it might need to be a special kind of drone that could fly high up and out of sight <em>and</em> have a good enough camera to capture footage from that distance AND not make a lot of noise.</p>

<p>Yeah but the latest most real death threat is allegedly from James Alefantis <em>himself</em>.  That action is extremely unbecoming of someone who supposedly has nothing to hide, so I feel that the investigating should definitely continue moving forward.</p>

<p>Fair enough.  Don’t move forward toward what you feel you shouldn’t moving toward.  I can respect that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Legal professionals I&#39;ve encountered beg to differ.  There are literally 1000s of pieces of suspicious or damning circumstantial evidence in this case.</p>

<p>Pointing the finger at the two or three you personally don&#39;t find compelling doesn&#39;t mean a whole lot therefore.  And may be a little bit shilly too.</p>

<p>The larger problem I see is that the officials entrusted to investigate and prosecute this type of thing are themselves so compromised by it that it will take an act of God to get it to court.</p>

<p>NOT a lack of evidence once there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Zillow the blue house was bought (presumably by Alefantis) on July 25, 2014 for $263,636 however the Zestimate (Zillow&#39;s estimated market value) is $700,000. Having lived in DC from 2010-2013, I know for a fact that real estate in this neighborhood (Columbia Heights) which is up-and-coming and was being developed when I lived there would never go for such a low amount. Who did he buy this house from, and what kinda strings did he pull to get this property so insanely cheap? Even in this condition, this house would never sell below $500,000, twice the value he paid for it ....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I stated in my post, I lived in DC and was very familiar with the home prices in this particular area (Columbia Heights), so I have no reason to believe that Zillow is wrong on their price. Even broken down row houses like this were going for far more than the mid $200,000, that isn&#39;t heard of in this area. But to provide more proof than my anecdotes, I went back through some of the sale prices on houses on that block, public records listed on Zillow and here is what I found: the median sale price for homes in Columbia Heights in 2014 was $524,000, from the Zillow records DC home prices were steadily on the incline after the 2011 slump and even then median home sales in 2011 in Columbia Heights were $399,000; 3516 11th St NW (not to be confused with Pegasus Museum, but the building in front of it) 3 bed 2 bath sold in 2004 for $332,000, $90K more than Alefantis house 10 years before; next there is 3524 11th St NW, this has 4 beds 4 baths, so larger than the Alefantis 3 bed 1 bath, and it sold for $595,000 in 2012, more than double what Alefantis paid 2 years later for his slightly smaller home; 3561 11th St NW (across the street same block) 4 bed 4 bath sold for $280,000 back in 2000, 14 years before Alefantis bought his house. These were all the public sale records I could find on Zillow for homes in this block. Anyone with a minimal background in real estate prices in DC knows that $280,000 for a 3 bed 1 bath in a very sought after and up and coming community in DC, is startlingly low, even if the house needed a full gut job. 2 blocks away on 14th Street is a massive shopping area and recently developed luxury homes (circa 2012-2013), significantly increasing the home prices in that area around 2014. Also, I did not make any accusations, I asked questions. Who did he buy this home from and why was it so cheap?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This appears to be a mistake.</p>

<p>The property in front is 3518 11TH STREET NW (<a href="https://www.taxpayerservicecenter.com/RP_Detail.jsp?ssl=2833%20%20%20%200099">Square 2833 Lot 99</a>). It is not owned by Alefantis.</p>

<p>The property in the rear is  is 3518 11TH ST R NW (<a href="https://www.taxpayerservicecenter.com/RP_Detail.jsp?ssl=2833%20%20%20%200817">Square 2833 Lot 817</a>). This is owned by Alefantis.</p>

<p>If you <a href="https://eservices.dcra.dc.gov/OCPI/PermitApp.aspx">apply online for a building permit</a> and enter &quot;3518 11TH ST R NW&quot; in the 
&quot;Address of Proposed Work&quot; field, then on the next screen it says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3518 11TH STREET NW<br/>
SSL: 2833 0099</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t understand the distinction between &quot;3518 11TH STREET NW&quot; and &quot;3518 11TH ST R NW&quot;.</p>

<p>The same thing is probably true of Zillow.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more information at the <a href="https://countyfusion4.propertyinfo.com/countyweb/login.do?countyname=WashingtonDC">Recorder of Deeds web site</a>, although you have to register. The owners of the house in front have lived there since 2005 and there were no transactions recorded in 2014. In August 2015, they refinanced the house, so they were still there.</p>

<p>Who knows if the trees were placed there to conceal activities, but I have never met someone who planted trees in such a manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to put a dampener on this, but the room in which the workmen are building a trench <strong>appears</strong> to be quite a lot larger than the garage at Pegasus Museum. </p>

<p>You can make a comparison at 8.50 in the OP&#39;s video. If you look at the far wall with the ping pong table, you can see there is room for two more ping pong tables, and room to spare, between the door and side wall. Whereas if you look at the garage view from outside, three ping pong tables wouldn&#39;t fit in the equivalent space. </p>

<p>This is just eye-reckoning, of course, and I&#39;m happy to be proved wrong on that if somebody makes a more forensic analysis of the two wall lengths.</p>

<p>Also, I am not sure how the height of the other room through the &quot;secret&quot; door can be at the same level, when the streetview shows there are steps to other entrance?</p>

It&#39;s a bit tricky to see but it definitely looks like the same pattern. You can also see a garage door rail hanging down from the ceiling on the interior picture at the same spot where it would be according to the exterior picture.</p>

<p>in a &quot;watchtower&quot; type structure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The name of the LLC is Castellum Achilles LLC.</p>

<p>A castellum is a Roman watchtower.</p>

<p>Achilles could represent a lot of things, but there is this bit in Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles.[39] Virgil refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men,[40] while Horace portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.[41] Other writers, such as Catullus, Propertius, and Ovid, represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles&#39; erotic career.</p>

<p>The mainstream media is pushing a false narrative of Russian hacking, North Korean hacking, etc with absolutely no hard evidence given to the American people.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s plenty of evidence of Russian hacking. Here&#39;s a comment I&#39;ve saved on the matter. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The forensic evidence that links network breaches to known groups is solid: used and reused tools, methods, infrastructure, even unique encryption keys. For example: in late March the attackers registered a domain with a typo—misdepatrment[.]com—to look suspiciously like the company hired by the DNC to manage its network, MIS Department. They then linked this deceptive domain to a long-known APT 28 so-called X-Tunnel command-and-control IP address, 45.32.129[.]185.</p>

<p>One of the strongest pieces of evidence linking GRU to the DNC hack is the equivalent of identical fingerprints found in two burglarized buildings: a reused command-and-control address—176.31.112[.]10—that was hard coded in a piece of malware found both in the German parliament as well as on the DNC’s servers.</p>

<p>Russian military intelligence was identified by the German domestic security agency BfV as the actor responsible for the Bundestag breach. The infrastructure behind the fake MIS Department domain was also linked to the Berlin intrusion through at least one other element, a shared SSL certificate.&quot; (
<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-signs-point-to-russia-being-behind-the-dnc-hack">http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-signs-point-to-russia-being-behind-the-dnc-hack</a>
)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evidence that state-directed Russian hacking is responsible for the DNC breach is, in other words, more than circumstantial.</p>

<p>An important part of the hack was a so-called &#39;spear-phishing&#39; campaign that attempted to emulate legitimate websites to pilfer credentials and even maintain a persistent connection to a secure session:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim&#39;s full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim&#39;s account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access.&quot;</p>

<p>The forensic evidence left by the hacks (C&amp;C IP addresses, spoofed certificates, encryption codes) point to Russian sources due to similarities between these intrusions and previous ones in Germany, Georgia, Latvia and other confirmed breaches.</p>

<p>Again, <em>this has been out since July,</em> including evidence that &quot;Guccifer 2.0&quot; is a smokescreen persona:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;ThreatConnect is the first to identify and detail analysis of Guccifer 2.0’s operational infrastructure. In our original hypothesis, we suspected Guccifer 2.0 might be leveraging French infrastructure to communicate with the global media, and we have validated this finding with the help of the media. As more details continue to surface surrounding Guccifer 2.0, we continue to identify heavy traces of Russian activity, from the specific Russian-based VPN service provider, domain registrants, and registrars as well as various discrete events that have circumstantial marks of Russian origins.</p>

<p>As we pointed out in our previous analysis, we conclude Guccifer 2.0 is an apparition created under a hasty Russian D&amp;D campaign, which has clearly evolved into an Active Measures Campaign. Those who are operating under the Guccifer 2.0 Twitter, WordPress and Email communications are likely made up a cadre of non-technical politruk attempting to establish “Guccifer 2.0” as a static fixture on the world stage along the likes of Manning, Assange or Snowden. Their use of Russian VPN services with French infrastructure may shed light on a method Russian intelligence operatives use — domestic services coupled with foreign infrastructure — to help hide their hand and deter any potential attribution to Russia.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-all-roads-lead-russia/">https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-all-roads-lead-russia/</a></p>

<p>There is plenty of forensic evidence to parse through. Yes, sure, it&#39;s <em>possible</em> that DNC networks were compromised by APT28 / APT29 (Cozy Bear and Lazy Bear) <em>and</em> that the leak did originate from another, third (possibly internal?) source. </p>

<p>After all, it&#39;s a very bold and risky play to deliberately use cyberwarfare capabilities to leak internal documents in lieu of traditional espionage: it compromises quiet ongoing surveillance in favor of a ploy that may or may not work, and could even spectacularly backfire. But it&#39;s also compatible with an emboldened Russian foreign policy. </p>

<p>And certainly it&#39;s also possible that the leak had far more wide-ranging influences that anyone intended, and all the players are caught off guard here and just improvising. (In fact that&#39;s more likely: only in movies does the villain &#39;foresee&#39; events 12 steps in advance).</p>

<p>And the evidence is more than circumstantial. Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear left significant fingerprints over the crime scene, from the command and control IP addresses, to the specific code and exploits used, to the Cyrillic settings on leaked documents; again, read the third-party security analyses for yourself. We don&#39;t have to just take someone&#39;s word for it, even though the American intelligence community is unanimous in its assessment here.</p>

<p>So: there is evidence; it&#39;s <em>not</em> a slam dunk, but pretty close; and there are many unanswered questions still.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>

<p>I&#39;m just a normal dude with a kid and a messy house and I don&#39;t have time to answer everyone. There are thoughtful comments downthread that discuss the limits of this evidence, such as it is, and other comments that are less useful. I acknowledge that the forensics are compatible with a lot of possibilities (including a massive conspiracy to start a war!), but some of these possibilities seem very remote to me. Follow the links, read what&#39;s there, and make up your own minds. </p>

<p>I just wanted to say: there <em>is</em> evidence, not <em>no</em> evidence as some were saying. It is in the nature of evidence that it does not form a deductive logical proof. So it goes. You don&#39;t have to just &#39;take someone&#39;s word for it,&#39; even if that someone is the PoTUS and 17 intelligence agencies...</p>

<p>I mean, look, how likely is it really that we&#39;re off to war with Russia when, in 30-odd days, Rex Tillerson will be Secretary of State? You know, the guy who supports removing sanctions from Russia over Crimea and has the Russian Order of Friendship medal? This is not a pretext for WWIII. If you watched Obama&#39;s press conference he talked multilateral frameworks to curb cyberwarfare between states, not thermonuclear armageddon. Y&#39;all need to calm down.</p>

<p><strong>2nd Edit</strong>: I&#39;ve been pointed to this write-up: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ijhug/we_need_an_independent_public_investigation_of/db8yhon/">https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ijhug/we_need_an_independent_public_investigation_of/db8yhon/</a></p>

<p>And let me tell you:  That has exactly <em>nothing</em> to do with how easy this case would likely be to prosecute.  It has to do with the fact that whatever attorney takes this case on better make sure they try this case w/a bullet proof vest on and they <em>don’t</em> have any family members - because murder would be about the <em>first</em> course on the menu for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry but it&#39;s not like we&#39;re talking multi-million dollar properties here, the highest price building so far he&#39;d paid less than $200k for. I think you people have it backwards, its not that he makes money from pizza, it&#39;s that he was likely born into money or came across it early in life, maybe due to real estate even, and then what do people generally do when they have a bunch of money? they follow their passion, they find something fun to do, generally. my ex used to always say that after he&#39;d made a certain amount of money he was going to quit his career and become a pizza delivery dude. I&#39;m sure that there must be others out there who think similarly.</p>

<p>The conspiracy would claim he is prostituting children and blackmailing politicians. While the conventional narrative would claim he is a socialite, and that the fundraisers he holds for politicians are so essential that he can trade fundraisers for favours.</p>

<p>In either case, Alefontis is more than just some pizza dude. He is a major DC power player, and in my opinion, the conventional narrative would not account for his power. </p>

<p>Not really sure what you are getting at? I&#39;ve never been called more powerful than the majority of senators and congressmen, even if by a fashion writer. Alefontis is clearly a wealthy and powerful figure. He may not be in the top 50, but he is a major DC power player. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was actually curious so I did the same again.  Simple youtube search &quot;pizzagate&quot;  Now, the #1 by view count is the Stephen Colbert piece in which he states several things that aren&#39;t true and misleads people.  </p>

<p>The second is a non english video, which was the #1 result when I did the same search previously.    </p>

<p>Number 3 is SNL with 1,000,000 views and then everything else is 500k or less.  </p>

I guess this video is for the advanced users because I couldn&#39;t make heads or tails out of it besides it might be the place of the instagram pics.

<p>This is comparing the outside view to the inside so that we can confirm where these pictures were taken, and where the construction happened.</p>

<p>Also... have you ever seen a lock up this high above the doorhandle before?</p>

<p>Yes. You see that regularly on older buildings. For whatever reason, a lot of old deadbolts were installed closer to eye-level.</p>

<p>That baffled me for a moment. I think the gators are thinking that the deadbolt has been raised to be out of the reach of a child. &#39;cause obviously the only thing keeping them trapped in that basement is a lock placed at cookie-jar height.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;We still don&#39;t know the purpose of the construction or trenching?&quot;</p>

<p>Ummmm. The trenching is for plumbing. Shocking I know that an old building undergoing renovations would need plumbing moved and/or replaced. The &quot;killroom&quot; is a fucking walk-in fridge. Shocking that one would need one in a restaurant. I don&#39;t know how the &quot;killroom&quot; fridge really relates to OPs video. I&#39;d assume it was located in CPP.Nit sure what line of reasoning is now placing it at the Pegasus Museum. It&#39;s entirely possible that the ground floor of the Pegasus museum (assuming the wall-in is located there) is a commissary kitchen for the various restaurants Alefantis owns. </p>

<p>While there was definitely some weird shit/comments on his IG feed, people say weird and stupid shit on the internet all the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright. So, I&#39;m genuinely interested in this story and open to it being true. I&#39;m not here to call people stupid. But so far I simply cannot see how any of this adds up. I&#39;ll try to list my problems with it here and anyone can provide me info that contradicts my points. I would love to see a full accounting of the evidence so far.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The coded language stuff just seems absurd to me. The much more likely explanation is that they are referring to pizza.  </p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;naked pictures of children&quot; in Podesta&#39;s house thing is also absurd to draw conclusions from. As someone who knows lots of rich people who like weird art, I can tell you this is not that unusual.  </p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot; thing is just completely insane. Abramovic is a performance artist. She does weird things. I know lots of them--probably some of you do too.  </p></li>
<li><p>If I knew someone who had a creepy basement and they posted it on Instagram, I and my friends would very likely tag things like &quot;murder room,&quot; etc. as a joke.  </p></li>
<li><p>Do you really think an international child prostitution ring led by politicians would have &quot;kids 616&quot; tagged outside their dungeon?  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>OK, those are just a few points. My question is this: is this really all there is to this and the thread that brings it all together is simply that all of these things together are too coincidental NOT to add up to a CP ring? </p>

<p>See, at first I thought maybe there&#39;s something there with the pizza gate thing. But all of these posts filled with absolutely no substance lead me to believe there is nothing. Unless that&#39;s the plan, fill forums with bs to turn people off the real trail, because most of this stuff is not good research or evidence or anything of the sort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Legal professionals I&#39;ve encountered beg to differ.  There are literally 1000s of pieces of suspicious or damning circumstantial evidence in this case.</p>

<p>Pointing the finger at the two or three you personally don&#39;t find compelling doesn&#39;t mean a whole lot therefore.  And may be a little bit shilly too.</p>

<p>The larger problem I see is that the officials entrusted to investigate and prosecute this type of thing are themselves so compromised by it that it will take an act of God to get it to court.</p>

<p>NOT a lack of evidence once there.</p>
