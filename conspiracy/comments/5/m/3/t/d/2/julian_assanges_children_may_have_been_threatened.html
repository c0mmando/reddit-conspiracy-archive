        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last night, the FoxNews Network, an American TV network, aired an interview between Sean Hannity and Wikileaks editor and founder Julian Assange. It was an interesting video that, for many, confirmed that Assange is, at least, likely alive and well. But there was something interesting near the end of the interview. It&#39;s something that may give us a tip as to why Assange has been quiet since 4, October until recently.</p>

<p>In the interview, Assange said that he had &#39;signed up&#39; for the consequences he was facing and that he knew what could happen when he decided to go against powerful organisations and individuals. But his children and family, he said, did not and shouldn&#39;t have to deal with those consequences. He said it twice and his voice caught on the second stating of it.</p>

<p>I believe that this was Assange telling us exactly why he&#39;s been silent: his family, specifically his under 10 years old children, have been threatened. This is the level the bastards we fight against are willing to stoop to just to hide the truth from us and silence their critics. It makes me hate them even more and commit even more strongly to their eventual destruction.</p>

<p>Not really sharing any new information I&#39;m sure. But I found it interesting and I&#39;m mostly just venting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Went back and re-watched. His answer about Woodward and Bernstein is truncated to what sounds like he was mid thought. There&#39;s a hard cut and then this:</p>

<pre><code>I&#39;ve been detained, illegally, without charge, for six years. In prison, under house arrest, four and a half years in this embassy, without sunlight, lots of spies everywhere, ect. It&#39;s tough, it&#39;s tough but that&#39;s the mission I set myself on. So I&#39;m willing to accept that. I understand the kind of game that&#39;s being played, big powerful actors, they try and take revenge, okay. It&#39;s a different thing for my family. I have young children, under 10 years old. They didn&#39;t sign up for that, okay? I&#39;m the type of father that they have. But they didn&#39;t sign up for that, and that&#39;s not something I like and I think that is a fundamentally unjust outcome for my children. It&#39;s not a good precedent for other people to have as well, but that would be my one concern. I know what I&#39;m doing, I&#39;m prepared to weigh the consequences of the conflict and dealing with powerful groups and individuals. But my family is innocent in that equation. They didn&#39;t sign up for that fight.
</code></pre>

<p>I believe he feels immense grief about the situation his family is in. Knowing the types of people he&#39;s up against, it&#39;s not unfair to believe at all that he has had it impressed upon him that they are at risk. That fact may even be at play in his decision making now as a matter of coercion, which would explain why he is alive but still not signing anything with his encryption key. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing about this. They can capture and do whatever they want to his children, but that will be publicized. What civilian individual or group has it out for julian? I can&#39;t think of a single one. This leaves governments. If something, anything happens to his children governments immediately become implicated. Assange could become radicalized by this and decide to dump shit he&#39;s been holding. Maybe he has dossiers of international spies, maybe he has evidence 911 was planned, who knows what he has. What i know is that no matter what happens to Julian&#39;s children he has worse intel on nations capable of hurting his family. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a car accident or cancer, if anything happens to his kids I&#39;m blaming the nations with reason to want him silenced. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>um, he wasn&#39;t quiet.  He gave several important and damaging interviews.  The fact that people managed to fall for the contrived &quot;Assange is dead/missing&quot; dialogue did it&#39;s job in that nobody discussed the points of focus that Assange tried to direct people towards during those interviews.</p>

<p>The controlled narrative of &#39;Assange&#39;s disappearance&#39; has been supported and in fact obviously promoted here.  This has been suspiciously timed around the time of new moderation members and mod-team resignations.  This, in addition to entering nearly any thread on this sub and seeing a ridiculous amount of deleted posts and selective mumblings about rule violations make it absolutely clear what is happening.</p>

<p>He addressed significant proof of Clinton being pay-to-play even when sacrificing her own apparent moral values (in the case of Morrocco), exposing even more of her wrongdoings very close to the election.</p>

<p>He talked about the emails where Hillary used the destruction of Libya as basically a pawn to help her run for President.</p>

<p>He repeatedly confirmed that Russia wasn&#39;t the party that provided the information, even prior to the election.</p>

<p>Arms sales to countries giving massive contributions to the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>Security concerns he now has since his internet has been turned off.</p>

<p>etc.. etc..</p>

<p>While people here may say &quot;well we already knew all of that&quot;, the fact of the matter is that this was finally the actual hard-proof that should have been used to appeal to people first seeking an alternative outlook regarding the global elite.  Instead of these incredibly damaging conflicts of interests having the spotlight shone upon them, the narrative immediately shifted to &quot;where is Assange, is he dead, has he been compromised?&quot; just as he was starting to demonstrate the kind of impact his <strong>true information</strong> could have on the American election.</p>

<p>Shortly after the emails were released, there was an actual stickied post here promoting the idea that Assange was missing or dead,  without a <strong>shred of tangible evidence</strong>.  Meanwhile, posts about the actual content of the leaked emails didn&#39;t get nearly the attention they warranted.  </p>

<p>The plan worked absolutely perfectly, and the timing of the new mod changes here was absolutely no accident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As posted in another thread, as far as I know Julian has only one child, his son, Daniel, who was born in 1989. I went to the University of Melbourne with Julian and Daniel, and coincidentally they were concurrently there in (from memory) 2005 or 2006. Julian was finishing his Maths degree at the time (again, from memory, but I could be wrong as I saw him in Maths and Physics classes at the time), while his son was just starting.</p>

<p>So unless he has had a child in the last 8-9 years, which he has managed to keep quiet about and somehow that information leaking to the press (a possibility I admit), he may be telling us something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no evidence his family has been threatened. That is a really big accusation to make with nothing supporting it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest Assange is upset he can&#39;t visit his family for so many years now. Of course it&#39;s bad for his kids and they never signed up for this long not having a father present. I&#39;m glad the UN finally stepped in and started putting pressure on a few world governments to start acting humanely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So he agreed to remain silent, allowed Wikileaks to become a compromised weapon for the West and his family is left alone. He obviously no longer has control or influence over Wikileaks, which is why Wikileaks is begging for money and doing lots of grandstanding lately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange hasn&#39;t &quot;been silent&quot; since Oct. He has published multiple things he wrote and did at least two interviews. Claiming/insisting that he was &quot;silent&quot; during this time is to engage in &quot;fake news&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point I sincerely doubt even if his family is gone or put into a &quot;Safe House&quot; to keep Assange quiet, the Medi won&#39;t cover it.  All I have seen over here is anti-Trump adverts, Anti-Trump News, Zero Coverage of Wikileaks or Assange, they are still focusing on the Russian angle even this evening the News was warning that Trump should listen about Russia and the games they are playing.  Sick of It All.  No mention of Hillary&#39;s corruption during the election, the fact she compromised National Security etc.  Just Trump is a crazy loose cannon and Brexit and Trump will ruin the world.</p>
