       He's out there but gives you something to think about.  Everything he says I just keep in the back of my mind.  I see no reason why someone who is interested enough to watch his videos would react so adversely to the things he says.

       The people who think he's disinfo just do not know the metaphors he talks about, which is why I still think he's alive to this day. It's a way of protecting himself. Only those who truly know what he is talking about will understand, the rest of people that hear him will laugh him off or actually believe he's talking about literal reptile people...

       Could you please explain to me what the metaphors actually mean? I've known about David Icke for a long time but I was never able to buy his "evil alien lizards" thing, despite the fact that I believe he's legit on a lot of other things. PM me if you don't want to say it publicly, I'm awfully curious, thanks.

       The reptilian banter has to do with his belief that non-human terrestrial beings are in control of the planet. That they are indirectly controlling the population by manipulating the elite.

       Good post. For me personally, I think he's hitting close to home when it comes to the elites, pedophelia and satanistic rituals. (Illuminati confirmed pretty much) As you said, he's been in the game for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything reptilian related, I still watch with an open mind, but I don't think it should red-pill anyone. It fits in with the whole Niburu/Evolution is faked/Hollow earth theories too well for me not to be atleast amused.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a bridge too far, for now, and it could simply be a big hoax. (Similar to how the CIA (or FBI dunno) used/is using the UFO phenomena to seed disinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Start with exposing the people, the corruption, the pedophelia and the whole organisation. If they turn out to be reptilians, good one Icke for callin' it, if they don't, fuck it. It was a fun idea and to be honest, the actions and mindset of our ruling elite are so out of touch with us regulars, they might aswell be Reptilian...

       I don't give icke the credit because before he ever wrote a book he came on live tv saying he was the reincarnated Jesus... okay. If you do that shit it's guaranteed that your nothing more than an attention seeking lunatic. Everything he does seems motivated by trying to get people to believe in him

       Every single somewhat enlightened person I've gotten close to has had a point in their life where the lines between solipsism, enlightenment, the bible, and existentialism blur and one can easily confuse their awakenings with being central to the universe, in some ways, being that we are centers of our own universes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Icke fell into an illusion that - though he was very important and very aware - he wasn't the biblical Jesus. However, he was correct in thinking that he was a fragmented piece of God. Saying things like he did is dangerous, and foolish to a degree, but saying that you've found "Christ consciousness" and that it's alive within you isn't crazy at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why do you get the luxury of dismissing someone's entire life's work simply because they thought / said something a little spacey in the 90s? Seems quite convenient a position to take on such a thread..

       Don't many people who believe in god believe we are All sons or daughters of God and that we are created in his own image?
Didn't he call himself the son of god? If so and he believes in religion then that is a fair assessment of those beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all I remember of him growing up was the national newspapers calling him a crazy person who had a breakdown (red pilled hard) in reality he was born again and had an awakening like many people who find god or something bigger than themselves to believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mentioned him at christmas to family and that's all they knew about him that he was crazy and called himself the son of god.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's a little bit unfair to hold him to that decades old MSM portrayal of him.  It may be the only reason he is allowed to say the things he does about elite pedophilia.

       Everything of his that I've seen is him laying out his research and letting people make their own conclusions of it. He gives what his conclusions have been in a journalistic sense but doesn't bother "converting" those that won't listen. That's kind of par for the course in terms of conspiracies. All other conspiracies lay out evidence and try to draw conclusions. 
As for the "reincarnated jesus" bit, IIRC he was asked if he was God and he replied that no, he was
       <em>
        like
       </em>
       God in the sense that he has realized we are all connected and living as one consciousness.
