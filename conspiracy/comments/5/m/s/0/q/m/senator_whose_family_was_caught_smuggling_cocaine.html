        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>although the bust happened a few years ago, this should be a reminder who&#39;s really profiting from drugs in the US.</p>

<p>&quot;A cargo ship which has been linked to anti-drug Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell was stopped and searched before departing from Colombia recently, with approximately 90 pounds of cocaine found on board by the Coast Guard. But now, Senator McConnell is doubling down on his reputation as an “Anti-Drug Senator” by railing against legalized marijuana.</p>

<p>The Senate Minority Leader said that he is firmly “against legalizing marijuana,” even while this has put him at odds with his Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes.</p>

<p>McConnell acknowledged that marijuana is “not in the same category as heroin,” even if it is treated as such by the DEA. Still, he said that legalizing the plant could “completely transform your society in a way that I think certainly most Kentuckians would not agree with.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think an answer to this, honestly, is to go in a direction of legalizing any of these currently illegal drugs,” McConnell explained. “This whole movement in various parts of the country is a big mistake.”</p>

<p>This is rather ironic, as The Free Thought Project reported back in November that drugs found on the ship, the Ping May, were carried by the vessel operated by the Foremost Maritime Corporation. That’s a company owned by Mitch McConnell’s in-laws, the Chao family.
Free Thought explained that “this connection is not only relevant because of the family connection, but also because the Chao family has often made large donations to McConnell’s campaigns.”</p>

<p>“In fact,” they continue, “the Chao family has been funding McConnell since the late 1980s. Years later, in 1993, McConnell married Elaine Chao and secured the Chao family as one of his primary sources for investments.”</p>

<p>A gift worth somewhere between 5 and 25 million dollars from the Chao Family made McConnel one of the richest senators in the country in 2008.</p>

<p>The Foremost Maritime Corporation is currently operating 16 dry bulk cargo ships, most of which are currently still in service.</p>

<p>What makes this case even more interesting is that McConnell is well known as a staunch prohibitionist. In 1996, McConnell sponsored “The Enhanced Marijuana Penalties Act”, a bill designed to increase the mandatory minimum sentencing for people caught with marijuana.</p>

<p>Luis Gonzales, an official with the Colombian Coast Guard in Santa Marta told The Nation that the Ping May’s crew were questioned as part of the investigation, but that they have yet to file any charges in the case.</p>

<p>&quot;James Chao, father of McConnell&#39;s wife Elaine, has a lot of questions to answer after about $6.7 million worth of cocaine was found on the Ping May, a ship owned by the Foremost Group, a company Chao founded and led to a tidy fortune.<br/>
But was that fortune built on honest movement of legitimate bulk trade goods, or has Mr. Chao been trading in less than legal goods? Foremost is the source of most of Sen. McConnell&#39;s fortune through gifts and inheritance from his in-laws. It is a shadowy corporation, utilizing a complex scheme of shell companies to skip out on millions in taxes annually. </p>

<p>Some of the goods shipped by Foremost echo themes of the McConnell campaign. For instance, McConnell has stressed his opposition to carbon dioxide limits imposed by the federal government that would impact the domestic coal market. Guess what? Foremost ships routinely transport coal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The war on drugs is an insult to the intelligence of the American people. There are mountains of evidence proving that the biggest importers of harmful, addictive, mind diminishing street drugs is the government. The drug laws that exist do not apply to the government agencies that bring these substances to our country. They are only designed to keep everyone else from this extremely lucrative business and give the establishment another reason to oppress people.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TLDR Mitch McConnell&#39;s family has been busted with nearly a hindered pounds of coke on their ships.</p>

<p>This means they are profiting from the drug cartels. </p>

<p>The family has made the senator one of the richest senators in our nations history through donations.</p>

<p>The senator insures cartel supremacy by making prohibition laws even stronger and by opposing legalization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, his job was to vote along party lines which is what he did. That&#39;s what most politicians do, they listen to what they&#39;re meant to do or the party whips come round.</p>

<p>But separately can you not entertain the possibility that the cocaine shipment is extremely detached from this guy? I have no idea who he is, I don&#39;t really care either. But a shipping company literally ships a metric mega-shitton of stuff all over the world, every single shipping company probably has drugs going through it. This may be without the knowledge of anyone in the shipping company, let alone the owners son in law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah I agree. It&#39;s the same thing when people say we need to hate Russia and start WW3. When you ask them why exactly we should hate them there reason is literally the same thing as their original statement &quot;because they are our enemy&quot; as if that is a logical reason.</p>

<p>Same with weed. Why is it illegal? &quot;It is a gateway drug and will destroy communities!&quot; But there&#39;s no proof of that? &quot;Yes but it is illegal and bad!&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re right they are just words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Legalizing marijuana would be a great move for Kentucky. They need any business they can get. My family is from Morgan county Kentucky which is the most backwoods place I have ever seen. In that part of Kentucky if you have a job at Walmart, have a running car, and a rusty single wide hanging off the side of a hill you are doing damn good. All they have as far as real jobs is coal mining. Which is a depressing life to lead, I have been in an industrial setting my entire life around equipment that could kill a person in a second, but I would never step in to a mine. Except if my kid was going hungry. Whoever has been in charge of that state has been fucking up for a long time. The education in that area is laughable, and between meth and heroin they have a big problem there. You have uneducated, underemployed, hill people, what else is there to do but get fucked up. Not to mention the hospital that is two hours away, with a staff so stupid that I legitimately believe I could do a better job than them. Also, it&#39;s fucking Kentucky, everyone that wants to is already growing grass, why not tax it so they can educate there children so they won&#39;t be doing meth/heroine speedball and looking up to Walmart employees with trailers hanging off a cliff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ITT: Our weekly episode of &quot;<em>This</em> the <em>the</em> glaring hypocrisy that&#39;ll put us over the top in shaming .gov into Pot Legalization<sup><sup>(R)</sup></sup> !!&quot;. </p>

<p>Sorry, <a href="/u/Trees420_Nation">/u/Trees420_Nation</a>, the Law-enforcement / Prohibition axis needs illegal drugs and <em>therefore, there are going to be illegal drugs</em>. </p>

<p>There&#39;s just no better way to generate and move off-budget &#39;slush-funds&#39; and recruit sleazy, off-the-books gangs to perform illegal, unconstitutional dirty tricks. Not to mention keeping dirtbags like McConnell in line.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been that way since at least 1919, and it&#39;ll continue as long as the U.S. government exists.</p>

<p>&quot;Narcotics&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_State_Narcotic_Drug_Act">became a &#39;thing&#39; in <em>1934</em></a>. Why then? Because a <em>standing Army</em> of former alcohol Prohibition-enforcers was about to become unemployed by repeal of <em>that</em> atrocity. You <em>don&#39;t</em> let a force like that go in the middle of a Depression, when rumblings of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot">&#39;business plot to overthrow the government&#39;</a> were fresh in everyone&#39;s minds. Just add a little bureaucratic inertia, and constant fine-tuning for each new generation, and here we are!</p>
