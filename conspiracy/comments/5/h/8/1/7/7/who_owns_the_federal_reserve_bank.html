       The Jesuits and the Jesuit Order, they don't so much own it, they control it, because they created it and why isn't it being audited? Well, because the Jesuits are the controlling factor of the Federal Reserve, the same Jesuits controls the IRS and every other government entity so the Federal Reserve would never be audited.

       Idk bro.. money is everything and the Rothschilds own the money. The Khazarian mafia is the most powerful. Jesuits and Catholics didn't find Israel, it was the Zionists and Rothchilds. WWII was infact the Catholic/ Jesuit old world order, vs the Rothschild, Zionist new world order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit* Also, it was Judaism that founded Christianity and Islam to convert the non-Jew, indiginous people of Europe and the middle east to a second tier, judeo religion and enact usury so only Jews controlled the energy/ monetary policies. Jesuits don't control the money.

       And true but the Jesuits are the head of it all. The Jesuits
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       the Illuminati. So while the Rothschilds may own the money, the Jesuits owns the Rothschilds. The Jesuits killed JFK, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, the Jesuits sunk the Titanic, created the Federal Reserve, the Jesuits, including the Jesuit General and the Pope are the main controllers of this world.

       Why would they have the power though over the people who created them? Money= power. All the richest lands, most powerful jobs, money, everything.. Jews own it. Zionist world order won WWII against the Nazi, Axis backed Catholic/ Jesuit order. I don't see how Jesuits hold more power in today's world than the Khazarian mafia.

       Yes because the Jesuits put Jews in position of power, so that if problems occurs, the Jews can be blamed and not them, the Jesuits. They really planned this, this way. I even made a video on Youtube detailing how the Jesuits did this. They are very clever but they are extremely powerful.

       Jesuits wouldn't exist though if Jews never created Christianity to take control of the Roman Empire and Europe. In today's world, it's obvious that Zionist Jews are the pushers of the world. It is true the Jesuits now control the Catholic church, but after WWII and the Second Vatican Council in 1962, the Jews control the money and now the Jesuit/ Vatican aswell. The Jewish world congress is part of the shadow government of the world. The Elders of Zion describes modern times, Jesuit influence peeked in the 1940s. I don't see the evidence they still have the world power today. Zionists control the Masons. They control the powers of the EU and US. If you can provide me specific sources on how and where Jesuits control Rothchild and private banking, currently, then I'll look at it.

       I just showed you evidence via a video link that comprised all of the evidence, but in case you need more than that, here are the links that details perfectly how it's the Jesuits that owns the banking system, not the Jews, like a lot of people like to think:

       I just see no evidence that the Jesuits control global power, influence and politics. Everything points to Zionism. It's true that Zionists prefer to deflect this fact, and make you think it's other groups.. but I don't see any evidence to indicate that Catholicism/ Jesuits have that much power anymore.

       Well.. is it the Jesuits that control the 6 corporations that control all American media, or are they Jewish? Jesuits control Hollywood? The Banks? Fortune 500 companies? I'm just trying to figure out why you're so intrigued about Jesuits and feel they are the rulers with no actual indication in place to show that they control anything.

       Because a lot and I do mean A LOT of these conspiracies actually points back to the Jesuits but Jones, Icke - no "known" theorist will touch the topic of Jesuits, you ever wonder why that is?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean because, lets cut the crap about Illuminati all the time and see that it's The Society of Jesus who pull their strings. Everyone is indoctrinated into this scary Illuminati, which isn't as scary as The Jesuits who run them. Good job people like Eric Phelps, William Cooper, Ian Paisley, Barry Chamish etc. have the balls to stand up and expose the real puppet masters The Jesuit Order from The Church of Gesu in Rome, Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a lot of people have all been steered in the wrong path by people like Alex Jones, David Icke, Noam Chomskey etc, and people need to ask themselves why these "theorists" are so global and get away with exposing the orders. Its not just about the amount of people following them now which stops them being assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could have been annihilated well before now like poor Phil Schneider etc. It hasn't happened because they are helping to keep the veil down on the JESUIT ORDER who owns the Illuminati and every organization on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're all playing a game to keep the intelligent sheeple still locked away to a point, feed them some truths and have them hook line and sinker then divert them away from the real culprits. Alex Jones and those like him are all temporal co-adjutors for The Society of Jesus who has insiders in every side of conflict. The Jesuits are the most intelligent people on this planet especially in the high end part of the Jesuit Order.
      </p>
      <p>
       They forget to tell you about how the Jesuits are Alchemists, Sorcerors and Occultists just like your scary scary Illuminati. They love to promote Illuminati on Mainstream TV on films like Chainsaw Massacre but wheres the Jesuit advertising? NONE! They're feeding people what they want but people are foolish enough to desire.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people re-opened their minds and started looking at the facts a bit further now and in the direction of The Jesuits they will be shocked to find all the answers in front of them. No one isn't saying Illuminati isn't powerful because they are second in command to The Jesuits and
       <em>
        no one
       </em>
       else is higher than them. The Illuminati Consist of B'Nai B'Rith, Grand Orient, Council of 33rd degree Masons of Scottish Rite, Council of 13 degrees of the Bavarian Illuminati, Black Nobility &amp; The Committee of 300.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones had openly admitted being a Roman Catholic Christian. Alex amazingly gets into Bohemian Grove without getting killed or removed unlike no other person attempting it. Alex Jones will not talk to anyone who knows of the Jesuit Order being supreme ruler. David Icke has mentioned very minutely that the Jesuit Order are very power players but that's ultra rare and he too promotes this scary Illuminati mystical force of Order. David Icke isn't a stupid man, he's smart and his knowledge of the order is very large which in itself is a suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you honestly think Mr. Icke wouldn't know the true power of the Jesuit Order? Of course he does but he chooses to not expose them because he's on their side as a Temporal Co-Adjutor. People really need to think, because the Jesuits are riding everyone like cowboys at a rodeo.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, there is a true leader of all the masonic groups, organizations etc. This leader is known by some as The superforce, the men from below, olympians and so on. They're all names given to the Society of Jesus who as educated people should know - is The Jesuit Order. Jesus is a representation of the sun, its as simple as that and followed by the occult. The Jesuits are not nice christian worshipers and teachers, they practice sorcery, alchemy, occult, ritualism just like their 2nd in command Illuminati. The Jesuits are the most feared people on this planet among people in the know. I mean just listen to people like Barry Chamish, Eric Jon Phelps, Alberto Riveria, William Cooper.
      </p>
      <p>
       The establishment through its servants Alex Jones, David Icke, Noam Chomskey have programmed people's minds with a truth, no doubt about that. Yes you will find the Illuminati is behind all the problems in the world because they are almost at the peek of the pyramid, so of course everything goes through them at some point but the jesuits are the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate Khazarian fake Jews, but I know they are not the leaders of this world and their being used as a proxy to blame as always. Just like how the Jesuits yet again created another thing known to us as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, pathetic. Did you know that every time you look up at the moon or the moon is shining on you that your unknowingly worshiping the Jesuit Order? Yes, the main craters of the Moon are Jesuit named. So whilst your worshiping Molech with Big Ben and not knowing it, the Jesuits again are one step ahead and on another planet entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing why haven't these "theorists" and "truthers" even told people who the Illuminati actually are? The only thing they hint at is the bloodlines, the bloodlines. That's only one part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if all I and Eric Jon Phelps are saying about the Jesuits are lies - as some think, why do people like Eric Jon Phelps get their books banned? Why do old books on the Jesuit Order get banned and removed? Why do many others who author books exposing Jesuits, Illuminati, freemasonry, finance have their books banned for people never to see? Why do some people get assassinated for writing and giving information (Phil Schneider, Gary Webb etc)? Gary Webb was well known and he's gone now and it blamed on suicide. David Kelly from England was a scientist he was "died by suicide", yeah right.

       No one really "owns" the federal reserve. However, it is structured like a private corporation. But it is run by a board appointed by the President, on 14 year terms.

       Why it isn't audited? Good fucking question mate. It should be. And it's lack of transparency is fucked up. I remember hearing Bernanke tell Congress one time during questioning, "We don't have to answer that." Didn't even plead the 5th. Just straight up said fuck you we aint answering that. It was crazy.

       this is not correct, it does have private ownership.  The twelve regional banks that make up the Federal Reserve are owned by shareholder private banks.  These banks get 6% annual return when the Reserve is profitable (almost always) and stock ownership is based on monetary value of the bank.  So basically the largest private banks that operate in the US (both foreign and domestically owned) have the largest impact on Fed policy.  All these banks get a sweet 6% return every year on encouraging more US debt and a weakened dollar through shady policies like quantitative easing.
