       link to the page. Also interestingly, why is there no wiki page at all for James Alefantis? Does anyone remember it being on there at all, maybe it has been deleted? Why is there one for his pizza place and not him, being the 49th most powerful man in Washington according to GQ? Wonder if anyone can shed any light on this?

       Jesus. Give me a fucking break. Any report, including this wiki, that claims the theory to be debunked essentially just says "yea, well, the cops said it's bullshit so it's bullshit. No research or investigation needed. Move along!"

       It specifically states in the wiki page that 'Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia' along with 'Snopes.Com' and 'The New York Times' are the ones who have debunked it. Since when has the police even investigated at all??? and a website and MSM are eligible to do the debunking how? and what evidence have they provided? I'd like to see it.

       Maybe someone should contact the met police dept of Columbia and ask why they have 'debunked' it and what and if any investigations they have made? Not that they would give anything away anyway, i would do it but i'm in the UK.

       It's becoming increasingly difficult to believe that there's nothing behind p-gate. The way MSM are handling it, refusing to even acknowledge it, is a telling sign.

       Definitely agree - and I think this wiki conspiracy page is just another worrying bit of evidence that seems to be piling up of their onslaught of categorising pizzagate as an 'alt right conspiracy' and nothing more.

       I mean seriously? You think this is normal reaction from the media? Potentially, the biggest organized child-trafficing ring in the history and their first reaction is to outright dismiss without even bothering to actually cover the story and present the story. I mean, it's not like they had any qualms with running wild with 'Iraq has WMDs' story, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point media clearly exists with the sole purpose of serving the elite. I don't expect Podesta shouting from the rooftops 'I'm innocent', however I expect journalists and law enforcement to look into it, considering the large amount of coincidences. But who are we kidding? These same people run them.

       “Pizzagate” has been debunked about as thoroughly as any conspiracy theory ever could be — the restaurant doesn’t even have a basement, for example — but some die-hards just won’t give it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's their idea of being thoroughly debunked? That it doesn't even have a basement? I just thought that quote was a little assured, and thought some of you might enjoy the blurb.

       I'd be interested to know if anyone has checked previously and remembers being on there? I'm sure i was on it before but i cannot be 100% sure. Just thought it curious that his pizza place has one, and pizzagate has one as a conspiracy theory but not him? I only searched in light of David Seaman's video of late that stated his wiki page was being deleted. Cheers for the info though! I also would be interested to see if any one can tell if a page has been deleted from wiki?

       No, I don't remember him having a wiki page. archive.org and archive.is seem to agree. David Brock had one though, and until recently had James listed as his partner.
