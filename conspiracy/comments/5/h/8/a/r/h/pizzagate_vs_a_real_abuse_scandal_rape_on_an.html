        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/chugs1984.html">chugs1984</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Due to the massive scale of child abuse perpetuated by the <a href="http://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/">Catholic &amp; Christian church, state run orphanages, military cadet schools and other institutions it has been estimated that over 60,000 boys and girls were raped, suffered from sexual and physical ab</a>use and were denied natural justice by church and successive governments.</p>

<p>In this case there was reams upon reams of evidence and victims who were finally had a chance to tell their story.</p>

<p>My own family (not just one member but two) suffered at the hand&#39;s of brothers (such a insult to the word) who ran the catholic school they attended. I know the true price and I&#39;m sure for those who want to call me a shill they can see by my post history the consequences of this abuse has affected myself and others in my family.</p>

<p>I have myself have heard rumours from street kids and dealers about certain politicians who were into the rough trade, the young boys who could be bought at &quot;the wall&quot;. It was common knowledge about certain brothers and schools were places to stay away from.</p>

<p>From reading the terms of reference and looking at today&#39;s environment of prosecutions, along with far better reporting and investigation frameworks i far more confident that systemic abuse on the scale that we saw prior to early 1990s has been greatly reduced, and stopped in many other places..</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with pizzagate?</p>

<p>The idea that every prosecutor and cop in Washington DC is so utterly corrupted by the DNC and is providing them protection whilst they run a child ring seems fantastical at the least.</p>

<p>In Australia even in the worst days the church and law enforcement were aware of the abuse. Money was paid out, priests moved and non disclosure agreements drawn up. There was reams of paperwork, lawyers were involved and so on. </p>

<p>Schools, churches and other places shut down in a bid to coverup and hide their shame</p>

<p>The street kids, and &quot;junkies&quot; the refuse of child abuse rings would be talking about this stuff. </p>

<p>But i have seen no complaints, no complainants&#39;, no angry families, no unusual patterns of drug abuse and suicide from &#39;young democratic youth organisation&quot;, no whistle blowers and no straight out evidence.</p>

<p>The Darknet is where these abuse rings operate, on VPNs, with TOR and in third world countries where they can buy local police ag the very least and/or operate with relative impunity. </p>

<p>Apart from a emails written by a foodie who loves pizza and pasta, who is a technical luddite, as is HRC, you guys are telling me that along with some very circumstantial evidence, with no victims, no missing kids, no bodies and no angry families that is enough to prove its happening?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry that you hate HRC and podesta this much but the fact that you people are spamming reddit and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with this crap is really upsetting me seeing its diverting attention from real fucking scandals and conspiracies.</p>

<p>HRC and Podesta have done some bad shit, no denying that. But more on the scale of selling arms to dictators, selling jobs in government for &quot;donations, corrupting governments, starting wars and rebellions, selling uranium to ones enemies and accepting hundreds of millions in bribes.</p>

<p>Considrring HRC and Podesta are quit familiar with the NSA infrastructure i find it highly unusual they would be running a child abuse ring considering all the data would be there to prove it, ic it was happening, stored in KEYSTONE, PRISM and other systems. If you knew there was a chance that your political enemies&#39; would gain control of this apparatus surely you would be so foolish to operate a vast criminal enterprise knowing that you could be easily prosecuted. </p>

<p>We know via the Snowden leaks the government shares NSA sourced material with federal and state prosecutors on drug, murder and other major crimes cases, coaching the prosecutors how to hide and mask the real sources of the material. We know as is the case with General Petraeus and other high ranking officials and officers that they were being &#39;monitored&#39; hence why they were discovered leaking top secret material. (and really we&#39;re to buy that convoluted story someone had a mate in the FBI who just accidentally discovered the  emails being hidden in gmail drafts)</p>

<p>The idea that HRC runs the government and has complete protection from such an all seeing apparatus is a joke (or else she would won this dammed election if she was that powerful).</p>

<p>If any can satisfy the following however i will consider the argument</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Who are the victims and where are their complaints, where are the families?</p></li>
<li><p>If the victims have been paid off where is the evidence</p></li>
<li><p>If the victims were murdered where are the bodies or cold cases?</p></li>
<li><p>Where are the children currently being abused?</p></li>
<li><p>Outside of HRC and Podedta who else is doing this and apart from the emails what evidence is there to tie them to  crimes?</p></li>
<li><p>Where is the community and locals of Washington? I knew street kids in my area that attested to the abuse that was happening. Surely these kids/young adults, thrown away by abusers, usually because there junkies and too old, would be a primary source of evidence? </p></li>
<li><p>Where are the whistle-blowers?, Disgusted cops and lawyers ordered to ignore and suppress the abuse? Families breaking their NDAs and so on?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>edit: subtle grammar changes. I wrote this at like 4 am with 3 hours sleep, on a mobile with a crying baby next to me....so my grammar is all over the place. </p>

<li>Because he/she doesn&#39;t realize how big and wide spread the problem is in the whole system</li>
<li>Thats how every crime is - you find bits of evidence along the way.  Once you find the smoking gun, its over.  Thats how they all work.  Pizzagate is relatively new as far as being a widespread phenomenon.</li>
<li>Personally, I think you have the right to question it.  That keeps people on point and in the right direction.  But if you are one of the guys starting threads claiming &quot;the whole thing is fake, theres no real evidence&quot; then it makes sense why people would call u a shill.  This is a conspiracy theory forum, and there is really a lot of small bits of evidence all over the place that make this a worthwhile investigation, but certainly there is no solution yet</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I&#39;ve looked at major conspiracies and cover ups across the world and there is always people talking....just they were ignored because they were junkies and undesirables.</p>

<p>Look at the HRC FBI investigation. There were so many leaks from angry FBI agents that she was going to get away with it. Look at MK Ultra and the huge amount of material from that.</p>

<p>I used the Royal Commission into child abuse being run in Australia and my own anecdotal experiences but it was clear that in those cases that although it took sometime they were called to justices, or at least known in the community. </p>

<p>So re Pizzagate, where is the direct irrefutable evidence? Oh you&#39;ve got some emails from a major foodie talking about a pizza place that (and i just saw this) makes it own fricken tomato sauce. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you people realise how fucking shit food is in America. When I travelled to the US around 8 out of every 10 meals was just so bad I wouldn&#39;t feed it to my dog. </p>

<p>It was just shitty food. I can imagine that a foodie like Podesta would be like a junkie when it comes to finding a good resturant or pizza place. </p>

<p>That said its clear that he uses food to lobby the rich and powerful. There are a bunch of stuff showing him cooking at his house, using good food to get powerful people at his table. </p>

<p>Perhaps there is a code in the emails but the idea that its a child abuse ring, without any evidence, no leaks, no whistleblowers, nothing then you have to start asking yourself what do you actually have. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you welcome the questioning though. </p>

<p>First of all,HRC runs the government? Now you&#39;re just making shit up. Second of all, I thought you had just described how coverups work, now youre saying that its infeasible. Your point about the NSA is interesting though. Thats why many people believe there is an intra-intelligence community struggle.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll take a whack at your questions too.</p>

<p>Who are the victims and where are their complaints, where are the families?
   Possibly it is the missing child population of Virginia, which is 7-8x the national state average per capita.</p>

<p>If the victims have been paid off where is the evidence
     Hidden in some shell corporations most likely. Keep digging.</p>

<p>If the victims were murdered where are the bodies or cold cases?
    No one knows if murder is involved, but once again, the numbers on missing children are horrifying.</p>

<p>Where are the children currently being abused?
   Uhhhh if I knew I would call the police and tell them.</p>

<p>Outside of HRC and Podedta who else is doing this and apart from the emails what evidence is there to tie them to crimes?
       I ain&#39;t got time for this question, look up the Frank Coverup, Jimmy Saville and bbc, Who Took Johnny on netflix, Epstein and his island, you seem to already know and have first hand experience with the Catholic Church scandal. These are all in the last 20 years, I think its pretty obvious that it is a rampant problem.</p>

<p>Where is the community and locals of washington? I knew street kida in my xiry that attested to the abuse that was happening. Surely these kids/young adults, thrown awan by abusers, usually because there junkies and too old, would be a primary source of evidence
    I&#39;m not sure what youre asking here.</p>

<p>Where are the whistleblowers?, Disgusted cops and lawyers ordered to ignore and suppress the abuse? Families breaking their NDAs and so on?
    As far as I know, there are no whistleblowers for the pizzagate scandal specifically, but there have been many whistleblowers world wide talking about this. Many.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but the fact that your so offensively aggressive isn&#39;t really conducive to getting to the bottom of this. </p>

<p>Are you prepared to accept your wrong? Can you as an adult capable of saying your wrong if you were presented with undeniable logical or evidence? </p>

<p>I am more then happy to accept HRC and Podesta are doing this. <strong><em>But only if there is evidence</em></strong></p>

<p>if not then there really is no point even replying or discussing the matter. I&#39;m not going to call you stupid or your claims bullshit. </p>

<p>But i will call out anything that you don&#39;t have evidence from. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who said this? I mean, who actually theorized that every cop and prosecutor was in on it? Not some comment that says &quot;THEYRE ALL IN ON IT!!!!11&quot; No one said this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you want me to say? That you didn&#39;t say this and therefore I&#39;m completely wrong in my argument? Seriously what sort of argument is this? </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that dozens if not hundreds of police and lawyers who work in the Washington / Virginia area would have to be involved in a coverup of this scale. Hundreds of children every year going missing across multiple states. Thousands of children over the last twenty years. And not a single person has said anything. </p>

<p>Suppressing victim complaints, quashing investigations into missing children, declaring dead children and/or whistleblowers as accidents and so on. </p>

<p>Seriously a shit load of money would have to be spent be to covering it up. Doesn&#39;t seem very feasible or likely does it.  </p>

<p>And for this to happen in the backyard of the FBI. An agency that hates HRC guts, an agency that would love to nail her with something like this. </p>

<p>Really this is what the Pizzagate theorists are claiming. That the DNC (as corrupted as it is) has somehow corrupted a staggeringly large number of law enforcement agencies and departments across multiple states. </p>

<p>And yet despite this immense amount of power she lost an election and couldn&#39;t stop them from investigating her email server. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, so you DO understand how a cover up of this magnitude works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I love studying cover-ups, from the Gulf of Tonkins, the Gulf War (I &amp; II), world war 2, Vietnam, and the death squads and civil wars of south america (i.e. Iran Contra affair). </p>

<p>Its exceedingly difficult for a governemnt to keep something like this covered up let alone a political party like the DNC. Especially when government changes hand from democratic to republican and so on. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all,HRC runs the government? Now you&#39;re just making shit up. Second of all, I thought you had just described how coverups work, now youre saying that its infeasible. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My point is this. Pizzagate theories basically say that HRC and Podesta are immensely powerful and are capable of covering up and maintain this cover up (despite intense scrutiny). I&#39;ve tried to explain the amount of people who have to be on the Clinton payroll. We are talking about police across multiple states, state and local. We&#39;re talking about the FBI. </p>

<p>And yet despite wielding such power she cannot win an election? </p>

<p>Either she is god and is omnipotent or she isn&#39;t and therefore there should be evidence of a coverup. Victims claiming they were abused, families pursuing justices for their dead or missing children, whistleblowers. And a heap of evidence in their emails about pay offs and other coverup activities. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your point about the NSA is interesting though. Thats why many people believe there is an intra-intelligence community struggle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think about it, it also applies to the email server. The NSA would have been scanning the computers, emails and systems of cabinet minsters like HRC. The idea that they didn&#39;t know that she was running her own email server is either a sign that the NSA is utterly incontempt, or they knew she was running her email server, and the content that was on it. </p>

<p>The argument that there is an interagency war going on is interesting but how does it apply to pizzagate and again where is the evidence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who are the victims and where are their complaints, where are the families? Possibly it is the missing child population of Virginia, which is 7-8x the national state average per capita.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its not evidence that says HRC and Podesta are doing it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hidden in some shell corporations most likely. Keep digging.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And thus despite having all of their personal emails you found nothing about money. Either the money that is paid off to the cops and lawyers and other people keeping all of this secret, no money paid to victims and so on. </p>

<p>The fact that the Clinton foundation is under investigation and no one has leaked strange payments made to nobodies, to families of victims and such </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the victims were murdered where are the bodies or cold cases? No one knows if murder is involved, but once again, the numbers on missing children are horrifying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly there is no evidence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where are the children currently being abused? Uhhhh if I knew I would call the police and tell them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if you guys were having to prosecute this in like a court, you know, a place where people are considered innocent before they are found guilty it would could easily argued that you have a terrible case. </p>

<p>Again you have no evidence. </p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t even get trial insurance with the sort of case your constructing even if it was pursued in a civil court. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Outside of HRC and Podedta who else is doing this and apart from the emails what evidence is there to tie them to crimes? I ain&#39;t got time for this question, look up the Frank Coverup, Jimmy Saville and bbc, Who Took Johnny on netflix, Epstein and his island, you seem to already know and have first hand experience with the Catholic Church scandal. These are all in the last 20 years, I think its pretty obvious that it is a rampant problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The number one thing is when these cover up/conspiracies were exposed a host of victims have always marched forward. </p>

<p>No one has come forward in Pizzagate!</p>

<p>Its like your accusing HRC of murder but you can&#39;t tell me who was murdered and you can&#39;t point out the family of the murder victim. NO one is complaining. </p>

<p>The royal commission in Australia didn&#39;t magically happen without complaints from victims. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is the community and locals of Washington? I knew street kida in my xiry that attested to the abuse that was happening. Surely these kids/young adults, thrown awan by abusers, usually because there junkies and too old, would be a primary source of evidence I&#39;m not sure what youre asking here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My apologises. I&#39;ve eddied my original post. I wrote it at like 4am, after 3 hrs sleep, on a mobile with a crying baby. </p>

<p>My point is this. As a &quot;junkie&quot;, I&#39;ve known a lot of street kids and dealers. The street network is very good way of getting information. </p>

<p>If the Pizzagate conspiracy theorists really believed something was going on the first place they should go to is the street kids and homeless of the cities and towns across Washington, Virginia, Maryland and surrounding states and simply straight out ask them if they were raped as children by politicians and lobbyist in Washington. </p>

<p>surely they can&#39;t have killed hundreds of raped children every year and not a single body ever being found. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where are the whistleblowers?, Disgusted cops and lawyers ordered to ignore and suppress the abuse? Families breaking their NDAs and so on? As far as I know, there are no whistleblowers for the pizzagate scandal specifically, but there have been many whistleblowers world wide talking about this. Many.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly that&#39;s my point there are have been whistle blowers about major conspiracies but none exist for Pizzagate. </p>

<p>The ones that don&#39;t are killed. It gets worse than that. Ultimately, I don&#39;t really care.

    <div class="md"><p>This is a well written article about a serial killer(s) tangled around powerful people and untold scores of sexually abused, mutilated lives due to pederasty - full tilt.</p>

<p>This article demonstrates how these crimes are covered and covered up:</p>

<p>As you state, your life has been impacted personally. You do not explain how their abusers were prosecuted or brought to justice. </p>

<p>Pederasty crosses all lines of social landscapes from religion, politics, police, business people, powerful elite to clowns and MENSA members. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a political witch hunt of one party and none in here have ever made it such and or gotten away with it!</p>

<p>Even as you say, this stuff takes place on the Darknet...it also happens in churches, schools, restaurants, around police, priests, doctors, lawyers and parents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you&#39;ve just underline my point. </p>

<p>Look at all the evidence and material found. Cold cases, police reports. Victims, missing people. </p>

<p>The other thing is that since the 1980s there has been a huge push around the world to clean up polices forces and accountability, especially in western democracies. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that their are paedophile rings still running in our societies but considering that you have HRC and Podesta&#39;s emails and the best you&#39;ve come up with is pizza I simply cannot accept that you have anything but a fraction of the evidence and material that Mr Appelman collected to prove there was a huge coverup. </p>

<p>And therein lies the rub. Pizzagate has no evidence. Nothing but a shit post from 4chan. </p>

<p>Even if there is a code, why it has to be about child sex abuse is beyond me? Why couldn&#39;t it be about corruption and money laundering. </p>

<p>Look at HRC Victory fund, laundering money to beat the federal limits on candidate donations. </p>

<p>Look at the actual conspiracy theories that have good evidence that illustrate HRC selling political favours to foreign governments in return for massive donations to the Clinton Foundation fund. </p>

<p>Or the DNC selling positions on boards and committees in return for donations. </p>

<p>That shit is real. There are zillions of emails on that stuff. </p>

<p>But the idea that there are no emails on the pay of dozens of cops and lawyers used to suppress victims and family complaints, there are no bodies, no quashed murder investigations, no abnormal series of suicides (either before after the &quot;breaking of pizzagate) and so on says to me that you have nothing. </p>

<p>I point to the huge scandals around the world. Victims were talking and screaming about what happened to them.</p>

<p>I find it disgusting to believe we&#39;re all cowards</p>

<p>Edit: Yes since the 1980s there has been significant reform in how police forces operate....especially in the US, Australia and Europe.</p>

<p>There is a much greater degree of accountability. You can read this in the case studies and analysis that are available on the websites of Criminology institutes and NGOs who are in the law enforcement and judicial sector.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t corrupt cops but i am saying the widespread systemic corruption of polices forces is far less a problem then it used to be.</p>

<p>The idea that the police departments, local and state across at least three states would be corrupted by the DNC, specifically HRC and Podesta is just fantastical </p>

<p>And despite the huge areas where evidence would be almost blatantly sitting out top no one has found anything solid.</p>

<p>Think about it, thousands of you donald trumpers are busy scouring the net of anything you can link HRC to and despite a fuckton of hearsay and conjecture no one has found anything solid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sigh</p>

<p>I know lots of people who make &quot;perverted art&quot;. Maybe some were abused and beat in their childhood. Sure they make really crazy shit in the performance art space.  My friends and family are into S&amp;M (they were actually in that night club scene in the Matrix) and so on. But the idea they&#39;re part of a child abuse scandal either abusing kids or using their art as the only way to describe they were abused is just wrong. </p>

<p>Its just ridiculous that somehow people who go to Comet pizza parlour, who have strange art, somehow substantiates that HRC is running a paedophile ring.</p>

<p>Whilst the idea that HRC and Podesta are running a perfectly compartmentalized paedophile ring is just ridiculous. </p>

<p>The entire point is they lobby rich and powerful people by offering them children to rape. And we&#39;re talking about thousands if you look at the missing children of the states that surround washington, and multiple that by the decades she has supposedly been operating this. </p>

<p>So your saying that they operated this ring in perfect secrecy. Despite tens of thousands of mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters of abused children never saying anything. That somehow these victims (since they&#39;re not coming out) must have been murdered, so again thousands of bodies never revealed and found (must have be quashed by dirty local, state and federal police operating over five states). All of those peoples and no one has said one iota? </p>

<p>And yet apparently they can&#39;t keep their emails secure? </p>

<p>What a joke. And the fact that emails don&#39;t contain anything else? No major pay offs, no talk about paying off cops, the FBI, and lawyers across multiple states?</p>

<p>In Australia where had several victims right groups pursuing the government for the royal commission, for what is essentially the same number of people HRC and Podesta are accused of abusing. The were years of stories in the news about scandal after scandal.  </p>

<p>The big piece of evidence that the pizzagate consipracy thrives on is the relationship of people with HRC and Podesta. The idea that anyone who knows or is related to HRC or Podesta who has ever been involved in child abuse issues/crimes/coverups somehow means that HRC and Podesta are child sex criminals. </p>

<p>By law I&#39;m related to Cardinal Clancy of Australia, who was cardinal from 1983 to 2001. </p>

<p>He presided over a huge about abuse and coverups. In fact even before he became the cardinal, as a bishop and senior priest he would have known a significant amount of abuse was happening.</p>

<p>Does that mean I&#39;m part of the catholic churches systamatic rape of tens of thousands of children? </p>

<p>The reality is my father and brother suffered immensely from institutions and administration that Cardinal Clancy presided over. Are they too part of the conspiracy? </p>

<p>I personally knew Cardinal Clancy&#39;s sister and she was the most loveliest, amazing person i&#39;ve ever seen. Was she part of the conspiracy? </p>

<p>You god damn fucking CUNTS - FUCK I HATE YOU FUCKS screaming like DUMB LITTLE CHILDREN&gt;</p>

<p>YOU DON&quot;T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK GOES ON IN THESE THINGS&gt; YOU DON&quot;T KNOW THE SECRETS AND PAIN PEOPLE CARRY.....sorry but this is just a bit upsetting for me to read you people carrying on about this stuff when there are real conspiracies going on</p>

<p>The idea that there is a super duper child abuse ring with not a single victim is just the stupidest thing i&#39;ve ever heard of. </p>

<p>Because I can tell you now....out of the supposedly thousands of victims, the idea that not one has spoken up is wrong. </p>

<p>Either they&#39;re fucking screaming about it and no one is listening. </p>

<p>Or it didn&#39;t happen. </p>

<p>K I&#39;m here to call out all your bullshit and keep you honest</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but the fact that your so offensively aggressive isn&#39;t really conducive to getting to the bottom of this. </p>

<p>Are you prepared to accept your wrong? Can you as an adult capable of saying your wrong if you were presented with undeniable logical or evidence? </p>

<p>I am more then happy to accept HRC and Podesta are doing this. <strong><em>But only if there is evidence</em></strong></p>

<p>if not then there really is no point even replying or discussing the matter. I&#39;m not going to call you stupid or your claims bullshit. </p>

<p>But i will call out anything that you don&#39;t have evidence from. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who said this? I mean, who actually theorized that every cop and prosecutor was in on it? Not some comment that says &quot;THEYRE ALL IN ON IT!!!!11&quot; No one said this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you want me to say? That you didn&#39;t say this and therefore I&#39;m completely wrong in my argument? Seriously what sort of argument is this? </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that dozens if not hundreds of police and lawyers who work in the Washington / Virginia area would have to be involved in a coverup of this scale. Hundreds of children every year going missing across multiple states. Thousands of children over the last twenty years. And not a single person has said anything. </p>

<p>Suppressing victim complaints, quashing investigations into missing children, declaring dead children and/or whistleblowers as accidents and so on. </p>

<p>Seriously a shit load of money would have to be spent be to covering it up. Doesn&#39;t seem very feasible or likely does it.  </p>

<p>And for this to happen in the backyard of the FBI. An agency that hates HRC guts, an agency that would love to nail her with something like this. </p>

<p>Really this is what the Pizzagate theorists are claiming. That the DNC (as corrupted as it is) has somehow corrupted a staggeringly large number of law enforcement agencies and departments across multiple states. </p>

<p>And yet despite this immense amount of power she lost an election and couldn&#39;t stop them from investigating her email server. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, so you DO understand how a cover up of this magnitude works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes I love studying cover-ups, from the Gulf of Tonkins, the Gulf War (I &amp; II), world war 2, Vietnam, and the death squads and civil wars of south america (i.e. Iran Contra affair). </p>

<p>Its exceedingly difficult for a governemnt to keep something like this covered up let alone a political party like the DNC. Especially when government changes hand from democratic to republican and so on. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all,HRC runs the government? Now you&#39;re just making shit up. Second of all, I thought you had just described how coverups work, now youre saying that its infeasible. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My point is this. Pizzagate theories basically say that HRC and Podesta are immensely powerful and are capable of covering up and maintain this cover up (despite intense scrutiny). I&#39;ve tried to explain the amount of people who have to be on the Clinton payroll. We are talking about police across multiple states, state and local. We&#39;re talking about the FBI. </p>

<p>And yet despite wielding such power she cannot win an election? </p>

<p>Either she is god and is omnipotent or she isn&#39;t and therefore there should be evidence of a coverup. Victims claiming they were abused, families pursuing justices for their dead or missing children, whistleblowers. And a heap of evidence in their emails about pay offs and other coverup activities. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your point about the NSA is interesting though. Thats why many people believe there is an intra-intelligence community struggle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think about it, it also applies to the email server. The NSA would have been scanning the computers, emails and systems of cabinet minsters like HRC. The idea that they didn&#39;t know that she was running her own email server is either a sign that the NSA is utterly incontempt, or they knew she was running her email server, and the content that was on it. </p>

<p>The argument that there is an interagency war going on is interesting but how does it apply to pizzagate and again where is the evidence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who are the victims and where are their complaints, where are the families? Possibly it is the missing child population of Virginia, which is 7-8x the national state average per capita.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its not evidence that says HRC and Podesta are doing it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hidden in some shell corporations most likely. Keep digging.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And thus despite having all of their personal emails you found nothing about money. Either the money that is paid off to the cops and lawyers and other people keeping all of this secret, no money paid to victims and so on. </p>

<p>The fact that the Clinton foundation is under investigation and no one has leaked strange payments made to nobodies, to families of victims and such </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the victims were murdered where are the bodies or cold cases? No one knows if murder is involved, but once again, the numbers on missing children are horrifying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly there is no evidence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where are the children currently being abused? Uhhhh if I knew I would call the police and tell them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if you guys were having to prosecute this in like a court, you know, a place where people are considered innocent before they are found guilty it would could easily argued that you have a terrible case. </p>

<p>Again you have no evidence. </p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t even get trial insurance with the sort of case your constructing even if it was pursued in a civil court. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Outside of HRC and Podedta who else is doing this and apart from the emails what evidence is there to tie them to crimes? I ain&#39;t got time for this question, look up the Frank Coverup, Jimmy Saville and bbc, Who Took Johnny on netflix, Epstein and his island, you seem to already know and have first hand experience with the Catholic Church scandal. These are all in the last 20 years, I think its pretty obvious that it is a rampant problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The number one thing is when these cover up/conspiracies were exposed a host of victims have always marched forward. </p>

<p>No one has come forward in Pizzagate!</p>

<p>Its like your accusing HRC of murder but you can&#39;t tell me who was murdered and you can&#39;t point out the family of the murder victim. NO one is complaining. </p>

<p>The royal commission in Australia didn&#39;t magically happen without complaints from victims. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is the community and locals of Washington? I knew street kida in my xiry that attested to the abuse that was happening. Surely these kids/young adults, thrown awan by abusers, usually because there junkies and too old, would be a primary source of evidence I&#39;m not sure what youre asking here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My apologises. I&#39;ve eddied my original post. I wrote it at like 4am, after 3 hrs sleep, on a mobile with a crying baby. </p>

<p>My point is this. As a &quot;junkie&quot;, I&#39;ve known a lot of street kids and dealers. The street network is very good way of getting information. </p>

<p>If the Pizzagate conspiracy theorists really believed something was going on the first place they should go to is the street kids and homeless of the cities and towns across Washington, Virginia, Maryland and surrounding states and simply straight out ask them if they were raped as children by politicians and lobbyist in Washington. </p>

<p>surely they can&#39;t have killed hundreds of raped children every year and not a single body ever being found. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where are the whistleblowers?, Disgusted cops and lawyers ordered to ignore and suppress the abuse? Families breaking their NDAs and so on? As far as I know, there are no whistleblowers for the pizzagate scandal specifically, but there have been many whistleblowers world wide talking about this. Many.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly that&#39;s my point there are have been whistle blowers about major conspiracies but none exist for Pizzagate. </p>
