        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why the hell are they censoring and trying to disprove any meaningful conversation about pizzag4te? What to protect a man who&#39;s apparently so influential that he&#39;s featured in a magazine?! Like what the fuck. The responsibile thing to do would be to admit your place of business has had some strange &quot;artwork&quot; and move on. </p>

<p>My frustrations aren&#39;t with people who don&#39;t believe it. You have that right to your own opinion. But nobody is sitting there mocking your opinions without giving you the opportunity to respond. This mad effort to disprove and kill the story has made me more motivated to dig deeper. So despite what you feel is real or not, these posts need to be afforded the same respect and scrutiny that is offered everywhere else. </p>

<p>No I don&#39;t have a tin hat on my head, no I&#39;m not 100% convinced but this is feeling like a stab at my free speech. Saying it&#39;s a witch-hunt and effecting real people is like saying you don&#39;t care about children and you believe everything you hear from your media source. It&#39;s trying to hide pedophiles. Regardless of if you think CPP is a victim, the bigger victim are the real children who have suffered through the hands of a pedophile. That&#39;s where this stems from and where my concerns rest.</p>

<p>That was the appeal I saw in Reddit. A chance for everyone to share their opinion and discuss. You do your own censorship, if you don&#39;t like the things you see on /all then gtfo. We can have all the porn and violence reach there but not discussion of something that apparently occurs far to often. </p>

<p>If you disagree with me, fucking great, I don&#39;t care. Don&#39;t get on Colberts high horse and mock people for having an opinion that this needs to be looked into more.</p>

<p>CensorGate is a better way to describe this recent shit storm. </p>

<p>Yep.  Very.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oh absolutely it does - in <em>everyone’s</em> eyes (or at least it very much <em>should</em> be in everyone’s eyes).  I mean you’re hiding, aiding, and abetting possible criminals of the worst order.  Are the CPP people <em>actual</em> pedophiles?  We don’t know.  I don’t think too many people are saying they are yet.  I’m certainly not.  However, there is most definitely enough impropriety for a serious investigation to be warranted into what the hell is going on there…and with the Podestas…and w/The Clinton Foundation, and w/that lady that worked for TCF who trafficked all kinds of Haitian children, got caught, and then changed her name and is now working for fucking <em>Amber Alerts</em> whose sole purpose is to warn against child traffickers (<em>WTF?</em>).  Forgot the bitches name.  Yeah.  There is <em>definitely</em> enough weirdness to warrant looking deeper into it all.</p>

<p>And anyone who keeps the further investigation into it all from taking place - on an issue that’s literally the absolute <em>most</em> important issue in the entire human species (the violating of our children)?…yeah.  Anyone obstructing an investigation into a possible criminal, pedophilia racket is themselves acting in a <em>very</em> criminal manner, and should be treated with according harshness, as far as I’m concerned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s protecting them!?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  And if you’re protecting criminals, then you’re “aiding and abetting” - which is itself a known crime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s reinforcing my beliefs that that there&#39;s something wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep - and I really hope many others are catching on and waking up to this as well.  Shit is <em>very</em> not right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s like they&#39;re using the brainwash gun but its not working so they just mock people to disprove them. Fuck that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  I’m starting to lose a bit of patience with the naysayers.  I came up with the following assessment, and I think it’s pretty accurate:</p>

<p>……</p>

<p>You are either:</p>

<p>A) A pedophile trying to deflect attention from the most vital, the most important epidemic on this planet in the hopes that your pederasty does not get discovered.</p>

<p>or you are:</p>

<p>B) A useful idiot that is so moronically oblivious to the mountain of very unbecoming information that exists that he does not understand or recognize how vitally important stopping the epidemic described above is, and in your criticism of those who choose to investigate this criminal epidemic, you unwittingly contribute to the demise of the human species itself.</p>

<p>Either option is pretty God damn abhorrent and should not be tolerated by anyone in <em>any</em> society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. And it&#39;s pretty damn apparent that history shows claims like this are proven real,  and today shows that it&#39;s pretty damn big. Take all the children in the TB found in Norway.. each one lives being altered w.o any sense of control. The people responsible for that should be stoned. Everyday. For the rest of their lives. Let them live and suffer. Death is too easy and quick. I&#39;d rather be proven wrong. I hate seeing previous evidence of this shit everywhere. That it exists and is a thing..  if CPP art being there had any other intentions other than sorrow for the victims it shouldn&#39;t be there. </p>

<p>Artwork from victims is their only outlet and owning it, discussing it in anything other than trying to stop more victims from being made, is just inexcusable.  Making suggestive jokes online is dumb and he should be investigated. But then turning around and playing victim.. when it&#39;s the community asking.. it&#39;s just discussing.</p>

<p>God.  <em>This</em> right here.  You just basically laid out in one sentence the best counterargument against what so many fucking stupid, useful idiot fuckwits say:  &quot;Durrr!  You don&#39;t know what kind of bad press you&#39;re giving this poor pizza shop just by <em>alleging</em> that they&#39;re into pedo practices!&quot;</p>

<p>I wanna say Motherfuckers...do you useful idiot pieces of shit even <em>know</em> what you&#39;re saying?  Do you know what the possible implications are of actually NOT investigating an establishment or person that in point of fact very much <em>looks</em> like they may be involved in pedophile activity?</p>

<p>Are you fucking SERIOUS?</p>

<p>Yeah.  I&#39;m glad some of these conversations are taking place over the internet and not in person, cuz I might be liable to <em>really</em> go off on someone if somebody actually attempted to make that actual argument in person.</p>

I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about or who did that, but there are a LOT more people looking into this that very much <em>don&#39;t</em> do that, so that you or whoever else single out those particular individuals that call out for murdering others <em>before</em> it&#39;s found out whether others are violating minors or not is just pretty bad thinking on your part.</p>

<p>If someone in point of fact <em>is</em> violating minors, however?  Then yeah.  Those violators should be ended in the worst possible way.  And those defending the protecting the violators?  I&#39;m not sure they don&#39;t deserve much better.</p>
