<p>It seems these people are in  some panic mode that Trump will become President. Maybe they fear that Trump will really have a look into some of the terrible secrets they are trying to hide. Maybe they know <strong>they could all be executed for what they have done</strong> if they&#39;re exposed.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah people have been talking about some plan of Obama to remain in office and institute marshal law and even I thought that sounded ridiculous at the time. But what&#39;s this about a new election? Let Barry O stay in the white house &quot;just until the new election is over, we swear&quot;, knowing full well kicking Trump out will mobilize the most radical gun owners on the right, leading to a need for large scale police/military intervention. This unrest would likely disrupt the new election under way, allowing Obama to stay in office &quot;just until the &#39;domestic terrorists&#39; are put down, and we can continue the election, we swear&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, not quite.
Before the electoral college (and even in current law, if no candidate reaches 270 electoral votes), each state counted/counts as 1 vote. Whoever wins the most states wins the election. The electoral college actually gives those more densely populated areas (liberal states) more influence. A direct democracy was never seriously considered by our founding fathers, and was certainly never implemented or intended to be implemented.</p>

<p>Lot of shadow banning going on. </p>

<p>I noticed this yesterday on politics in a threatening post from the mods. Half of my comments were shadowbanned, only I could see them, even though they were all within the rules except perhaps one where someone claimed I was crying wolf and responded he was with the wolf. Seems pretty minor to me but was removed.</p>

<p>Here many of these comments are invisible if you&#39;re logged off.</p>

<p>But you righties are about to get your wish. Politics is about to return to a Trump adoring sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m not aware of that though I&#39;m willing for it to be investigated along with the general election. I want honest vote counting at every point. And Michigan was fixed for Trump, that&#39;s why it&#39;s so messed up.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing evil about Clinton, at least not compared to any republican. I didn&#39;t like her actions in Libya and Syria but Obama was the boss, not her. But even that was pretty minor compared to the wars, murderers and massacres under the Bushes. Other than that I can&#39;t think or anything else she&#39;s done that&#39;s close to evil. And she&#39;s a saint compared to Trump. Old people and poor people wouldn&#39;t have to worry about losing their health care and pensions under Clinton. Women wouldn&#39;t have to worry about being forced to carry babies they didn&#39;t want. And on and on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah your rant is hard to take seriously. But you know it came out that she pushed for the war in Libya and Obama was originally against it, right? She was found to have pushed for the war in Libya so that in the future when she ran for president she could claim she had a successful war as head of secretary of state. Only problem is that it was a disaster because she has no idea wtf she is doing, and she left Americans to die in the midst of it. 50,00 or so people died in an unnecessary war so hillary could have more leverage in a presidential run.</p>

<p>So here is the deal - you are never likely to see hard proof. The amount of info CrowdStrike was allowed to release is already miles ahead of what almost any other similar forensic investigation is allowed to make public. I&#39;ve done a number of these for some very large entities, and the most I&#39;ve ever been allowed to say is &quot;we&#39;re investigating a potential incident&quot;. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had incidents where I was all but positive who was responsible, but the FBI would not allow us to publicly attribute it because there was still a margin of doubt. If the NSA (and many other independent researchers) are willing to say &quot;Yes, this was Russia,&quot; you can bet your ass they have a mountain of evidence behind that.</p>

<p>CrowdStrike are some of the very best in the business and were the ones responding to the DNC hack. Here is the evidence they were cleared to provide publicly:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/">https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bear-hunting-tracking-cozybear-backdoors/">https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bear-hunting-tracking-cozybear-backdoors/</a></p>

<p>(Again, keep in mind there is nothing nefarious about not sharing these details publicly. You will find very few entities that suffered a hack willing to allow responders to make even this much public.)</p>

<p>Additionally there is a good deal of evidence (technical, social, and circumstantial) that Guccifer 2.0 is an identity created by the Russian intelligence services to keep eyes off of them.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-0-dnc-breach/">https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-0-dnc-breach/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-all-roads-lead-russia/">https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-all-roads-lead-russia/</a></p>

<p>Lastly, there is this report from SecureWorks:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign">https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign</a></p>

<p>These are three highly respected, independent sources all arriving at the same conclusion. To date I have not been able to find any credible sources that have had access to the details of the cases that have come to any other conclusion. If every independent professional investigating the breaches comes to the same conclusion, you can be pretty certain the evidence is all but overwhelming - whether or not you are authorized to see it yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>PFFT all that mumbo jumbo comes from a bunch of &quot;intellectual experts.&quot; There&#39;s a reason Trump is replacing all the experts in our government with corporate interests. Experts and their &quot;knowledge&quot; are just a bunch of LIBRULS! We need <em>real</em> leaders who are entirely motivated by increasing their own personal wealth!</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to take a leaf out of Trump&#39;s book tell you go give me a source from some <em>real</em> corporate approved experts who made a bunch of money from what they wrote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s assumable is what it is, to be expected. It&#39;s called geopolitics. That&#39;s not to say a foreign government was successful, because I don&#39;t think it affected much at all.</p>

<p>Clinton defeated herself. The media got &#39;the pulse&#39; wrong and took audiences for granted. People wanted good reason to vote against another political dynasty and the media was doing everything to avoid providing it. So, people took to the internet to learn about emails, the CF..to watch Trey Gowdy, for instance, make an absolute jackass out of her. </p>

<p>People talked, even if they were embarrassed in real social situations to admit their thoughts, the online communities allowed things to blossom into a bunch of reasons to vote for anyone but her. </p>

<p>I think the very site I&#39;m typing this on had more to do with Trump winning than Russia.</p>
