       Don't politicize this shit. PizzaGate, in it's current form, holds a heavily politicized connotation (anti-Cunton - DNC - Democrat). Revisit with evidence of this shit happening within the RNC, as well (Boy's Town - Bush/Reagan call boys). This is why PG is getting rejected so hard. People are still buying into the two party paradigm. It has nothing to do with parties, views, ideologies, per se. But sick fucks in the ruling elite (political class). PG needs to be re-branded, imo. This is coming from someone who knows a shit tonne about marketing and a "conspiracy theorist"...
      </p>
      <p>
       This is about following leads, wherever they are, in order to bring justice and possibly save lives from these sick fuckers. Re-frame it, as not politicized, but epidemic in the elite class for profit/blackmail...
      </p>
      <p>
       My two cents..

       This is my thing with Pizzagate, is that there have been a lot of accusations of this sort before....on both sides. Yet no investigation and other mysterious happenings that people write off as coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a real thing that is happened, and I agree that the two party midset is whats keeping these fuckers in power.

       Don't tell people specifics that are likely to cause very real psychological trauma.  A lot of the stuff associated with PizzaGate is really horrible, and unless said information is being used for the purpose of bringing charges or making arrests, there is no point in immersing either yourself or them in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important point that you need to make with anyone, is that the institutions which they currently rely on, are not to be trusted.  Letting people know that politicians are paedophiles, by itself, is as specific as you need to get in 99% of cases; the rest will just horrify and distress people and cause them to view you as a lunatic in order to protect themselves.  That is the main reason why people are so resistant to accepting this, because of how awful it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the primary goal should again be reducing/removing mainstream trust in the existing institutions, so that said institutions can be replaced and run by people with genuine integrity.  The objective should not be to needlessly shock people purely for its' own sake.

       I think I have been traumatized. EVERY SINGLE time I see a child or a picture of one on Facebook or something I question whether they have been compromised.  And I think about the parents , if I know them, would they be capable of doing that or putting the child in a situation like that? It's a fleeting thing that passes my mind, but still disturbing nonetheless.  I hope it will eventually go away

       It's shitty that this person waited until you were at work to voice his opinion and go on the attack about something you'd put on FB. The upside is he's shown you who he is, so believe him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let the situation sit for a few days and give some thought to how you've been treated simply because you have a different perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       The onus isn't on you to fix this. If there's any type of relationship to be salvaged, even if it's only that of co-workers, it's on the person who attacked to apologise. For now, keep being your awesome self and let him feel the loss. You can't fix it because you didn't break it.

       What if somebody considers you completely blind?  Maybe an Islamic Scientologist thinks you need to "Get Clear with the Prophet"?  Maybe a Hollow Mooner thinks you need to wake the fuck up?  Maybe a National Security Nazi thinks you need to do what you're told?  Are you helping pedo victims by getting in the faces of people who have no preparation or context for what you're talking about?  Why weren't you interested in pedo-rings before Pizzagate, since they have been around for decades if not centuries?

       Don't talk about it at work. Just tell him he's probably right. There's going to be some people that don't want to talk about it and are very triggered by it. I would avoid bringing it up.

       You do you man. Not everybody is going to agree with you, the same thing happened to me (my dad) and he just got soo angry! 
It's ok to have your beliefs questioned, how else would we come to our own conclusions. It seems like he is the one targeting you (i hate facebook, don't have it and would never add my boss or older workmates lol the horror). Maybe this is more a lesson on keeping personal and work separate so you arnt unnecessarily targeted. Just be polite you are still the same person!

       That's most likely a dude that will NEVER change his mind on it then. No matter what you said. Just tell him that it's all circumstantial and don't engage him on it. Not worth the argument at work.

       Literally don't even bother. If someone flips out on you for having a different idea, opinion, etc... they aren't capable of having an actual discussion or debate and will not under any circumstances change their mind. If you push them further they will actually double down on their ideology even when you bring facts/proof to them because that's just how narrow minded human like animals are.

       Then, sadly, you have to lose all respect for him as well. Because you're the one with an open mind and brave enough to confront this horror--because even if PG is overblown, the truth of a power structure rooted in sexual child abuse and murder is not.

       I would be careful. You never know he could be into CP and panicing. One thing I'm learning through PizzaGate is the amount of people into pedo stuff is significantly higher than I ever thought possible. Either way its usually not a good idea to be FB friends with people you work with

       People calling it fake news don't realize the whole thing was kicked off from podesta emails. They only know msm says it's fake. Msm doesn't explain shit, they're too busy trying to hide facts and talk shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest I don't know for sure that these people in question are pedos. I know that pedos exist and other stories have come out in recent years about how there is a pedo network operating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I think pizza gate has enough evidence to convict podesta or anyone else? 
No, not yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will the truth be uncovered if they are pedos?
Hopefully, but maybe through another means like clinton foundation or some other source that hasn't been found or considered yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If nothing else explain how msm calling out fake news is bullshit - they were reporting fake poll results for the whole election cycle.

       Don't bother. I gave up trying to reason with ignorant people many years ago. Just bare in mind it's generally not their fault they are ignorant. They are conditioned by mainstream society to be ignorant and are far too reliant on the system to see it any other way. Many of us were ignorant too at one stage. Try not to take it personally

       Anyone I've talked to about it, I've left clinton out of it for the most part.  I've focused on the fact that this type of thing has happened, and with the recent busts around the world, it's easy to show that it's still happening, and if you then tie it to the media cover ups associated with it, you've set the stage for the acceptance of it without ever mentioning clinton or the dnc.
