       Yep. This was fairly clear during the election... while Trump supporters were aggressively demanding that heads roll for some of these scandals, the actual Republican leaders were eerily silent on the issue despite the fact that exploiting the scandals to their fullest extent would have yielded more congressional seats.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past, either party has been quick to exploit whatever weakness they could and crank up the pressure until bones began to break and ligaments tore... this year? None of that. With the exception of a few people, no one touched the biggest scandals within the WikiLeaks information. The implication being that any scandal that touched BOTH parties was deemed off limits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump himself went pretty far with some of this stuff, which is curious being that his name also shows up in the flight logs with Epstein and Mar a Lago is literally down the street from Epstein's own home... my guess is that he was just baiting the Clinton camp to bring that up because he knows that whatever dirt they can hit him with would be followed by an enormous mudslide directed back at them regarding Epstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's still shocking to me that the American people and journalists (even non-MSM ones) are willing to overlook a major child sex scandal because their own party/candidates may be involved. Like, what the fuck guys?

       The silver lining here is if you put your trust in FBIAnon.  Just like you said, Trump may get in trouble for donating to CF or for ties to Epstein, but FBIAnon alluded to no real evidence of any Trump pedo stuff.  I'm skeptical myself, but I do believe FBIAnon is legit.  For those that haven't read FBIAnon, you owe it to yourself to do so -

       I doubted at first, but now I'm an FBIAnon-acolyte myself, so I'll just endorse that link there :)  I've read his/her posts multiple times over the duration of the election cycle and every time I read it I become more convinced s/he was legit.

       Republicans have nothing to gain with aggressiveness. They control all three branches of government. Any big move has the potential to hurt them without any cost. Benefits simply don't out weigh the risk.

       Most unfortunately law enforcement is now rather politicized, so even fbi actions might be suppressed for the same reasons.

       I don't know much about the situation, but I think Trump can be forgiven for not knowing what he was getting himself into if he only went one time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he learned of something sinister, perhaps he can't be forgiven for keeping it quiet if he stumbled that sinister thing, but I am vaguely aware he kicked Epstein out of one of the establishments he owns for being a pervert. Maybe Trump intended to wait until he has the power of the presidency to drop the hammer. Maybe he'll take it to the grave. I can only hope he's truly a proponent of justice.

       Even still, maybe he didn't know what he could have done about it even if he knew about it. These guys get away with everything and their enemies end up suicided. Maybe Trump figured it was better not to die for nothing by stirring the hornets nest that owns the courts.

       Why would they. Everything legit involving pizza gate can be tied back and confirmed through the wikileak emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing ties President Clinton or Epstein to this through wikileaks.

      <p>
       The
       <em>
        real

       question is why is MSM pushing that Hillary is the target, when pizza gate really has little to do with her either. Is it because the mass3s sympathize with her loss, where if it was people they never heard of they would be outraged?

       Because if it looks like an attack on Hillary people immediately write it off as political. Your average person I mean. We just got over the messy election so they're trying to pitch it as an election story to smear her. As a result, people assume it's bullshit from the 'alt-right' and not regular citizens.

       It doesn't help that it was spread almost exclusively by Trump supporters before the election, was talked about every day on the Trump subreddit before the election, and is seen as credible almost exclusively by fringe right wing media outlets.

       Yeah - I get that. I think instead of focusing on the person talking about something, we should always examine the quality of their idea or the accusation.

       Or course pro-Hillary news and groups don't want to indict their own leader.

       It's like saying a murderer can't report another murderer or he's seen less than credible because he himself is a murderer. If the murder happened, investigate it.

       Precisely. They're also exclusively calling it "alt-right", when i'm very sure most people that are really involved consistently here are of many different political affiliations.

       It's because they now have an easily-dismissed conspiracy theory, which has been solidly mocked in the MSM news, and even in the late night talk shows at this point, and it comes complete with its own cute little hashtag!
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were more cynical than I already am, I would think that the 4chan "code words" were placed deliberately after the Podesta Wikileaks, just because they knew that they could count on everyone whipping themselves into a frenzy over them.  When it turns out to be a big pile of shit (which, rest assured, it will), they have a handy scapegoat for any allegations of child trafficking leveled against TPTB.

       I've been following this since it broke, and I've watched the narrative go from:
      </p>
      <p>
       "PODESTA AND ALEFANTIS ARE FUCKING AND EATING BABIES IN THAT PIZZA SHOP, AND POSSIBLY SERVING THEM ON THE PIZZA"
      </p>
      <p>
       to:
      </p>
      <p>
       "THEY
       <strong>
        CLEARLY
       </strong>
       RUN CHILDREN THROUGH THERE, AT A MINIMUM"
      </p>
      <p>
       to:
      </p>
      <p>
       "THAT ARTWORK PROVES THAT
       <strong>
        SOMETHING
       </strong>
       IS UP THERE"
      </p>
      <p>
       to:
      </p>
      <p>
       "THIS PLACE IS
       <strong>
        NOT
       </strong>
       FAMILY-FRIENDLY, AS ADVERTISED"
      </p>
      <p>
       to, finally, today:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Alefantis needs to apologize, and explain those Instagram pics if he wants to clear this all up."
      </p>

       Perhaps in the pic tagged as "chickenlovers" it was because they both like chicken on their pizza. Or just like chicken. it's a damned restaurant, for god's sake.

       Listen mate they're just focusing on the fact that this random-ass pizza place is now a hotspot for terrorist attacks and death threats because it's ridiculous. I'm sure there's other shit involved in your conspiracy butt it's too big to to fit in a quick 4 inch news article.

       yeah and my mom lived in the same apartment building as John Kerry back when she lived in Boston two decades ago (that's actually true, unlike pizzagate). Does that make her a part of this conspiracy? Ever heard the phrase "correlation does not equal causation"?

       If pedos were actually "going down" I'd be ecstatic, but instead you guys are making a ton of noise out of nothing that isn't going to go anywhere. There are much more productive ways to help fight sex trafficking and pizzagate is NOT one of them.
