       I know there were posts about the Petro Dollar going to collapse and nothing essentially happened with that as far as I know. And there's Pizzagate which the media is declaring as fake news. But whether its gonna be an assassination, market crash, a giant leak, or world war 3, I just feel like something big is gonna happen more than what's going on? I just can't shake this feeling. Was wondering of anybody else is feeling this. (Hopefully it wont.)

       "You think its a coincidence that Trump has surrounded himself with former generals? It’s like bodyarmor for him. The former usurper elite have been usurped themselves, and unlike those whom they previously displaced(who ceded with grace), this elite is anything but graceful.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will try to stage a coup if they can. Problem for them is that in any coup, the armed forces hold the key. Trump is beloved among the army and he is now consolidating the brass around him. Yet, the Deep State hasn’t given up hope."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Agreed; the CIA and FBI have shown signs just this year of being openly hostile to Trump—the CIA in the last few days implicating Russia, and the FBI/Comey in covering up Hillary’s crimes. A coup attempt by those agencies acting jointly is not out of the question, especially since Holder’s ATFE also is likely to be on their side (the ATFE ran guns for Holder, in the infamous Fast and Furious scandal).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, the armed forces throughout history has not been a strong bulkwark against coups. Military men usually fall into line after a changing of the guard; whether that’s from the personalities of soldiers (duty to the leader, whoever he is) or just the self-preservation tactics of military leaders, that’s for others to figure out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Roman army did nothing to stop the various palace coups that went on during the empire, merely switching allegiances to whoever was in power. Sometimes they’d run their own coups as well, but they’d never stop a coup.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then the Soviets and Nazis and Spanish had their secret police keep the armies from revolting during their coups and purges.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, don’t trust our armies to protect us from our secret police; it just never pans out that way, sadly."

       Believe it or not, Trump isn't "beloved" by the military, but is definitely favored over Hillary. Surprisingly, Gary Johnson has the military vote by a landslide. Something like 70% of the military favored Johnson, last time I checked.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I was very wrong about the number, but very right about the point.

       Really, where do you get your 70% for Johnson?? Better check again. Last I checked, Trump got 61% of the military vote. (

       My bad, that was an off-the-top-of-my-head number because I was mobile and didn't have the time to look it up and that number came to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't 70%, but Gary Johnson

        the most popular candidate among active duty

       (by about 8% in that poll).

        Here's another poll from a more recent date

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I think I got the 70% number by remembering that Trump polled at around 30% with the military and just wrote off Hillary completely.

       I haven't seen the 70% number, but I have seen loads of pre-election polls that had Gary Johnson just ahead of Trump with them both just shy of 40% and Clinton in the low teens.

       I think this is a really important question.
      </p>
      <p>
       My interpretation is that they've lost control to some degree and they know it. And, "The best way to control the opposition is to lead it."
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think they're getting the foundation of any revolutions set up in a format they can control and predict, that way they can ride out the revolution without losing control. That's why the Anon mask became a CIA thing. That's why the Ron Paul revolution was diverted in to the Tea Party. That's why Bernie Sanders and his base was diverted in to Hillary Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't control everything, so to gain control of the things they don't yet control, they try to lead them by using power and blending in with an existing crowd and taking it over like pied piper

       may even be subconscious normalisation,... but yeah pay attention and you'll see a LOT of things - movies, t.v., radio, even adverts, there's so much shit if you just open your eyes and your mind... and you can say "oh your just making links where you want to see them", but your subconscious brain is doing it too, which is the point entirely.

       two things I want to point out: 1) the opposition was being supplied by our other enemies; if world government is the next step and all global leadership is in on the scheme, there will be no one supplying the insurgents and chances are the technology is there to cripple us without firing a shot; 2) you are assuming we would have the organization to offer any resistance- Americans are so fragmented and us against them strategy would be impossible.

       Those are some good points.  Definitely problems to be overcome.  I have a feeling that there will be a polarizing event that will bring everyone together.  Government-wide child trafficking and sexual abuse would do it.

       I just recalled a point someone made before about the drug war.  The government can't even stop the flow of drugs into prisons.  How can they stop the flow of drugs into the US if they can't stop them from going into prisons?  It is not possible.  The drug war is lost.  It is not winnable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same thing with weapons, or anything else.  If weapons are outlawed, then a black market will be created and weapons will be smuggled in.  It will be unstoppable.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is especially true if there is a revolution.  There will be money to be made by supplying weapons and ammunition, so they will be available.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there will be people in the military and law enforcement who are secretly against the government.  They will be very, very useful.

       If CNN, NBC, ABC, and the rest can convince Americans that Russians rigged the election and in many other ways, I just don't see any resistance gaining any traction. The men behind the curtain want nothing more than a manageable bunch and with 7 billion useless eaters squatting on their land, a combination of tactics will be most likely used to make things more agreeable. I will venture a guess and say that a nice Plum Island super-virus combined with a series of inside-job "terrorist" EMP strikes will stoke the flames of herd thinning. Cities would see less than 10% survival rates. The black market will be alive as we have seen in other civil wars, but technology has reached a point where long guns are no match and there's no way to hide (all-seeing eye) even if you shoot your way to the mountains. This is not to say I'd want to be around when their plans come to fruition: I think a bullet to the head would be a more preferable option.

       I see.  Yes, I have read that the Illuminati want to thin the herd by quite a bit, and are already doing so.  Hiding in plain sight, and doing damage whenever you can is another option.  Sort of like The Monkey Wrench Gang.

       No, that's not correct. I haven't frequented
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       or read much of anything about the stuff that's going on currently, but I can feel an over all feeling of foreboding. I have noticed and tried to make my close family and friends aware of how certain things are shoved down our throats. I.E.; alcohol-i have noticed more and more ads and an sense that societal alcoholism is acceptable...women drinking copious amounts of wine, beer ads everywhere you turn around, deviant behavior-more and more television shows portraying heinous acts, super close to torture porn but is becoming mainstream entertainment, certain "comediennes"-spotlighting terrible behavior and making it acceptable to become a lowlife. Our society (at least here in the USA) are becoming brainless jellyfish. Some of us that are aware of the small things are now piecing it together to see a very frightening and real "big thing" on the horizon that is just out of clear view. I too am under the belief that something is going to happen. And to think that stepping away from your computer is going to keep it from happening...is false logic.

       Soooo, you've noticed trends. They happen. I came to reddit 9 years ago for this sub and I always felt like "they" were out to get us. "They're" not, but they sure as shit don't give a single fuck about you. " the world isn't out to get you, my dear. It just doesn't care".

       I feel it also.  Just imagine how many powerful people were made promises by the Clinton's and gang.  They never considered that she could possibly lose.  Those promises and favors still stand even is she doesn't, at the very least there are powerful &amp; angry people... worldwide.

       Yes, something is coming. I don't know what. But there will at best be massive civil unrest, at worst civil war.

       They are going to make a try for the electors. If that fails, we will probably see a false flag on Christmas or New Years. Followed by martial law or war with Russia, or both. If that fails they already gearing up for violent protests at the inauguration.

       I always felt that this is simply the calm before the storm and sooner or later Revolution in America, World War III, then mass purges will occur. Unless if the world and especially the American populace were mostly awakened against the mainstream lies.

       You're not crazy. I started feeling the shift around 2 years ago. The energy all around is very frantic. 2017 is sure to be an absolute shit show. I don't know what exactly it is that's on the horizon, but I think a lot of people who are ignoring this shift in the atmosphere will be waking up to it very soon. Automation, AI, Trump, Wikileaks, corruption exposed, gender and sexuality essentially losing all meaning, people losing trust in the media, some people even losing trust in the Internet, just to name a few. Some people's entire concept of reality and their identity are based on what these things are challenging and exposing. Once the curtain is fully pulled back and all is undeniably exposed, chaos will ensue.

       Same. Some shit is going down in 2017. They'll use some huge distraction to keep the focus off their imminent exposure. Perfect time for "alien" disclosure or civil war or some shit...

       Yes I do. It'll take a while for it to sink amongst Trump's supporters that they have been shafted and thrown under the bus. He isn't going to "Lock her up" and he isn't going to "Drain the swamp". He isn't going to "Make America Great Again" either. Then there will be trouble.

       We need to start planning for that scenario.

       The establishment lost a lot of money and power between Brexit and Trump. Whether this was planned or not is up in the air as far as I'm concerned.

       Either way its our job to be consistently reminding everyone of the corruption they saw this election.

       I've been feeling a looming disaster since January 10, but I'm not so sure anymore. I think the "event" might just be everything that's already happening, perhaps accelerating a bit more towards some climax or anti-climax.

       I know this is kinda unrelated, with a focus on politics here, but I'm just sharing information. And shit, if it comes true, I'll be glad I posted this comment. But I have also had a sense of unrest/unease/anxiousness about something big happening and it has been steadily growing over the last few months. I have heard other people saying the same/similar things.

       Specifically referring to nuclear war, yes, it's stupid.  Barring certain parts of the US, you're either going to be just plain dead or slowly die in your bunker basement.  If you're talking earthquakes (no, I'm not from LA), if the building you're in goes down you're going to have a couple days pinned in rubble hoping for an emergency rescue; you're not going to be getting to your stash of MREs.  If there's some kind of land war in the US stockpiled food will be the least of your worries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuff like this is at best playing on consumer desire to maintain a false sense of security.  So yes, it's stupid to go to Costco and buy a crate of emergency rations.

       Also: I live alone, I already have food in my cupboards, and I'm aware of the likelihood of various disasters and my odds.  At no point does "bunker down in my house for a month eating canned beans" work out to be a wining scenario.  In the case of a disaster or emergency you will either a fine, dead, or in a situation so fucked up as to be miles over your pay grade.

       On a related note, I have never had a more interesting time than when I was listening to the local radio (national guard, etc) due to one of the radio repeaters mirroring to the internet.  I still remember one night when a fuel transport was getting ambushed under gunfire.

       Bond market crash (the bond market is worth much more than the stock market). A bond market crash could see the end of a major currency (USD, EUR, JPY or GBP) as these are the currencies denominating a large portion of the market. A crash of a major currency would spark financial chaos making 2008 seem like a meer blip. This is the crisis that should have happened then but the elites implimented QE, ZIRP etc to kick the can.

       Yeah they won't let a financial meltdown happen. False flags and war are about the only way outta this it seems. Iran? That's my guess. Pakistan also. Perhaps the US stages a FF on Indian soil and we have "no choice" but to turn it into one big crater.

       Just like they didn't let it happen in 2007 and 1987? They don't control everything, and also financial crashes can be used to profit and control people so they might do it intentionally if they see that's the way things are headed anyway.

       Well we've been callimg for the elites power grab for months, but the opposite has happened. Maybe your big event isn't against us, but against them. Brexit was the first signal, and personally the damage control from elites was so outlandish that they exposed themselves and said "Hillary Clinton will fix this", and they exposed themselves once more trying desperately to get her elected. Low and behold they exposed themselves again by attacking rather then welcoming. Now the elite have to worry about the crumbling EU, and if a big false flag attack happens it will be another back fored plan. They are exposed, and weak as they lose their power, and desperate attempts to grab it back will expose them further.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look for another French (poor France) false flag opperation leading up to their elections. Look for them to be exposed as a false flag operation. Desperate people making desperate actions make a lot of mistakes. The only thing a failed uncovered false flag attack would do is assure a Le Pen victory and insure another nail in the coffin for the global elite.

       It already is taking place. The United States Senate on December 1 did indeed pass the "Anti-Semitism Awareness Act". You should look at it:

       You're telling me. I'm only 20 and quite recently is when I started to see things as they really are; MSM being full of propaganda and fake news, the government passing legis. basically breaching certain constitution amendments, Pizzagate, this past election, wikileaks and Assange recently, the list goes on. I've been so paranoid and anxiety ridden for the past year because of all this and it feels like it keeps escalating. something definitely is going to happen. I would say either a government coup here in the US or another world war. If not another world war, then some serious shit is going to go down with Pizzagate or wikileaks. Only time will tell though.

       not sure what to think about trump's picks or his refusal to show up for intel breifings.
      </p>
      <p>
       picks like jeff sessions, the goldman guy, and the exxon guy for 3 of the most important slots, are very staus quo (though i tip my hate at the big oil pick for state...finally no subterfuge about who our state dept really works for...well played).
      </p>
      <p>
       but even so, i haven't been this uneasy since i was 10 and the doomsday clock went to the closest to midnight ever in 1984, 3 minutes to midnight (we've been quietly back up to 3 minutes for a couple of years now).
      </p>
      <p>
       if you take all of the discrete bits of information about many seemingly unrelated issues, the picture points to WWIII and martial law...we've been an inverted totalitarian fascist state for some time now, with our very own jack booted parimiltary police depts.
      </p>
      <p>
       they don't go for the racial and ethnic minorities intially...the always go for the dissidents--the left and right libertarians. they've already branded us and targeted our most vocal and visible news and analyis sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       yeah, i'm scared.
      </p>
      <p>
       disclosure: i'm far left and far south libertarian left on the political compass, no friend of either major political party.

       Investment advice is tough and honest people always say - I cannot predict the future, I only have an opinion. Use your own head.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, if you have 401k, you could move stocks into a "money market account". It earns you almost nothing but you should not lose much, for it is a very short-term fixed income instrument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I recommend getting physical metals anonymously. David Seaman and Mike Maloney and Peter Schiff have talked about this at length.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is a food angle - if you have extra money, buy 3 months worth of food that you will eat and will not go bad. If nothing happens, you will just eat it. Buying a supply of food is a form of savings. Yes, it could spoil, so you need to learn the dos and donts, but if done correctly, it is an investment. When you buy in bulk, you save money.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also want to have some amount of free cash sitting around - at least 1 month's worth of expenses, jsut in case the ATMs stop working.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting a few guns and learning how to use them might be a good idea. It is not for everyone for some people are more responsible / organized than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       One could also take a penalty and pull some or all of their 401k out prematurely.
      </p>
      <p>
       That might be a bad idea. Other than precious metals, there are few things that you want to invest in when at the top of the bubble. Real estate should be a good steal when the market bottoms out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Growing your own food, permaculture, agorism,
       <a href="https://freedomcells.coeo.cc/">
        Freedom cells
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://getcell411.com/">
        https://getcell411.com/
       </a>
       are all good ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe moving you and your assets abroad (yes, quite radical).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot that one can do. Some of the steps will be smart, some of the steps will be wrong. Got to use one's head.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am certain of is that not everyone can be saved. Some humans are like fruit flies - reproduce at a rapid pace while the food is present and do not think about the future. You can't help them. I tried and I gave up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And additional ideas - you can try renting out your car on Turo.com and your room on Air B&amp;B.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to try to outrun the collapse :) Good luck.

       Becoming a Swiss citizen is not a bad idea but it is very tough to do so and takes forever.

       They won't talk much about speculative things like a market crash and they will not discuss things like not paying taxes. Even working for cash is technically illegal and cannot be discussed there. That said, these guys are pretty good at credit score tips, some laws, answering questions, advice on budget planning, etc. It is a huge community.

       Pizzagate has the potential to bring down corruption in the system in general. That is a huge event taking place its just being made to look irrelevant. If we don't shut up and keep digging and connect new evidence with old like Ted Gunderson former fbi. Look into him. We can all be apart of killing the bullshit in to days system. They got most keeping their heads down tho or they're hooked on a drug. Shuts going down right now man don't wait for a big event you're livin in it.

        Marina Abramovic has ties to Rasputin.

       Rasputin's death was on December 30, 1916. Maybe the occult elite will do something to mark the 100th anniversary on December 30th, 2016?

       There will probably be another big terrorist event sometime during Trumps presidency. Within the first two years. Especially since he was very determined to end Isis, so there is that. It's only logical to assume there will be some event in retaliation to this agenda. Or a false flag to further the cause.

       <li>
        <strong>
         Plan C
        </strong>
        : 12/19 plan B Fails because too many people are aware of it; the electors defy them; Trump installs protective forces; whitehats in CIA/NSA/FBI inhibit this from happening.  So Plan C is where another huge false flag that takes us into a red-level emergency, a war with Russia.
        <br/>
        <ul>
         <li>
          We nuke ourselves with a mini nuke in charleston or something and blame it on russia. We already tried this once and Alex Jones stopped it.
         </li>
         <li>
          We attack our own powergrid in the middle of winter.  Many people suffer and die from the cold.  Russia or North Korea is blamed.  Or the Sun itself.  Beware of "space weather events", this means we get hit by a supermassive solar flare and it takes down google, even though we know google had already planned for massive solar flare attacks as far back as 2008.
         </li>
         <li>
          Another Shooting blamed on ALT Right.  This time they've upped the ante and actually killed a few people. It will be late-christmas shoppers on the 12/24 and they will be mostly poor, working class black people scrambling to get the latest kids whatever.  A shooter will gun them down at like say a target or walmart.  It will encite a huge race war
         </li>
         <li>
          Obama will suspend Trump's inauguration to deal with a) War, b) Riots, c) Space weather events, d) Grid collapse

          At this point, they may bust out holograms and have the UFO show up.  No really they might do this.

       <li>
        <strong>
         Plan D
        </strong>
        : As a result of Pizzagate, INTERPOL and the UN may march on US soil and take all these elites to the Hague by boat in a supermassive pedo bust.  This will all be staged.  They will go to Antarctica, or they will go to an island that is an entrance to a breakaway civilization where they will go and eat lobster and rape the 33,000 children they've 'saved up' in Spartacus Undersea, a deep undersea, gay pedo rape wonderland where they eat lobster, drink champagne and rape children all day.  Of course, there are the monarchs too, that love being gangbanged by poltical elites while twerking on top of pizza, but at one point in their lives, they were crying as boiling water was poured into their genitals also.  That's the day Miley Cyrus and Katie Perry and Madonna and Prince, etc were born.  Their pizzaday if you will.

       Saturn lining up with the Earth, moon and Mars with CERN in the middle to shoot our atmosphere all over it I'm guessing. Again, this is my crazy theory right now I have bad feelings about but no substantiation. Just stuff like NASA asking Kubrick to change Saturn to Jupiter in 2001, stuff like that sticks with me and it seems to line up with certain current events
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think a lot about what CERN does. The God Particle is the one atom in the whole universe being constantly crushed by all others simultaneously. If you "see" it or "capture" it, you're trying to momentarily contain the source of all light in the universe, essentially. And its built by Nordics, and they get everything right. Right?..

       I just recalled a point someone made before about the drug war.  The government can't even stop the flow of drugs into prisons.  How can they stop the flow of drugs into the US if they can't stop them from going into prisons?  It is not possible.  The drug war is lost.  It is not winnable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same thing with weapons, or anything else.  If weapons are outlawed, then a black market will be created and weapons will be smuggled in.  It will be unstoppable.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is especially true if there is a revolution.  There will be money to be made by supplying weapons and ammunition, so they will be available.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there will be people in the military and law enforcement who are secretly against the government.  They will be very, very useful.
