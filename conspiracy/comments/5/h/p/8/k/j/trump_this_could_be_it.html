<p>Edit: incompetent examples, basically what he puts on twitter or how he responds to events or whats going on, his vague responses to anything thats going on which had a flavor of pandering to an audience, his appointments for his office, and not to
mention his questionable ceo appointments. Like i had hopes for economy growth in his business like sense, but if you need to take advice from other probably more ruthless than you, no one wins. There are tons of other examples. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US became empire a long time ago.    We have had emperors,  sequentially appointed,  ever since.    Elections have been a farce of sorts.    The media has been used to control the choices,  only this time,  Trump wasn&#39;t supposed to get as far as he did.    He was vetted compared to the candidates that were more highly acceptable to have been the pawns of the real movers.     But now that Trump&#39;s cabinet is being announce,   we can see that the movers are still holding their sway.    Long live the emperor,  who is really more of a puppet on a string.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually im broke asf. Im also super fucking ill. Im also on my own. I know or have known people that make this shit look like a cake walk. I dont care because i know shit that makes anyone quiver in their boots. But im looking at whats in the light. The biggest stories, trump, etc. it leads a direction, a solid direction either for civil unrest or for things happening. I look at trump and wonder where the hell im going to live, afford, taxes, bills, job, health, etc. at the same time, if the government does fail or go into lock down, that does affect my state. Im not a freedom fighter, nor am i wealthy. I have connections of sorts, but my personal plans depend on everything.  Immediately and moderately i need to know whats going on with the presidency and policies, medium term or at least an idea of policies canceling or chance of cancelling ie obamacare etc. i need to know his competence level so i mention what ive noticed and see if anyone else has noticed the same. Then for time up to and may be a little past his inauguration, i need to see what the underground either finds or speculates to predict what moves i need to make. Long term is better worked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im looking at the fine because im not in the job market, but i dont have insurance. As well you talk about the premiums, yeah, but im not paying them with deductibles that makes it look like i never had coverage in the first place on top of the Actual medical i have to pay for so its not like &quot;healthy, just dont go to the doctor&quot; no i would have to go to the doctor, pay the 5000 and pay all my medical expenses because insurance is a piece of paper and not actual coverage. </p>

<p>Again, my post is to show what ive noticed, see if anyone agrees and may be get more info if i dont have any. I dont just look here, i talk or listen to the people here because if anyone is more critical, its the &quot;people&quot; here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good on ya. Glad you got some attention. Talk to a financial advisor based off your hourly wage to see if it&#39;s worth the fine. If you make less than $75,000 a year? It&#39;s better to get obamacare</p>

I take everything as a whole. Not saying i trust one of em as a sole source or another, just trends. As well, ive been observing trumps demeanor the whole time. Heck, i follow him on twitter. But i look at media&#39;s response to his back or outlashes, his appointments, policy standings, etc. i just wanna know where were going. And considering all the muck we&#39;re dredging in, im wondering if its going to get higher,  or if its going to settle back down. As well mr trumps participation in all this.  </p>

<p>UM. Maybe check out bbc or usa today or drudge or drudgereport and maybe you get a little bit of a wider exposure to the world before you go down a rabbit hole</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kind of just keep my eyes open. And not so much that i come to conspiracy for news, its like there are the major stories that the news is covering, then theres these guys that cover everything else or at least a critical view of the &quot;real&quot; stories. Its not that i trust one or other, its kinda just like watching what people say etc. what the perspectives are. As for news, im not as concerned, i have my own shit going on, but the potus and general direction does affect me so i kind of plan based on it. At the same time, i started twitter for no good reason, honestly. And i started following him because everyone blasts what he says, figured i would see the tweets my self. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean honestly i dont give a shit, but speculating whats going to happen in the next year or so, if undoubtedly sooner, im kind of looking at underground. Its not that its not entertaining, just, i know some things personally, like first hand. And im not encouraging all this, i posted to get opinions and i appreciate what youre saying, not good mentally to take all this nonsense in. Especially looking to mainstream media etc. i come here because the most fringe stuff could come here. I find a good bit of stuff from places i never even expected. I dont care about &quot;news&quot; i care about the president. I also look for stuff you just cant &quot;find&quot; because if its credible and actually possible, its gota be small enough its not worth killing. That being said, i dont care either way, but i wanna see what the wispers are, take a grain of salt, think for my self, but know Nothing can be too far fetched. And honestly, im not worried, i have my own sources (not any site) for stuff. Im just seeing what the chatter is.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, i dont take handouts. From anyone. Im looking at markets and law. I afford my own expenses, some things have happened personally so im looking at priority or necessity. I have been trained in my own health, as well i can get supplies, cheap. 25$ vial of non prescribed insulin which if normal prescribed without insurance costs 300 a vial and that wont even last me a month, test strips cost around 200 without insurance, etc etc. i can take care of my self but budgeting and prioritizing what is more important or what moves to take, even long term, i need foresight. Not saying i dont have it, but it helps when i get input. As well, doctors visits, which im supposed to have every couple of months is several hundred dollars depending on coverage etc. so balancing finances is one thing, health is another. But there are also other factors that im looking at that have nothing to do with those topics. </p>
