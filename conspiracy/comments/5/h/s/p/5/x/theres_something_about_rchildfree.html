<p>How about instead, they are genuinely happy with their life choices?  They see their miserable, exhausted friends with no money.  They see how it changes your entire life.  It takes a lot of honesty with yourself to decide not to go that route.  Many people realize that if they aren&#39;t willing to give it their everything, it just isn&#39;t for them.

<p>I remember a company selling child leashes in about the 1980&#39;s.  Really.  I remember them on the market.  A hundred years ago, it was perfectly acceptable to give your very young children cocaine, and because of this a certain soda became popular... Clutch those pearls!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now you are just phoning it in. Honestly. the point is that there is EVIDENCE that these things are happening. Look at all the connections, read up on Marina Abromovic, read through Podestas emails for references to human sacrifice/consumption of flesh. the bit about acid is conjuncture but I believe the cannibalizm part to be spot on based on evidence from the Podesta leaks, based on the references to pagan rituals, based on references to Moloch, based on artwork in the Podestas homes linking them to dark cannibalistic rituals etc. Another possibility for the disposal of the bodies is pizza ovens (i mean honestly think about it, they must have tons of these ovens and it would be a very convenient method to dispose of bodies.)   </p>

<p>If you have a hardtime believing it the its because you haven&#39;t seen the evidence. Have an open mind and ALLOW yourself to believe</p>

<p>Do it for your kid. This kind of thinking and belief in truly preposterous ideas is going to harm her, deeply. And it&#39;s going to poison her against you as she approaches adulthood.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only seen the mountain of speculations.</p>

<p>Do you know how long it takes to burn a corpse and how much heat is required, and also <em>what mess the ashes do</em>? </p>

<p>Just visit a pet crematorium and you&#39;ll see. There&#39;s also a very distinct smell that cannot be confused with pizza.</p>

<p>By now, you could maybe have access to years of annual reports, expenses, renting proofs and all sort of papers to back up your claims. But pizzagaters are a bit lazy, they&#39;d rather blame our DARK LORD SATAN! xD</p>

<p>I think bussinessmen know what the Podesta cannibal wall painting means, especially using his own quote: he&#39;d rather be the one with the fork. <em>It&#39;s a shark world.</em> Horrible taste but still a cold reality, shocking, as art is often intended to be.</p>

<p>Now Abramovic... why don&#39;t we hear anything about her or <em>don&#39;t have anyone searching her trash bags yet?</em> She&#39;s convenient to name but besides her crappy art and narcissism, I don&#39;t see you guys bringing anything new to the... TABLE! </p>

<p>The underground video has been debunked.</p>

<p>Rest is inconclusive to many. All there&#39;s left are stories of rituals in the name of THE DARK LORD and the acid buckets! You&#39;re free to believe all this but I also feel sorry for the people around you (and these &quot;evidences&quot; won&#39;t ever convince me.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re suggesting doesn&#39;t make sense. The &quot;elite&quot; folks thrive off of unwitting, gullible consumers. Encouraging people not to have kids would only lead to fewer such consumers, which doesn&#39;t help them.</p>

<p>To look at it in a different way, look at Catholics and how they encourage child rearing to the point that masturbation and contraception is still considered sinful because it is &quot;wasting seed&quot;. They want Catholic families to be very fruitful. Why? More believers, more consumers, more support, and more power. </p>

<p>As the saying goes &quot;follow the money&quot;. Who stands to benefit? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what your saying. But look at it this way, theres no way to convince EVERYONE to stop having kids. If you can convince even a sector of the populace that kids are not people and that kids should be hated (like the upper middle class (((liberal))) elite for example) hat&#39;s already a huge victory. These people will turn the other cheek when TPTB pray on the children that do get born. idk, it&#39;s just a theory  </p>

<p>edit: and think about the Haiti connection. Haiti is a poor country with a high birthrate. you cant convince people in countries like Haiti to quit having children but you can target people in the US/other rich Countries. the Globalist elite will rely more and more on trafficing in children from the 3rd world to satisfy their sick appetities, rather than children born in the US</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is true that with increased education, better sanitation, and access to birth control, then the birth rates go way, way down. People still do have kids, but they have fewer, and there are more people who don&#39;t have then at. You can see this trend happen everywhere as countries become more developed. </p>

<p>What do you think the elite will do with these trafficked kids? It sounds like you are concerned that they will use them for sexual perversion but you weren&#39;t clear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is something to what you are saying. I think its a little more of a transhumanist faction of the elite. The agenda being to break the mother-child bond, to paint childbirth as gross or barbaric. Sounds crazy but the TH agenda is to move parentig into the realm of the State, where humans are born in a glass tube and reared by strict protocols. </p>

<p>The eugenic and population control
movement has begun. Read about the Georgia guidestones, about Bill Gates vaccinating/sterilizing mothers. Sure the Catholic church bans contraception. But I have a feeling that is an outdated agenda that will change. </p>

<p>I have already noticed a tendency of gay friends to call straights &quot;breeders&quot; which I feel is part of this.
Again, its totally fine to be childfree but I was uncomfortable in that sub also and decided to leave. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite possiby a psyop, yes. Back in the day if you had a certain preference you didn&#39;t have a special name for it. If you didn&#39;t want kids you just didn&#39;t want them. Now we have special labels like &quot;childfree&quot; and other associated bullshit. Movements like these are usually not naturally occurring. To stay safe from such things, only align yourself with ideals rather than movements. Movements can be subverted, but ideals are constant things.</p>
