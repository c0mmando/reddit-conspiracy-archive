       Not everyone likes kids.  I'm pretty happy they decided to not have kids, if they don't like them.

       How about instead, they are genuinely happy with their life choices?  They see their miserable, exhausted friends with no money.  They see how it changes your entire life.  It takes a lot of honesty with yourself to decide not to go that route.  Many people realize that if they aren't willing to give it their everything, it just isn't for them.  So, why do you care?

It's not that i care that much about this one sub, i'm just concerned for children in general in light of what we have been learning about the globalist elite class

       They feel like children and procreating is shoved in their faces by friends and family and so they vent about hating kids in a place where that's okay. I was subbed there for a while but I don't hate kids and so I unsubbed.

       But you're being weird about it.  The people in that sub chose not to breed, so be thankful.  What's it to you if they discuss it?  Now you're passing judgement of some kind that they must be bad people for being happy about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Care to provide some examples of how disgusting and obnoxious they are?  You've gone well out of your way to be offended.

       example: someone posted a pic of some women holding sings that said stuff like "kill the freeloaders" and had pictures of babies. it got hundreds of up-votes. is that not suspicious at all to you??

       Whatever it is your complaining about, it's in the eye of the beholder and you haven't provided a source.  What is there to be suspicious about, and what are you proposing?  Shutting it down because it displeases you?  Frankly, I'm happy a large segment of our population is choosing not to have children.  Have you taken a look around?

       i am not going to link the thread directly bc i think that is against the rules of this sub. if you really want to see it go to child free and look at the top post with around 400 up-votes. it has a pic with two women holding very graphic and violent anti-baby signs. also there is another post with a pic of a child on a leash.
       <br/>
       Again please, i am being civil with you so stop putting words in my mouth, i never said it should be shut down. Calm down please.

       I looked at the picture you are referring to.  I'm fairly certain it's been upvoted, because it's obviously photoshopped and absurd.  The ladies are actually holding signs that say something else.  It's somewhat tasteless and not your kind of humor.  Best stay out of that sub then.

       it does not matter one bit that it was photo-shopped, fact is that people on that sub liked it and found it worth up-voting. whether the pic itself is real is not the point and you know that.

       i know kids can be hyper but it is NEVER okay to dipict children on a leash. NEVER. that is absolutely sick and perverted and it reminds me of the pic from CPP of the girl taped down to a table. leashes are usually associated with bdsm in reference to people.

       I remember a company selling child leashes in about the 1980's.  Really.  I remember them on the market.  A hundred years ago, it was perfectly acceptable to give your very young children cocaine, and because of this a certain soda became popular... Clutch those pearls!

       I know how to use google &amp; my opinion still stands. to explain, the context of the pic was it had a dog in a stroller and then a child on a leash down on the dirty ground. so the child was potrayed as an animal. that is absolutely disgusting, sick and perverted. absolutely depraved and demented... and i'm just here thinking, i'm not getting how you could see it in another way. this isnt about me being offneded, Its about these people having no conscience and OPENLY calling for children to be abused.

       Ok. And what does that have to do with pizzagate? do you deny that it is strange to talk about hurting babies just because you don't like them? For It is one thing to talk about adults, but we cannot allow people to talk about the worlds' most innocent creatures like they do on childfree. Hmm

       I didn't put the bold and all but don't you find it strange there's people wanting to punish pedophiles who end up threatening normal hetero/homo/x people just because they have a hardtime to believe in "kids being cannibalized or melted in acid" (in the name of OUR DARK LORD, of course)?

       Now you are just phoning it in. Honestly. the point is that there is EVIDENCE that these things are happening. Look at all the connections, read up on Marina Abromovic, read through Podestas emails for references to human sacrifice/consumption of flesh. the bit about acid is conjuncture but I believe the cannibalizm part to be spot on based on evidence from the Podesta leaks, based on the references to pagan rituals, based on references to Moloch, based on artwork in the Podestas homes linking them to dark cannibalistic rituals etc. Another possibility for the disposal of the bodies is pizza ovens (i mean honestly think about it, they must have tons of these ovens and it would be a very convenient method to dispose of bodies.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a hardtime believing it the its because you haven't seen the evidence. Have an open mind and ALLOW yourself to believe

       Pizza ovens top out at 800-900 degrees. To cremate a body you need a minimum of 1400, but more like 1800, and all sorts of venting and other functions not present in a pizza parlor.

       But realizing you're a mom, honestly, get some help. From a psychiatrist. The ideas you're carrying around and appear to be obsessing over are not sane. They are joke started on 4chan that has apparently set off many mentally unstable people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do it for your kid. This kind of thinking and belief in truly preposterous ideas is going to harm her, deeply. And it's going to poison her against you as she approaches adulthood. I have friends whose parents had untreated mental illness. Most of them have completely cut their parents off. That is what is going to happen to you if you continue to indulge this fanciful obsession over pedophelia.

       I've only seen the mountain of speculations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know how long it takes to burn a corpse and how much heat is required, and also
       <em>
        what mess the ashes do
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just visit a pet crematorium and you'll see. There's also a very distinct smell that cannot be confused with pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       By now, you could maybe have access to years of annual reports, expenses, renting proofs and all sort of papers to back up your claims. But pizzagaters are a bit lazy, they'd rather blame our DARK LORD SATAN! xD
      </p>
      <p>
       I think bussinessmen know what the Podesta cannibal wall painting means, especially using his own quote: he'd rather be the one with the fork.
       <em>
        It's a shark world.
       </em>
       Horrible taste but still a cold reality, shocking, as art is often intended to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Abramovic... why don't we hear anything about her or
       <em>
        don't have anyone searching her trash bags yet?
       </em>
       She's convenient to name but besides her crappy art and narcissism, I don't see you guys bringing anything new to the... TABLE!
      </p>
      <p>
       The underground video has been debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rest is inconclusive to many. All there's left are stories of rituals in the name of THE DARK LORD and the acid buckets! You're free to believe all this but I also feel sorry for the people around you (and these "evidences" won't ever convince me.)

       Making jokes in a community of like-minded thinkers does not equate to supporting child abuse. It's like telling an off-color joke in private- it doesn't mean that the joke teller wants to kill all people from another gender or race. I personally don't want kids, and may make jokes in private about "somebody needs to punt that crying baby," but if anybody seriously did that, I would be for him or her getting the maximum penalty for child abuse. It seems like you have a hard time distinguishing reality if you think that that sub really does lead to child abuse.

       What you're suggesting doesn't make sense. The "elite" folks thrive off of unwitting, gullible consumers. Encouraging people not to have kids would only lead to fewer such consumers, which doesn't help them.
      </p>
      <p>
       To look at it in a different way, look at Catholics and how they encourage child rearing to the point that masturbation and contraception is still considered sinful because it is "wasting seed". They want Catholic families to be very fruitful. Why? More believers, more consumers, more support, and more power.

       I understand what your saying. But look at it this way, theres no way to convince EVERYONE to stop having kids. If you can convince even a sector of the populace that kids are not people and that kids should be hated (like the upper middle class (((liberal))) elite for example) hat's already a huge victory. These people will turn the other cheek when TPTB pray on the children that do get born. idk, it's just a theory
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: and think about the Haiti connection. Haiti is a poor country with a high birthrate. you cant convince people in countries like Haiti to quit having children but you can target people in the US/other rich Countries. the Globalist elite will rely more and more on trafficing in children from the 3rd world to satisfy their sick appetities, rather than children born in the US

       It is true that with increased education, better sanitation, and access to birth control, then the birth rates go way, way down. People still do have kids, but they have fewer, and there are more people who don't have then at. You can see this trend happen everywhere as countries become more developed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think the elite will do with these trafficked kids? It sounds like you are concerned that they will use them for sexual perversion but you weren't clear.

       I think there is something to what you are saying. I think its a little more of a transhumanist faction of the elite. The agenda being to break the mother-child bond, to paint childbirth as gross or barbaric. Sounds crazy but the TH agenda is to move parentig into the realm of the State, where humans are born in a glass tube and reared by strict protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
       The eugenic and population control
movement has begun. Read about the Georgia guidestones, about Bill Gates vaccinating/sterilizing mothers. Sure the Catholic church bans contraception. But I have a feeling that is an outdated agenda that will change.

       I have already noticed a tendency of gay friends to call straights "breeders" which I feel is part of this.
Again, its totally fine to be childfree but I was uncomfortable in that sub also and decided to leave.

       Quite possiby a psyop, yes. Back in the day if you had a certain preference you didn't have a special name for it. If you didn't want kids you just didn't want them. Now we have special labels like "childfree" and other associated bullshit. Movements like these are usually not naturally occurring. To stay safe from such things, only align yourself with ideals rather than movements. Movements can be subverted, but ideals are constant things.

       sorry, yes, i should have been clearer. We suspect for example that Haitian children are being raped/tortured/cannabalized/etc at Comet, Besta and so on. They will use them for sexual pleasure

       I looked at the picture you are referring to.  I'm fairly certain it's been upvoted, because it's obviously photoshopped and absurd.  The ladies are actually holding signs that say something else.  It's somewhat tasteless and not your kind of humor.  Best stay out of that sub then.
