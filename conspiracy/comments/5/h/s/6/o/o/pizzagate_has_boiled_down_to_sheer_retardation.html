    <div class="md"><p>In the real world, outside of a tv courtrooms/bad college filler, &quot;the burden of proof&quot; doesn&#39;t mean shit. Laws and rules exist to punish those who cross the line in regards to <em>&quot;destroying someone&#39;s life.&quot;</em> If the burden of proof meant a god damn thing, you wouldn&#39;t hear a thing about russia hacking the elections, or Osama bin Laden being responsible for 9-11....CONSPIRACY, ever heard of it?</p>

<p>&quot;How the hell do you know who your daddy is? &#39;Cause your mama told ya so.&quot;</p>

<p>Pizzagate is here to stay...fake news, aka CNN, ABC, NYT, WPo, etc..etc..failed, now the public will deal with it. Sorry. Also, the word you are looking for is &quot;proof.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The definition of a conspiracy is a secret plan or meeting between two or more people with the intent of causing harm or breaking a law.</p>

<p>Does it say anything there about evidence not existing?</p>

<p>A conspiracy is a real crime that you can be imprisoned for (conspiracy to commit fraud, murder, theft, arson, etc)</p>

<p>The issue with 9/11 at its core is that the official government/media conspiracy theory (theory of 2 or more people causing harm) does not have the evidence to back it. We can reject their claim and try to come up with a more cohesive explanation with the evidence we have. There are actual crimes that do exist even without dropping the official story. &quot;We had no idea they would use planes as missiles&quot; even though multiple agencies and military branches had drills leading up to 9/11 and had forewarning from other intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>Burden of proof is also always valid. If you&#39;re having any sort of intellectual discussion, burden of proof is relevant, it&#39;s not just valid in law.</p>

<p>Example: I think Santa is the actual pedophile  mastermind. He&#39;s able to sneak into every person&#39;s house and brings &quot;gifts&quot; to children. The evidence is there. You may say that&#39;s silly since Santa isn&#39;t real, but then I&#39;ll just shift the burden of proof to you and have you prove Santa isn&#39;t real. (Just an example, I don&#39;t believe this to be true)</p>

Personally, I can easily deconstruct your whole conspiracy THEORY quite easily, and so can others. The problem is none of you have the actual courage to argue LOGICALLY about it.</p>

<p>The &quot;mountain of evidences&quot; is BS. There&#39;s also a few mountains of facts, statistics, proofs and logical explanations being conveniently ignored. That&#39;s how I know who is on some religious war and who is doing things based on reason.</p>

<p>By the way, that&#39;s what missing. Victims. And an actual crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok i&#39;ll bite, if you were really following the investigation you would know that the victims are either consumed (the blood of children has been used for thousands of years in paganistic and (((other))) rituals) or incinerated/dissolved in acid. i think they could also be buried underground, for example under the DC subway. and i would suspect many of the victims who&#39;s lives were spared are out walking around but if they tell the truth their whole families will be killed, sinister things like that, you just never know. It just makes me so sick that they are doing this..   </p>

<p>this is the most sophistacated conspiracy in modern human history and its not going to be so simple to come up with the smoking gun or one big piece of evidence. what we have already is Grounds for a major invesstigation if not Arrests.   </p>

<p>supposing for the moment that you genuinely dont understand and youre not CTR -- i ask you to just be patient and PUSH with the rest of us for justice to be done and for a REAL INVESTIGATION to be conducted. if your so tired of pizzagate then why arent you pushing for an investigation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No seriously.</p>

<p>This is the same as drowning witches and based ON THE SAME FREAKING REASONS WHY IT WAS DONE! Sorry to tell you but I first thought this answer was posted to make fun of all this. </p>

<p>I actually feel bad for you because you are making yourself sick over exagerated myths and missing the opportunity to help real children/victims who&#39;d benefit from the attention and investigation. While I&#39;m not disagreeing there are pedo networks, I also know the highest number of pedo victims are NOT in networks... they are most likely bf/stepfather of a single mom and this totally ignored. I have no doubt about your good intention and how you feel, and why you perceive the people who rely on other facts as enablers, somehow.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pushing on the investigation but there&#39;s absolutely no pizza in mine, and only facts. I didn&#39;t even include the possibility of a God or a Satan, just to be certain I&#39;m not biased ;) Unfortunately, all of you are searching more about Podesta and Satan than orphans, statistics, NGOs, kidnapping, traffic, conglomerate, etc. etc. So it&#39;s a bit hard to believe there were any research put into this. </p>

<p>If you knew anything about occult and satanism, you&#39;d know yourself it doesn&#39;t make any freaking sense when  Alefantis is as popular as Crowley! I&#39;m sure that&#39;s an insult to all occultists, and Crowley&#39;s spirit/ghost/whatever is certainly pissed of being compared to the 49th most influential pizza maker in DC or something! Let&#39;s just say he worked harder than Alefantis to earn his popularity. You might want to read about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey!  I can repost too!  Here.  I&#39;ll do it now since what I said previously is so apropos in this OP you made here as well:</p>

<p>............</p>

<p>This is actually an ignorant statement of the deepest order on OP&#39;s part.  Speculation is in fact <em>exactly</em> what you do when you don&#39;t yet have actual proof of a thing.  After you have proof, then it&#39;s no longer speculation.  It&#39;s a conclusion.</p>

<p>So do we have proof that the Comet Ping Pong people <em>are</em> in fact pedophiles?  I would say no.  It seems there is no have hard proof of pedophilia yet.</p>

<p>However, there <em>are</em> indeed quite a lot of very unbecoming indicators that there is some seriously untowardly activity that&#39;s been going on surrounding that establishment.</p>

<p>Therefore, since there are a lot of indicators but no actual proof yet, speculation is EXACTLY what you&#39;re supposed to be doing.</p>

<p>No need to witch hunt.  No need to accuse needlessly.  No need to call certain things proof that aren&#39;t necessarily that.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> okay to speculate intelligently, put two and two together, and connect dots, however.  That much is what people are SUPPOSED to do.</p>

<p>So speculate away, everyone.  Just try to do it from a critical thinking perspective is all, and realize that your speculations may or may <em>not</em> be correct at this particular juncture.</p>

<p>But speculate away.  Sometimes it&#39;s in the speculating that actual truth gets found.</p>

<p>Really?  And how many people can you describe witch hunting here?  One dude who sounds like an unstable agent provocateur who in NO way represents me or, I’d say, many people investigating this.

<p>lol.  Wow.  I’ve seen nothing but attempts at debunks, and none of them stack up against the incriminating data.  So I actually invite <em>you</em> to attempt to debunk the information, then come back here and see if you’ll find any intellectual honesty or search for truth in the top posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you did there: empty arguments and &quot;lolz.&quot;</p>

<p>You don&#39;t get why agent provocateurs are used, don&#39;t you? You guys clearly don&#39;t understand the dynamic and purpose. Doesn&#39;t matter what you believe, more than half the population is actually certain you guys are dangerous nutzo. <strong>The goal has been accomplished, too late to cry. You got owned on that round again.</strong> Keep going and see where it will lead us all.</p>

<p>All this was easily predictable, some of us even posted about it before being called shills and pedos.</p>

<p>I knew you&#39;d say you can&#39;t trust the cops or FBI. How convenient. More people wrongly accused in your twisted conspiracy. Only you guys know shit eh? Those 2-3 pizza/pasta emails were pretty revealing. At least there&#39;s still a justice system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I absolutely guarantee you you won’t.</p>

<p>I know. Already did. Even the simplest debunk that doesn&#39;t make your whole trail of crap fall apart seems to make a lot of you insecure. Even that was too much. What I&#39;ve seen as comments you qualify as &quot;arguments&quot; were things like &quot;you&#39;re a shill&quot;, &quot;hey guys shills post, that must mean we&#39;re onto something&quot; or simply &quot;fu pedo.&quot; </p>

<p>So I unfortunately cannot say I&#39;ve witnessed any intelligent argumentation against the debunking, and certainly not a single &quot;yeah that makes sense.&quot; Maybe those posts should be created when the kids are in bed.</p>

<p>on the other hand, the media + Washington have a responsibility to be honest, transparent and ethical. When they are not, weird, awful things happen because the truth is obfuscated in a quagmire of corruption which leads to all sorts of shit. Bad leadership leads to bad results, dude. They are more responsible for this kind of shit than us peons. </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>An agent provocateur may be acting out of their own sense of duty or may be employed by the police or other entity <strong>to discredit</strong> or harm another group (such as a peaceful protest or demonstration) by provoking them to commit a crime, <strong>thereby undermining the protest or demonstration as a whole.</strong></p>

<p>The contemporary term false flag describes covert operations that are <strong>designed to deceive in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by entities</strong>, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them.</p>
