       There's only "top" content being submitted that revolves around the Democrat side.

       I believe
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">

       has infiltrated.

      <p>
       How about some analysis of the Republicans? If there really is this many Democrat baddies statistically there would have to be just as many Republicans. 
In the end, no matter who, there's something foul at play and I'd like to know more.

       There are a couple subs around here that seem to be t_d affiliates. I saw one crop up recently called
       <a href="/r/EnoughFakeNewsSpam">
        /r/EnoughFakeNewsSpam
       </a>
       , which I figured would be a sub about fake news, regardless of its alignment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their rules say that only posts about mainstream fake news would be allowed and anything about alternative media would be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked the mods about whether Huffington Post and Breitbart count as mainstream or alternative (since they have similar readership numbers and are basically left/right analogs of each other), and surprise surprise, they said HuffPo was MSM but Breitbart wasn't, so anything posted about Breitbart would be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked them why and they said it's because HuffPo represents the mainstream views of the country. When I pointed out that Trump won, so Breitbart should really be considered the mainstream viewpoint now, I got banned and muted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like it's just another sub for Trump supporters to rant about liberal media.

       Definitely. I wouldn't go there even if I was unbanned, but it doesn't mean I can't call them out for what they are.

       I would argue that all the t_d folks who come to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       and complain about the bias should exercise their freedom to stay away from the sub, but they feel compelled to come and make their opinions known nonetheless. (Not that I have any problem with that.)

       I feel, like many others out there, that something sinister may be at play. I don't care what side and who, I care that we figure out what's going on but through a logical process, conspiracy theories are all good and fun but I'm only going to follow that has logical and sound reasoning.

       If I'm trying to incite anything it would be a level-headed debate.

       I certainly accept that this is a theory people believe and I wish to entertain it, which is why created this thread to begin with.

       Why are you skirting around my point by attacking me? I haven't attacked you or anybody here, so why are you so hostile? Just because I want more information that isn't one-sided? What's your motive here? To suppress those who want more than what's fed through this subreddit? I mean, that's basically what mainstream media outlets are allegedly doing. So what are you doing? What are you trying to achieve?

       Attacking you? Hostile? No need to project emotions into the words you read. This isn't romance correspondence. I'm not trying to woo you or insult you. I have an agenda free life.. I have no political affiliation, nor concern about it. I don't have the power to suppress you...

       This has nothing to do with Republican v Democrat. This is not a partisan sub, it is anti-corruption, anti-establishment sub, and Hillary Clinton embodies the corrupt Washington establishment. Conversely, Donald Trump gives people hope that a maverick Washington outsider might stem the rot. That may be a forlorn hope, but it's probably worth a shot.

       What you say and what's being posted/upvoted are two different things.

       Also, why is everybody comparing Trump and Hillary that way? Criminal vs Businessman, they're both much more than that and it also takes more than that to elect a President, at least it should but so far this election process has proven that wrong to everyone.
