    <div class="md"><p>There are a couple subs around here that seem to be t_d affiliates. I saw one crop up recently called <a href="/r/EnoughFakeNewsSpam">/r/EnoughFakeNewsSpam</a>, which I figured would be a sub about fake news, regardless of its alignment.</p>

<p>Their rules say that only posts about mainstream fake news would be allowed and anything about alternative media would be removed.</p>

<p>I asked the mods about whether Huffington Post and Breitbart count as mainstream or alternative (since they have similar readership numbers and are basically left/right analogs of each other), and surprise surprise, they said HuffPo was MSM but Breitbart wasn&#39;t, so anything posted about Breitbart would be removed.</p>

<p>I asked them why and they said it&#39;s because HuffPo represents the mainstream views of the country. When I pointed out that Trump won, so Breitbart should really be considered the mainstream viewpoint now, I got banned and muted.</p>

<p>Seems like it&#39;s just another sub for Trump supporters to rant about liberal media. </p>

<p>I would argue that all the t_d folks who come to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and complain about the bias should exercise their freedom to stay away from the sub, but they feel compelled to come and make their opinions known nonetheless. (Not that I have any problem with that.)</p>
