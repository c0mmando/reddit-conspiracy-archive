<p>I asked, requested one mod to gather the mods and in concert explain that PI and doxing will get us hammer banned. Seems the mod was correct; his voice meant nothing and my voice meant nothing.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been here seven years and I fear we&#39;re being sabotaged, yet again, from inside, by turf wars within the mod squad! </p>

<p>Knock it off! Enforce the Site Rules and the Community guidelines and ethos!</p>

<p>This won&#39;t blow over. It is a steady erosion of the quality of the sub that has been going on for half a year now. Integrity in the mod team is needed, badly. Rule 8, fucked in early 2016, rule 6, fucked in summer 2016, rule 11, fucked in fall 2016. <strong><em>All secretly, while keeping the rules in the side-bar despite suggestions to remove them to avoid hypocrisy.</em></strong> </p>

<p>Trolls are being given carte-blanch if they are even remotely successful with karma, rule 5, fucked. That trend leads to the plot of <em>Idiocracy</em>.</p>

<p>That is rule 10 territory. If you were just cautionary then you shouldn&#39;t have been modded/warned. You were probably hostile too. Links?</p>

<p>I seriously think it&#39;s just that a lot of people are on totally different trips day to day. It&#39;s all too chaotic due to the internet dropping on humanity. Hopefully it will clean itself up like an eddy in a river sooner than later. Could be decades.</p>

<p>Do they want to allow anything in order to dilute the sub?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know their motives. They vaguely preach about &quot;letting the people decide&quot; when called out for violating the rules with modding. Appeal to popularity. IMO it&#39;s holier-than-thou ego-inflation behavior, at the expense of one of my favorite internet forums :(.</p>

Do you have so very little to do in life that you take on a crusade...an unpaid crusade... to rid a conspiracy forum of &quot;misleading, sensationalist, or fabricated&quot; titles?

<p>That&#39;s a logical fallacy too.  Just because something is a subjective judgement, and subjective judgements can easily be incorrect, doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re better off making no subjective judgements at all.  </p>

<p>It is, however, a good reason to take less severe actions.  For example, rather than delete posts judged to be misleading, one might merely tag such posts as &quot;misleading,&quot; so that in the event that a subjective judgement is incorrect, at least the consequences of that error are neither severe nor permanent.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of people and posters who need to run from this sub.  I would like to think that quality, not popularity, is the goal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In turn that would suck all entertainment value from it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want entertaining tabloid-style conspiracy theories, read a tabloid.  Some of us are looking for the truth, even if it&#39;s less entertaining.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>making it a vapid echo-chamber like most other subs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what it&#39;s becoming now.  When people vote after reading nothing more than the title, titles that are fiction are at an advantage.  The &quot;misleading&quot; tag was a way to balance out that advantage it a way that couldn&#39;t accidentally lead to censorship.</p>

<p>The result of having a lot of bullshit is that those who don&#39;t like bullshit will leave.  The only people left will be those who don&#39;t think critically, but instead believe everything they read.  That&#39;s how you end up with an echo chamber.</p>

<p>Seems like you retiring as a mod was good for everyone involved...and the logical fallacy I was refering to was anyone with a life shouldn&#39;t have time to mod...<em>for free.</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem, what you consider logical and plausible, might be your misunderstanding of bullshit. Who are you to judge? Well, as a mod you could inflict your judgement...but thank goodness that came to it&#39;s logical conclusion.</p>

<p>Let people think for themselves. Let people use the process that exist. Nobody needs your editorial. Some people think shit is real, others think that shit is stupid. Thank hitler killing baby jesus that you no longer get to choose for others. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not the same guy.  I just thought your reply was mistaken and chose to throw in my two cents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you might be doing it wrong..or at least are in the wrong place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If not in a conspiracy theory forum, then where exactly should I find the truth about conspiracy theories?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s the problem, what you consider logical and plausible, might be your misunderstanding of bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Logic is something that everyone knows.  Only the truth is up for debate.  I cannot tell you how much change you have in your pockets, but I can absolutely tell you that, if you take it all out of your pockets, you&#39;ll no longer have any change in your pockets.  </p>

<p>In the same way, no one here can say whether any particular conspiracy theory is true, but they can absolutely identify when a post title isn&#39;t a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the article it links to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let people think for themselves. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one was being prevented from thinking for themselves.  It was just a tag.  They could still read the article and the discussion, and they could still upvote it, and if the tag was incorrect, they could even raise hell about the post being inappropriately tagged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let people use the process that exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The process that exists is misleading the subscribers of this forum by filling it with patent bullshit.  What&#39;s wrong with supplementing a process that isn&#39;t getting the job done with another process that barely changes anything but helps out the first process a lot?</p>

<p>&quot;Majority rule&quot; is rarely the best solution.  We only use it because we often don&#39;t have a better solution.  The problem is that it is ultimately nothing more than mob rule.  A sub can either be what the creators intended it to be, or it can be what the majority wants it to be.  If this were the only sub on the whole internet, then majority rule would make sense, since it is a sub that everyone has to use.  But it&#39;s not, and so if the majority isn&#39;t happy with what the creators of this sub intended it to be, then the majority is free to go to other subs.  This sub is for those who share the creator&#39;s vision.</p>

<p>Now, I have no idea what the creator of this sub intended it to be, but I&#39;m assuming they wanted a place to discuss honest conspiracy theories, and not a place for <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> types to circle-jerk as they abandon all logic and reading comprehension skills and pretend that any and all news says whatever they wish it said and upvote posts that misrepresent that news with the hope that those posts reach the front page and force everyone to know that what they wish was true is actually true.</p>
