       You could be right.  She messed up and russia may be involved.   The issue I have is the news has yet to acknowledge that she may have lost because of all of the other fuck ups her and the dnc had.   Yes, we may not have known if Russia didn't hack in and supposedly release the emails.  However, if they didn't interfere(hey wait havent we done this before in other countries elections) then we may have never found out and they would try the same shit with the next election since it worked.

       You are not watching or listening to any news. There have been countless pieces about why she lost that do not involve blaming Russia. Primarily, they discuss her over confidence in the rust belt being so high that she didn't bother with campaign stops.

       There are no shortage of MSM stories about the campaigns failings.

       The news I have seen so far has been all about blaming Russia, and then about trump not taking daily Intel briefings.   I haven't been sitting in front of the tv watching the news or online all day reading so I may have missed some of these discussions.

       Well, I think part of the issue is the framing in how you seem to think "news" works.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not the job of news programs to run a story like "Why Hillary lost the election" because that is primarily an opinion piece. Discussions like that happen on the "talking head" shows and in op-ed articles in papers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is news, however, to report on Russian hacking or Trump skipping intel briefings. Because those are in fact, news. It doesn't mean Russia was to blame, but the discussion about throughout DC is a news-worthy item.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you primarily just tune into your local nightly news program, I wouldn't expect you to see it. But if you turn on any of the cable news networks, there have been no shortage of those discussions.

       I think those "you people" would like to see some actual evidence of "Russian meddling."  Is the argument, seriously, that the best Russia could come up with was releasing the DNC's own emails?  No ballot box stuffing?  No vote machine hacking?  Just . . . releasing some of Podesta's emails?  But not other folks (other than the ones in Podesta's box)?  What lame hackers.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't feel like meddling.  That feels like a whistleblower.  Or maybe investigative journalism.   But pretty weak sauce for a technically savvy nation.   Also: where's the evidence?  This feels like a simple repeat of Team Clinton propaganda, in an effort to flip the Electoral College.  (And that's exactly what it is, btw).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a major push by both sides to take this away from Trump, and it will ramp up from now until the Electoral College does its thing.

       This is the problem with running corrupt candidates from a national security perspective.  Revealing the truth becomes blackmail.

      <p>
       I would like to once again thank the democrats for fucking over the country by running one of the worst candidates in American history.

       You got it.  Hillary Clinton should have been person of the year, because only Hillary could have made Trump president.  Her legacy will be making, first, an unknown black guy president, and then, making a reality TV star president.

       "Russia rigged the election by informing Americans of what we've been doing for the past 6 months!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds an awful lot like the DNC's attempted Trump smear when they called him out for saying the media was rigging it against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember someone (I think Colbert) satirizing him by saying "The media is rigging the election against Trump by showing clips of Trump speaking!"
      </p>
      <p>
       When in reality a lot of the clips shown of Trump speaking were, in fact,
       <em>
        clips
       </em>
       and not the full argument he was making.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference with Hillary is that we got the full context. There were no partial emails on WL.

       Uh, so you're "analysis" is that because some people believe that Podesta and others are involved in child porn/spirit cooking/ whatever, therefore we don't need any evidence that Russia is really behind the hacks/leaks?   That's your, er, "logic"?

       this sub wouldn't be appropriate. The juiciest verifiable conspiracy of our age--

       affected a US election and this sub is still met with "WHAT ABOUT HILLARY. WHAT ABOUT ISRAEL. What do you mean Russians wanted Trump in office? How about some skepticism?" A certain narrative seems to be promoted here.

       I have no dog in this fight. So I'm interested to hear what your thoughts are on why every mainstream media outlet that has ignored all the very underhand and important stuff of late, should suddenly be believed because of an "unamed sourced"?
      </p>
      <p>
       even the so called "source" says its "someone with connections to Russia". Hillary has connections to Russia, Buzz Aldrin his connections to Russia, Colin Powell has connections to Russia - what does that phrase even mean? This "news" itself Sounds like it's been generated/engineered in such a way as to drive a story where evidence for one does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was a plausible theory put forward (even without firm evidence or sources) detailing who was involved and why they might do this, I'd be all ears.
      </p>
      <p>
       The WaPo saying "Russia did it" however does smack of sore losers.

       It's not. It's an amalgamation of different people with different ideas. Yours included! Mods are openly neutral and transparent. Which is why you are able to see a shift at all (rather than mods controlling a narrative so that r/conspiracy's aesthetic never changes) Given the history and the nature of governance, of course 99.9% of r/conspiracy are going to be skeptical of all government, and if one "team" promises smaller government, and the other promises bigger government, it makes sense that some, up to and including the majority of r/conspiracy might become attracted to the team promising smaller government. Especially when the leader of that team had to fight a grueling, bitter fight with a common enemy (the MSM) to get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's any blindness, I will confess, it is because the MSM have time and time again shot themselves in the foot, and I just refuse believe anything they say anymore. It will take someone like you to come up with a convincing argument (and that argument is not "he's racist, he's sexist, he's XYZ"). With regards to the MSM It's boy who cried wolf syndrome, and they're still doing it with all this Russian hacking nonsense, so no reason to believe they have changed.

       It makes no sense to distrust the government but have faith in a party whose promises you believe who has never followed through on those promises. People here believe every conspiracy theory other than the Russians are trying to do what's in this book.

       You're attacking a fictitious position. Sure some people within a large number of people are XYZ, that doesn't therefore mean everyone within that group is XYZ. Because you've picked out a single contradictory case, doesn't mean that all people have the same mindset.

       That link doesn't provide any evidence that Russia didn't hack the Clinton's emails. Their "whistlblower" source simply states that the "MSM" is lying about the NSA knowing who hacked the DNC. It doesn't actually debunk that Russia was behind the attacks. He basically says that they shouldn't be so certain unless they could provide proof.

       You can't demand that someone prove a negative. If even the CIA doesn't really know who's behind it, then there's no way to know. But just because it could be anyone, doesn't mean it's someone very specific.

       Julian Assange implied pretty strongly that it was Seth Rich of the DNC who "was murdered in a robbery" where nothing was taken from his persons. Assange didn't explicitly say it was Rich because of his policy, but he replied when asked if it was Seth Rich that "his sources go through great risks to leak this valuable information" and then offered a $20k reward to anyone with info on who murdered him. Makes it pretty clear to me that it was not Russia.

       Assange also runs the organization that withheld info they have on Trump and only released stuff that was harmful towards Hillary. He isn't infallible and he has biases of his own, just like everyone else. What I'm trying to say is he could have reasons of his own for insinuating that Rich was the leaker. And honestly we don't even really know where Julian is right now, let alone if he's alive. Wikileaks has likely been compromised, and they have an agenda, as evidenced by their timing of the release of the leaks and their not leaking hacked RNC info.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the entire intelligence community is claiming that Russia influenced the election, we should at least take it seriously and not dismiss it. The democrats don't singlehandedly control all of the intelligence agencies. And this isn't new news, they've been saying this for months. Is there a smoking gun? No. Is there sufficient evidence to say with certainty that Russia interfered? No. But there is enough to warrant an investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the Washington corrupt are going to flourish under Trump. Look at his cabinet and tell me how he's anything different than what we always get.

       I agree with most of what you said... except for that he withheld information on trump. Wikileaks as an organization has never been known to withheld any info for personal motives, and assange explicitly said that nobody had leaked him any info on trump or republicans and that if they had he would have verified and published it. Wikileaks doesn't have control over who they get information on...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, not sure how this is turning into a discussion on trump as i only said its possible that the corrupt started this rumor because they feared him following through on draining the swamp... regardless: we found out from wikileaks that the owners of citibank picked obamas cabinet for him. You know, the same people from saudi arabia that hillary clinton took money from despite having acknowledged that they fund isis. The same people that were publicly mocking trump saying he would never be president and after he was elected told him to bow down. Not saying i agree or disagree with any of his picks... but it is definitely going to be very different from what we've seen over the bush/obama/clinton years.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on to russian interference, i haven't heard any credible info as to how exactly they interfered other than potentially leaking the podesta emails (his email password was "password" btw... so not exactly tough to hack). To me, unless they did something more substantial then it hardly justifies retaliation or action as some are suggesting... I just don't understand how when the secretary of state takes top secret classified info off of secure government devices and uploads them on a private, illegal, unsecure server that the FBI says was hacked 5 times presumably by world powers, no one gives the slightest shit in the world and gives her a get out of jail free card.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly if her and podesta weren't so careless with information vital to national security or privacy, maybe they don't deserve to be running the country?

       I also agree with most of what you're saying here. I think Hillary's law-breaking, constant lying, and flat out untrustworthiness are what
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       killed her campaign, but the purported Russian disinformation could have really tipped the election in Trump's favor. I mean it was a pretty close election, so something like that (along with the timing of the leaks) could have wound up being a deciding factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the end of the day, it was just a propaganda campaign, I don't think it was more than that like actually altering votes or machines based off of the current info. So I don't think that any kind of
       <em>
        extreme
       </em>
       measures need to be taken necessarily. But there needs to be
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       kind of response if it's proven that Russia did interfere, diplomatically or otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spot on about Hillary and Obama, but I don't really see Trump's reign being much different from a typical republican presidency. He's going to defer to Pence on things like policy decisions and that says it all. The guy is in over his head, though I like how he's telling China to fuck off.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Assange, I also remember him saying in an interview something along the lines of "what we have on Trump wouldn't be worse than what he's saying all the time". So that kind of implied to me that they do in fact have dirt on him, along with reports that the RNC was hacked as well, with no release (though it's possible Wikileaks just didn't get those leaks from whoever hacked them).
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly can't say I really blame Julian though. Our government shit on him, I would want to send the country into disarray too if I was him lol.

       Assange made it very clear that they don't reveal the sources of their leaks, it would absolutely tarnish their otherwise perfect track record. The $20k reward for someone who was murdered that would otherwise have 0 connection to wikileaks makes it pretty obvious to anyone with a brain that Rich leaked info to them...

       Sorry but you just sound stupid when you say someone who is dying would have admitted something like that... and EVEN in the slight chance that he did. Do you think ambulance or police would say anything after seeing this guy getting murdered for what he did? As if whoever did it is above killing them too?
      </p>
      <p>
       But no... its gotta be russia because seth rich didn't say anything as he was gurgling up blood when trying to breathe just to stay alive.

        Really? He was DYING with multiple gun shot wounds point blank to his back... he wasn't alive very long CLEARLY and that doesn't mean he's in any state to start articulating what he may or may not have done to have caused that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wtf are you talking about? How is he going to say anything to anyone? He got ambushed and probably didn't know what was happening, why, or who was doing it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He was alive for like 2 hours. He died at the hospital. And you think
       <em>
        he
       </em>
       wouldn't know what happened, but
       <em>
        you

       do? A complete stranger who wasn't actually at the scene of the crime? Got it.

      <p>
       Yet, you believe that these "assasins" shot Rich, made it look like a robbery (without actually taking anything), and didn't even confirm the kill? You think this is more likely than a botched robbery at ~3am?

       Lol love how you claim my knowledge of the situation is less credible than yours because I'm a complete stranger who wasn't there. Newsflash: you are too.  He was fucking shot and got his ass beat bad enough  to die... but when i claim it's unreasonable for you to assume he was in a coherent enough state to talk about what may or may not have happened (as he's DYING), you respond that I'm making claims based on innuendo. Right.

       Available evidence should certainly be discussed, so it's great that you posted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I as well as others find the evidence weak/circumstantial/based on claims of biased parties. It is not necessary for me to prove that someone else is responsible or prove that Russia has an alibi ("it was hanging out with Finland that week, witness reindeer confirm"), merely to point out the faults in your evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So your demand that someone provide "evidence that Russia didn't hack" is excessive, while your claim that Russia did hack does require proof. The logical onus is on the one making the original accusation.

       There doesn't seem to be any.  It's almost as if Clinton makes stuff up and the media reports it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My understanding is that the "hack" was mostly a release of Podesta's emails - which sounds like someone guessed his idiotically password (which supposedly was p@ssw0rd).
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't feel like the might of the Russian intelligence apparatus.  And you can bet, given that Hillary didn't even have as much security as Podesta on her server, that the Russians really do have her emails, and that those are plenty incriminating (the FBI has said its 99% that 5 hostile agencies penetrated her server).   But Hillary's emails/server contents have not been released.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logic suggests that it was inside job, by someone with lucky and limited access.  Meanwhile, unknown agencies have the contents of Hillary's "secret server."  And the US media continues to disgrace itself.

       There was a fairly thorough investigation done about how the Russians have been controlling media narratives (yes, even influencing MSM).  The people who conducted the research are shadowy and therefore not accountable for flaws in their work, but their explanation of their methodology should be more than enough to satisfy the people on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point being - the Russians use, among other things, shill Reddit accounts to spread pro-Russia news and viewpoints. Don't be surprised if there are some that regularly participate on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure someone will respond "b-b-but Hillary's CTR shills!" sure, that's fine. But Hillary lost and CTR has no point now - the Russians are still around.

       Because, most oddly enough, only the Senate is ensuring this issue is not tackled in a partisan manner. The lay person most certainly isn't, which your comment alludes to. The lay person reads the news and finds it another opportunity to smear the President-elect.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, rightly, fans come out and point to the idiocy of such attacks. How is this an opportunity to smear, when it was the content of what was hacked that did the damage? Sure, it's bad that Russia was able to affect American elections, but to think that this somehow diminishes Donald's accomplishment or taints his future presidency is irrational.

       I was just indicting this subreddit which has been happy to build conspiracy theories against Clinton with sometimes flimsy circumstantial evidence. Here we have a lot of admitted ties between Putin and Trump and this sub is mostly silent about them. Everything you've said about the defense of trump by this sub could also have been said about Clinton for the last however many months. There's a clear bias here, to post info about Clinton's corruption and to ignore parallel information about trump.

       According to the RNC and their own intelligence agencies they weren't hacked at all. There was an interview with Sean Spicer on CNN about it. Apparently the RNC offered the NYTimes an exclusive insight on what they had and all their proof/evidence, etc. And NYTimes said fuuuuck that, it doesn't fit our narrative.

       Id be as keen as anyone to see what the 8years dormant RNC has been up to, but to be honest, I'd not be surprised if they've done very little given how poorly organized and in disarray they seemed to be this last election cycle. I would imagine it would all be embarrassing and bitchy infighting over where allegiances fell - I'd be very interested and shocked if it were anything else.

       He didn't use email.  And they did try to find dirt on him but said nothing they found was worse than what comes out of his mouth every other day.  So we've seen the worst of Trump.  Trust that if they could find anything other than a tape of him saying the P word twelve years ago they would have shouted it from the rooftops.  All they had was Russia, Russia, Russia and Nazi's- even though Trump is a known supporter of the Jews and its public record that Hillary has more ties to Russia than Trump with her Uranium One Deal.

        At the same time we should return to plans to provide the FSA, or some group of moderate forces, with equipment that will allow them to deal with a weakened ISIL, and stepped up operations against the Syrian regime. This entire effort should be done with a low profile, avoiding the massive traditional military operations that are at best temporary solutions. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward,
        <strong>
         we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.

       Its necessary to point out that the significance of this email is not what it literally states, obviously the US would rather limit ISIS' influence in the region. The context is that the US knew that Saudi Arabia was arming ISIS when the

       You can decide that this isnt actually treasonous. But you should know that this comes as close as any Presidential Candidate has ever got to crossing that line. Chances are that if you disagree about Clinton or Kerry or Obama's culpability in this matter, you would have said Reagan and Oliver North were Traitors if you were asked 5 years ago.

In stark contrast to western claims at the time, the Defense Intelligence Agency document identifies al-Qaida in Iraq (which became Isis) and fellow Salafists as the “major forces driving the insurgency in Syria” – and states that “western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey” were supporting the opposition’s efforts to take control of eastern Syria.

        and

       To get from this that the US is actively helping ISIS is a very very far stretch.  The US attempted to help the FSA against Assad.  Many FSA members became ISIS later. That is not direct help to ISIS.

       Yes, the man that said we should sneak attack Mosul definitely does not need intelligence briefings. /s
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, good source on your little factoid that was reported by Breitbart and the numbers came from the "Government Accountability Institute". This "Institute" is co-founded by Bannon and that particular bit was found to be false. If any briefings have been missed, they are delivered in paper form to the president, not disregarded entirely as Trump is doing. I'm not necessarily a fan of Obama and wouldn't say I'm a democrat, but if you're going to make accusations, make sure they have a credible source.

       So, you're saying it's not true that he missed half of those meetings, and after that you agree that he did miss a lot of these meetings?

       I just don't understand how anyone could ever be okay with some of the stupid shit Trump has said recently. Clinton is terrible, but don't stick your head so far up your own ass about trump. He is literally acting like he wants to throw the presidency on purpose. I'm still not convinced he will ever be our president with some of the stupid shit he's said since being elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       And keeping on topic with this sub, I'm not convinced this isn't part of the plan and he hasn't been working with Clinton this entire damn time.

       Here is a good one covered by a couple of outlets to some degree but lacking in the context. You can go ahead and try and explain and justify, try to be dismissive and willfully ignorant. Im just going to leave this here for you to think about.

        At the same time we should return to plans to provide the FSA, or some group of moderate forces, with equipment that will allow them to deal with a weakened ISIL, and stepped up operations against the Syrian regime. This entire effort should be done with a low profile, avoiding the massive traditional military operations that are at best temporary solutions. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward,
        <strong>
         we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Its necessary to point out that the significance of this email is not what it literally states, obviously the US would rather limit ISIS' influence in the region. The context is that the US knew that Saudi Arabia was arming ISIS when the

       You can decide that this isnt actually treasonous. But you should know that this comes as close as any Presidential Candidate has ever got to crossing that line.

        It is also likely that some of the small arms in IS’ possession – such as an M4 carbine-style Bushmaster X15E2S manufactured in the USA and documented in IS’ arsenal entered Iraq with private security companies during the US occupation and found their way into Iraqi arms markets.

In stark contrast to western claims at the time, the Defense Intelligence Agency document identifies al-Qaida in Iraq (which became Isis) and fellow Salafists as the “major forces driving the insurgency in Syria” – and states that “western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey” were supporting the opposition’s efforts to take control of eastern Syria.

If all that Russia released simply amounted to a bad segment on The Today Show and had nothing of any substance to it, how would it have effected the election? How
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       it? Not to deflect, but Carlos Slim (the riches man in Mexico) owns the NYT. Is Mexico interfering with US politics? Or are they simply publishing truth? Anyone that thinks WL was "manipulating the election" by publishing primary sources
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       thinks it is okay for NYT to publish without the same degree of skepticism is being intellectually dishonest and hypocritical.

        Its necessary to point out that the significance of this email is not what it literally states, obviously the US would rather limit ISIS' influence in the region.

       She acted with executive authority. She could have killed the deal on her own at any moment in time. But chose not to. This is important and refutes your argument. This isnt blame.

       You arent citing any sources for any of your claims. You think I am being partisan but I am the one that acknowledged fault on both sides of the aisle for 3 separate arms deals. And yes, the SoS can kill an arms deal on her own. The President can tell her to approve it but she can still say no. I pointed out exactly how this is just like Contra which was illegal and people convicted, so this clears that goalpost but the goalpost set in this conversation was you asking for policy or secret that was compromised. What I linked you to was a TS email that originated with the SoS. That is something you and I should not be able to read for obvious reasons. But here we are. Now you want to debate the significance of the email, and I welcome that discussion, but you should concede the point that addressed exactly what you were asking for.

       This isnt true. The president can
       <em>
        prevent
       </em>
       SoS from acting in certain ways but the SoS can also pressure the President. That is why cabinet positions exist. So the President doesn't have to do everything. SoS does not run everything through the president and may also limit the things that get to the President. So if the SoS wanted to prevent a foreign government with furnishing enemies of the state with american weapons all they would have to do is not negotiate with terrorist sponsoring states.

       Every single one of these people have mechanisms to prevent the US from arming enemies of the state. These things should be discussed publicly by MSM. But they arent and that is the problem we are discussing. If you want to decide who is to blame for arming ISIS knowingly through SA, that is fine. But you need to accept the truth that we are discussing for any of this to go further. I would love to put this at the feet of the Republican party, believe me. Like I said, Im a democrat.

        Twenty more seconds of googling disproves your latest fake news fetish story. Here's an article from Scientific American from 1997 detailing the timeline of the nuclear launch process. I guess now you can either become outraged at the "liberal media" for this act of treason, or admit you were wrong and that this information isn't secret or classified.

       First, that's 1997.  Second, that's general information and says "within a half hour".  Third, she
       <em>
        specifically
       </em>
       gave information about the time it takes from when the pres gives the order to the launch time, which is
       <em>
        definitively
       </em>
       classified info.

       "hacked the elections" is stupid, but they certainly seem to have targeted Clinton. For some reason they wanted Trump to win, and they helped. Do we really want to just let that slide?

       Hillary Clinton's "Reset" policy towards Russia as Secretary of State was an absolute failure.  She completely screwed the pooch when it came to diplomacy with Russia.  This was during the Medvedev administration, early in Obama's presidency, well before Putin's involvement in Ukraine or Syria, and if she hadn't totally mishandled our relationship with Russia things may have turned out differently over the past 8 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government should have known that it was only a matter of time before the Russians tried to attack Hillary Clinton in some way.  They know full well how much she's despised in Russia, not just by the government but by the common people.  So why the fuck were they so lax about cyber security when they knew that Russian hackers were a universal threat and that they had a personal grudge against Hillary in particular?

       I would be surprised if they didn't. Apparently, Clinton's private server was easy to find, and more than one foreign intelligence agency knows the secrets that it contained.

       But if we're being specific, then we're discussing the leaks that actually affected the election: the DNC leaks and John Podesta's email. For the DNC leaks, Assange all but bluntly states that it was leaked (not hacked) by Seth Rich:

      <p>
       For Podesta's email, we don't have the name of the leaker, but in the Pilger interview, Assange says that leak is from a "Washington insider". Craig Murray, an associate of Assange and a generally credible source, says as much, claiming that he has even met the leaker and that it was, again, a "Washington insider":

       When faced with conflicting accounts, evaluate those accounts and how well they correspond to other known facts. And either, in theory, could be a lie. So are you suggesting that this poorly sourced story from the Washington Post and the CIA is more believable than the person who at least knows from whom he
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       received the leak? Does the CIA and Washington Post have a better track record for honesty than Assange? I've chosen my answer to that question, and I'm pretty damn comfortable with it for now.

       Is there not ample evidence that Russia does the same things, generally with a lot less finesse and more loss of civilian life? How are we to respond to their aggression? I'm not condoning our actions, but the situation has a lot of nuance and it's not as simple as "let's all get along" when the other side is
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       not going to respond in kind.

       I don't think we should fight a proxy war and help fuel the destabilization of an area. If Russia wants it let them take it. The people will revolt without us selling weapons but prolonging the conflict helps no one in the area at all.

       Where do you draw the line at stopping tyranny? The policy you are proposing was more or less the status quo in the US and parts of Europe in the first half of the 20th century. It didn't work out so well. The Cold War was the response, and I always laugh when people say the Cold War ended in 89/90, because it is very much still alive in Ukraine, Syria, elsewhere.

       This would seem to be in our interest. I think there is a valid case for a non-interventionist US foreign policy. I don't think anyone is seriously suggesting that other countries should not be intervening in these cases, however. I'd be perfectly happy to see us not be the world police. But large parts of the world still need policing, and
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       after 2007-08 none of our allies are really in shape to beef up their military in short order. Europe is a clusterfuck right now. China and Russia are uneasy allies as are the US and China. It will take courage, intelligence, careful planning, diplomacy, and a good amount of time to remove us from the world stage in this fashion without completely demolishing the First World as we know it.

       Maybe because Hillary was completely open about her desire for a war with Russia.  There is no way that her Syrian No Fly Zone would have resulted in anything other than war.   And there is no way she wouldn't have done it, given the vast amounts the Saudis paid for that war, and her history of foreign-policy fuck-ups.

       Because if it actually comes to all-out war, it's not a war they can win.  If there's one thing Iraq and Afghanistan have taught us, it's that ragtag bands of goat-fuckers, armed only with AK-47s, IEDs, home-field advantage, and sheer fucking tenacity, can fight the world's most advanced military to a draw; all this on foreign land, where the people speak a different language and can be easily characterized as "other" (making it easier to convince US forces to kill them.)
      </p>
      <p>
       On American soil, with Americans fighting Americans, the instant those orders go out, the Fedcoats lose a third to half of their enlisted forces and a smaller (but still significant) chunk of their officer corps to defection. (I am basing these numbers off of conversations I've had with friends and family who are veterans; I admit that they are anecdotal, but they're not pulled straight from my ass.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Cops are a different ball game, because they've been trained to think with an "us against them" mentality.  The average cop, if ordered to, will mow down a group of people without a second thought.  A soldier, sailor, Marine, or airman
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       consider whether the order is lawful or not before pulling the trigger, which pretty much explains why

       It's obvious how they're going to make their move.  They're going to take all the data the NSA has been gathering and come up with a list of people for the police to arrest and/or kill, in the hope that this will nip an incipient insurrection in the bud.

       I doubt they see ME, personally, as a particularly grave threat.  They've obviously collected a vast amount of data on me, just like they have everyone else, but I'd be surprised if a human eye has ever looked at my file.  I'm simply not important enough.  And this is a good thing, since it means I probably won't be in the first wave of disappearances.

       fucking quick, and in order to keep a lid on the situation, they would need to act with more speed, competence, and brutality than I think is within their capability (at least the first two).

       They'd probably be able to subdue the cities without too much trouble, but short of bombing the entire continent to smithereens, the Feds are not going to be able to crush a rebellion (or several disjointed ones) that's waging a guerrilla war from the countryside.  Too much territory to cover, too many veterans familiar with current counterinsurgency tactics, too many hunters who know the terrain like the back of their hand.  You know that misattributed Admiral Yamamoto quote about there being "a rifle behind every blade of grass"?  There you go.  They're not winning that kind of war, I don't think they can prevent it from becoming that kind of war, and I think they know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't even touched the fact that a domestic insurrection in the United States would tank the global economy.  The banksters know this.  It's one thing if the insurrection pops off organically, but why on earth would they give the go-ahead for their goons to start a war themselves?

       They don't want to "win". They want martial law. The civil war will be between brothers. Just like it always is.

        On American soil, with Americans fighting Americans, the instant those orders go out, the Fedcoats lose a third to half of their enlisted forces and a smaller (but still significant) chunk of their officer corps to defection. (I am basing these numbers off of conversations I've had with friends and family who are veterans; I admit that they are anecdotal, but they're not pulled straight from my ass.)

        It's obvious how they're going to make their move. They're going to take all the data the NSA has been gathering and come up with a list of people for the police to arrest and/or kill, in the hope that this will nip an incipient insurrection in the bud.

       This is why you have 'terrorists' shoot up night clubs and schools. Just change "muslim" to "conspiracy theorist" and you can yank anyone off the street in the name of security. You're staring at the framework right now, they've already built it.

       You don't have to crush the countryside. You wait for 2/3rds to die out from starvation, and then let the rest kill each other over resources while you sit nice and safe in DUMBs.

       The accusation of what Russia did is pretty benign - publicize evidence of corruption. Countries have done that to each other all the time. You can't do anything about that except cover yourself with an Iron Curtain. In fact, it's a good thing that there's more sources to publicize evidence of corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       The corruption is the problem. The people are unhappy. If the election can be so easily manipulated, that's the underlying problem, not the fact that a foreign government may choose to try to interfere.

       You recognize that Hillary doing stupid shit, and the American people being upset about a foreign power intentionally interfering with an election are not mutually exclusive right? It'd be nice if things were that simple but they're not. You can be happy that the information was uncovered but you should still be wigged the fuck out that Russia was working deliberately to influence a US election. Unless you think they just have our best interests in mind which would be, well, a really dumb thing to think.

       That's been my point the whole time. Unless Russia manufactured fake intelligence and pushed it as real or actually hacked votes to be changed to Trump, this is all a massive overreaction. If they are providing truthful intelligence, where is the foul? Why should we be upset because we better understand the truth of the matter at hand? It is willful ignorance.

       Bush anti-gay. Obama not. Bush would not kill bin Laden. Obama would. Bush tax cuts for the very rich. Obama prefered infrastructure spending. Bush against health care reform. Obama for health care reform. Bush dictatorial foreign policy. Obama valued allies' input. Bush cratered the American economy. Obama averted a second Great Depression and now has unemployment lower than it was prior to the 2008 recession.

       Rofl remember when Obama campaigned saying he would pull out troops out of Iraq and eventually the Middle East? Remember when drew that red line? Remember when nothing of the sort happened? Foreign policy is very similar between the two. Bush cut taxes for the rich and then Obama bailed em out and gave em raises when the market crashed. Both have completely ignored national debt. And health care, have you seen the massive spike in insurance rates under Obamacare recently? Do you're ally think he didn't see that coming? Funny how it was called the AFFORDABLE care act. Presidents today say what they have to to get elected and then go to the middle of the aisle. Both supported increased surveillance, both did nothing to change the situation in Guantanamo, both were in wall street's pocket. Both have done nothing pertaining to the war on drugs/private prisons/pharmaceutical companies. Obama is all talk. Your right about their differing views on homosexuality though.

       I remember when Obama said he'd defeat Al Qaeda by increasing troops in Afghanistan and when he said he'd be gradually withdrawing troops according to the agreement George W. Bush made with Iraqi president Alawi.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember corporations given bailouts by Obama deciding on their own to give raises to their executives and being roundly condemned for it, even by Obama himself.

       I remember Republicans admitting for a time that deficit spending was necessary to get the unemployment rate down. Then beginning, like you, to complain about the federal budget deficit. That's now going down. What do you think President Trump is going to do with the national debt and the federal deficit with his pledges to cut taxes, set the feds loose on illegal immigrants, explode the military budget and pass a trillion dollar infrastructure bill?  He's not going to get all that money back by cutting Social Security and Medicare (which his pledged not to touch during the campaign). Where is he going to get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are less than 100 prisoners in Guantanamo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama has had a Republican Congress all but 14 months of his terms. Yet he has been able to reform Federal drug policy in ways that cause people like Senator Sessions conniption fits.  Sessions is going to clamp down on marijuana sales in EVERY state, by the way.  That make you happy?

       You like Trump plenty. Presidents don't "end up doing the same general things." And we're already seeing the clear demonstration of this being the case with the president-elect you supported appointing corrupt tycoons and incompetents to the Cabinet.

       "You like Trump plenty." Are you seriously telling me who I like and what side I'm on? Do you know anything about me? I didn't vote for trump and I'm not even a republican. You seem to like blaming republicans for things when both parties have shown massive incompetence, the democrats are indefensible. Bush sucked and so did Obama. As long as America is stuck in this "my party's right and yours is wrong" mindset we will continue to get nowhere. You are in fact the one who doesn't know what they're talking about you proved that when you claimed to know who I support and what party I'm loyal to.

       Okay, first off, the word "hacked" shouldn't really be used here. What should be used as an adjective instead is "influenced". It's not debatable that Russia certainly wanted to influence the election, and anyone who doesn't understand the 'why' of this isn't smart enough to even engage in conversation with. What is debatable is the extent of the influence.
      </p>

       Next, this issue goes beyond American politics and should be taken very seriously by both parties. The concern, at its core, has nothing to do with Hilary fucking Clinton or your lord and savior, Donald Trump, and this post proves exactly how ignorant people are. So congratulations by focusing on what really doesn't matter. Some of these people are fucking incorrigible.

       This has everything to do with Hillary Clinton and her butt hurt supporters losing an election that they should have won. Instead of getting votes, though, they were too busy planning victory parties. The her magisterial drunkness couldn't even get her shit together to actually accept the results and lead her voters and followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your whole argument rests upon the supposition that the American public is dumb and easily hoodwinked. That's the problem with Clinton dead enders, in that you have no respect for people who may have different opinions and feelings than you about the direction of the country. I don't agree with Trump and his ideas, but I didn't agree with Clinton either (mainly because I don't like two-faced hypocrites that try and make their hypocrisy and duplicity positive attributes).
      </p>
      <p>
       And I say this as someone who is many standard deviations from the mean in terms of things you frankly aren't capable of understanding with your close-mindedness and intellectual bigotry. She and the system she represents got the comeuppance they deserve (well, they really deserve the gallows for the collective war crimes enabled by their cowardice, but whatevs).
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this Russian hyperventilation thing continues to erode public support for all neo-liberals and neo-cons, like John McCain and Lindsey Graham (and most assuredly Chelsea). Fuck the establishment, and if it is the Russians doing the fucking, I don't care. Your precious American ideals were sold out decades ago when we chose to invade a country for bullshit reasons (well, that and project paperclip giving Nazis a home in the USA after the war).

       I agree, people generally don't know what that term actually includes. But in this case, writing malware specifically to gain access to a system or to automatically crawl, scan, and id data is definitely a hack. It happens very frequently.

       Outside of catching them in the act myself and getting a confession? For starters,
       <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national">
        this statement from the CIA, FBI, NSA, Army Intelligence and Security Command and pretty much every other US intelligence agency.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Outside of every US Intelligence agency, there is some corroboration from private security firms as well:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Threat researchers at Dell SecureWorks, an Atlanta-based security firm, had been tracking the Russian intelligence group for more than a year. In June, they reported that they had uncovered a critical tool in the Russian spy campaign. SecureWorks researchers found that the Russian hackers were using a popular link shortening service, called Bitly, to shorten malicious links they used to send targets fake Google login pages to bait them into submitting their email credentials.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The hackers made a critical error by leaving some of their Bitly accounts public, making it possible for SecureWorks to trace 9,000 of their links to nearly 4,000 Gmail accounts targeted between October 2015 and May 2016 with fake Google login pages and security alerts designed to trick users into turning over their passwords.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Among the list of targets were more than 100 email addresses associated with Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, including Mr. Podesta’s. By June, 20 staff members for the campaign had clicked on the short links sent by Russian spies. In June, SecureWorks disclosed that among those whose email accounts had been targeted were staff members who advised Mrs. Clinton on policy and managed her travel, communications and campaign finances.

       100 out of 4,000 targets is a tiny fraction. That is not enough to state she was targeted to rig the election against her and if anything it actually discredits the notion. She wasn't singled out. Did they say whether any of Trump's campaign were targets, or did they just leave that part out?

       Where to start....
      </p>
      <p>
       1) What difference does it make that it was 100 out of 4,000 or 100 out of 40,000? Russian hackers targeted the Clinton campaign. That is the only point here.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) What difference does it make if Trump's campaign was targeted? No information about him or his campaign was leaked. Had they been targeted and infiltrated it would bolster the case for Russia trying to meddle with the election since they would have kept whatever they found quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Why do you believe that FBI, CIA, NSA, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and every other intelligence agency would lie about this?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that your mind is made up on this case.

       No, and I'm not arguing with the content or trying to defend the Clintons or the DNC. They are politicians in the most cynical sense. That being said, I have a huge problem with one of our main global rivals putting their finger directly on our Democratic process by trying to influence a Presidential election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I moved to the U.S. from Russia when I was a kid. I can tell you with certainty that they have absolutely no respect for the democratic process (United Russia routinely wins over 100% of the vote in many Oblasts and no one really gives a shit). Our Presidential elections mean something to me -- all of the political ads and partisan bullshit aside, it makes me proud to be a part of a country that truly has free elections (even if the rest of our political system is corrupt). Russia meddling with that pisses me off.

       I am not defending Russia. I am saying if they're going to blame Russia for Hillary's loss, they'd better damn well show the proof. I have shown that the Clinton Foundation source was Justin Cooper, a top Clinton aide.

       So they are automatically wrong about everything? While  it's certainly possible that the FBI might lie, it doesn't seem likely in this case. At least, their actions have not been consistent  with the notion that they were trying to get Clinton elected. If they were,  why would they re-open their investigation into her emails just days before the election?  And why would they sit on the information that Russia was actively trying to get Trump elected until
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the election?

       That's difficult to say, because you're trying to measure something inherently subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I think debating the content of all of these emails is somewhat beside the point. There's no denying the content and the picture they paint of Clinton being the career nepotist she is.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm personally more concerned with is whether people are willing to excuse a foreign power deliberately involving itself in our political process, especially if that power has a preferred outcome, just because they happen to support "our guy".  If we're going to comb through every DNC email available, fine, transparency is good. But it needs to be balanced. Where are the RNC's emails? What do those show? I want to see everybody's dirty laundry, not just one sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, we are doing ourselves a disservice if we willingly allow foreign involvement in our electoral process,  no matter who the beneficiary is. Russia doesn't do anything for the magnanimous benefit of the US, so we should certainly appreciate their motives when analyzing this situation.

       Russia's involvement is hacking both political parties emails and deciding to sit on one and release the other. We have multiple agencies telling us this.  You're either saying it's no big deal, or that literally every one of these actors are in cahoots with one another to lie and pin the blame on Russia.

       In my mind, the public has a right to see those emails. While in a perfect world our benevolent public servants would be completely transparent, that's obviously not the reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately we'll never know, but if the shoe were on the other foot, I highly doubt the same people shrieking about this would be doing the same thing. The whole "integrity of our election" thing just seems phony. Perhaps some people, such as yourself, have genuine concern, and that's fine, but I don't believe that's the case for a majority who say they are "concerned" about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said all this, there still isn't concrete proof this occurred. From my view this looks like a last ditch effort to discredit Trump and perhaps attempt to change the result before the EC votes -- the timing is just too convenient.

       It's widely known and accepted by anyone capable of critical thinking that countries often influence other countries public elections, among other things..  What is paramount, in this specific example of "Russian hacking," is the fact that all of these
       <em>
        revelations
       </em>
       are intended to delegitimize the incoming POTUS in the eyes of the US public and instill a hysterically negative view of Russia into anyone that is vulnerable to this persuasion.  As you would say- this is an example of an active campaign to influence the American public.. although, instead of Russia being the perpetrator, it turns out that the culprits are from the US and other Western nations.  It's quite the plot twist, I know..

       Speaking of Influencing the elections of other countries, for all of the sheep out there, here's an even bigger plot twist: Hillary herself has said, and I quote:
"I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake...and if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.”

       Firstly? I just did. In one word.

      <p>
       But how about the repeal of Glass-Steagall, the installation of NAFTA, Hillary's influence peddling released during the election, and the push for TPP/TTiP? All give power to global corporations. The MSM is bought and sold and are legally allowed to lie to us. How does any of that

       Don't forget CIA operation mocking Bird. Turn the entire MSM into propaganda tools to change public opinion. Keeping saying a lie until It becomes fact. I mean look at 2001 you couldn't find a single person to say Iraq didn't fund 9/11 and Saddam didn't have nukes stockpiled ready to roll.

       The fact that you are getting downvotes just shows how pointless this sub has become. You'd think a conspiracy website would be pretty interested in understanding how a long standing enemy of the US is altering the domestic political landscape.

       If trump morons try to turn this into partisan politics, then we really are doomed. The Russians are only able to influence our elections because about half of our population are ridiculously gullible.

       War??  Okay then please tell me what the crime is.  If the crime is "hacking" then we should also war china, Saudi Arabia, several EU countries, and a slew of others.  Countries hack one another all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the "crime" is releasing information so what?  They can say whatever they want.  That's not a crime.  They can sit on or expose what they like.  Here's a novel idea... if you don't want to get in trouble don't be a scumbag crook and liar .   I am not all gung ho to send our boys in to get killed because some hysterical zealot yells for war.

       Oh no, I fully believe that the information was leaked by a Russian speaker who could very well have ties to the SVR or FSB. I'm just doubtful legit proof could be provided and information like this isn't good for much other than sowing discord and mistrust without proof. We're stuck trusting the CIA which is not something I'm willing to do. Now I should clarify, I do not think this is some secret CIA plot to oust Trump. Something that not a single representative has even mentioned.

       What? I'm referring to the comments in this thread who act like there has been proof of russians involvement and it's just accepted. It's not.  Russia is a scapegoat for Clinton's cunts being caught manipulating the election then still losing.

       Before making that claim, it would be helpful if you could point to any evidence of Russia hacking anything related to the election. Numerous whistleblowers and insiders have claimed that it was our own people who supplied the emails to Wikileaks.

       Not evidence for own people, but for not coming from Russia. Though that is if you believe this interview is legit. But that also brings the question, if it is fake why would they make it so that it was denied to be Russian Government

      <p>
       Here is a better writeup than I could have written.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most relevant bits:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        To summarize, while yes we have no smoking gun, the methods used in the DNC hack are very similar to methods used by groups who are believed to have acted in the interest of the Russian government in the past. The hardest piece of evidence is that the DNC hack reused a command and control node and SSL certificate that were both used in a hack of the German government that german intelligence has linked to Russia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now we of course do not know exactly who is in these groups and whether they are directly part of Russian intelligence or just realted, but we do know that their actions align closely with Russian strategic interests. (hacking U.S. defense firms, hacking U.S. Government networks, hacking NATO allies). Crowdstrike, a respected cybersecurity firm, believes two Russian groups functioning independently of each other both hacked the DNC. Crowdstrike was of course hired by the DNC, but they are a respected firm with a good reputation. Two additional tech security firms hired by the DNC, Mandiant and Fidelis, confirmed Crowdstrikes conclusion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The day after Crowdstrike released their report the Guccifer 2.0 wordpress account was created, claiming to be a lone hacker behind the hack. Though he claimed to be Romanian, he refused to speak at length in Romanian and spoke it poorly.. The meta-data in the first batch of leaked documents also indicates that they were edited by a computer using Russian language settings and who's username is a nickname for the founder of the Soviet Secret Police. After this was pointed out all subsequent leaks were edited using virtual machines with different languages and usernames from around the world.

       Okay, let me get this straight. The former Deputy Assistant Department of State and high ranking official in four presidential administrations claims that he and others in the intelligence community leaked the emails to Wikileaks, and you're claiming there's nothing to see here?

       I don't really want to go down this rabbit hole but,
      </p>
      <p>
       A) High ranking seems like a big stretch here. The best I can gleam from wikipedia is that the man worked as a psychiatrist for the assistant secretary of state as an expert in hostage rescue. Impressive for sure, but even when he did work for the government that is not a position that would be involved with what he's claiming to do now. Certainly not remotely comparable to Vladimir Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as a note, the deputy assistant secretary reports to the assistant secretary, who reports to the deputy secretary, who reports to the secretary. There are 35 assistant secretaries of state, who can have as many deputies as they want. At any given time there are probably 100+ people who shared his title.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) For the last 30 years he's worked as a consultant and science fiction writer. There's no reason to think he would have access to this kind of information in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       C) He hasn't provided any corroborating evidence, when doing so would be fairly easy. For instance, we know now that the attacks were done by the same computer involved in the "fancy bear" attacks on Germany. If he had simply mentioned this, then his claims could be verified, as that was not public information at the time. Even now, he could provide some kind of information on how he has access to this group, or any kind of verifiable information about this group.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all it seems overwhelmingly likely to me that he's saying most of this as a way to drive traffic to his youtube channel and website, where he sells his novels.

       The guy is admitting to treason! You don't do that for freaking YouTube hits. I feel like logic has completely vanished in this thread. And if you do some more research on Pieczenik, you'll see that he was also in the intel community

       I'm not really sure what you're suggesting. Admitting to treason is a lot safer if you haven't actually committed treason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there is no way you could convict him of treason based solely on that youtube video. If the CIA found any evidence linking him to the hack he would likely be in jail right now. Seems like the fact that he's publicly admitting to treason and not in jail would imply that he might be lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, the guy seems pretty far off his rocker. His most recent video is on the civil war being act of auto-genocide from Lincoln, committed because Lincoln was a homosexual.

      <p>
       You're getting downvoted because you're completely misinterpreting his statements (something a lot of people in this sub are good at). They are saying that a "smoking gun" is such a high bar to set, it's unreasonable to ask for it in cases like this. What are the chances that we would find a "very high level communication" that details their attacks and motives? You're asking for too much if you want a "smoking gun" in this case. The evidence we do have, however, does point to Russia's involvement.

       What, the video? It's some attention-seeker who offers no evidence of his own. He just wants you to buy his book so you can "get the truth". It should be trivially easy for him to provide evidence of his claims.

       Okay, so the former Deputy Assistant of the Department of State basically admits to treason so that he can sell a few books. I hope you see the problem with that logic. But if you want more evidence, how about a quote from a former U.K. ambassador in this
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/10/cia-concludes-russia-interfered-to-help-trump-win-election-report?CMP=share_btn_tw">
        Guardian article
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       Craig Murray, the former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan, who is a close associate of Assange, called the CIA claims “bullshit”, adding: “They are absolutely making it up.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “I know who leaked them,” Murray said. “I’ve met the person who leaked them, and they are certainly not Russian and it’s an insider. It’s a leak, not a hack; the two are different things.

       Look, people make outlandish claims all the time. Don't you think the government would be trying to prosecute him if he really was the source of the leaks? Think about it. I can admit to murder with impunity. You know why? Because I've never murdered anyone. You need evidence, not just a "confession" on a vlog, to make a case. There is no evidence this guy or his associates are behind the leaks. That's why he can comfortably admit to it without fear of prosecution.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course a "close associate of Assange" would claim that it wasn't the Russians. Again, we ask for actual evidence. Not just people who stand to gain from making unsubstantiated claims.

       And I'll give my opinion/conspiracy theory on why the government isn't openly attacking Pieczenik and his coconspirators.

       Interesting theory. Here's the difference between your theory and the theory that Russia was behind the attacks: the amount and quality of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one hand, you have various security firms, Democrats and Republicans, and government agencies that agree that the evidence points Russia being behind the attacks. On the other hand, you have a guy with a vlog and a website that links to his book and Alex Jones at the very top. A man who directly stands to benefit from having people buy into his claims (book sales, video views, etc.). A man who risks virtually nothing to reap the benefits of making these claims. Learn to apply Occam's razor.

       Just like all of that evidence that led to the invasion of Iraq? They had a pretty compelling case, but it was all bullshit to push an agenda. I learned my lesson after that fiasco, and now I consider it dangerous to blindly accept what they say, especially when there's compelling evidence to not believe them

       Yes, a lot of people believed that Iraq had WMDs. But a lot of people believed they didn't. There was actual, real-life evidence that showed there weren't. I remember because I can admit I thought there
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       WMDs and I would argue with people who showed me evidence to the contrary. Looking back I learned to gauge what is solid evidence, as well as to always remember people self-interested motives. There is no hard evidence that points to anyone
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       than Russia being the source of the leaks. There's evidence and motives it was them. You're only evidence to the contrary is a couple people denying it was the Russians. People who stand to benefit from lying. People who offer no evidence of their own, even though they would be the ones who could most easily prove their claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and as far as your theory about why they don't go after Pieczenik, I could bring up Edward Snowden as a counter-example. The US aggressively pursued him, even though he had the support of a large portion of the public.

       Why are you so averse to believing this? I can get that you would hate Clinton/DNC or that you might think Trump is great. But Clinton's shittiness and/or Trumps greatness, and Russian interference are not mutually exclusive concepts. Is your confirmation bias so strong that you never change your mind?

       Logic is the right way indeed. Let me fix that for you: Hillary and DMC
       <em>
        are definitely
       </em>
       corrupt. And Russian government
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       was behind it.

       I find not extremely dubious how pro-Trump this sub is. I can't recall a previous election where a candidate was as loved here. It's especially heinous considering the cabinet he's putting together of establishment guys like John Bolton who was there when Bush was lying about Iraq...

       Maybe it's just my bias but Paul seems more a propos for this subreddit than Trump in his current form.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump during the primary when he was taking down Jeb! for his brother's part in 9/11 makes sense for conspiracy to champion.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Trump now is a mess...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we can be both concerned with his Russian influences and despise Hillary's involvement in politics. Outside of the CIA's allegations, Trump has been friendly with people friendly to Russia and it seems weird the GOP (for the most part) is fine with that. It was just four years ago that Russia was considered our biggest geopolitical foe by Romney and now many Republicans don't want to talk about Russia or want to talk about Trump's potential cabinet picks with ties to Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thinkl earning why the Republicans are not as anti-Russia as they were four years ago would be interesting to say the least. Obviously the Dems are using this opportunity to scapegoat but there does seem to be something there.

       You are underestimating Russia.  They are in it for themselves and if they did essentially install a puppet, that is a big deal.  Trump's reaction to this is what is most worrisome.  He reacted like a 12 year old that got called a name instead of a statesman.  I'm not a fan of the CIA just like most on this sub, but the president has to work with them.

       Trump spews conspiracy theories left and right - I think he's creating or at least bolstering a relatively new breed of conspiracy theorist, a hyper-partisan variety that will not believe anything that goes against their prime directive, which I suspect in this case is not just Trump but the rise of a populist white nationalist movement. It is different in the level of cooperation and agreement that is emerging. In times past this particular type of propaganda has been effected through takeover of government run media and forceful shutdown of dissent. In the information age it's being done through targeted misinformation: complete discrediting of valid news sources that exhibit unavoidable editorial bias, selective acceptance of citizen journalism with no real sources or facts to back it up. It's like people joining a cult as opposed to a government takeover or coup: people self-select information sources and don't look at anything that contradicts their world view. So, there's some overlap with more traditional conspiracy theorists, but it has this other aspect to it that seems...novel.

       and if anyone has a problem with the CIA coming out and saying that, but waiting on presenting the evidence, then I expect yall were absolutely outraged when Comey came out and said the Hillary investigation was back on, without citing any evidence, right? Im sure if I dig through yalls post histories, Ill find lots of anti-Comey pro-hillary comments in regards to him swaying the election last minute, right?

       I don't see how Russia isn't doing Americans a favor by exposing politicians like this. I hope they do it for every politician including trump. It's not like America hasn't been fucking with Russia for decades. If they were hacking top secret military info that put Americans directly endanger I would be worried. Releasing emails that gives us a better picture of a candidate we are voting to lead our country. I really don't see the harm in that.

       This dumbass said the same thing to me just below. Apparently we have no critical thinking skills for not just outright believing shit, the elites love morons like us, and we're dogs on leashes according to this imbecile.

      <p>
       Apparently, questioning material that comes your way in an ongoing war of information and propaganda is no longer acceptable on r/conspiracy and we're just supposed to believe whatever strangers tell us to.

       So not believing claims made by the CIA without evidence makes everyone in a conspiracy thread a russian stooge? Maybe we just don't want to believe everything thrown our way from "experts". Need i remind anyone of the WMD b.s. that led us into a needless war?

       Don't question anything r/conspiracy , obey or you're supporting russia.

       Ps- no one cared when top secret classified info was taken off secure government devices by
       <em>
        the secretary of state
       </em>
       and uploaded to an illegal unsecured server which was hacked by Russia, China, and multiple other sources... and now all of a sudden russia allegedly gave us TRUE information about THE SAME PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGEST SECURITY BREACH IN HISTORY and there is an uproar? Wtf?

       Dude, I'm a veteran and I want to see that happen.

      <p>
       We've stuck our nose where it doesn't belong far too often. Our foreign policy is a joke, we live in a constant state of war for oil and regime change, we have a history overthrowing democratically elected leaders to replace with dictatorships with western ties, and we've been subverting international law for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our turn as the sole world power has seen abject destruction become the norm. Unipolarity is an insecure system because it allowed the US to be the world's playground bully. If you are frightened that Russia will take over if we lose our sole-superpower status don't, the are in economic shambles and can not take our spot. The move will likely be back to multipolarity in a Westphalian sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to prove Putin is a terrible person use his LGBT treatment, economic cronyism and multiple blatant assassinations of political enemies. People will claim our leaders are just as bad but in these three aspects he stands alone.

       This seriously this
Putin's a globalist that got kicked out of "globalist club" and now holds a a grudge and a lot of resentment. He's not interested in the betterment of the world he is interested in the betterment of Russia and that's it. You're a fool if you think the situation is as easy as Alex Jones says it to be. 
A split in Ukraine benefits both Soros and Putin.

       and I note that it's mainly on the political positioning rather than the evidence of a proven connection between Russia and the hackers. The connection made by DNC-employed CrowdStrike endorsed with "moderate confidence" by SecureWorks is equally rebutted by Jeffrey Carr.

       Seems very circumstantial. Imagining for a moment that the Russian state was involved however, I think there are two questions of interest to me:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Was this aimed at destabalizing the election, or the process as a whole?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Why not now release the RNC stuff (if anything exists)?

       For question 2 it could be that they want to have Trump as a friend who can lift sanctions on them. You don't bite the hand that feeds you. Alternatively they could use any information they have to blackmail officials.

      <p>
       There's a legitimate chance that Russia hacked both parties' servers, and leaked one party's info so that they could blackmail members of the other party post election. Sure, they didn't force the DNC to have shady shit on their servers, but if you think for a second the RNC doesn't have some secrets they don't want getting out you've got to be insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that this sub is laughing this off with "Of course it's those crafty Ruskies again" when the front page is 10 more articles with no new information on fucking pizzagate is actually sad. Hacks are sleeping on what could be one of the biggest conspiracies ever because it doesn't align with their partisanship.

       I didn't expect this sub to be brimming with critical thinkers, but I also didn't expect it to be a nonsense circle jerk either. Can't we be interested in getting to the bottom of the bullshit going on in both sides of the aisle? This ridiculous he-said she-said back and forth is just a distraction from actually answering the important questions that fundamentally all brought us here.

       Then why do you keep siding with Russia when the facts are constantly pointing at there being foul play? Russia wants what the U.S. has. It wants to be a superpower again. Why is it so difficult for you to at least see the possibility that Russia could be fucking with the U.S. to regain geopolitical control? If that were happening wouldn't you want to stop it?

       Ill agree that it is a problem. But you can not say that what Russia did was of any consequence if you think the emails were of no consequence. You actually have to report on the emails in order to convince people what Russia did was wrong in any way. But since that didnt happen...

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Trump supporters admire Putin.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Any evidence for that? Oh, that's right, none is needed to parrot a silly fake-news meme.

       <em>

       Hillary's missing state dept emails never were published. The main missing ones where Bengazi timeline stuff. Stuff that would piss people off and catch her lies to congress. All we have are some FOIA stuff on that. So that means Russia has them ( since every secret source says they did it), and didn't make them public.
      </p>
      <p>
       So either Russia didn't want to publish her worst dirt to help get Trump elected, or they didn't want to publish her worst dirt so they could use it against her if she did get elected.

       I keep seeing this about Russian Hacks being the "great conspiracy of our day" but I've yet to see anything that even suggests it. Some person supposedly with the CIA anonymously said Russia hacked the election, and only WAPO got it? We're taking about the geniuses leading the fake news witch hunt who used what equates to a fake news site as one of its sources. While I'm in full agreement this Pizzagate shit is way overblown for being barely supported with evidence, but at least those people are working at something from a basis,  not just the marching call of a bad Media outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are going to talk about the election, a better question isn't puttin, but Assange. Is he afraid of Clinton, did he strike a deal with Donald? Or is WL just publishing the only stuff it can get?

       This post outlines the evidence that Russia is behind the hackings, the biggest pieces being that the hackers reused a SSL certificate from an earlier attack that Germany linked to Russia, and that 3 independent Cybersecurity firms all came to the conclusion that the attack was from Russia. The evidence here is pretty hard to argue against, and it seems like there is consensus among the experts. This was also covered by nearly every news source, not just WaPo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new information that was leaked was that Russia also hacked the RNC but chose not to release that info for whatever reason. This would imply that it wasn't just Russia trying to dig up whatever they could to make the U.S. look bad, but rather that they were specifically trying to swing the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't as much "hard evidence" for this, the leak was just the other day and the CIA hasn't released a report yet. However, the fact that the CIA has yet to comment on the leaks is a good indicator that they are legitimate.

       Definitely an interesting read. Now I'm not a cyber expert, but the evidence relies on the fact that the Russians used a similar set of tools and servers as previous, but what prevents someone from intentionally leaving those tracks to get someone else blamed, I.e. increase tension between Russia and USA? Is there something built in that prevents this kind of fraud?
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate to agree with Trump as well, but we are also dealing with a reality where a mountain of evidence can be perceived in a way to point to multiple conclusions (what appeared to be WMDs and Saddam bluffing,) and it's pretty important that something like this be correct this time. Additionally RNC chair claims there was no hack on RNC, aND FBI says there's no proof on it being Russians.

       Ya but the really damaging emails resulting in pizzagate and spiritcooking trends came from Podesta, who's Gmail password was P@ssword
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       he fell for a phishing scam.
      </p>

       Everytime someone yells "ITS THE RUSSIANS" it's embarassing to know how utterly incompetent Hillary's camp was in email security. Russians could've done it, but then so could an 8th grader.

       Until an intelligence agency is willing to come forward publicly with irrefutable evidence and have an official declaration that yes, the russians did it, I'll continue to ignore the death throws of the dnc and whining of the left who are more concerned about the 8th grader that aired their dirty laundry then they are about the contents of said laundry.

       I see this evidence being flogged a lot. It attempts to impress with technically credible sources, but totally ignores basic facts of the interested parties in the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guccifer 1.0 was a real "hacker" and was arrested. Guccifer 2.0 was a false flag—and a ridiculous one. Does anyone remember the supposed Clinton Foundation leaks from Guccifer 2.0, with the "Pay to Play" folder? What credibility did it have? How damaging was it for the election? What was the value there? Yet this is being pumped up as the hack source? And its effect on the election was nothing next to that of the DNC and Podesta email leaks. The "hacks" you refer to are just theater to cover up for the fact that the DNC leaks and Podesta's emails come from insiders, not Russia. Oh, and to provide an alternate theory of the DNC leaks to cover for whacking Seth Rich.

       If you want to talk about plausible conspiracies, why don't you look at all of the insiders and whistleblowers who are saying that people from our own intel agencies leaked the emails, and it has nothing to do with Russia. You can try to degrade the users here, but many of us have read up extensively on this matter and can differentiate a conspiracy from propaganda

       Are you defending state owned media catered to foreign countries?
      </p>
      <p>
       So when the divided "media collective" is privately owned and caters to groups of people who are equally divided. That's terrible, the world has gone to shit. 
But a state owned media source who's entire function is to target foriegn competitors for its personal interests. Those are the real patriots and truth seekers.

       Are you familiar with Russia's legacy of disinformation to the point of crippling entire nations?

       Maybe I am 15, but at least my reading comprehension level isn't that of a 6 year old. I guess I need to spell it out for you. My point was that we have insiders and whistleblowers who are claiming that
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       leaked the emails to Wikileaks, not the Russians. This is a much more substantial development than 'anonymous sources' claiming Russia could've influenced the election

       Edward Snowden, the person responsible for our nations biggest security leak is living comfortably in Russia right now. Wikileaks has been a Russian mouth piece since 2013.

       You don't think those claims are significant? I will withhold judgment until any official reports are released proving Russian involvement, but all of the evidence needs to be considered. Right now we have vague statements from some sources in the intelligence community, and we have statements from credible individuals claiming that the leaks came from people within the U.S. government. Who knows, maybe they can prove these people are Russian agents. All I'm saying is we should keep an open mind and consider all possibilities that have evidence supporting them.

       Some guy? These people aren't your average Joe Schmoe. One is a former ambassador, one is a former NSA agent who helped develop many of the programs that Snowden exposed, and the other is the former Deputy Assistant of the Department of State who served in four presidential administrations. If you think their testimony is flimsy as fuck, then I question your ability to analyze the situation objectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, you're exaggerating the claim that every Western intelligence agency agrees on this. Many of them are claiming there is evidence of Russian interference, but they are divided on how conclusive this evidence is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, did we see any dissenting voices from the intelligence community when we invaded Iraq even though they doubted the existence of WMDs? No, because they were doing their job and couldn't disclose such information. Nonetheless, the people in power fabricated and exaggerated evidence to push a hidden agenda. The CIA is also known to have lied in the past in order to support the President's objectives. Why is it so difficult to remain skeptical until more facts come to light?

       Yes, wake up yourself. Do you know where you are? This is r/conspiracy, not r/trusttheestablishment. Why the fuck would I give special credence to "every western intelligence service and multiple media investigations"? Waking up means learning to question exactly the sources you're citing as authority. And in this sub of all places. Hilarious.

       First, you're being horribly unspecific. We are arguing about the source of the leaks. Specifically, the ones that had an impact on the election. That would be the DNC leaks and Podesta's emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are claiming that Russians were responsible for hacking these systems and leaking the mail, and I am saying they did not. That is the truth in question here, upon which further deductions about various agendas might depend.
      </p>
      <p>
       And my reasons for not believing your theory, I will provide by repeating what I told someone elsewhere:
      </p>
      <p>
       For the DNC leaks, Assange all but bluntly states that it was leaked (not hacked) by Seth Rich:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For Podesta's email, we don't have the name of the leaker, but in the Pilger interview, Assange says that the leak is from a "Washington insider". Craig Murray, an associate of Assange and a generally credible source, says as much, claiming that he has even met the leaker and that it was, again, a "Washington insider":
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/12/cias-absence-conviction/">
        https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/12/cias-absence-conviction/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the credibility of the CIA's recent claims, the ones you're basing your indignation about Russian meddling on? Consider this dose of skepticism from Glenn Greenwald:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/10/anonymous-leaks-to-the-washpost-about-the-cias-russia-beliefs-are-no-substitute-for-evidence/">
        https://theintercept.com/2016/12/10/anonymous-leaks-to-the-washpost-about-the-cias-russia-beliefs-are-no-substitute-for-evidence/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       When faced with conflicting accounts, evaluate those accounts and how well they correspond to other known facts. And acknowledge that either account here, in theory, could be a lie. So are you suggesting that this poorly sourced story from the Washington Post and the CIA is more believable than the person who at least knows from whom he directly received the leak? Do the CIA and Washington Post have a better track record for honesty than Assange? I've chosen my answer to that question, and I'm pretty damn comfortable with it for now.

       Then who did? What evidence do you have for that? Seriously, I'm goign to lay out a case, with evidence, of why its the Russians. You should be able to do the same for whomever you think did it. Can you?

      <p>
       Are you aware that this is what Russia has been doing for decades now, going back to the Soviet Union? Interfering with elections is their MO. Sowing seeds of discontent using a "fountain of lies" propaganda is literally how they try and weaken their opponents. They recently did it in Ukraine.
       <em>
        We know this about them.
       </em>
       We also know they are mad at Obama and Clinton. Trumps statements make it clear that he is Russia's preferred leader. So given that you have to be naive to expect Russia not to try and do something just like this, like they do everywhere,
       <em>
        What are the Russians doing if not what is being reported?
       </em>
       Given the threat of the United State's to them, they'd have to be crazy not to do this, wouldn't they?
      </p>
      <p>
       Throw into this Trump's bizarre praise of Putin, Trump disregarding his own intelligence services and acting in public as if he had never heard the briefings, Trump's selections of very pro-Russian cabinet picks,
       <a href="https://twitter.com/keitholbermann/status/808066577715384320">
        Trump literally reading verbatim the words of Russian media propaganda
       </a>
       (I can't stand Obermann, but everything he says is publicly available, he just connects the dots). And that's not even all of it. The context is crystal clear to anyone willing to just spend some thinking about it. This is the conspiracy sub. Here is one that is literally laid out right in front of you. You don't even have to make any leaps of logic or faith. Its right there staring you in the face.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm 46 years old. I lived through the end of the cold war where we always suspected there was a decent chance we'd be incinerated in a nuclear war. Our enemy was the Soviets. They are now the Russians. Russians run the KGB playbook when it comes to foreign intelligence. Putin was a foreign intelligence KGB officer for 16 years. I am more scared of what is happening in my country than when I thought we'd might be nuked. And most of my fear is that the people that I expect to be able to sniff this stuff out are completely blind to it.

       Can you read? This question is answered in my post. I gave you direct quotes from the people accepting the leaked documents, and I explained why I trust those sources more than this WaPo CIA article, so ... I guess re-read that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am aware that Russia has hacked US government targets on multiple occasions. I also believe it's likely that they have their own copies of the contents of Hillary's private email server, which I've heard was nearly open to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       But after this point, you again want to argue in a very non-specific way, "The Russians have hacked us." "Putin is former KGB." A lot of your argument is simply based on anti-Russian prejudice. They aren't saints, but you're judging them by a double standard. They seek to protect national interests, as America does. I'm neither American nor Russian, but I find your faith in the CIA troubling. Have you never visited this sub before? Anyway, you said you were going to give evidence.

        Where is the evidence that Russia supplied the DNC and Podesta leaks, specifically?

       Anti-Russian prejudice? That's a joke. I didn't give two shits about Russia before this election. I knew how they operated though. You don't get to have it both ways. If they are going to protect themselves against the US, this is how they do it. Or are we not that big a threat after all?

       You didn't address my question about evidence, but that's fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        cui bono
       </em>
       test that you're referring to is an interesting starting point for understanding a potential conspiracy; it helps to determine whether it even makes sense. But it is not sufficient in itself to determine the nature of events, especially when interested parties have every incentive to cloak their true interests. "Russians benefited from the election of Trump. Trump won the election. Therefore, Russians are responsible for getting him elected." This is fallacious reasoning. It ignores the much more important factions
       <em>
        within the US deep state
       </em>
       that clearly support Trump. In case you haven't noticed, Trump has most of the FBI, the MIC, and possibly the NSA in his corner; the CIA, or elements of it, is not. If you want to know why Hillary lost the election, I suggest you consider that your own deep state was not comfortable with the particular brand of criminality that Hillary represented. The Russians are not nearly as central to the election outcome as the media, who are still serving the array of interests that Hillary represented, want you to believe.

       And why does this matter exactly? Funny that Russia provides the transparency this fucking "democracy" would need in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you quantify how those emails vs. other factors influenced the election results? Why are you so sure Hillary would have won without the email leaks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, let me remind you the importance of words and how fake news are generated and then pushed by these so called "journalists" circlejerking: Russia didn't "hack" the election. It hacked a private email server, which happens every day. Also, claiming that Russia had shit on the Republicans, which I don't doubt exist and somehow didn't publish those is a conspiracy theory in and itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all these circlejerking "journalists" who lost all their credibility during the campaign anways are trying WAY too hard to discredit Trump.

      <p>
       Now calling them out on this is considered "pro-Trump" somehow. I'm not a huge Trump fan but I'm a fan of unbiased political discussion, and it's actually pretty fucking clear which side is more unbiased nowadays, and which side has more media power and lies all the time, distorts news, reports fake news then never follow up (where are all those women who Trump supposedly "raped"), and so on.

       sub would be all about taking this shitty unsubstantiated WaPo article with un-named CIA "sources" at face value. And someone here gilded this shit?

      <p>
       Read the following for a little bit of grown up skepticism about the horseshit you're trying to pass off as "a legitimate chance", despite the directly contradictory statements of Assange, the person who at the very least had direct contact with the leakers themselves.

       Oh, and since you have such faith in the sincerity of anonymous CIA sources in the government, maybe you can just accept this FBI report at face value, because, you know, the FBI is the agency principally involved in investigating allegations of domestic espionage.

       But no, over all the credibility of these sources, people in r/conspiracy, if they were rational by your lights, would accept the word of the WaPo as sock-puppeted by someone in the CIA. Sorry but no.

       John McCain, a friggin REPUBLICAN has said that if there is any idea that a foreign power could meddle with our elections, every American should be concerned.
      </p>

       It's disgusting that the microscope is not pointed at ALL people in power - just one side. The winner should be held to even higher responsibility than the loser of a major election.

       Nice switch, but unfortunately the fact that

       is sponsored by the US

       Not really a Trump supporter, so I won't waste time defending his cabinet picks. Just pointing out that your initial point of "even a REPUBLICAN" is not in any way a good argument in favor of the
       <em>

       brought up McCain as if he lent some credence to your point, and I chose to address that and will stick with it, thanks. Syria and Russia are related and so is McCain, and that is why I am saying he cannot be trusted to tell you a damn thing about who possibly hacked the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was part of the whole CFR regime change agenda. Donald, whether you like him or not, is going to reverse that agenda. McCain has basically committed treason (by knowingly sponsoring ISIS) to topple Assad. He is too tied in with the events in Syria.

       I'm definitely against Hillary 100%, but I'm not a Trump supporter. How could I be, when Trump was specifically chosen
       <em>
        by Hillary
       </em>
       as the opposing Republican candidate, the one whose obnoxious views would make him easiest to defeat in the general election, the one who her allies in the media would "elevate" as the "Pied Piper" candidate?

       There's a leaked email you won't often see Trump supporters call attention to. Feel free to use it in any arguments you may have with Trump supporters in the future. I will credit him, however, with the pleasure he gave me as an appreciator of irony, as Hillary's "Pied Piper" truly did run off with the whole village.

       Ok, lets assume for the sake of argument that Russia is behind the leaks. What then? The election was still legitimate and Trump is still president. He has done nothing impeachable and has no personal responsibility for the actions of a third party. What is next? Does it make any practical difference if the information came from a Russian agent or a disgruntled whistle-blower or the Washington post before it was forwarded to Wikileaks? What is anyone proposing to be done?

       Gee, I wonder what possible reasons Russia could have for wanting to get the U.S. to elect a non-leader with absolutely zero experience in politics at a time when the world is at its highest point of tension in decades? A narcissistic fool falls for every single reverse psychology trick in the book and is triggered faster than a 13 year old girl on Tumblr. A man who in all likeliness owes a lot of money to Russia – money that he probably doesn't have. It couldn't be that if they succeeded in getting some type of man like that into the White House that they would have complete control over the U.S. government. And even if they did that they wouldn't use that strength to leverage themselves back to the top of the geopolitical stage while destroying us in the process.

       i am really glad you got that off your chest but I was not asking about motive. I was asking how we proceed if we assume the russians are the source of the Wikileaks emails.

       This is unprecedented territory. If it turns out to be true there should certainly be people losing there job or going to trail for trying to cover it up until after the election. As for who wins? I think the procedure is for Biden to take office while it's worked out.

       If Russia did in fact release the info then I am inclined to believe the election has been compromised by a third party (and argueably Americas biggest enemy.). Surely most people would agree that you just cant let that stand.

       The election was lawful and will be certified. any delay would have been led by Obamas administration so go ahead and investigate. however there is zero constitutional allowance for a do over in elections Trump has done nothing to impeach for so we are left with what some sort of coup?

       My ego? People like you are literally advocating for a coup in The United States because your still salty about losing a fair election. Who gives a shit that your upset, you don't get a do over. The election is legit.

       It would appear that HRC is behind it now. Her ex campaign has asked for all electors to get a intelligence briefing by the Obama administration. Sounds like a coup to me.

       With bipartisan support. It is not a coup against a party, or even against Trump himself. Why would anybody be against finding out the truth? I simply don't get why being ignorant and risking the worst is worth it. Ignorance is not always bliss.

       What would be the reason for the briefing by the Obama administration except to foment a coup through the electoral college? They do not need the administrations view on anything to know how their states have told them to vote. This is the kind of thing that happens in banana republics.

       With all of the actual "hacked" emails (podesta) nobody is even entertaining the thought that Podesta and anyone else that had their emails copied are actually the ones at fault here. If it was phishing it was Podesta fault, if it was a weak password it was Podesta fault, if it was poor security it was Podesta fault.

       The DNC emails were likely handed over by an insider and the actions of the DNC are the reason for them to be made public.

       Accountability for these things lies strictly in the hands of those that made it necessary for their communications to be brought out of the darkness.

       Who gives a shit what method was used...? Rather, what is the difference whether Russia used a phishing attack to obtain and disseminate information with the intent of undermining a United States Presidential Election or they hacked into his email server to accomplish the same thing? Furthermore, do you have any evidence at all to substantiate your claim that "the DNC emails were likely handed over by an insider"?

       First there is no proof the Russian government did anything.  The FBI has stated this.  It could have been "Russians" and/or others. 
Second, if there was nothing incriminating to reveal then the boogeyman "Russians" wouldn't have been able to influence shit.  It's like the DNC loaded up a car full of meth and left it running with the doors unlocked in the middle of a trailer park.  Then acted indignant when Tuco Salamanca drove off with it.

       The FBI (along with the CIA, NSA and many others) has also stated that they strongly believe that Russia was behind the DNC infiltration. I really don't understand the basis of your second statement. Assuming they covered their tracks well enough to not leave anything incriminating, how exactly would that preclude them from being able to influence the election by releasing harmful information? (Which was done - there's no argument about that.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you believe every US intelligence agency has a reason to lie about this? And if you do take them at their word, then setting the  carelessness of Podesta and other DNC staffers aside, do you really have no issue with Russia doing this? Whether you supported Hillary or Trump, this is a global rival directly putting their finger in our Democratic process to their own calculated benefit.

       I'm skeptical because I believe that the current administration is in control of those agencies to a large degree and they will say what they are told to say.  The DOJ has been completely corrupted and there is absolutely no argument about that.  It's not a far toss to think that the three letter agencies are much the same.  The higher ups are controlled by the Obama administration, and the Obama admin is out to get Trump.  So we have "Russian hackers".  There are other sources who have said the leaks have been coming from internal whistle blowers.
       <br/>
       I'm skeptical of all of them.  I'm not just going to go "oh okay well some dude in a suit who works for an alphabet agency made some statement to some MSM outlet so it must be true!  Now I'm going to go watch football and get fat eating wings!"  Nope.
Also, "strongly believe" is not evidence.  It's propaganda.

      <p>
       I don't buy it.  I need more.  I'm not saying it isn't true.  I'm saying I have not been convinced with evidence.

       Because the military industrial complex wants a nice war or proxy war to make some more money. Do you not think all of our 3 letter agencies help and support the military industrial complex? If you don't you might be fucking stupid

       I closed the door to my house but didn't lock the door properly, someone came in and took all my stuff, then used these items to shame my family and I during a very public period of time. Is this a robbery?

       Um, yes? So if a bank robber robs a bank and the safe happens to be open when he gets there making it easier to steal the money, does that somehow make it ok for them to take it and also make them no longer bank robbers?

       No, they are thieves, these are robberies, and they should have consequences. Instead I'm seeing what's essentially victim-blaming for "letting it happen" and then a sort of reverse victimization where the content of the thefts makes the stolen-from party a culprit in another "crime," thus negating the theft from relevance.

       All of this while DONALD TRUMP likely ran the most privately toxic campaign in modern history, which I assert based on the fact that it was incredibly toxic publicly. It hurts to even consider the larger picture.

       Funny how the leaks didn't have a shred of classified info or even the faintest trace of any info that could hurt the USA, despite being real and damning for the involved parties.

       They didn't leak those emails- all the emails from the day Benghazi happened were gone.  I thought the FBI was keeping them as classified evidence so they could prosecute her, maybe they still are but after Trump steps in.  They said they were capturing the classified emails.
      </p>

       Edit: They didn't leak the classified emails but it's clear on important dates the emails were missing.

       Almost definitely true.
You gotta admit, it is really strange though... she's single-handedly responsible for the largest security breach in our country's history (yes, top secret classified info was hacked from her UNSECURED server by Russia, China, and other world powers) and most people don't give a shit at all. She gets a "get out of jail free" card after paying the wife of someone investigating her almost a million bucks and having her husband ex president meet with the head of the DOJ just before the trial, still no one cares. They don't care about that same security breach when she runs for President.... And now that she has lost, people are upset that russia may have hacked podesta's emails (whose password was "password" and revealed TRUE information about her and the people surrounding her, and their countless list of nefarious deeds...
I just... Can't wrap my head around it. I really can't.

       You don't waste a million dollar exploit on a guy who used "password" as his password.  And so far, there hasn't been any evidence revealed on exactly what kind of classified information Clinton had on her email server and whether it was compromised by state actors.

       <p>
        The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.

       I didn't know he said that. Regardless the statement is self evident in my opinion, just look around you and realize that liberal media has been trying to take him down since before the election. This is just the latest angle they can think of.

       Collusion between the democrats and the media is no secret at this stage, even look around on reddit and you will find collusion. My statement isn't a far stretch by any means, I don't need anyones company to witness what's obvious. One trip to politics during the election to find 100% anti-Trump stories is enough to convince me.

       hey sadsack do you understand how a CIA investigation works? obama is due all the facts by whatever deadline he gave. the investigation is still underway. literally the ONLY thing that was reported was that there is a shocking amount of evidence behind the idea that russia interfered. Wait another month and you'll get an entire report of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you have a problem with the CIA stating that ahead of the report release/inauguration date, then I suspect you were just as vocal when Comey came out, days before the election, and swayed it by stating unsubstantiated drivel about muh server!!! or are you just another partisan blowhard?

       You're probably a trump supporter since you defended him though.

       All I'm saying is that where trump supporters go, shills follow. It's toxic, but it's not trump supporters fault it's CTR. It's just a shitty side effect.

       I don't know how many times it must be repeated until the message sinks in. But -- "Where is the evidence?" -- Citation is needed, what we need is a source that suggests it's true, but there isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could tell you that I'm sitting right next to Big Foot &amp; have no evidence to show as proof and you'd still want people circulating this with no sources to cite other than my word for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like the claims that Hillary Clinton got 3 million Illegal Immigrant votes, I'm not going to believe that bullshit until a source citing evidence presents itself -- but I will suggest that if it's true, Hillary Clinton not only lost the Popular vote by 1 million votes, she lost both the Popular &amp; Electoral. But again, I digress, there's no evidence to suggest that the allegation is true so, why must we buy in to an allegation about the possibility of Russia interfering with the election?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Russia helped Trump win the election by interference, and that's some how an automatic disqualifier, then would you not say that Hillary Clinton is equally as disqualified because she had help with foreign aid? Hillary Clinton having foreign aid is actually a provable fact and has been exposed to be true that her campaign was influenced by foreign aid via Saudi Arabia's ties to the Clinton Foundation amongst others who payed into the Clinton Foundation in exchange for Government favors &amp; influences.

       It's called Google, easy to fact check these things. Various articles you can click to check out if you want, though I'm certain that you're already of the opinion that everything on Clinton is fair game &amp; that I have no complaints about Trump &amp; that he's just the perfect little lamb or something.

      <p>
       Look at this way, I don't believe any shit about Clinton until the a court of law convicts her in Court. Simple as. Now that Trump won, what is stopping him from trying to put her in jail via the normal way? Oh wait, he is no longer interested in doing that despite his big mouth promising to do so.

       Depends on how long you've been into Politics to know who Hillary Clinton was/is prior to the 2016 bid for presidency. I've known about both of these people (Trump &amp; Clinton) since the 90's, Donald Trump has been very good at what he does (which is Entertaining, he's a very good actor), if you want to know who the real Donald Trump is, the real Donald Trump is the type of person who will hire someone for a job, and if that person doesn't do a good job then he will find someone who will do a good job &amp; hire them. Trump is the type of person, who if you give him a role to play, then he depict that role in a believable fashion. He played the "Bad Guy" on WWE once &amp; he depicted himself as a "Bad Guy" &amp; he was good at it, it was entertaining. So, if you give him the role to play President, he will depict himself as a President in a Presidential fashion (more than likely). To put it bluntly, Trump is a successful Con Artist. The only person making the claim that Trump is the perfect little lamb, a "Virgin Mary", is people such as yourself who like to make it out like every argument in defense of Donald Trump is what you make it out to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any thing critical of Donald Trump compared to Hillary, you know, the "Literally Hitler" slogan, based on nothing but perception  &amp; emotional projections. Didn't believe any of it. Racist, bigoted, hateful, sexist, xenophobe, homophobe, transphobe, Islamophobe, etc. These labels, the slandering, obviously doesn't work find something else such as a real argument &amp; articulate it in a way that doesn't accuse or accentuates or projects your opinionated spun narrative. Clinton on the other hand, people cited sources, laid out the facts, &amp; let the evidence speak for itself, it just happens the overwhelming majority who saw that evidence came to the same conclusion, where-as the big difference here between Donald Trump &amp; Hillary Clinton is actually pretty obvious. The consensus on Clinton was generally &amp; majority came to the same conclusion by individuals, and the conclusions about Trump were all over the place you couldn't pin them down, mostly because the definitions of all the slandering labels did not match up.

       As far as I am concerned, I don't care whether the news is the so called "lame stream media" or google facts. I am a firm believer of innocent until proven guilty. As far as I am concerned about Trump, that too applies, despite the stench of Russian manipulation and the fact he openly has asked the Russians to interfere during his campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I find fucking hilarious about you lot here is that Clinton is guilty no matter what she does yet the Donald could be forgiven no matter the evidence. Trump is incapable of conspiracy it seems....

       Like I said, Clinton is always the whore while Trump is the innocent virgin. Pathetically obvious double standard.

       Citation needed, show me where I say "Donald Trump is forgiven no matter the evidence" -- Do you recognize that fallacy of such a statement? I say that there's a lack of evidence and you say that I'm denying the existence of evidence? Why? Where is the evidence, show me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually saw the conference where Donald Trump spoke about encouraging Russia to "hack", but again, I can't say that that, in and of itself, is evidence that Russia was involved in any hacks. WHERE is the evidence that they were?
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump is only guilty of saying stupid &amp; retarded things at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know what truth, facts, evidence, statistics, etc. are? Because that's what is missing here when you make your case in arguments against Donald Trump. Give me anything for citation. Don't just link me to an article, where all the article does is project an opinionated narrative, they make a claim, but fail to link a credible source for why they believe this or that or how &amp; why it's evidence of any thing. You can't just make wild claims with out citation like that and expect people to believe you who are outside of confirmation bias.

       Precisely. There are now growing allegations that Russia has interfered into your elections and got Trump into power, which in default, basically fucking you lot and you have given so much the benefit of the doubt to him, claiming that he is "merely guilty of saying stupid things".
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if the same allegation involves Clinton....my god, you will probably be frothing in the mouth by now.

       Hence my argument about bias and double standards.

        The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.

        So here is the deal - you are never likely to see hard proof. The amount of info CrowdStrike was allowed to release is already miles ahead of what almost any other similar forensic investigation is allowed to make public. I've done a number of these for some very large entities, and the most I've ever been allowed to say is "we're investigating a potential incident".
       </p>
       <p>
        I've had incidents where I was all but positive who was responsible, but the FBI would not allow us to publicly attribute it because there was still a margin of doubt. If the NSA (and many other independent researchers) are willing to say "Yes, this was Russia," you can bet your ass they have a mountain of evidence behind that.
       </p>
       <p>
        CrowdStrike are some of the very best in the business and were the ones responding to the DNC hack. Here is the evidence they were cleared to provide publicly:

       </p>
       <p>
        (Again, keep in mind there is nothing nefarious about not sharing these details publicly. You will find very few entities that suffered a hack willing to allow responders to make even this much public.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally there is a good deal of evidence (technical, social, and circumstantial) that Guccifer 2.0 is an identity created by the Russian intelligence services to keep eyes off of them.

       <p>
        These are three highly respected, independent sources all arriving at the same conclusion. To date I have not been able to find any credible sources that have had access to the details of the cases that have come to any other conclusion. If every independent professional investigating the breaches comes to the same conclusion, you can be pretty certain the evidence is all but overwhelming - whether or not you are authorized to see it yourself.

       All of which are speculation, absolutely nothing to suggest that any of this is true with irrefutable evidence or sources cited.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know who hacked the e-mails, some might even suggest (but no evidence to back this up) that the DNC staffer who suicide by shot to the back of the head, is the one who leaked the information, and for doing so, he was assassinated &amp; it was made to look like a mugging. Now, unless we can link evidence that suggest the DNC staffer was working as a Russian secret agent, I have to throw this out as a credible source to rely on whether he was a Russian spy or just a DNC staffer who didn't like where things was going -- or he committed suicide via shot to the back of the head for the shits &amp; giggles.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is enough to speculate though that the reason a lot of sources remain anonymous is because there's a possible threat to their life being in danger should they out themselves. So, depending on the things that the public does not know because we're not privy with access to these kinds of information, I'm afraid that all of this is going to be nothing but unconfirmed accusations. We can demand the Freedom of Information Act, but that only gets us so far and often times doesn't lead us to any answers that we're looking for, and only confirm what was already common knowledge or speculated to begin with.

       It doesn't matter whether that's true or not, because I'd rather focus on why there was even any corruption to begin with &amp; hold them accountable.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you woke up one morning to find your vehicle vandalized &amp; someone had left video &amp; photographic evidence as proof showing you who it was that did it, are you going to move Heaven &amp; Earth to find out who it was that snitched, or are you going to press charges on the person who trashed your car?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a line to be drawn, of course, the question should never be "where" do we draw the line, but "when" do we draw the line. I'm not interested in the truth? I think it was pretty clear that I want evidence &amp; sources cited that suggest it is true, what you gave me was a bunch of speculations &amp; accusations. Assertions, eh? Tell me, what assertion is strong enough to suggest that this is real, that Russia hacked our voting machines or influenced the election results? You do realize first &amp; foremost, the voting machines are not connected to the Internet, if someone was going to "hack" the voting machines, it's going to take some knowledge in engineering or reverse-engineering to physically tamper with the machines in person, and absolutely nobody is going to get away with something like that out in the open. if evidence exist that the voting machines was tampered with, please present a source citing this as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Russia influenced the election results, I have to disagree on the assertion based on not "not" being interested in the truth, but based on there being no strong credible evidence cited that suggests it is a proven irrefutable  fact. The only thing I could say Russia may be guilty of right now that has any merit to the idea that Russia interfered with the election results, it's when Putin announced &amp; said that a vote for Trump meant peace &amp; a vote for Clinton meant a WW3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again just to reiterate, if it's a disqualifier for a foreign Nation to aid a Presidential candidate on their campaign for Presidency, and if strong evidence that suggests Donald Trump is guilty of this, then would you also agree on the assertion that Hillary Clinton too should be equally disqualified for her ties to Saudi Arabia aiding her campaign amongst other foreign aid through favors &amp; influence being sold via the Clinton Foundation, which actually does have strong evidence to suggest that this is an irrefutably fact to be true? By the way, nobody is making the argument to say --
       <em>
        "so it's okay if Donald Trump/Republicans do it but if Hillary Clinton/Democrats do it it's not okay?"
       </em>
       -- nobody is saying that.

       Trump’s behavior, however, has at times concerned the Russians, leading them to revise their hacking and disinformation strategy. For example, when Trump launched into an inexplicable attack on the parents of a Muslim-American soldier who died in combat, the Kremlin assumed the Republican nominee was showing himself psychologically unfit to be president and would be forced by his party to withdraw from the race. As a result, Moscow put its hacking campaign temporarily on hold, ending the distribution of documents until Trump stabilized, both personally and in the polls, according to reports.

       FBI issued an unprecedented warning to state election officials urging them to be on the lookout for intrusions into their election systems and to take steps to upgrade security measures across the voting process, including voter registration, voter rolls and election-related websites. The confidential “flash” alert said investigators had detected attempts to penetrate election systems in several states.

       ...attackers would probe election offices in advance to find ways to break into computers. Closer to election, when it was clear from polling which states would have close margins, the attackers might spread malware into machines in some of these states, rigging machines to shift a few % of the vote to favor desired candidate. This malware would likely be designed to remain inactive during preelection tests, do its dirty business during election, then erase itself when polls close. A skilled attacker’s work might leave no visible signs though the country might be surprised when results in several close states were off from preelection polls.

       Sorry but I'm gonna have to throw out a lot of those "sources" as most are biased left leaning or have just flat out been debunked already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't cite any thing from NYT, r/politics , r/worldnews , USAToday, Forbes, Washington Post, The Federalist, New Yorker, Politico, News Week, Time, Reuters (any thing from Yahoo News is not credible source any more), Buzzfeed (especially Buzzfeed), CNN, The Guardian, The Hill, PBS, -- I have to throw out all of these immediately with out having to read them mostly because I've already read them, and nothing they've come out with was anything substantial as cited evidence that would suggest that Russia had any thing to do with the Election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't need to list any thing from InfoWars, Breitbart or the famed "Alt-Media", all of those don't list any facts, statistics, or evidence. I'm a huge advocate for stating facts, evidence &amp; statistics, laying them all out there, and letting it speak for itself rather than someone giving me their opinion &amp; projecting the idea that it's real. I can't just have someone telling me what to believe because I'm perfectly capable of critical thinking skills &amp; coming to a conclusion to form an opinion myself with out someone trying to force their narrative on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of what you see in MSM today is nothing but an echo-chamber, which is just confirmation bias, which is you're not going to believe or trust any thing else if it's something that you already disagree with. I will take a look at a few of the there "sources" you cited though but don't be surprised if I don't just automatically believe &amp; agree with it 100%.

       Like, for instance, the Haitians. The tsunami, earthquake disasters, etc. We were told for example that we were donating to help rebuild &amp; aid relief for the Haitians, yet there was no actual aid relief or rebuilding. Even the recent hit to Haiti, what I saw with my own eyes, were Haitians pleading with America NOT to donate to the same scam that they were exploited for. You know, there was something very telling about that, they were more concerned about Americans being scammed of these supposed "Relief Efforts", than of their own predicament. So, I believe what my own eyes &amp; ears are telling me there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Hillary Clinton vote in favor of going to war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc?  My eyes &amp; ears are telling me yes, she did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Donald Trump talk about grabbing a woman by the pussy? My eyes &amp; ears told me, yes. But did he actually do it? My eyes &amp; ears tell me, no, he didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Donald Trump guilty of the Trump University scandal? Well let's see, money in the bank accounts, police reports, lawsuits filed, etc. My eyes &amp; ears are telling me, yes. And were these things settled in a court? Eyes &amp; ears are telling me, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you've got evidence to cite that would suggest that Russia is responsible for any thing about this election, it better be something that my eyes &amp; ears actually believe.

       What I believe &amp; trust are my own eyes &amp; ears, and traditional definitions of words (as opposed to the broad-brush terms, slogans, labels &amp; slander). I'm not going to 100% believe articles written by anybody (especially if they are click-bait titles) projecting an opinionated narrative.

       Here are the independent reports, these do not use biased language it is all laid out plainly.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'm all for skepticism when it comes to attribution, but when several of the top cybersecurity firms, and the NSA come out and say "it was Russia", I think we can accept that it's true.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here are links to some of those reports as well as some background info. Keep in mind, these firms give the same threat actor different names for their own reasons. ex. APT28=Dukes=Bears

       Question, if it's true that Russia did hack e-mails, influence the election in some way, etc. Is that at all possibly an indication, that Clintons private e-mail servers (the deleted e-mails) were... "not secure"? Just curious, because if there's any evidence that would lead to or link Russia to being even remotely involved, then wouldn't it be possible that the evidence is some where in at least one of those deleted e-mails?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just interesting to think about, can't really say for sure though.

       None of the Wikileaks or guciffer leaks were from Clinton's server.
      </p>
      <p>
       The leaks were podesta /dnc emails. Clinton's emails were obtained through foi requests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia likely hacked the RNC too, as I linked above. The question really is not IF Russia hacked, it's why they hacked both and only released the dems emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is why this stinks of foreign meddling.

       It looks more like propaganda to spin a narrative to me. I mean, I see claims that two Russian agencies are involved but doesn't link a source that proves the connections exist, I can only say that they are wild claims at the moment, because with out a source showing a connection, it's more like walking right off a cliff or running a dead end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guccifer 2.0, sounds more like a convenient scapegoat to spin a narrative, no physical body it's more like a persona, or "Anonymous" at this point, someone innocent is likely dead right now but we'll never know because he couldn't make it to a trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       One lone hacker trying to take claim of responsibility for the hack but it sounds more like a troll, don't even know who this person is and can't even tell if the claims can be substantiated, much less be a link proving any connection was Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it seems like the only connection to Russia here, is apparently the "lone hacker" Guccifer 2.0 used a VPN to mask his real location by using a Russian IP address or proxy, and this is some how projected as evidence that Russia is involved?.. I don't see the connection of strong suggestion that Russia is to blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I need to give my brain a rest after reading all of that, most of it sounded like the author of these articles didn't even know what the hell he/she was talking about. It sounds like gullible people read those posts, and are going around projecting their opinionated spun narrative to say that it's factual evidence of Russia involvement, while at the same time lacking a source evidence to cite the connections with nothing but wild speculation.

        for all the people preaching how Russia did everyone a service by making information public, it's now being asserted that they also hacked the RNC but deliberately chose to withhold their data.

       <p>
        They based that conclusion, in part, on another finding — which they say was also reached with high confidence — that the Russians hacked the Republican National Committee’s computer systems in addition to their attacks on Democratic organizations, but did not release whatever information they gleaned from the Republican networks.

       That's quite the logical fallacy you've set up there. Both events are not mutually exclusive. Hillary could have sabotaged her own election, and Russia could have supported Trump. But hey, maybe we wouldn't be having this discussion if Bernie had won the primary.

       Nobody in the CIA has stepped forward to publicly state that this even happened!  It's all a 'Secret Assessment' that the FBI will not even support, not even all of the 17 intelligence agencies (!) support.  It's pure propaganda, and nothing else.

       I think the main point is that Russia hacked both the DNC and the RNC but only released one.  I'm sure if the RNC emails were released, there would have been plenty of blowback.  but releasing only one shows pure intent to meddle.

       The russians didn't hack anyone, the closest you get is blaming it on a group that "may be linked" to russia and not working for them. Also the republican party denies it was hacked and no evidence has been presented to prove otherwise. You are reading fake news by people with an agenda twisting words to suit their argument.

       Good point. Even if the CIA is right and Russia hacks helped Trump win, it doesn't change the fact that Hillary was anything but squeaky clean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I'm done with all that... Trump won, move on, crybabies. I'm a little more concerned with his cabinet appointments going to family, Wall Street, oil execs, intelligence people employed by foreign governments, etc. Then there was the lack of blind trust or divestment of his numerous business interests. "I'll let my kids run it and we won't talk about it." I guess I have to take the man at his word, since he's kept all his campaign promises so far.

       Craig Murray, Former UK Ambassador to Uzbekistan: The CIA’s Absence of Conviction
      </p>
      <p>
       I have watched incredulous as the CIA’s blatant lie has grown and grown as a media story – blatant because the CIA has made no attempt whatsoever to substantiate it. There is no Russian involvement in the leaks of emails showing Clinton’s corruption. Yes this rubbish has been the lead today in the Washington Post in the US and the Guardian here, and was the lead item on the BBC main news. I suspect it is leading the American broadcasts also.
      </p>
      <p>
       A little simple logic demolishes the CIA’s claims. The CIA claim they “know the individuals” involved. Yet under Obama the USA has been absolutely ruthless in its persecution of whistleblowers, and its pursuit of foreign hackers through extradition. We are supposed to believe that in the most vital instance imaginable, an attempt by a foreign power to destabilise a US election, even though the CIA knows who the individuals are, nobody is going to be arrested or extradited, or (if in Russia) made subject to yet more banking and other restrictions against Russian individuals? Plainly it stinks. The anonymous source claims of “We know who it was, it was the Russians” are beneath contempt.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Julian Assange has made crystal clear, the leaks did not come from the Russians. As I have explained countless times, they are not hacks, they are insider leaks – there is a major difference between the two. And it should be said again and again, that if Hillary Clinton had not connived with the DNC to fix the primary schedule to disadvantage Bernie, if she had not received advance notice of live debate questions to use against Bernie, if she had not accepted massive donations to the Clinton foundation and family members in return for foreign policy influence, if she had not failed to distance herself from some very weird and troubling people, then none of this would have happened.

       Sweet child I never said I was a Hillary supporter. But at what point are you going to look at facts and stop blaming her for Trump's blatant lying? Still calling anyone who opposes Trump "shills" just proves my point. Try different jokes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe MSM. I strongly encourage the research of peer reviewed articles. And if at that point you are still calling those research backed articles "fake news" then you should lobby for the complete shutdown of our educational system. Professors are making students write papers with cited sources and those "shills" must be stopped. 😂😂

       Im not a Trump supporter, and I don't buy the bullshit narrative that Russia hacked our elections.  There is only speculation so far, and call me old fashioned but speculation alone isn't enough to send me frothing at the mouth wanting to declare war on a super power.

       Guys guys guys... before you start with this nonsense claim of "well some people think it's Russia and we have no proof it isn't Russia and Russia has hackers blah blah blah" let's get one thing straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton and her posse has been COMPLETELY NEGLIGENT WITH CYBER SECURITY THE ENTIRE TIME. Hillary removed classified info off of a secure government server and put it on her private, illegal, unsecured server where our TOP LEVEL CLASSIFIED INFO WAS HACKED AT LEAST 5 TIMES.
      </p>
      <p>
       EVERYONE CRYING RUSSIA NOW, STFU!!!
if you cared about our nations integrity, hillary should have been put in fucking jail for that. If she had, she never would have run and no one would have been able to release that shit on her to impact an election. Case. Fucking. Closed. Stfu.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.s. Podestas password to his email was "password". But yeah... "the hacks really seem similar to hacks russia has done in the past". 
Hmmm... maybe people with top level security clearance should give a shit about that responsibility and not invite anyone with a keyboard to spy on our secrets.

       Well to be fair Hillary is probably only able to stand and walk around in the first place because of machinery and handlers. So it wouldn't really be that surprising if Russia could hack her or control her actions

       She is a robot built by the Russians then hacked by the Russians...she's an older model after all these years on the political circuit... So many glitches 😳

       Yes, and no. Trump had every MSM outlet (even fox at first) out to bring him down and make him look back, hollywood was against him, the fucking president who should have been doing his job was out campaigning for her every day, anyone that wanted to vote was called racist, deplorable, redneck, etc. Everything in the book. Clinton had the media absolutely covering her ass at every turn. They never mentioned anything damning in wikileaks that came out, they never mentioned any of her scandals ever, they never did anything but make trump look worse than he is (not he's great, but  if you looked at his policies instead of believing what msm tried to spew, there's a lot of reasonable stuff..
      </p>
      <p>
       Not defending Trump, but Hillary and co. pulled out every trick in their playbook to paint him as much worse than he is. They're still doing it now, and we should all pay very close attention to what happens up until he is sworn in and during his term (s) of presidency.

       Whatever your opinion about Donald Trump, you have to recognize that he single-handedly defeated the Clinton Crime Syndicate, and brought Hillary Clinton's reign of terror to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton would have defeated Jeb Bush and would currently be the president elect.

       Just taking one large step back :
      </p>
      <p>
       the act of one country using rumour and misinformation to influence global politics is literally hundreds of years old. So although the US government and media is acting by impressively butt hurt, it's not a new or particularly dramatic for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would not take long to produce a list of elections around the world that were targeted by the CIA and in some notable cases, where they could not influence a vote, they planned a hit on the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, perhaps more in keeping with the old spirit of this sub - we ought to be asking how this narrative of Russians influence started in the MSM back in September (in Time and CNN ) and now have magically come true - or so the CIA tell us .

       Remember when Russia hacked the 9/11 memorial and made it look like Hillary was in poor health, even though her campaign had been reassuring us for weeks that she was fit as a fiddle. And remember when Russia hacked her campaign and forced them to say she had pneumonia. Russia is good at cyber, apparently.

       Seems like the MSM is following the script. Act I : blame Russia. I'm getting horrible 2001 flash backs. I was 17 living in NYC when 9/11 happened. I remember watching the towers burn and finally collapse from across the bay. Our entire school was on the 5th story roof of our high school watching before they sent us home. Prior to 9/11 the media and government were yelling about Iraq this, wmds, chemical weapons. Act I : blame Iraq. Act II : 9/11 attack. Now take that anyway you'd like, I for one feel it was allowed to happen. Act III : War.   We're in the same process now. Russia Russia Russia even during the elections. What could be staged for act II. It needs to be terrible, something so horrific and massive that the entire world instantly jumps into conflict. I shudder to say hydrogen. Act III : end game, there are no winners in a war between nuclear super powers.

       I literally could not give a fuck about Hillary's emails. I believe the story I've been told by Hillary and the media because it makes sense. A lot more sense the her secretly being some mind of mastermind out to grab power at any cost for reasons that aren't clear to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       She doesn't know how to use any phone others than a blackberry from the mid 2000s. She doesn't know how to use the internet let alone how it works. She is in her 70s and has spent the last 20 years, the years that technology and the internet became everyday, in a protected bubble of the White House and constant high pressure work. The server was already in her basement because her husbands staff used it and it was recommended to her by Colin Powell. She asked him what he did about email and he brought up the idea of a private email.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly tell me which story makes more sense. Busy women with zero technical skills who only knows how to use one phone insists her staff figure out a way to let her keep using that phone or us government state department use as a front for powerful political family to trade vast sums of money  and influence for favors and manipulate the whole system?

       Deflecting to other actions does not make the claims untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has claimed the Russian actions forced the actions in your post. By writing them as if they are linked, you are seeking to minimize one action as if it never existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps speaking to the evidence of the claims instead would get further.

       Before making that claim, it would be helpful if you could point to any evidence of Russia hacking anything related to the election. Numerous whistleblowers and insiders have claimed that it was our own people who supplied the emails to Wikileaks.

       What exactly was the fluff? Don't confuse opinions you don't like with senseless bullshit.

       Russia's involvement is hacking both political parties emails and deciding to sit on one and release the other. We have multiple agencies telling us this.  You're either saying it's no big deal, or that literally every one of these actors are in cahoots with one another to lie and pin the blame on Russia.

       <em>

       I'm not really sure what you're suggesting. Admitting to treason is a lot safer if you haven't actually committed treason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there is no way you could convict him of treason based solely on that youtube video. If the CIA found any evidence linking him to the hack he would likely be in jail right now. Seems like the fact that he's publicly admitting to treason and not in jail would imply that he might be lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, the guy seems pretty far off his rocker. His most recent video is on the civil war being act of auto-genocide from Lincoln, committed because Lincoln was a homosexual.

       i am really glad you got that off your chest but I was not asking about motive. I was asking how we proceed if we assume the russians are the source of the Wikileaks emails. The election is over and Trump won and the election itself was not compromised, the information revealed is what it is no matter who discovered it.

       You do realise it is ridiculously easy to write shit and post stuff about anyone nowadays? Google? How about a little critical thinking?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at this way, I don't believe any shit about Clinton until the a court of law convicts her in Court. Simple as. Now that Trump won, what is stopping him from trying to put her in jail via the normal way? Oh wait, he is no longer interested in doing that despite his big mouth promising to do so.

      <p>
       Now the same shit is stirring about Trump and what does this sub reddit says? Yep, it is all fake. All part of the MSM agenda.

       First, you're being horribly unspecific. We are arguing about the source of the leaks. Specifically, the ones that had an impact on the election. That would be the DNC leaks and Podesta's emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are claiming that Russians were responsible for hacking these systems and leaking the mail, and I am saying they did not. That is the truth in question here, upon which further deductions about various agendas might depend.
      </p>
      <p>
       And my reasons for not believing your theory, I will provide by repeating what I told someone elsewhere:
      </p>
      <p>
       For the DNC leaks, Assange all but bluntly states that it was leaked (not hacked) by Seth Rich:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For Podesta's email, we don't have the name of the leaker, but in the Pilger interview, Assange says that the leak is from a "Washington insider". Craig Murray, an associate of Assange and a generally credible source, says as much, claiming that he has even met the leaker and that it was, again, a "Washington insider":
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/12/cias-absence-conviction/">
        https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/12/cias-absence-conviction/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the credibility of the CIA's recent claims, the ones you're basing your indignation about Russian meddling on? Consider this dose of skepticism from Glenn Greenwald:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/10/anonymous-leaks-to-the-washpost-about-the-cias-russia-beliefs-are-no-substitute-for-evidence/">
        https://theintercept.com/2016/12/10/anonymous-leaks-to-the-washpost-about-the-cias-russia-beliefs-are-no-substitute-for-evidence/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       When faced with conflicting accounts, evaluate those accounts and how well they correspond to other known facts. And acknowledge that either account here, in theory, could be a lie. So are you suggesting that this poorly sourced story from the Washington Post and the CIA is more believable than the person who at least knows from whom he directly received the leak? Do the CIA and Washington Post have a better track record for honesty than Assange? I've chosen my answer to that question, and I'm pretty damn comfortable with it for now.

       I just don't understand how anyone could ever be okay with some of the stupid shit Trump has said recently. Clinton is terrible, but don't stick your head so far up your own ass about trump. He is literally acting like he wants to throw the presidency on purpose. I'm still not convinced he will ever be our president with some of the stupid shit he's said since being elected.

       And keeping on topic with this sub, I'm not convinced this isn't part of the plan and he hasn't been working with Clinton this entire damn time.

       This would seem to be in our interest. I think there is a valid case for a non-interventionist US foreign policy. I don't think anyone is seriously suggesting that other countries should not be intervening in these cases, however. I'd be perfectly happy to see us not be the world police. But large parts of the world still need policing, and
       <em>

       </em>
       after 2007-08 none of our allies are really in shape to beef up their military in short order. Europe is a clusterfuck right now. China and Russia are uneasy allies as are the US and China. It will take courage, intelligence, careful planning, diplomacy, and a good amount of time to remove us from the world stage in this fashion without completely demolishing the First World as we know it.

       Well, I think part of the issue is the framing in how you seem to think "news" works.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not the job of news programs to run a story like "Why Hillary lost the election" because that is primarily an opinion piece. Discussions like that happen on the "talking head" shows and in op-ed articles in papers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is news, however, to report on Russian hacking or Trump skipping intel briefings. Because those are in fact, news. It doesn't mean Russia was to blame, but the discussion about throughout DC is a news-worthy item.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you primarily just tune into your local nightly news program, I wouldn't expect you to see it. But if you turn on any of the cable news networks, there have been no shortage of those discussions.
