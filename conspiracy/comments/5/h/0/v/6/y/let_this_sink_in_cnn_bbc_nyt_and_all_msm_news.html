        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You don&#39;t address controversy unless they are saying something substantial, something that&#39;s struck a nerve. Think about it, where were the crazed gunmen rushing the people in the hotseat during 9/11? </p>

<p>Where were all the radical alt-rights that tried to assassinate Clinton during one of her rallies, or Trump for that matter? Where are the wackos stalking Podesta and others over this Pizzagate stuff? </p>

<p><strong>There aren&#39;t any.</strong> </p>

<p>I feel that only people with decent mental capacity would even take interest in investigating this Pizzagate thing, these aren&#39;t the kind of people with violent tendencies, or tendencies to break the law. Logically thinking, why would a citizen investigating trafficking of innocent people seek to inflict harm and break the law themselves?</p>

<p>This little investigation we are doing that has so many eyes on it that they tried boot stomping to the ground, they now talk about on all news outlets. Of all the subject matter to cover, they all made a coordinated effort to saturate the media with a <strong>conclusive</strong> statement on it.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t waste your time looking into it, it&#39;s only crazed radicals, it&#39;s fake russian news!&quot; We are seriously onto this guys, the more they push we need to push back. We need to get twitter accounts, all of us, to push this stuff. They haven&#39;t stopped it yet and if we kick up the heat now they never will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I think about that all the time. By working to refute the very points we make, they in turn are forced to see the evil we are investigating, they are forced to create lies to denounce facts.</p>

<p>They are unknowingly defending pedophilia and human trafficking. That&#39;s the real sick part. All MSM is blatantly defending this disgusting behavior. </p>

<p>Imagine if this was an investigation of a murderer, would we then tell the victim that they are a conspiracy nut for wanting to investigate? Would they vilify them just the same? We are in a dark dark world where people have enough money to say &quot;hey, don&#39;t let them think we sell people&quot; and all the heads involved just swallow their pride and comply.</p>

<p>Money can pervert anyone, the upper echelon are proof of it, as are the birds that squawk in their favor. </p>
