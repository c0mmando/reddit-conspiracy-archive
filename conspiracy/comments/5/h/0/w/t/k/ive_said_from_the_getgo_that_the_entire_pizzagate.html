    <div class="md"><p>Unless an actual police raid takes place, no definitive proof is going to come to light. Just like any real-world investigation (done without wire taps and surveillance) a case needs to be built to find just-cause for a raid. Even for the wire-tap (if you aren&#39;t the NSA or CIA) a police officer still needs a warrant from a judge and to get that warrant they need to prove &quot;reasonable cause&quot;.</p>

<p>So, finding a dead body on the sidewalk is not the purpose of pizzagate. The purpose is discovering a preponderance of evidence which would present &quot;reasonable cause&quot; for authorities to pursue the investigation further.  </p>

<p>As it stands, the &quot;proof&quot; surrounding CPP is shaky and I&#39;m personally not 100% convinced of all of the pizzagate claims, however there is enough evidence that I feel it&#39;s worth looking at closer. Despite this, I feel there is definitely <strong>something</strong> sketchy going on, but I&#39;m not sure exactly what. There is too many fishy occurrences to simply dismiss .</p>

<p>Remember, you are posting to r/conspiracy and that&#39;s the purpose of this sub. Look at the fishy occurrences and see what they indicate.</p>

I hear about it in my work ALL the time. A dude running a Curry shop just has to pony up $300-$500 to make a passing grade. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s common, but it definitely happens, and if Jill Stein can make $9milling in a couple of days I&#39;m sure the ex lover of David Brock can find a source of revenue a fraction of that size.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this guy doesn&#39;t really want to go over the evidence, just to attack the arguments. All of the evidence that I have seen is circumstantial. Just the same, the circumstantial evidence is damning for the vast majority of the people who view a significant amount of the information. The key to the PG defense is to call it fake without addressing any of the evidence, because the evidence itself is indefensible (when taken as a whole - granted, they can laugh off one or two Insta pics, but the comments and volume of posts are too much to defend). From here on, I think the game is to try to see who really wants to know and reach them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>nah, just strategy... it&#39;s why you have to stick to the script of discrediting the idea. The evidence is circumstantial, but so voluminous that it is damning to anyone who doesn&#39;t have their mind made up <em>a priori</em>.</p>

<p>The only reason why you have to play such hard defense is because Alefantis and company thought that they were above the law, and left such an awesome trail of &quot;non-evidence&quot; that has worked up a fury around the globe. <em>Hubris</em> at its finest!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now there is a mountain of circumstantial evidence.  Plenty of places for your stupid ass to go and read about.  You can read for a week straight and still not be fully aware of all the strange connections and what most of the people who started investigating this shit a month ago know. </p>

<p>What we need is for law enforcement to do the rest of the work and take it seriously and launch and investigation.  And the fact that Trump&#39;s top security advisor who is a fucking decorated general seems  to know whats going on gives me hope.  The fact that legacy media is flipping out like they way they are about him should also raise an eyebrow. </p>

<p>Now, go away concerned troll. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you find it strange that both Trump and Bill Clinton were close to a convicted pedophile who was charged with trafficking underage girls. Court documents allege that he was filming said encounters for use as blackmail. An alleged sex slave claims she was raped at 13 on Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s plane, which he calls the Lolita Express, by Donald Trump. Bill Clinton flew on said plane 26 times. Now the media derides the whole thing as a vast right-wing conspiracy although Trump was the first one outed as a possible pedophile? Obviously none of this is proof,  but there are some strange coincidences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There hasn&#39;t been any official investigation into it, there are no official facts yet.  That&#39;s the problem.</p>

<p>Criminals get prosecuted on circumstantial evidence all the time.  That&#39;s what the whole point of criminal investigation and the court process - to evaluate what&#39;s legitimate and what isn&#39;t.  So far, we haven&#39;t had a single official investigate this seriously.</p>
