    <div class="md"><p>its too bad &quot;pizza&quot; is the operative word because when anyone talks about it, to the uninitiated, the confusion is inevitable. &quot;Pizza&quot; was chosen for the theme of this scandal because supposedly, true life scumbag child abusers that post on various forums gave us all a hint, maybe two months ago (timing may be totally wrong, sorry if so). I have not personally seen the messages, but i read that these pervs were the first to recognize &quot;pizza&quot; references in John Podesta&#39;s emails. Leave it to pervs to tell us all how pervs must always communicate in code. That seems like a simplistic start, but the code words are hugely important. The FBI catalogs the code words they identify in their investigations, and in this case, corroboration between the FBI&#39;s intel and the hints from anonymous pervs is evident (obvious to some?) . Now put yourself in the shoes of an FBI agent...not at all an easy thought experiment no matter who you are. Agents may be looking at crime scene footage or pedophile websites, or lots of other horrible stuff that normal people cant handle. They just have to, and in the process, they determine any possible connections to uncover leads that will close their investigation ASAP. At least in theory they are actively pursuing justice; and that is the other side of the FBI coin. History has proven to anyone that listens to her, that the FBI will change their strategies away from traditional justice, and more towards an evolved justice that addresses modern intricacies of privacy and stopping crime. That second interpretation brings us to your question. The evidence that amateur investigators have access to at this moment would certainly be PART of the FBI&#39;s official case, but the feds wouldnt prosecute anyone until they consulted with the NSA, which would provide privacy protected intel, that amateurs could only hope and pray to ever look at. If the FBI is currently underway with these procedures then we only have to wait until they announce their findings. Until then, citizen investigators are poring over anything they can actually find, and they steadily compile their efforts at voat and other such sites. What makes these matters more interesting is how the interested parties are reacting in the past month. UN-interested parties that are denying everything possible are always hanging around also, waiting to pick fights and latch on to the attention around the entire story. Ask yourself : would I leave my kids at a party being held at any of the restaurants all on the same street in this old DC neighborhood?</p>

<p>On this subreddit. Take a fresh breath of air outside of your echochamber one of these days, buddy. Your opinions are not the opinions of the majority. Your echochamber is not reflective of most people.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For a group of critical thinkers, from what I&#39;ve seen most people here fucking <em>hate</em> when someone challenges their opinion.</p>

<p>Which is odd, because you&#39;d expect the exact opposite to happen among a group of critical thinkers. Weird.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m the dumb one and &quot;Don&#39;t disagree with me, don&#39;t dissent, leave me alone&quot; is the way real critical thinkers do it.</p>

<p>So why did you try to do the thinking for the OP instead of letting him reach his own conclusion? If it&#39;s so stupid, then the &#39;evidence&#39; should be your weapon, and you should be more than happy to share the evidence so that you can show how &quot;stupid&quot; it is.</p>
