       Pizzagate was exposed way back in 2012:

       There is some strangeness with the logos. I understand this might sound a bit "out there," but I can back this up. After you review that link, check this one out:
       <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/occult-symbols-in-corporate-logos-pt-1/">
        Occult Symbols in Corporate Logos
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       People who run/create companies appear to be following a hidden "occult" religion of some kind. It's very clear that there is a reason behind all of the Saturn logos and other occult symbolism, but the actual reason for it I am not aware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you judge this as some whackjob conspiracy theory, see the evidence for yourself. It's
       <strong>
        very
       </strong>
       obvious. Once you see it you cannot unsee it. It will change the way you see the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google image search "saturn corporate logos." There are so many corporations that use Saturn as their logo. Nike, Saturn (cars), Nissan, directv, internet explorer, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the company doesn't use Saturn as the basis for their logo, they might go with a black cube, they might use a freemasonic square and compass..."Pyramid corporate logo," "eye corporate logo," etc. Get creative with the image searches. It's all based on occult symbolism. The craziest ones are Time Warner Cable and other eyeball logos on media companies.

       Its true.  The symbols are derived from a frequency.  If you put a bunch of sand on a table and then vibrate it, it creates a pattern, or symbol.  See this as proof:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/wvJAgrUBF4w">
        https://youtu.be/wvJAgrUBF4w
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The origins of these symbols are derived from an energy (wave frequencies) that emanate from our universe, low level and high level frequencies.  Picture the relationship of your brain, these symbols, and their root frequencies akin to your iphone, a sound, and a ringing bell.  The bell rings, makes a sound, you record it with your iphone, and it now exists inside your iphone in a new format.  The same concept works with things that you visualize/see.  Symbols carry frequencies, and these frequencies resonate with us, whether for good or for bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       The occult symbols are a constant reminder of our enslavement within this defined spectrum of perception.  They affect us subconsciously

       That's interesting, but with all due respect, my post is 100 percent unrelated to your post. i don't want the massive coincidence that I am pointing out to be associated with magic vibration crystals or whatever. I find it interesting that your comment is at the top of this thread. The shills will leave it alone and upvote because it makes me look bad.

       Its not unrelated.  I was trying to reinforce your point, man.

       Look up David Icke and watch his performance in Wembley in 2012.  Its like 8 hrs long, but he explains all of these symbols you're talking about in the 2nd part and he explains scientifically where they get their power/meaning.  That video that i sent you is undeniable.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a rhythm to our universe.  Our good deeds and bad deeds send echoes through it - whether you look at this literally or symbolically, it is an important concept

       Here is an excellent presentation on what the OP is talking about:

      <p>
       Video on YT - Mark Passio Occult Solar Symbolism in Advertising (5mins)
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jak__snJGrU">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As Mark says, tptb are always trying to convince you they are selling you something that is vital and something they make you think you don't already posses.
