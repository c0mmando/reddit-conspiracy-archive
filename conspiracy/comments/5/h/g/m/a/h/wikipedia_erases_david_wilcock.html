      <p>
       For those who don't know him, here is a short excerpt from his own website (divinecosmos.com): "David Wilcock is a professional lecturer, filmmaker and researcher of ancient civilizations, consciousness science, and new paradigms of matter and energy."
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I always found him to be very rigorous in his researches and overall he's a very nice and talented guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       David Wilcock just published a
       <a href="http://divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/1208-endgame-pt-1">
        long article
       </a>
       on his website talking mostly about pizzagate. Well, guess what, his (english) entry on wikipedia is completely gone.

       Dumb move on wikipedia's part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I might make for a decent representation of a large chunk of society? Average intelligence at best, has emotional responses to things that make me less than objective at times, have good intentions but still. That sort of picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well I can say that having political figures and the MSM go out of their way to address pizzagate, but not to investigate and debunk it, but just to mock it or try to censor it or attack anyone who is willing to consider it, just makes me feel even more suspicious about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it really is just a bunch of trolls, then some MSM journalist needs to thoroughly look through all the evidence and debunk/confirm accordingly. The MSM has taken the time to make fun of it and call it fake, which has resulted in an explosive streisand effect. So maybe they ought to go ahead and actually debunk the whole thing now.

       All very sinister.

       Except Wilcock is regarded as 'non-notable' by Wikipedians, who deleted the article about him
       <em>
        over a month ago.

       The reason for the deletion, as far as I can tell, was as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Most search results were about a different David Wilcock
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "this" David Wilcock was too insignificant to warrant a disambiguation page
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They don't have page for "the other" David Wilcock that people were searching for from #1 above
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The original author of the page points out that "this" David Wilcock is an author on the NYT best seller list, and that all of the other search results for "the other" David Wilcock are actually results for "this" David Wilcock
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         DELETED!

       His latest article is extremely comprehensive. It's enlightening to see who covers pizzagate and who ridicules it with a "fake news" slogan. I'm excited for him to finish part 2.

       For me, David Wilcock is "out there" - but I know he has a large following. That said, deleting his page is perhaps only going to fuel the fire (e.g. Streisand Effect). We shall see.

       For the jury is still out on Wilcock, but I feel he is earnest even if not 100% correct.

       Regardless, I find this very odd. Personally, Wilcock is my favorite person in the new age field (I think most are charlatans, but Wilcock does his research and doesn't spout total bullshit.)

       Anyway, I'm also skeptical of him, partially because I like him know much. I've been following Wilcock since 2009 or so. I wanted to do more research on him, and get info about him from other sources so I went looking for his wikipedia and couldn't find him. For someone as prominent as he is in his respective field (new age authorship) I find it absurd that wikipedia would delete his page.
