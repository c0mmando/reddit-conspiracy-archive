       "A thin, stern-looking man in photographs, Mr. Podesta was given the moniker
Skippy the Evil Twin by the staff when he was in a bad mood, according to
his brother, Tony Podesta"
      </p>

      <p>
       "Good story, but Tony needs to stop talking to the press."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Podesta was known to politicos as
“a man of rare humor” and “a straight shooter,” but “with a low threshold
for nonsense,” which, if anyone on his staff did something stupid, provoked
a “mean, surly presence” that colleagues nicknamed “Skippy” -- to be
avoided at all costs."
      </p>
      <p>
       "With Skippy in the White House, it’s not hard to imagine what Jewell’s 50
research projects will “discover.”
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s orchestration worthy of a Beethoven symphony, but the fingerprints
look like Skippy’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s all performance art, like the Wizard of Oz or stage magic, dazzling by
the misdirection of attention: Listen to our wails of outrage over here
while we wreck America’s industrial strength over there."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Anyone who has worked for Podesta in the past decade knows Skippy, who first appeared during Podesta's eventful years as chief of staff in the Clinton White House . As scandal rocked the end of that presidency, staffers knew they had better come prepared to meetings. Otherwise, nurturing mentor John would be replaced by Skippy -- Podesta's quick-tempered, edgy and sarcastic alter ego.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You haven't seen him in this meeting, have you?" the transition co-chairman for Barack Obama  says with a laugh, noting that many a reporter has met Skippy."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This was, after all, the man whom Clinton staffers used to joke had an evil twin named Skippy to explain his flashes of imperious anger, slamming doors, slamming phones and berating staffers. He even kept a jar of Skippy peanut butter on his desk."

       Maybe that's the name they call the satanic peadophlic entity that has possessed his body.Like Captain howdy in the exorcist.These demonic spirits do seem to like quirky names.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe Skippy the evil twin is Podesta's mk ultra alter ego.That's why Tony needs to stop talking to the press,his little insider jokes make Podesta's nervous.

       Not the best approach. I have some uh, art, on my computer that wouldn't be work appropriate. Like a naked anime guy in bondage, that probably wouldn't go over very well.

       It is just creepy that he prominently displays a painting of two children who are either drugged, traumatized or dead. Like he saw that painting and apparently was like yeah, I like this, gonna hang it up in my home. Since he works closely and heavily for the Clintons, specifically in helping them survive 'scandals' and Bill Clinton was a frequent flyer on the "Lolita Express".

       Raids in World of Warcraft. That's right, not only am I a weeb, I'm a WoW player, too. But yeah, when someone in a raid starts acting like a douche, I just start 'accidentally' letting them die over and over, until they go ballistic and leave. So when I made this reddit account, it was originally going to be for nerd stuff like WoW. Damn did my reddit life take a weird turn.

       It's not an accusation. Catharsis is essentially what makes art
       <em>
        art
       </em>
       to those who consider any particular work to
       <em>
        be
       </em>
       art, insomuch as catharsis is a process that affects those experiencing or viewing a work of art.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not saying that having a cathartic reaction to something proves anything or even suggests anything.

      </p>

        wondering if that gift of "CHEESE"

      </p>
      <p>
       Last but not least, it's a place where a man can leave his

       The fact is russia admitted to being in contact with the trump campaign prior to November. That could mean alot of things without the proper context. 
But facts dont matter to you as far as i can tell based on your post history..

       Brilliant, you're condemning artwork made by survivors of trauma and child sex abuse because you do not like the man who collected their work. Yay you! /s
      </p>
      <p>
       Serbian painter Biljana Djurdjevic on the source of her paintings:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A:I read a lot, from junky novels to pure art novels, am addicted to TV who works 24 hours per day, I hardly watch but I need to have it in the room, maybe it is compilation of my thoughts that I collect through ordinary day like seeing some old man struggling with his poverty and starting to fade from the face of earth without being seen at all, or
        <strong>
         seeing another victim of paedophilia for this and other subjects unfortunately I didn’t need any imagination. Just a pure reality.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In other words, she is expressing the horrors she survived. Would you ban survivors of abuse from using art as a mode of expression? Would you hold them responsible for the deeds of the people who collect their work?
      </p>
      <p>
       On the
       <em>
        Arch of Hysteria
       </em>
       (what people say is the Dahmer like sculpture, FFS) by Louise Bourgeois, an artist who became famous despite being lambasted by critics for sourcing her work in her own experiences of trauma, because you know, people don't like it when women talk about these things.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Stemming from her interest in the physical, emotional, and psychological aspects of pain and fear, Bourgeois was drawn to the arch of hysteria as theorized and represented by the nineteenth-century neurologist Jean Martin Charcot (1825-1893). While working at the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, Charcot sought to represent hysteria by documenting the performances of his female patients. The physical tension of the hysterical arch - an intense muscular contraction, resulting in immobility and paralysis of the limbs - is emblematic of an equally extreme emotional state. Bourgeois makes this highly vulnerable position even more so by suspending her male figure from the ceiling. In choosing to represent him in an attitude traditionally associated with the female, the artist transgresses the social and sexual roles assigned to women, challenging the misconception of hysteria as a female malady.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For Abromovic however, I've no defense. The point is, knee jerk reactions and broad condemnations don't work when it comes to art. That's what the Nazi's did.

       This is a bit of a silly discussion. What you might care to have on your walls at home is not constrained by the rather stricter environment of a professional office. Moreover, something that isn't illegal at home won't become illegal in an office. It can only contravene the business's rules and procedures about employee conduct.
