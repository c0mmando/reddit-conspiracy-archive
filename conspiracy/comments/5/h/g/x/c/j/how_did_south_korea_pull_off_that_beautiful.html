    <div class="md"><p>Uh, Americans HAVE done multiple protests over the last decade BUT the MSM just quietly hides it away.  Examples:</p>

<p>&quot;On February 15, 2003, there was a coordinated day of protests across the world in which people in more than 600 cities expressed opposition to the imminent Iraq War. It was part of a series of protests and political events that had begun in 2002 and continued as the war took place. Social movement researchers have described the 15 February protest as &quot;the largest protest event in human history&quot;.&quot;  </p>

<p>There were other protests:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/american-mainstream-media-censors-massive-protest-against-syrian-refugeesthis-is-why/">170,000 Polish patriots marched through the capital to end Islamic invasion in their country.</a></p>

<p>An estimated 4.4 million people marched in a series of rallies that took place across France on 10 January (around 700 000 people) and 11 January 2015 (around 3,7 million people) against terrorism and to support the freedom of speech, after the Charlie Hebdo shooting, the Montrouge shooting, and the Porte de Vincennes siege.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have to come together as one united citizenry.  That&#39;s how we make it happen.  We focus on NOT being stupid, loud, ignorant, violent rabble rousers.  We don&#39;t make the protest into a fucking concert - but make it into conscientious objection by an entire mass of people.</p>

<p>TPTB here have us SOOOO damn divided, however, and so many of us are at each others&#39; throats - for stupid, false, indoctrinated, brainwashed reasons of racism, etc - that it&#39;s really easy for any real concerted protest that we might try to start to get quickly divided up, broken apart, dismantled, and rendered ineffective by agent provocateurs and other cointelpro.  See the Occupy Wall Street and March Against Monsanto protests.</p>

<p>We need to change our way of being if we have any hope of a US protest to actually work.</p>
