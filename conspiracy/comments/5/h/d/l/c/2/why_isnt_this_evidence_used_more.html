       Not everything is a conspiracy. Sometimes it's just someone wanting to wreck the shit out of some cheese and party in the pool.

       As for the second example he used, the only things that make it suspicious is that their ages are specified, they are said to be entertainment, and that entertainment is assured. If the people being invited don't already know who these children are or what their ages are, then they are clearly not close friends and family. And if they are not close friends and family who would already know these kids, then that is what makes it a bit creepy that they are being told that the kids will be their entertainment in the pool "for sure". Even then, if this were email of some random citizen, it could still be passed off as just a joke about the silly antics common of young kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       But given Podesta's tastes in disturbing art of children being tortured, that Podesta was the chairman of Hillary's presidential campaign, and Bill Clinton was best buddies with Epstein, it makes some people nervous for the safety of those kids. Like maybe if just one of these factors wasn't included, then it wouldn't look as suspicious. But it's like.. Clintons were close buddies with a child predator, Podesta works closely with the Clintons, and Podesta has a thing for creepy child torture art. Then he gets invited to a party where children, ages specified, will be entertainment for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it makes sense for people to be a bit concerned about it, though it is not "proof" of child abuse.

       Which is why you specify the ages. . . To inform people who otherwise wouldn't know.

       Tell kids there's a pool. Go to party, where pool isn't heated? You're gonna cop it from the kids. So yeah the pools gonna be heated "for sure".

       The quote is the person will have "further entertainment". So they're not the primary source of entertainment.

       Biljana Bjurdjevic is the artist, most of the art I think is meant to be creepy in general, but a good portion of it shows children in particular being tortured and they have the thousand yard stare of trauma, as well.

       You can do a google images search if you want to see other examples from the artist, some include children being tied up in inhumane positions and they all have the trauma/dead eyes.

       meant to be his home? And is there a source on that? I only see the one painting in the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       When looking up her work I only see a couple of paintings by her that show children tied up, not one showing torture and certainly not a "good portion" when most of her work doesn't even feature children. She's a legitimate artist, you can read all about her and her artwork if you take the time. You might then understand her work. This is all pretty tame and ordinary by the standards of the art world.

       Yes, it is supposed to be the inside of his home. This is an article from WashingtonLife showing another room in the house with another painting by that artist on display:
      </p>

       <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it is due to some sort of trending algorithm that I don't understand, but when I do a google image search for her artwork, most of the results for her paintings are children who either appear dead or heavily drugged or dissociated/traumatized, or who have their hands behind their backs and appear to be in fear, or who are tied up and hung from walls in ways that are inhumane and torturous in my eyes, at least. So maybe my impression from that is off and it was an algorithm or coincidence or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I go to a site dedicated to her, the first page displays 6 paintings from her.

       So yes I see that she paints other sorts of things, as well, and I know she is a legitimate artist. I'm not trying to attack the artist, herself. I know that some artists capture the more depressing parts of life, and there is nothing wrong with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was just that Podesta had at least two paintings of hers in his house, one of which showed what looked like two girls who are either dead, drugged or traumatized, given their body positions and expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'll be honest, most of these types of details don't make me worry all by themselves. It's just that we know the Clintons have been very close to Epstein, we know that Epstein is a convicted child predator, and then we know Podesta has worked very closely with the Clintons to help them. So it's because of knowing all that, when I see that he likes a painting of two dead/drugged/traumatized (whichever it is supposed to be) children so much that he hangs it for prominent display, it creeps me fuck out.

       The heated pool, given the context of the conversation mentioning cooler temps (kids whine if water is too cold), is reasonable.

       Your first example requires context. The complete version is:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them."
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't try to be misleading, or you'll just hurt efforts to raise awareness the moment people realize that you tried to mislead them. They won't be open to considering anything you have to say after just one incident of that. Credibility is a very fragile thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second example doesn't become less suspicious even when put into context, though, but still as a general rule, we should try to make sure to give everything in its full context.

       When you include the context there is nothing there that a court of law could find as evidence of pedos. You're reaching and trying to twist the words to suit your purpose. Instead of focusing on making these read the way you want to perceive then you should be looking for something non subjective. This isn't proof of anything and it's not good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not defending pedos but this doesn't prove anything and really needs no defense. Keep digging...
