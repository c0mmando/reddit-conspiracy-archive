       This is not just a "leftist" led censorship. Saying blanket statements like that makes this actually look like some insane, alt-right conspiracy when it actually has nothing to do with politics.

       There are plenty of people on the right who stand to lose a lot if pizzagate is not censored.

       Honestly though. And saying that "Progressives" or "leftists" want this kind of censorship is just marginalizing people when we should be pulling together about all of this going on. This isn't a left vs. right issue, this is a citizen vs. government issue, which is
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       different.

       i didn't want this to be about left vs right. but i remember when there was this new policy about copright infringement, alot of left wing people supported that movement. and i don't see that now, when it's really getting serious.

       Yes I know about this. Thanks for mentioning that because these are the types of specifics op should be mentioning in his post. These websites, among plenty of others, along with sources linking to where they've censored pizzagate would be brilliant in the original post. But my instincts tell me that op is kinda concern trolling here, so I personally downvoted because I think it didn't add to the discussion. However if there was another post under a similar premise, describing the same thing but with links, I would upvote that post.

       Just noticed you've added in links. Thanks, that's what I mean. That's what makes the difference between a good post and a bad one. If you don't have the time to write up the full post with links at the time you originally want to post, then just wait until you have the time to make sure you can write up a good, high quality post, instead of posting something half finished which could be taken either way by those who read it. Do you get me?

       I'm not necessarily implying this is it, but shilling can come in all shapes and sizes.  It can attack one side in a variety of ways, support the other, act irrationally and claim to be a part of the enemy organization, muddy the waters through creating noise, so on and so forth.

       That's my thoughts exactly regarding this post. I downvoted it, left my comment, then moved on to pay my attention where I believe it's due - real work exposing pizzagate. Not this fear mongering.

       Facebook removing pizzagate posts. Twitter too. YouTube removing pizza gate videos. Reddit deleting pizzagate subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were keeping up with the events unfolding around pizzagate you would be aware of the censorship. Hell, I've seen the hive of shills over in enoughtrumpspam posting again and again getting tons of upvotes about censoring subreddits talking about pizzagate.

       People of the "Progressive" mindset only want freedom of speech for themselves, nobody else. Sort of like how the fascist groups on Reddit get angry when the owner acts like a fascist and removes their subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really is like two polarized fascist groups battling with each other, while trying to frame each other as worse at the same time. Kind of like watching Russia and the U.S. try to frame each other for propaganda when they both spew plenty of it.

       Why would Progressives want to censor pizzagate?  Maybe your definition of Progressive is not accurate.  Do you think Hillary is liberal?  She is actually a moderate Republican.

       Definitely false. I'm most certainly a progressive and want freedom of speech without censorship for everybody. I'm especially an advocator for freedom on the internet and take steps to secure myself in various ways to combat the bullshit our government likes to deal us.

       The entire concept of "brigading" is so fucking stupid. It was pushed as some great scourge upon Reddit a few years ago as an obvious first step towards censorship and controlling social movements. It shouldn't matter what link you clicked on if you are a regular user. If you want to go ahead and join the community and start participating, then you should be free to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile we have had CTR running wild on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and elsewhere for almost two years. Astroturfing is the real brigading, and they use botnets and keyword detection to amplify their impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious that Reddit has been compromised in this new information war.

       I don't think Infowars should be censored by reddit or anyone, but it's definitely not a "major media outlet". It's a few amateur guys trying to come up with ridiculous theories.

       You don't know them then.  It is a team of over 10 full-time professionals, they regularly send reporters to events they want to cover, have multiple channels, millions of views daily, and do a lot more than just ridiculous theories, which aren't all ridiculous.  It is one of the biggest alt-news outlets, and that's why they come up so often in mainstream media discussion, even Hillary Clinton mentioned them.

       True, I don't know them or how they operate. But I do know that I have almost never seen anything credible suggested by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And regardless, 10 people running a blog and a low-production Youtube channel/stream is not a "major media outlet".

       Major is the number of people listening to them.  It's huge.  I find a lot of their stuff credible though somewhat exaggerated.  More in the past year because they've gotten serious about politics over conspiracies, but still.

       Big brother's watching, we watch him back
       <br/>
       We see right through his disguise
       <br/>
       He tries to scare us, with angry words
       <br/>
       But we all know that they're lies
       <br/>
       Whole world is waiting
       <br/>
       Just see the fear in their eyes
      </p>
      <p>
       Whole world is watching, observing every move
       <br/>
       Is it beginning or the end?

       Just like a chess game, but so intense
       <br/>
       That I just don't understand

       Big brother's marching

       Neatly disguised, so far away

       Open your heart, try to remember

       Two worlds apart, but so close

       The entire concept of "brigading" is so fucking stupid. It was pushed as some great scourge upon Reddit a few years ago as an obvious first step towards censorship and controlling social movements. It shouldn't matter what link you clicked on if you are a regular user. If you want to go ahead and join the community and start participating, then you should be free to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile we have had CTR running wild on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and elsewhere for almost two years. Astroturfing is the real brigading, and they use botnets and keyword detection to amplify their impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious that Reddit has been compromised in this new information war.
