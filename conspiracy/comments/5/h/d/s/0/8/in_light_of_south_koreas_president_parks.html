</blockquote>

<p>I have a theory. Trump knew about the lolita express shit but he never took part in it himself. Remember, he never drank or used drugs. Imagine how many drunk elites he has had the pleasure of speaking with.</p>

<p>Trump may very well be involved in the ring, but my theory is they introduced him to it, Trump refused to participate and then went rogue. The establishment and media united from both sides against Trump because they had no child pedo blackmail they could use to control him. The Pussygate tapes are the best they have.</p>

<p>If Trump was involved, he would not have spoken out against globalism and Soros in his speeches. If there was pedo dirt on Trump, I believe some of it would have leaked during the elections to sabotage his campaign.</p>

<p>I think Trump vaguely knew that human trafficking was going on but he freaked out and went rogue when he found out the extent of it.</p>

<p>It could be idealizing him too much, but I don&#39;t understand why he&#39;d speak out against Soros and threaten Clinton with jail and call the Clinton Foundation a criminal empire live on national tv if he was secretly on their side. There would be no need to mention Soros and bring him in to the American mainstream if Trump was a part of the Clinton crew.</p>

<p>that&#39;s definitely possible. I feel like they wouldn&#39;t have him speak out directly against Soros and globalism if that were the case, but he very well could be controlled opposition. Has the CIA or any other government organization used this sort of tactic before?</p>

<p>Obama will pardon clinton. The Obama DOJ will protect everyone. Obama will pardon everyone that Trump accuses. Trump is president elect. He can&#39;t do anything until he takes power in January 20th. If Clinton and Podesta know the Trump DOJ will prosecute them 2 months before Trump takes power, they have plenty of time to cover their tracks.</p>

<p>Of course, Podesta and Clinton know it&#39;s coming anyways. That&#39;s probably why this &quot;fake news&quot; newspeak started coming from the media a week after Trump&#39;s victory.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump is a saint or a super hero. He&#39;s definitely a scummy guy. I just think he never went all the way with the child pedo shit like the other ones did. I assume there&#39;s some major catalyst that caused him to go rogue and run for president-and I assume it was when he found out the extent of the evil in the pedo ring. He was donating to both sides before this so he was definitely privileged to information from elites in both sides. The Al Smith dinner speech was not really something that controlled opposition would do IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The picture your painting of trump as someone who is &quot;recently awoke&quot; is an intriguing one. It explains his behavior towards the clintons and other politicians before his campaign. Like he found something out about them that changed his mind.</p>

<p>But since his election he has spoken pretty positively about Hillary and Obama. Which, I guess, doesn&#39;t necessarily mean anything.</p>

<p>I think I  find it difficult to believe that someone who is so clearly entrenched in the elite lifestyle and those circles and has been for generations could have an agenda that seeks to bring down the elitist society. </p>

<p>he has to do that to calm the crazy protesters and to allay suspicians so Obama doesn&#39;t mass pardon everyone involved.</p>

<p>Maybe Trump sincerely won&#39;t do anything but he won&#39;t have to. The FBI investigation in to the Clinton Foundation is still ongoing, and I am confident that Jeff Sessions will be happy to prosecute.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump is that evil of a guy. Not Podesta/Clinton level at least. It could all be PR to cover his evil, but there are a ton of stories out there of him anonymously helping people and giving them rides and giving homeless people jobs. Trump is not a saint but I&#39;d believe it if he decided to run for president to stop the kiddy pedo shit. Remember in the 80s and 90s everyone was begging this guy to run for president. He was known as a benevolent billionaire and even got cameos in kids movies like Home Alone 2.</p>

<p>If Trump was involved, the media would not have blown their cover the way they did this year with their one-sided partisanship. They would not have smeared him the way they did. The establishment and Podesta would have no problem with Trump becoming president if they had pedo blackmail on him to control him.</p>

<p>They&#39;re all terrified of Trump because they can&#39;t control him with pedo blackmail. They aired his dirty laundry out to the world with pussygate and it didn&#39;t work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if Obama mass pardoned everyone it would be a pretty clear breach of power and it would not stand. That doesn&#39;t seem like a plausible scenario. </p>

<p>Either way, I do hope this is true. I want to believe Trump gives a shit about me and you. But I just have trouble believing it! He&#39;s a self-serving businessman. You&#39;ve pointed out various stories about him helping people, but there are multiple records of him screwing people over too (Trump U, not paying contractors/painters for work done, saying horrible things about women and minorities, etc.). So as far as his character goes, he has shown little to make me believe he is capable of launching a campaign against wealth and power in the name of justice and truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, she was arrested and properly cleared of charges. While I do agree the police overstepped their bounds, the police are not meant t oact as judges or juries. They arrest people on suspicion of a crime, and then a judge and/or jury decide if the police were correct in that arrest. </p>

<p>Do i think the police should have arrested her? Of course not. But, do I think this is a failing of our justice system? Not at all. She arrested under suspicion of a crime, and was shown (quickly) to have not committed that crime, and thus the charge was dismiseed. </p>

<p>&quot;Some may never figure out their purpose in life,
And some will.
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in,
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment.
We live in a world where it&#39;s more okay to follow than to lead.
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to.
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat.
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life,
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice.
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time.
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest.</p>

<p>This is the story of The Man On The Moon. -KiD CuDi </p>

<p>We are that voice.</p>

The media used this as an excuse to alert the masses of &quot;fake news&quot; without providing any motive or information on the gunman. No investigation was held, just speculative bullshit the public will eat up. Alefantis also could have used that employee day off as a day to hide shit and make sure they cover their asses if there&#39;s ever a reason for police or others to go inside. And apparently the suspect&#39;s father worked for the federal government. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not <em>saying</em> it was a false flag, but it was immediately exploited to push their agenda, making it painfully obvious what their intentions are. They are covering this up with all their power. Hillary personally said &quot;lives are at stake because of fake news&quot; and even Steven Colbert did a bit making fun of pizzagate and influencing public opinion. We struck a nerve on these people. I don&#39;t think it should be ignored. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Say something about it being a set up? No. I mean I know this is a different thing, but look at 9/11. Look at how many people were involved in that. And if you aren&#39;t convinced 9/11 was a false flag, I highly suggest you consider it and research it and think about it from a pure physics perspective. What conditions must be met for a steel structure skyscraper to freefall directly down? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to argue about that or go any deeper, but I see no evidence showing that the cpp incident was not a false flag. I&#39;m not saying it was, but it would not be that hard to throw together a plan where no one gets killed so no official investigation has to be held, but it&#39;s enough to scare people from the idea and give the media a reason to attack pizzagate. And that&#39;s all it was. There was no presented information on the shooter. They assumed it was because of the scandal when it could have been unrelated if it had been real. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t rule something out just because it is unlikely. The fucking president of South Korea was being controlled by a cult powered shadow government. That idea was too crazy for the vast majority until proven. </p>

<p>Ok you have to think from a soldier&#39;s perspective.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t that brainwashed. They aren&#39;t clone troopers. They were all for the most part raised in America alongside their fellow Americans and many of them joined the army to protect their fellow Americans.</p>

<p>They are not just going to blindly follow orders to shoot down their fellow neighbors. Soldiers are not brainless automatons. This isn&#39;t Black Mirror. </p>

<p>Most of them joined because they were broke and it paid well, plus gi bill for free school.</p>

<p>I assure you, basic training is designed to beat the shit out of the part of you that questions your superiors.</p>

<p>A lot of folks, according to my brother who went army, just want to feel badass and shoot shit. Same with marines.  There would just not be nearly as much resistance as you seem to think there would be.</p>

<p>The kids i worked with were generally the type that would defect imo, medical and whatnot. We were required to have pretty high asvab scores for those jobs.  The majority of our force however is not very bright. Mostly army.  They would do wtf they were told to do and eat up whatever shit story they are told.</p>

God said those who sacrificed children to false gods in the Old Testament were sacrificing HIS children. Imagine the horrors that await everyone who harms a child of God.</p>

<p>We are these limitations. Some of us are more in touch with the whole still. Some exploit their connection for instant gratification, power, control, and do it at the cost of true knowledge, true inner peace, true wisdom. </p>

<p>They are the left hand path and they &quot;hack&quot; the mind, the body, and soul for instant reward. They reach out to inner / outer &quot;existences&quot; that promise instant reward in exchange for sacrifice.</p>

<p>There is another path through self-love, harmony, laws of nature, and an intunement with ones own heart and love of the universe. It is not as instantly gratifying, it&#39;s not easy, and it doesn&#39;t guarantee a painless future or power, but it does protect you from the eternal suffering loop that one might fall into if they become too wreckless and devote too much of their time to false gods / false self.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is. Jesus is God. The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are one, yet it is the Son specifically who created all things.</p>

<p>Specifically, see John 1:1-14 (with emphasis added):</p>

<p>1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and <em>the Word was God.</em></p>

<p>2 The same was in the beginning with God.</p>

<p>3 <em>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</em></p>

<p>4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</p>

<p>5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</p>

<p>6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</p>

<p>7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</p>

<p>8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</p>

<p>9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</p>

<p>10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</p>

<p>11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</p>

<p>12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</p>

<p>13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>

<p>14 <em>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,)</em> full of grace and truth.</p>

<p>See also 1 John 5:7 - &quot;For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.&quot;</p>

<p>Jesus is God. He&#39;s the One who created all things, He&#39;s the One the entire Bible is about, and He&#39;s present in the Old Testament as well (meeting Abraham; wrestling Jacob; saving Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego; as Melkizedek, etc.).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The Father, the Word and the Holy Spirit are all called God in the bible. They are three separate person and they are one in unity. Jesus set aside is divine nature to come to earth and save us. This is why He was called the son of man and also the son of God. The bible says we can understand the invisible things by the visible things, even the Godhead. The bible calls two people joined together in marriage &quot;one flesh&quot; it is a unity. Just like the trinity is one God but a unity of 3 persons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. So you should have said &quot;Nothing came before God&quot; instead of &quot;Jesus&quot;. God &quot;sent aside divine nature to come to Earth and save us&quot; <em>after</em> the universe was created. Part of the whole representing the whole; synecdoche. As well as anachronistic.

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus was not created. The Bible says He&#39;s from everlasting. As shown above, He created all things. The Bible is very clear on that. Jesus was born, not made. He existed before he was begotten. He was in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Jesus is very much the Creator, and I&#39;m pretty sure even the Catholic Church teaches that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must not have read the Bible in its entirety. Jesus has plenty of hatred in His heart for the bloody, cruel and perverse. The Bible is full of explanations of His fiery anger and loathing of sons of the devil. Podesta is undoubtedly one of them. He hates God, and the man after God&#39;s own heart, David, said in Psalm 139: &quot;Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, the New Testament commands us to sing the Psalms in three separate places, Ephesians 5:18-19, Colossians 3:16, and James 5:13, so there&#39;s no way to suggest Psalm 139 doesn&#39;t apply to today.</p>

<p>Also, the wrath of God was upon Jehoshaphat specifically because he helped the ungodly and loved them that hate the Lord, according to 2 Chronicles 19:2. God was angry with Jehoshaphat, who was a godly man, because he didn&#39;t have enough hate in his heart for the wicked.</p>

<p>Jesus will send the majority of people to hell. That&#39;s not a loving act. That&#39;s a hateful act against people who reject Him.</p>

<p>If you claim to be a Christian, I suggest you start reading about the real Jesus, the real God, from His own Word instead of some long-haired, effeminate, hippy false God pushed by media and the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Edit: For the record, true Christianity is the belief that faith alone in Jesus Christ, who is God, became man, died, was buried, and rose again bodily, is the only way to receive the free gift of salvation from hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is still but one original life force energy that emanates eternally and all that is possible is but a game created by its own desire for the illusion of limitations. The ultimate act for this infinite is to create limitation through illusion. </p>

<p>We are these limitations. Some of us are more in touch with the whole still. Some exploit their connection for instant gratification, power, control, and do it at the cost of true knowledge, true inner peace, true wisdom. </p>

<p>They are the left hand path and they &quot;hack&quot; the mind, the body, and soul for instant reward. They reach out to inner / outer &quot;existences&quot; that promise instant reward in exchange for sacrifice.</p>

<p>There is another path through self-love, harmony, laws of nature, and an intunement with ones own heart and love of the universe. It is not as instantly gratifying, it&#39;s not easy, and it doesn&#39;t guarantee a painless future or power, but it does protect you from the eternal suffering loop that one might fall into if they become too wreckless and devote too much of their time to false gods / false self.</p>

<p>Exactly. He rode the lolita express and is about as elitist as it gets. So we know he&#39;s under the influence </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a theory. Trump knew about the lolita express shit but he never took part in it himself. Remember, he never drank or used drugs. Imagine how many drunk elites he has had the pleasure of speaking with.</p>

<p>Trump may very well be involved in the ring, but my theory is they introduced him to it, Trump refused to participate and then went rogue. The establishment and media united from both sides against Trump because they had no child pedo blackmail they could use to control him. The Pussygate tapes are the best they have.</p>

<p>If Trump was involved, he would not have spoken out against globalism and Soros in his speeches. If there was pedo dirt on Trump, I believe some of it would have leaked during the elections to sabotage his campaign.</p>

<p>I think Trump vaguely knew that human trafficking was going on but he freaked out and went rogue when he found out the extent of it.</p>

<p>It could be idealizing him too much, but I don&#39;t understand why he&#39;d speak out against Soros and threaten Clinton with jail and call the Clinton Foundation a criminal empire live on national tv if he was secretly on their side. There would be no need to mention Soros and bring him in to the American mainstream if Trump was a part of the Clinton crew.</p>
