       The first completely online revolution of a Country.  Perhaps the most significant revolution of all time.  This giant conspiracy is the key to every major elite conspiracy, as they are likely involving the same scum.  This is the big one and everything is at stake.  Don't stop!  They will begin contingencies soon; I, for one, am willing to lose everything for the truth to come out and see that justice is served.  Its almost 3 am east coast and the pizzagate voat subverse is being browsed by nearly as many people as
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is.  They have 8000 users.  We have over 400k.  Its on, don't get fatigued.  Spread it in every creative way you can think of, advocate non-violence, advocate investigation.  Bring them down.  Bring them all down.

       I love these kind of posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was watching a youtube video about PG, and I saw a comment that said "New Zealander checking in to show support" or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what was below it? Probably a hundred comments from people showing their support from all over the world. It was beautiful. Australia, Germany, Hungary, South Africa, Japan and dozens more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started tearing up, because I realized how beautiful that is. Tens of thousands united from around the world to combat against the child abuse that has infested our power structures. Some of the Americans here, myself included, sometimes focus on just the American aspect, but we obviously have seen cases in other countries like the Dutroux affair or the UK Parliament and now Football case.

       Internet crowd sourced revolution. Amazing. "May you live in interesting times".

       I'm pretty sure the citizens of the Roman Empire were disgusted with their leaders' sexual depravity. Homosexuality was pretty high up there, but I think bestiality is what took it too far.

       I mean.  Rome wasn't overthrown by outraged citizens.  It collapsed over more than a century because of many factors working in tandem.  There was a huge plague, runaway inflation, nonstop coups, invasions on several front, a mini ice age, all happening at the same and exacerbating one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       What did NOT happen was the people of Rome overthrowing their leaders for being sexually depraved.  I can't honestly think of a single historical example of that happening.  I'm open to hearing some, but the fall of the Roman Empire doesn't jive.  The fall of the Roman Republic doesn't jive either.

       Depends on who you ask. A lot of people would attribute the weakness that allowed Rome to be overthrown as a direct result of the effeminate culture propagated by the change in behavior of their leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, this isnt a pro or anti homosexuality argument. I'm sure vulnerability to Barbarian hordes wasn't dependent on how individuals preferred their sex. If their leaders aren't focused on leading though, they'll eventually be lead to their destruction. The motivation largely doesn't matter, but to dismiss it entirely because it's not PC is rather silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not ridiculous to say that this shift in culture lead to a more passive stance of their military, leading to defense vulnerabilities they hadn't previously had to deal with. I can guarantee you their citizens weren't happy about that.

       It's only speculative but definitely a nice read. Even if the guy is lying and isn't in some secret society he's clearly very intelligent and has interesting ideas. Claimed Jesus was in the secret society he's now in. He also predicted the Turkey coup and 'the happening' (the black lives matter guy who was sniping cops in Dallas)

       ahhh I remember now I saw that. I think I ignored it right away cuz he said wikileaks is in a holding pattern and Assange is alive, makes no sense to not show proof of life cuz of that.

       He says Wikileaks is a CIA operation. But he also said there's various factions with different intentions, all of which have infiltrated intelligence agencies of course.
      </p>

       Maybe Assange isn't alive anymore or maybe they're keeping him safe somewhere.

       could be true that he is CIA but still need proof of life, if he is CIA what is the need for killing him, no proof of life means they killed him.

       the goverment wants globalization.
       <br/>
       The power to controll all.
       <br/>
       But they forget that whit globalization there while be a global public.
       <br/>
       The global public is stronger together and harder to take down.
       <br/>
       U can easily control a country and its people.
       <br/>
       U can not control all the people of the world.
       <br/>
       And if people all over the world are after u.
       <br/>
       there is no where to hide.
       <br/>
       .
       <br/>
       In a country if 0.01% are after u that is a low amount.
       <br/>
       In the world if 0.01% is after u your fucked.

       Globalization is a dubble edged sword.
       <br/>
       But these fucks think they can control everything.
       <br/>
       I am sorry we 99% are smarter as u.
       <br/>
       And wen robots start replacing humans on a grand scale U ALL FUCKED.
       <br/>
       We humans will not laze around and watch t.v 24/7 we will investigate invent and explore &lt; human nature.
       <br/>
       And wen the world is globalized it will be super easy to from powerful independent group,s whit connections all over the world.
       <br/>
       Wikileaks unanimous is just the start.
       <br/>
       We humans adept and overcome.
       <br/>
       And yes 99% of us will not go there but the 1% that will, will show the rest of us whats up.
       <br/>
       Have fun whit your global cobalt cus it will in the end explode in your face !
.
       <br/>
       .
       <br/>
       Have u all not notice how everytime u controll and manipulate one thing.
       <br/>
       That thing explode and die,s out.
       <br/>
       Only to get replaced ?
       <br/>
       We are so close to create a decentralized internet one where u have no control at all.
       <br/>
       The more control and manipulation u push.
       <br/>
       The more control u and every one loses in the end.
       <br/>
       .
       <br/>
       .
       <br/>
       This is what your fighting every time.

       <br/>
       But in the end they attacks on u will increase faster and faster till it brake,s your own capacity

        "the Chinese curse"

       and implies that that the most interesting periods of history are also the most dangerous to live within. Stay frosty, theorists.

       I was tearing up at 3am today too. It wasn't for the online support, it was just that I was watching the testimonies of an English girl whose grandmother abused her as part of her twisted satanic rituals. I literally broke down. The things these children describe are beyond any healthy person's imagination. We have to stop this. It needs to end now. We need to prove who the people are that are doing this, and organize a worldwide movement to out them in public. Fuck these bastards.

       The more you open your mind to other people from different cultures, the more you realize we are all the same. The divides that are pushed by the media of all countries are there for one purpose: control. Once more and more people wake up and see that for all government's, the last thing they want is a war-free peaceful world, then we will have a chance at true freedom. I don't know about all of you, but I'm sick of being used as a mouse to turn the wheel of these war machines!!

       I don't think he's a pedo, so your argument ends in logic there. I think he's a slimy fuck, but not a pedo. Don't make it seem like I love the dude, he's defintely guilty of shit but in my opinion he's not a pedo.

       I don't really remember ever posting on this sub. Doesn't mean I don't come to read every day. There used to be some interesting stuff on here. Then it just turned into garbage that obviously swings to one side. I remember a time where every conspiracy theory didn't have to do with Hillary Clinton. I hope you enjoyed spending your morning looking through my meaningless posts.

       Judging by the amount of context you got out of what I said, I would guess there is at least one dumb person in here. However, I never mentioned anything about the intelligence of the people in the sub. I've read some great stuff and I think there are a lot of very intelligent people who contribute. I just mentioned that as of late, there is nothing but Hillary email conspiracies and it's getting boring.

       You mean one of the biggest conspiracies that has hard evidence behind it, which was completely glossed over by the media
      </p>
      <p>
       Like its so obvious the whole email thing is setup to circumvent the FOIA, and beyond that, just on principle she made the country less safe by using email as she did. If you really want secure email, it takes a full time staff doing network monitoring, making sure the latest patches are applied to all servers etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit in the wake of the shadowbroker leaks, I wouldn't trust anyone but the NSA to setup a truly secure server - HDD firmware viruses, 0-days against routers and firewalls, Intel management engine, etc etc there are just too many holes to worry about for a small team if you have an advanced persistent threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if she wasn't technologically illiterate she would have understood this, but she wanted to have her cake and eat it to. And people don't even bring up the fact that using the same address for personal and official affairs is in my opinion an abuse of power/conflict of interest - It's like using secretary of state letterhead on personal emails. Especially if she has personal emails with the same people she is emailing professionally, the lines get real blurry.
      </p>
      <p>
       But all the nuance was destroyed in this conversation because Americans don't do nuance very well and she spun it pretty successfully as an unfounded partisan attack. It absolutely was not, she fucked up, she broke the law and james comey basically said as much - the statute doesn't need intent to prove, its the act that's illegal. And it would have been easy to at least put criminal motive to it - hiding from FOIA requirements. Those emails along with podestas lost her the election, have no doubt about it

       What we seeing is two groups, sure the diehard trumpets are all into pizzagate, but another huge group are the ones who just are not diehard democrats who cant imagine entertaining the thought that their group might not be comprised solely of saints. That is why there are so many people discussing it, the only ones who call it bullshit without investigating are the most extreme dems blinded by their devotion.

       The problem is the whole thing falls apart when you remember the Pizza place has employes. You really think some 19 year old slave wage kid working for xbox money is going to keep quiet about a child sex ring happening at his work?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whats more likely? A massive cover up by vetran politicians of a long running chikd sex ring based out of a long standing family restraunt?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or that a man living in a Broom closet realizing mid october that his so called "October Suprise" turned out to be a quiet wet fart and had one of his more clever cronies make something up to save face?

       Well, if the fact that minimum wage workers is what brings the theory down for you, then I suppose that learning that workers eventually go home will be quite a surprise to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny how nobody whose emails have been leaked are claiming they are fake, they all just seem to say it is no fair and the russians (despite evidence) cheated at international politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is getting more and more to be just the extreme liberals who so desperately need their precious politicians to be clean that are holding to the idea that there is nothung there. So many of us dont give a damn about american politics and from an unbiased pov it is very clear that something is off here. Imagine if your mother was accused of rape, it would be so hard for you to see any amount of evidence, i feel for you, but you are blinded, it is not your fault, you literally cannot see what is going on. Your main defense was 'Minimum wage workers'. Good luck buddy.

       You don't find the wording strange though? I like the way you worded it, even though it still makes no sense, but don't you think the way he worded that is bizarre considering he is a well educated man?

       I liked the analogous sentence that somebody posted here yesterday:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Do you think I'll play football better on protein shakes than candy bars?"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a completely reasonable statement, and you wouldn't give it a second thought if you heard somebody say it.  However, since we're all sitting here trolling through some 84-year-old man's sent e-mails, we have no context of previous history.  Maybe the last time he got killed in dominos, he blamed it on being too full from the pasta meal they just had?  Maybe they have a running inside joke about making excuses for why they lost the dominos game?
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       explanation is more plausible than these the pedophilia theories that are being tossed about.  You could tell me that he's talking about cocaine (cheese) and PCP (pasta), which would still be pure bat-shit insanity... and yet 100x more plausible than this pedo angle.

       Yes, I think it is awkwardly worded, totally agree on that.  But you then want to make the leap to "well, it's awkwardly worded, that seems odd so I will assume he is a pedophile".  I am willing to believe but I do require real evidence.  Everything I've seen has a more convincing explanation than "satanic pedo ring".  For example, in the above, he was sending a quick email to friends and didn't take the time to edit his email for clarity.  Now before you tell me that doesn't make perfect sense remember that I am only saying it makes
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       sense than your interpretation.

       Fair enough. I just find it very odd that he didn't say pizza and instead said cheese. Let's say he meant cheese pizza and forgot the pizza part, why would he specify "cheese pizza? This is what intrigues me.

       He got a box of cheeses from Podesta as a Christmas present, instead of the usual gift of pasta and sauce from years prior.  He's going to wait until Susan and James (his grown children) return from their holiday travels (e-mail is dated 12/24) to enjoy the cheese with them.  There is at least one other e-mail where Herbert talks about playing dominos with his grown daughter, Susan.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can either interpret it as BDSM-fueled child rape sessions with his own grown daughter, or a
       <em>
        fucking game of dominos
       </em>
       .  Which one is more likely?

       And BTW, I'm not the one downvoting you.  You're looking at it critically, which is a refreshing change of pace on this sub lately.

       There is an email about dominoes before that one. The guy lost to his daughter playing dominoes who he claimed to be using Podesta strategy of making rules up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then that email shows he got a gift of Cheese instead of the normal pasta gift, followed up by a question if he will play better with cheese.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take that for what you will but it looks like he is joking that he hopes the next time he plays dominoes he will win with the cheese vs the last time he got pasta as a gift.

       The football thing is about youth coaches creeping it up of their own accord and using their position to trick or intimidate the kids into keeping quiet about it. There is, afaik, no suggestion of organised abuse. Just a classic case of paedos getting into positions of authority over kids as they are wont to do.

       good, so let's stop talking about "pizza" and dis-associate from that particular avenue of inquiry until/ unless some better evidence to support it pops of.  call it pedogate or whatever (even though a lot of these folks are probably more interested in teenagers than actual children)

       Pizzagate IS NOT comet pizza and Alefantis. 
Pizzagate is the realization and potential understanding of how the ruling elite operate, what they are willing to do to hide opposition, and the fact that the US government very well may be extremely close to child trafficking found in numerous other countries abroad

       but it's a certain ethos of "low information" that we're associating with the Trump supporters.

      <p>
       it's posts like this, from 3 day old accounts using emotional language and extreme concepts in the promotion of what currently bears many hallmarks of a witch-hunt, that connects it to the troll campaign which has been waged in favor of a Trump candidacy.

       The main source is the "pizza code" which some anonymous people have applied to mundane and common words in the wikileaks emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you start altering facts and applying controversial interpretations to things (like "pan is the god of pedophilia"), then it's easy to create a narrative which fits with your pre-determined conclusions.  This type of story building is consistently used to discredit "conspiracy theories".
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially if there IS some truth to the larger allegations and concepts (which there absolutely is), now you've managed to discredit the search for truth by associating it with a very specific and misguided investigation into a goose chase.

       I've seen pics grabbed from pedophilia websites on the deep web and the language they use is the same as they do in the Podesta emails, referencing pizza and cheese etc..

        notice the date

       You can also search for dark web posts from child porn forums and you will easily see the connection. Only a fool would think these emails are not code.

       Well, you've got me beat there.  I'm not interested in being exposed to child porn in order to expose this non-existent child sex abuse ring... but huge props to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're still making a HUGE stretch, dude.  Out of like 50,000 emails, they've been whittled down to about 100-200 that mention pizza or cheese.  Out of those 100-200, you've narrowed them down to about 6 (as far as I can tell) that aren't
       <em>
        embarrassingly
       </em>
       easy to explain away as office banter, or, you know...
       <em>
        actual conversations about pizza
       </em>
       .  Out of those 6 or so, there are still perfectly plausible explanations for all but one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <strong>
        pizza-related map
       </strong>
       is definitely weird.  But given that it is literally
       <em>
        the only
       </em>
       e-mail that isn't painfully easy to explain, I still think that it's not anything nefarious.  Any conversation that took place on the original e-mail thread between Susan Sandler and the realtor has been lost... which is certainly a possibility, because the wikileaks thread doesn't ever show her answering the question about pillows they purchased.  It's totally plausible that the realtor described more about the handkerchief during those e-mails to Susan... including what design it had on it, and then Susan forwarded the original to Podesta in order to keep those subsequent conversations private.  I do shit like that literally every day with my work e-mails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta was so
       <em>
        amazingly
       </em>
       unconcerned about the alleged semen and blood-encrusted Satanic cum rag left on the kitchen island,
       <em>
        he didn't even respond for 36 hours.
       </em>
       When he did finally respond, he said, "It's mine, but not worth worrying about."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's right.  This guy who was with the Clintons through the whole Monica affair was
       <em>
        so unconcerned
       </em>
       about a random Martha's Vineyard realtor having his DNA-covered Satanic child-raping jizz rag, he didn't even give her instructions to dispose of it!
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think about it.  Use every bit of critical thinking capacity you have, and if you're still convinced that it was a Satanic blood and jizz-encrusted child rape trophy, then at least I've said my piece.  There's nothing else I can do.

       I think the word "map" is just an autocorrect typo. Possibly for the word "mark" because that makes the sentence make a lot more sense.

       Totally plausible... but it still doesn't explain whether it had a tomato sauce stain on it from John's mouth, or the pizzagate explanation:  jizz and blood from his Satanic ritualistic child rape session in Martha's Vineyard.

       You're 100% right to be sickened.  Any decent person would be.  I only read the text of your voat link, because I have
       <em>
        zero
       </em>
       desire to view the links.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, you're mistaken about the other emails.  They have absolutely nothing in common with what you linked from voat, and are a total red herring.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, you do realize that the phrase "cheese pizza" appears exactly zero times in the Podesta or Clinton e-mails, right?  It appears exactly once in the Stratfor dump... and they're talking about... wait for it...
       <em>
        a goddamn
        <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/11/1155044_re-lunch-with-g-on-friday-.html">
         cheese pizza.
        </a>
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The other Stratfor e-mail that everyone has their panties in a bunch over is
       <strong>
        "How thin to slice it?"
       </strong>
       Jesus Christ, this is so clearly an in-joke between the Stratfor staff. The e-mail is addressed to the
       <em>
        entire Austin staff
       </em>
       , men and women alike.  Like
       <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/2b/0e/96/2b0e96d8cd8d7bc362fc72b72903a9e9.jpg">
        this woman
       </a>
       .  Holy shit, there's a guilty looking pedo if I've ever seen one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you
       <em>
        honestly
       </em>
       think 100% of this office just happens to be child rapists?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if they didn't order enough pizza last time or what, but all the jokes about filling out forms in triplicate, double-sided, color-coded, etc. is typical office humor. Plus, there's another e-mail thread about an office pizza party which shows the off-site employees bumming out since they won't be there for pizza, and the final guy insinuates that it's a bribe from management, and somebody else should eat his slice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how young you are, but let me let you in on a little secret:  Those of us who work in offices eat a
       <em>
        metric fuck-ton
       </em>
       of pizza.  It's the easiest meal to bring in when you're busy.  And I think you can safely assume that Stratfor Austin is pretty fucking busy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at it honestly, and without rage or bias getting in your way, you quickly understand how fucking
       <em>
        ridiculous
       </em>
       is to think that their entire Austin office is planning to fuck a kid
       <strong>
        over an office-wide e-mail thread
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       PIZZAGATE SEZ: THE ENTIRE STRATFOR AUSTIN OFFICE IS DIVVYING UP A CHILD TO FUCK. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET A COUNT OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT "IN".
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Dominos on cheese or pasta
       </strong>
       : This one seems so blindingly obvious. Keep in mind that the author is the 83-year-old Herb Sandler. His wife Marion of 51 years died about 3 years prior. Podesta had traditionally sent him an Xmas gift of pasta and sauce (Podesta is a known "foodie"), but this time, he got a box of cheeses. He thanks Podesta, and says that when his children (Susan and James) get back from their holiday travels (e-mail is dated 12/24), he'll enjoy the cheeses with them. Since there are other e-mails talking about how Susan (his grown daughter)
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34860">
        has beaten him at dominos before
       </a>
       , he's wondering if the cheese will improve his luck. This is a simple thank you for a Christmas gift. And fucking news flash: An 83-year-old man likes to play dominos.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT PIZZAGATE SEZ: PODESTA SENT A CHILD FOR 83-YEAR-OLD HERB TO FUCK. HE WAS EXPECTING A BOY, BUT GOT A GIRL. HE WONDERS IF HE'LL BE ABLE TO DOMINATE THE LITTLE GIRL BETTER IN HIS BDSM SEX PLAY, AS HE WAS LIMP-DICKED WITH THE LITTLE BOY LAST TIME.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use your brain, man.  Don't fall for this bogus shit.  It's ruining all credibility of the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       shit going down, i.e., Silsby &amp; Hillary, people getting "suicided", Epstein's pedo plane and fuck island, and all those who visit there.

       Sorry, I hate the Democrats enough that I fled the US in anticipation of a Clinton victory (that it was Trump only validated my decision).

       I don't support Trump like that but I fully support the investigation of  potential  trafficking brought to light by pizzagate
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate IS NOT comet pizza and Alefantis. 
Pizzagate is the realization and potential understanding of how the ruling elite operate, what they are willing to do to hide opposition, and the fact that the US government very well may be extremely close to child trafficking found in numerous other countries abroad.

       I haven't seen a single shred of evidence offered by a single person that would lead me to think that
       <em>

       there was something going on. You people are adding 30 unconnected coincidences or outright fantasies and putting them together like they form some kind of whole. It's complete and utter nonsense. I mean, by all means enlighten me, but you probably won't be able to because you yourself have no single specific piece of actual evidence to show. You have just

       So what it can't be true?? Is that what ur saying? This has happened before, EXACTLY. A pizza shop with young girls in the basement has already been found. The guy was tried for human trafficking and pedophilia. This exact scenario has happened before, but oh no this is such a crazy conspiracy. Ur an idiot and clearly haven't done any research .

       Of course it's your fucking fault, you are linking them, without a single shred of evidence, to a fucking paedophile ring. How is it

       You are without a doubt the stupidest person I've seen on reddit in a long time, you've failed to even come up with one cohesive argument and instead just parrot the same shit over and over again. I think I've lost brain cells just looking at the babble that you've somehow managed to type, which was probably extremely complicated for you, seeing that you've got the same level of intelligence and critical thinking as a 2 year old who's done nothing but sniff glue for his entire life.

       Okay well here's the biggest issue with "Pizzagate". It's actually putting people at risk. Seeing that a fucking gunman decided to go on some stupid unjustified "rescue" mission for some children that most likely don't exist.

       Because I'm sure that sites like "Above Top Secret" and "Infowars" are truly dedicated to spreading the truth. Alternate media isn't some kind of beacon of trustworthiness in today's society. It's the same as the rest of media, dedicated to pushing a specific agenda.

       And you wonder why people don't take you guys seriously. When presented with a very simple question, you can't even answer it. You just say it's 'obvious'. Well, if it's so obvious then you shouldn't have any problem spelling it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, you have nothing, and you are not fooling anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's fine for you. You'll just say that you're the only one that sees the TRUTH, and everyone else just has their heads buried in the sand, because they actually make decisions based on facts and you make yours based off of feelings and distrust.

       I'm starting to believe (to become redpilled if you will) that #pizzagate is a conspiracy, or trollspiracy, funded by Stephen Bannon, to cover up a peadophile ring run by Donald J Trump (the only high official formally accused of peadophilia, incidentally). This literally goes all the way up to the highest levels of goverment and threatens to bring it down, so they have enlisted an army of useful idiots to create this mountain of garbage they call #pizzagate to bury the real story here.

       That's... actually a decent theory.  One of the most basic forms of subversion is to accuse your opponents of exactly what your organization is doing.  In the case of Trump, we actually
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       (past-tense, since the death threats kept their victim from going public) evidence that he is a dangerous pedophile.

       Lying about a basement, interesting art taste, weird emails, the list goes on. There's no smoking gun but all of it is worth investigating and the fact that it's already happened before in a pizza shop makes this not farfetched at all.

       PROVIDE SOME FUCKING EVIDENCE
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously. There is zero evidence to substantiate a child sex ring at Comet Ping Pong. I have seen nothing credible, but I keep checking back in, hoping one of you perverts will exonerate yourselves with a shred of anything beyond "muh code words".
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, we know some politicians and other elites are rapists and pedophiles. Yes, we can make a safe guess we've caught fewer of them than are still at large. And you've caught... zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thousands of you tards have been at work on it for a month, and the only thing you've managed to do is scare the shit out of patrons at a pizza restaurant by getting on of your own so riled up, he tried to be an hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       You failed. This whole movement is a failure. You're just too spineless to admit your failure, so you keep going after the same target.
      </p>
      <p>
       And tell me, what have you actually done to help victims of sexual abuse? Have you volunteered or donated to any organization that attempts to help victims find peace? Yeah, most of you people dgaf. You're doing it because it arouses you.

      </p>
      <p>
       Why? How about if I change the words a bit? How about if I say the same thing in different sentences?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not posting threads nor are these top level comments.
      </p>

       You see what I'm getting at? I don't want to be banned obviously but I would like to why it's
       <em>
        spam
       </em>
       ? because I don't feel like typing up the same response each time despite the same thing needing to be said?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was I reported? I get it but I don't get it at the same time.

       The biggest issue I find in this whole "pizzagate" thing is that there are no victims or witnesses coming forward to corroborate these allegations. Only internet sleuths.

       I can't disagree with you on the point of evidence, but the majority of users of the sub have only one tool in order to uncover this mystery. All we have is a computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't have the resources of the FBI, the authority of the local PD, or even the protection for really diving head first into uncovering disgusting crimes such as this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real problem is you are asking for proof from the wrong people. Have you asked yourself, where is the proof from people in a position to provide it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Understand our frustrations. We are relying on a system that prosecutes whistleblowers, that protects those with enough power that can do harm without repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donate to a cause, you say? Like the Red Cross...? You hang out in this sub and point fingers. We have reasons why we don't blindly "donate to a cause". There are fine "normal" people out there like you and me looking into these issues and they end up killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, where is the evidence? It's being buried while we are at work, or at home, or on Reddit. It's being stolen from us as "propaganda" or fake news. It's being hidden under the guise of looking for evidence gets you arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       We, or maybe some, are fighting against a system with little else than an IP Address. I can only hope that you find a passion for truth and a means. It's more than we have at the moment.

       I'm not asking for your belief. You can believe what you want. I was directly responding to the "no evidence" claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are limited to circumstantial evidence (questionable photos, questionable context, interlinked shady business activity, questionable motives) unless the law is broken to obtain in.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to ignore the ugly plausibility then in no way will I stop you. There is no "hard" evidence one way or another, but enough for an agency to do more than is currently being done.

       You are asking for citizens to pursue potential abduction cases. It's absurd.

       You are taking the actions of one person (actor or not) and applying it to the population as a whole. That seems unfair.

       I cannot condone putting people in danger and will never want to face a situation like that with my family.

       Do you see the bigger picture, however? These questionable, disgusting, allegations are
       <strong>
        not being challenged thoroughly
       </strong>
       .

        Who were the children on the Instagram feed of the Pizza shop owner?
       </li>
       <li>
        Why was one child taped to a table?
       </li>
       <li>
        Why does their website have a login to large zipped files?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There are many, many more questions that are not only being ignored, but pushed aside as "fake news". There is no hard evidence because either: A) There is pressure from the very top to make this go away or B) There are agencies involved that are trying to keep things under wraps for investigation purposes. I hope its B, i'm more concerned its A.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself for one moment, as a human being, would you ever in your life post a picture of a child taped to a table to your social media feed? If not, then I hope you can understand why we, or maybe I, am so angered by this.

        Somebody already asked James Alefantis who the girl is and why she's taped to the table. They were abrasive as fuck and still got a calm response from Alefantis. And they were offered free coffee and got a free tour of Comet Ping Pong.
       </a>

       I was making a generalization. As we move through the new era of "fake news", anything that doesn't fit the agenda narrative will scrubbed away and hidden. Search results will be removed, not indexed, or hidden. Our history can be changed as easily as editing a wiki entry.

       Which is exactly opposite of what you are implying. It sounds like you are arguing that news sources should "misstate, misrepresent, and conceal information."

      <p>
       The facebook fiasco is old news and is no different that what you are advocating for.

       Dude, the first thing I said was prove it. If I want anything, it's evidence. I don't respect baseless nonsense, and I don't respect your ignorant ass for not understanding the concept of evidence, but being totally willing to toot your horn about the righteousness of your "investigation". You're not smart enough to investigate anything but your peen.

       So why are you here?   What do you care?  Are you really so upset about people harrassing one or two pizza joints?  I dont support any harrasment of the establishments.  But i just dont get why its your mission to come to their aid.  Of all the fucked up things in the world why are you not using your time more efficiently to help out those problems than posting on a conspiracy forum and arguing with internet strangers about a 'kooky' conspiracy.  Honestly.   Most people who have no dog in the fight would just ignore it and move on.  Is there something personally at stake for you in all this?  If not then wow, homeslice go do something more productive.

       My mission? No, I'm just annoyed enough with the stupidity to challenge you guys on it once in a while. I'm here because I've been here for almost a decade. I'm here out of habit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find the whole thing asinine, and I have as much right to tell the mob how asinine it is as the mob does to howl about how close they are to upturning the elite power structure, or whatever it is they think they're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I bother because it's dishonest to call what they've uncovered "evidence". I think it's worthwhile to challenge dishonesty. I'd bet you anything, some of the most vocal mob members agree with that sentiment. It's just too bad they don't understand how hypocritical they're being.

       Well then i suppose we all have something in common, thinking our words will change peoples hardline stances. It just doesnt work that way.
   Which is why i myself wisened up and quit being so fanatical about talking conspiracy with non believers.   I will bring up points about systematic control and propaganda at times.  But just small doses and not with the belief my words will change minds.  Just in the hopes my words will help plant seeds which will grow the more people are exposed to sinister agendas.

       Of course.  This is why real life detectives must use what evidence they have and follow leads.  They also never dismiss coincidences.  Dismissing coincidences is in direct conflict with their line of work.

       Ok, fine then. Why haven't you already taken these pedophiles to court if you have such good evidence? Surely you'd be able to find a victim, or someone who knows a victim, directly linked to one of these pizza places. Are you a victim? Did you get molested in alefantis's basement?

       What the fuck does that have to do with anything. If Conde Naste decide to shutter reddit tomorrow, reddit shuts down, and we're all banned, and there's no more conversation on reddit, and there's nothing anyone here can do about it. That's not censorship, or an attack on free speech, it's a company deciding what they do with their website. Full stop.

       Sure, it's a privately owned public forum, if you want to be precise. So still freedom of speech laws do not apply here, which was my point, which you might have deduced if you could interpret language.

       wow you are out of touch. Already the major social platforms have agreed to censor this stuff, a legal agreement with the EU. A house resolution was already passed to censor fake news. You are in for a real surprise buddy.

       And so are these fascists when any of this actually goes to court in america - if they couldn't get our guns, they're not taking our speech.

       Are you an American? If so, the fact that you think we shouldn't be allowed to speak freely is disturbing. This isn't fire in a crowded building, this isn't libel, this isn't slander

       this doesn't go to court. Social platforms and news sources have the right to censor anything they like. PG made it easy to do so, and no one will complain. If you have been watching the democrats are laughing their asses off about it. Go look up Sam Bee's segment about it from 2 days ago.

       use your free speech (I never changed anything, I said it is already being censored, ie: losing free speech), just realize you may be in the middle of a trap. I don't have to convince anyone of anything, just go read the f-ing news. It is all over. I'm a man, one who is not deceived by bullshit. Go ahead and move to smaller platforms, all that does is limit your exposure, which is exactly what they want. I am not saying there is a way around it, they set the trap, you stepped in it, now you are pissed off I am pointing that out.

       You said you're about to lose your freedom of speech - that doesn't mean "you're gonna get censored" stop this 1984 destruction of language bullshit. Words have meanings, think before you speak - unless you're just trying to spread propaganda by using hyperbole

       Lol no they are trying to control the narrative and by buying into their bullshit you're helping. They want to have a chilling effect, and you're saying we should STFU because they're gonna censor us? If we can't talk freely whats the point?

       I don't have to have a chilling effect, go talk about whatever you want. I am not the one who will be forcing you to shut up. Go talk, shout it from the rooftops. Nothing will backfire because the media are the ones propagating this. You think they will tell a balanced story? You think people will suddenly wake up and see the world is a conspiracy? That is naive, this has happened many many times already, rights are taken away because of a made up bullshit story. Think "shoe bomber" just as an example. Complete bullshit yet we still have to take our shoes off to fly. That is a much less impactful freedom to lose, but it is a simple example. No pushback, no one pointed out the story was bogus, they just accept it because the media told them to be afraid, so they are.

        Editor’s Note: The Washington Post on Nov. 24 published a story on the work of four sets of researchers who have examined what they say are Russian propaganda efforts to undermine American democracy and interests. One of them was PropOrNot, a group that insists on public anonymity, which issued a report identifying more than 200 websites that, in its view, wittingly or unwittingly published or echoed Russian propaganda. A number of those sites have objected to being included on PropOrNot’s list, and some of the sites, as well as others not on the list, have publicly challenged the group’s methodology and conclusions. The Post, which did not name any of the sites, does not itself vouch for the validity of PropOrNot’s findings regarding any individual media outlet, nor did the article purport to do so. Since publication of The Post’s story, PropOrNot has removed some sites from its list.

       Dang media.  It was a guy who went in, shot NOBODY, walked into the back looking for children to rescue.  Meanwhile everybody ran out the front door.  This guy finds a locked door in the back and shot the door lock so he could get in and still found nothing.

       This is not the definition of a terrorist who's trying to cause terror.  It's also not the definition of "shot up".  It is however the definition of the kind of activity we reject.

       I think it shows how stupid a lot of the people continuing this bullshit are honestly.  So assuming Pizzagate was all even real, did that guy who went in there really fucking think he would find kids in there being abused?  Even after this has been publicly discussed for over two months?  They would just carry on like normal?  With all the real cases of child abuse going on and people like Epstein who actually were guilty of it, this is just a circus show of ridiculousness and illogical thinking.

       I just offered my opinion, which is what this site is for, discussion.  But the main point of my post was that these people have been publicly accused of a crime, and everyone here thinks they are just continuing on as if nothing has happened and would be stupid enough to still be using places people are stalking for their crimes.  If you really believe all of this Pizzagate stuff, do you really believe they are dumb enough to not change the sites they use or lay low for a while?  I think anyone going to Comet Ping Pong now and thinking they will find someone in the act is certifiably batshit crazy.

       You don't want a conversation, you want a "safe space". That just shows how weak your beliefs are, that they can't even stand up to criticism and scrutiny. Pathetic.

       Right. I am all for people having and expressing their opinions.  And we should not all live in an echo chamber.  But what is more pathetic.  Being a conspiracy theorist.  Or somebody who comes onto a conspiracy forum to randomly argue with conspiracy theorists?  Most people i know who are not into these sorts of things just go about their day and dont waste their time and energy to dispute it.  Sure if somebody comes to you then you may get into a discussion.  But going out of your way to get into an argument.  Seems strange to me.

       No, youve expressed quite a few opinions, one of which i found humourous was your defence of Tamera Luzzattos emails. How her specifically naming the person providing Uber transport for the three kids, with their appropriate ages, being provided as 'entertainment' in the pool for the adults attending was just normal. The reassurance that they will be in the pool as well, everything about it lol...like I know you gotta put people down to try and discredit this thing but hold back on the namecalling, its hypocritical but mainly it just gives you away. Noone treats people like that on a conspiracy sub cause well...its a conspiracy sub

       Yes I made an alternate account because I feel very strongly about this. We are all going to get hurt from this bullshit. Now, looking at your history shows very short simple posts on almost everything, exactly what a bot would look like. Did your human handler take you over to post this? See how fun it is to snoop on people and make snarky comments instead of making an intelligent reply?

       I don't think anyone asked for nor deserves to lose their freedom of speech.  Rumors have been around forever.  Just because this is big and involves a lot of people doesn't require or justify any sort of legal intervention to stop it.  Nobody is "asking for it".

       no, that is a much older conspiracy, you don't get to rename it with some fake name in order to push it under the rug. That is global child exploitation and trafficking, and some of us have been researching that for many years. Pizzagate is exactly what the name says, that pizza places and Podesta are involved in some sort of child sex thing.

       I'm out. I've been reading r/conspiracy for 6 years, and as of recently, it has completely divulged into a breeding ground for the craziest of r/The_Donald. A sub that should be fully investigating the hundreds of conspiracies surrounding our new president-elect is stuck on fucking code names for pizza. Fuck.

       The first thing I read on this sub about PG was the emails to John Podesta referencing pizza related maps, as well as a reference to pasta, which are apparently code names for sex with children (although I've never seen official evidence of this). I read into Tony Podesta's fucked up art collection and his connections. I read about the strange events held at Comet Pizza and Ping Pong, which happens to be located near a few establishments also related to the Podesta's and other high ranking officials. I read about the fundraisers that they held for certain Democratic candidates. I watched some shitty cell phone videos of independent investigators looking for tunnels. I read about a government official who works in the area for law enforcement, and could be related. I went through pages of weird pictures on their social media accounts that seemed to have no direct connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this, not a single bit of it, comes close the scientific and structural engineering inconsistencies of the 9/11 commission report - a real conspiracy. Not a far fetched political narrative like you all seem to be pushing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do child sex rings and secret pedofile groups exist? Yes. Could they involve high ranking government officials? Absolutely. Does the evidence produced by the PG conspiracy prove any of it? Not even remotely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to do a fair amount of research on PG before denouncing it, but if I have it wrong, please enlighten me with some facts.

       No that's not far off from what we have so far...it's not overwhelming yet
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the sentiment so far is that "theres SOMETHING going on, which we would have never been clued into if those emails weren't leaked, there are more pieces to the puzzle they just need to be found."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also something many have been (more broadly) alleging for years now, and we finally have a few more specific strings to start pulling and seeing the evidence of that segment of elite scrambling to shut this down is validating the movement and giving it drive to keep pushing

       Pizzagate IS NOT comet pizza and Alefantis. 
Pizzagate is the realization and potential understanding of how the ruling elite operate, what they are willing to do to hide opposition, and the fact that the US government very well may be extremely close to child trafficking found in numerous other countries abroad

       It all goes back before the Sumerians. The elites linked to this satanic cult believe they are doing this all to make the sacrifice to bring gods vision of perfect or some shite like that. This plan has been in the works for a long time to make the biggest human sacrifice  ever! don't just look at the now, go back through history people like John Dee, the start of the Greek empire and the Sumerian tablets..

       honestly though folks, everything i came across was from official historical documents available to anyone.

       Which god? Are we supposed to believe that the moneyed elites not only believe in a god, but that it's an ancient Sumerian god? And that they are performing ritual human sacrifice?

      <p>
       Now that's a real conspiracy theory. Or a call of cthulu campaign.

       I know it sounds crazy, i think it's something similar to the Yazidis' belief in the devil as god rather than a god (the Sumerians believed aliens where god) only more of a satanic cult than anything else.

       This has been in place since the 70s and this is the first real chance to make a change. Everything that has happened in the past 40 years isn't by accident. It has been a coordinated attack on the citizens by the ruling elite.

       This has been a long time coming. It's the type of investigation where large numbers are necessary so that being silenced isn't an option. About three years ago I wanted to start an investigation into this topic. If organized right it would reveal who the kingpins were. My wife and daughter talked me out of it. Too dangerous to go it alone. Now it's a movement. I would say, don't get angry at the non-believers. They have normalcy bias and some others may be involved (MSM cough). They have to be terrified. I expect the strongest push for censorship we've ever seen.

       I believe you are 100% correct! I think that the very right to freely post on the internet might be at stake; and that it would be smart to begin taking measures to ensure the spread of the ideas and analytical pursuit of truth found here in r/conspiracy. I've started a thread for anyone wanting to discuss it further:

       Can someone give me something to satisfy my curiosity on the matter, considering I know nothing about this at all? I googled it and only got a YouTube video about Comet Pizza and upside-down stars, which I can safely dismiss as "nutty".

       I'm just curious what the ratio is here in terms of awareness of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Usually older) Folks that only watch Shit stream media watch one or two source videos or articles and they declare, wow the Internet is reporting on a fake news story, and it's ruining the life of a pizza shop owner, then a crazy gunman goes in and shoots up the place. (As my manager recently said).
      </p>
      <p>
       If people do their own research (multiple sources!) the conclusion is quite obvious and this is a satanic disease that everyone involved is desparately covering up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope the ratio is 80:20, truth seekers to Shit stream media parrots.

       There is so much disinformation to throw most off the trail that we are left with a bunch of circumstantial evidence, and documented evidence which in sum points to guilt. Wikileaks shows clear documented verified evidence that points to what these sicko are into, what the practice and believe.

       So if you are wanting to out the truth, now it's your turn to do some research now that I've given you a solid starting point. Or are you just going to keep denying it and say this isn't evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd rather not waste my time with you because I know even if I present a pile of "evidence" you will say it's not good enough. You are either unwilling to open your eyes, or you clearly have alterior motives. (meaning you do not want the truth to come out for whatever agenda.). I'll assume you have good scrupulous intentions so am providing some sources here.

       All these sources are in addition to the established fact that Hillary Clinton got Laura Silsby pardoned after she got caught smuggling 33 children out of Haiti. Why do you think the CF was in Haiti and burned

       ? And an important prosecutor in the DOJ - Ruo - was also caught showing interest in sick instagram images. The Podesta brothers clearly have a sick interest in spirit cooking (see wikileaks email) and related art, while they show an uncanny resemblance to Madeline McCann's kidnappers.

       As I said, in aggregate, when you research for hours on this and other connected topics, it's plain as day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more specific: Taking one or two sources into account, you are left with many gray areas. When you look at aggregate data, or multiple research theories, accusations, witness testimony and journalistic conclusions, your perspective becomes more black and white. (Assuming you can hold many data points in memory to string them all together.)

       Satanism is completely aligned with those pulling the strings. Read up on 'khazarian mafia veteranstoday'. Also see the

       I don't think satanists are bad so long as they are getting consent. A dictator like Mugabe is different. He is doing the opposite of dictating by consent. Some people want to see mass murders, but I don't think all satanists would want this.

       Yeah I'm definitely not advocating that. I'm just pretty skeptical that an accurate picture can be drawn without actually doing real investigating. If it was this easy to uncover a story then investigative journalists would also operate this way.

       This investigation just started. You know it takes years sometimes for sexual abuse victims to cover forward. Look at how long it took for bill Cosby's victims to cover forward. Not to mention, if there victims are children how could they possibly come forward? It's not like little kids know how to leak information to the media or file a police report. I mean, a kid couldn't file a police report without their parents, and who knows if these kids are orphans, run aways, or abductees. So they may not even have parents to protect them

       Stop.  Somebody did this already, got all the way to the back, found nothing, and was arrested.  Next day, media is calling for total censorship of the subject.  It was all a ruse instigated to get that censorship.  The real story is probably elsewhere.

       We have no proof of anything at Comet.  Just shade.  It could very well be a distraction, like say Alefantis is part of a ring, and that's why he likes the dirty rock concerts there, but at the same time doesn't actually do anything illegal at Comet.  Just an arbitrary theory, but at this point there is no proof of any illegal activity here.  One further: If there ever was, they surely stopped once they got the spotlight and went elsewhere.

         From all the money they're pouring into shilling, they REALLY don't want us to talk about it. Its important to spread the message online but don't forget about talking about it to friends and family irl! I'm a college student so many of my friends are college educated,  and I have yet explain pizzagate to someone who straight up refuses to believe there's anything suspicious. The CTR wants you to believe your silly conspiracy theories will be mocked and laughed at, BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE!

         </strong>
         argue with them until your blue in the face! Don't let even a single post  trying to discredit our investigation left unrefuted. Lurkers will read every comment and see our truth everytime these shills try to cover this shit up.

       Yet you talk of being willing to lose everything. Do you bring this up with people you work with? Post about on Facebook? I'm guessing no because that could have real consequences for you. Hiding behind your laptop on a throwaway while boasting about how committed you are is almost as absurd as pizzagate itself.

       So you reference my post and then ask dumb questions you should already know the answer to? I just wrote about how I have talked to many people Irl about this already. I'm not afraid of ridicule.

       I'm not surprised your reading comprehension is this terrible. If you had any ability to think critically you would see why pizzagate warrants a legitimate investigation.

       How exactly am I a coward and a liar? Because you disagree with me? Seriously, your deductive skills are quite terrible as well.

      <p>
       I don't think a coward would be openly supporting a conspiracy theory that the media is trying to turn the entire world against. Standing up to the mainstream media and the elite that govern it is not something a coward would do. You don't think I've encountered people in real life who has already succumbed to the fake news narrative? That doesn't stop me from spreading pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       A REAL coward would allow himself to be bribed into defending these sick fucks. How much money did it take for you to completely abandon your morals? You shills make me so fucking sick. Don't dare call me a coward and a liar when you yourself a filthy sell out.
      </p>
      <p>
       If somehow you're not a shill, then you are the classic example of a sheep. Learn to think for yourself. Quit defending people who kill, rape, and sell children.

       Pizzagate IS NOT comet pizza and Alefantis. 
Pizzagate is the realization and potential understanding of how the ruling elite operate, what they are willing to do to hide opposition, and the fact that the US government very well may be extremely close to child trafficking found in numerous other countries abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those speaking up against it are almost already a lost cause. the ones on the sidelines. The one still wondering. The ones across the world who understand how the globalists work. These are the people we need to influence. Not the literal shills who shill without even knowing it. At least tv pundits get paid millions of dollars. The idiots trolling us are doing it for free and think it's because they are patriotic.

       What we seeing is two groups, sure the diehard trumpets are all into pizzagate, but another huge group are the ones who just are not diehard democrats who cant imagine entertaining the thought that their group might not be comprised solely of saints. That is why there are so many people discussing it, the only ones who call it bullshit without investigating are the most extreme dems blinded by their devotion.

       You said you're about to lose your freedom of speech - that doesn't mean "you're gonna get censored" stop this 1984 destruction of language bullshit. Words have meanings, think before you speak - unless you're just trying to spread propaganda by using hyperbole

       Lol no they are trying to control the narrative and by buying into their bullshit you're helping. They want to have a chilling effect, and you're saying we should STFU because they're gonna censor us? If we can't talk freely whats the point?

       Depends on who you ask. A lot of people would attribute the weakness that allowed Rome to be overthrown as a direct result of the effeminate culture propagated by the change in behavior of their leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, this isnt a pro or anti homosexuality argument. I'm sure vulnerability to Barbarian hordes wasn't dependent on how individuals preferred their sex. If their leaders aren't focused on leading though, they'll eventually be lead to their destruction. The motivation largely doesn't matter, but to dismiss it entirely because it's not PC is rather silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not ridiculous to say that this shift in culture lead to a more passive stance of their military, leading to defense vulnerabilities they hadn't previously had to deal with. I can guarantee you their citizens weren't happy about that.
