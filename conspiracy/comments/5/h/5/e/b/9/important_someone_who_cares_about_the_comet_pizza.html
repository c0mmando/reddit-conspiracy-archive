<p>Apparently imdb has a false entry for him in &quot;something about pizza&quot; how that was done so fast is strange in itself.  I found a dec capture that does NOT show him with more than 1 acting credit and nothing about &quot;something about pizza&quot; so i guess it was added  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161206073247/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2625901/">https://web.archive.org/web/20161206073247/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2625901/</a></p>

<p>Backing that up  <a href="http://archive.is/6Vl1T">http://archive.is/6Vl1T</a></p>

<p>Then about a day after the incident it later it appears  <a href="http://archive.is/1htIv">http://archive.is/1htIv</a></p>

<p>So take the rest of this about &quot;something about pizza&quot; with a grain of salt because it seems IMDB&#39;s  is not perfect</p>

<p>Whats disturbing is how fast this credit was manipulated on IMDB which typically takes a while to do. I dont know if there was an insider  helping or what. Very strange.</p>

<p>I also dont know what this means. Is someone trying to draw attention to this strange movie called &quot;something about pizza&quot;. Who could alter his credit so fast? Imdb has a process. Does the movie even really exist? Is someone trolling datasources? I have no idea but its strange and its real.</p>

<p>BE AWARE THE REFERENCE DATABASES ARE BEING CHANGED IN THESE INCIDENTS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is strange to see the medias efforts to &quot;debunk&quot; completely and utterly backfire.</p>

<p>But they know what we are like... they know we are fact-checking and archiving as much as possible. They know that a blanket statement of debunked with out a serious questioning will only strengthen our resolve.</p>

<p>Its almost like they are fanning the flames. I don&#39;t believe (that they are intentionally fanning flames) in earnest, but I have so many questions.... None of the past year is making much sense to me at the moment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an IMDb contributor, I can tell you it is very easy to submit credits and the process time is very short for existing titles and names. If that movie already existed in the database, someone could submit a credit for him and it could show up in less than 24 hours. They don&#39;t vet submissions too well and mis-credits are usually approved initially.</p>

<p>The first time I viewed it, it didn&#39;t even have the actor part. It was just The Mill, A Tale About Bootlegging and Mute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trap i dont know.</p>

<p>If it was a trap then it has perhaps been discovered with this amazon owned imdb database alteration.</p>

<p>Maybe it was someone trying to send a signal . They certianly picked an interesting movie title and storyline and location to link him to. Who knows?</p>

<p>In his new york times interview the gunman  clearly said he drove to comet pizza from north carolina concerned about possible traped kids.  Why would this guy have such strong concerns more than so many other people who also have kids so as to drive so far?  The other movie references like &quot;The Bleeding&quot; are as far as i know unaltered like the bleeding which has another actor who also worked in 1989  with corey haim and corey feldman . Those two coreys said they were passd around in pedophil hollywood when they were young.</p>

<p>I have no idea what it means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah. How dare you temper emotions with a modicum of caution? I support a lot of the work being done on voat (although much of it seems more like fear porn or deliberate garden paths posted by shills), but they don&#39;t take too kindly to voices of reason in those parts.</p>
