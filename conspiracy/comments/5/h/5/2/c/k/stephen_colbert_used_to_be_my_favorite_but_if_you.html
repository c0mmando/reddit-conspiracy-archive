       Holy shit omfg they are "all hands on deck, the ship is sinking, we need to throw everything we have at this or we are fucked" in that kind of mindset. I can't even believe what i'm seeing. I don't watch T.V. much anymore for whatever my personal reasons. The fact of the matter is he is literally siting us, and our investigation to further make us seem like loons. Using quotes from the POPE of all people to make a mockery. I'm not scared or disturbed or anything, i'm more so shocked. This whole comedic banter started with them initially saying that they aren't real news, that they are entertainment. But then went on too discredit every good sliver of information that was out there and make a mockery about it. That doesn't surprise me. What does surprise me is how Colbert can be okay with that kind of thing. I knew that him getting this big wig job would make a difference in the character he was portraying, but not like this. I was stoked for him. This worries me.

       What I cannot understand is how the reality of the current Democrat Party/globalist/media system; war mongering, corruption, propaganda, censorship, bigotry; is totally lost on so many people. Food-gate aside, all those other facets of what came out with Wikileaks are plain as day, as is this rebound, angry reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The blindness to it all is like a new religion, wrapped up in flowery "progressive" packaging as if that shit means anything when the actions are the opposite, and rather intelligent people just go along with it. Truly baffling, and to me it is pretty scary. Not the media, the masses who swallow it hook, line, and sinker.

       To controll the narrative, to keep people agianst something not for anything much less each other. A permanant siege mentality. Im not saying the world cant be scarry but I am saying we have to stop being scared. As individuals being just that, individuals is our best option. Being corraled into groups focusing on things so large and ominus we really have no hope  of affecting them. Being left with little than to speak to their narrative. Thats the MSM's/corporate/globalist agenda to seperate us from each other and ourselves. The fearful are easley controlled. 
 It may sound crazy but just being a single person speaking to the things going on in your own life and of those around you is far more powerful than parroting what we hear in the media. Outside of the media the things being discussed there have little base in reality in my own peronal life, thats what I know and what I can speak to.

       I don't have an opinion on pizzagate, but consider yourself before you were made aware of all that you know now.  People can't help that they've been born into a profound propaganda system.  Just things like election fraud are enormously difficult to accept.  Patience.  It's happening, just not as quickly as we'd like.

       Well, what's sad for you is that you didn't even read a not-even opposing point of view.  That is behavior exhibiting the exact behavior it is judging.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's ironic too because of what the actual post said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am curious when you eyewitnessed this pedophilia as that is the only way you can be certain.  And even eyewitnesses get things wrong all the time.  (This is a rhetorical question.  I'm not curious).
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, I didn't say it wasn't
       <em>
        possible.
       </em>
       I said I was reserving judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm done here, as it takes an enormous amount of patience to converse when someone openly admits to the exact behavior they are condemning.  Cheers.

       Right because that's verbatim what I said!!  Thanks for the excellent recap!
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh wait.  That's actually not what I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's pretend it is indeed what I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really am curious here.  I'm assuming you're a person who doesn't have any affinity for HRC and her people.  Me neither.
       <br/>
       But I wonder then, how do you expect to get anyone to listen to your message if you come across exactly HRC people do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, if something evil is happening, and the goal is to protect children, how are you accomplishing that goal by mocking and refusing to even listen to anyone who even slightly questions it?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Remember kids:  if you want to help the kids, Behave Exactly Like the Libs!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't that behavior just slam the door on any future ability to influence people who might have otherwise considered your evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       ...Resulting in more resistance to the truth, and more children being harmed...
       <em>
        going 100% counter to your goals...
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Just seems like a really foolish way to get anyone to consider the evidence you worked so hard to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... maybe have a second look at how you want to come across if you really want others to hear your points.  Because this sure isn't working.

       Accusing me of being ctr like then posts this: "Wouldn't that behavior just slam the door on any future ability to influence people who might have otherwise considered your evidence?

       I did not accuse you of being CTR, and I do not think you are, and that is yet another blatant misrepresentation of what I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said actual HRC supporters are closed to anyone else's points of view, so at worst, I accused you of behaving like actual HRC supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's pretend I did accuse you of being CTR. (I didn't, but it's a fun exercise).   How on earth would accusing someone of being a paid decoy delegitimize the argument that insulting and mocking others is a poor way to get your point heard, and therefore sabotaging your goal of helping victimized children?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that is why you simply copy/pasted my entire point, and then wrote-
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        okay...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The two are entirely mutually exclusive, and there's no point to be made.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm done here now too, too much patience required for these arguments that are little more than "I believe it's true so it's true and it's as clear as the nose on your face and if you don't think so you should probably go punch yourself in the neck because it's true."
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  and just because I have to put this in every post, just in case:  I'm not saying it didn't happen.  I'm saying I'm reserving judgement until further evidence is revealed.

       it is a new religion. It's founding mythos is the "burning of the 6 million". Everything starts from there. You can't do X because it's racist, therefore you support "another" 6 million. You can't have Y opinion, because that's nationalistic or patriotic, and therefore you support "another" 6 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything that goes against the narrative is "racist" or "bigoted" or "xenophobic" and that is justified as the worst thing in the world because of the 6 million. That is the core of it. If you are not with them, you are a monster.

       Hopefully this is the extent of their power. If that's the case I think us conspiracy theorists are winning the battle. My only fear is the longevity of the war. If we can keep morale high enough to keep bringing the intellectual fight to them then I honestly believe we can win this and force them to cover various stories that have been brought up recently. I don't think people understand what's at stake here. If someone finds something concrete enough to force law enforcements hand in this then how bad will the media look? They will have to backtrack from calling us all loonies to covering a story that was uncovered independently by the people. If MSM wanted to hold any sort of credibility someone would be investigating but sadly that isn't the case. Once we get something concrete then the average joe will habe to look at news more proactively to formulate their own views of the world. If that happens and justice is found it would be monumental.

       The same people who pushed the Patriot Act and the War in Iraq down our throats are still on the news.  They unquestioningly regurgitated White House policy as fact and sold the American people on an unnecessary, disastrous war.
      </p>
      <p>
       By all accounts they should be ashamed of how they pushed that war.  Their credibility should be called into question.  Instead they just moved forward like nothing happened.  I would have had a modicum of respect for any of them if they could have just admitted that they didn't ask enough questions or look critically at the sources.

       its even more disturbing to see the concerted message be translated to french by our local Canadian medias and relayed as-is, just warning people about dangerous fake news that will make you crazy and not addressing any of the evidances/arguments. Even in my most fevered tin-foil hats moment I had not imagined that a concerted message could be output with such synch between different countries.

       No one here claimed that Comet Ping Pong and Pizza was the global headquarters for anything, just part of a network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, there are plenty of "normal" people who molest children and download CP. There are entire criminal networks built to cater to these people. Why wouldn't a similar percentage of wealthy, famous, powerful people also share pedophilic predilections? Why wouldn't there be criminal organizations dedicated to serving this elite clientele?
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, we know that wealthy, famous, and powerful pedophiles exist, including Jeffery Epstein, Jimmy Saville, Jared Fogle, Dennis Hastert and more. Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby proved that victims who make public accusations are usually ignored, and often harassed. The Catholic church scandals proved that institutions could hide systematic child abuse for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why is it that every time people claim that networks of elite pedophiles exist, the accusers get called crazy? None of these claims are impossible, and many parts of the claims have been demonstrated elsewhere. While the existing evidence in favor of the conspiracy is not as strong as I would like, I don't see much evidence against it. Just people who call it crazy and make appeals to authority. If these accusations are false, then there should be real evidence to counter these claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, all the Podestas have to do to shut up the people accusing them of kidnapping Madeline McCanne is prove that they were not in Portugal on the night of the crime. All James Alefantis has to do is open his restaurant up for public inspection, top to bottom, including the basement. This should be easy. Why haven't they done it?

       I have no opinion on this subject at the present, but I find issue with your logic.  From what I understand, the narrative about that spot is largely based  around questionable language, some odd photos, and high profile connections. While I think people may be reading in to some more than is there, I don't know where I've seen a claim that it is the central culmination of a network. Well, not from any of the more serious work on it (i.e., not emotionally driven).
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, to state that a central entity could never be found out because it is too big seems far fetched and a bit disillusioned with what power structure really is. Hell, half is perception. Quite contradictory, another argument will be that such a network couldn't even exist in the first place because it would be too large and eventually found out in some form, most likely from an entity somewhat removed from central authority, if such a thing even exists. See we have contradictory arguments appealing to how and why deep secrets are false or impossible to know, so therefore not worthy of thought. Odd to think in the "age of information". Yes, disinformation makes this difficult, but not impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say that any secret is truth just waiting to be discovered, and no matter the level of power, it is ultimately people who make up the structure. People talk, people leave records, and people "mess up". All it takes is the right set of eyes or ears to spot a trend or become curious and start digging.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm not sold either way, I just don't buy into the logic of "too big to be caught", or the strawman of what the narrative has been.

       ODD? The art in question isn't a but strange, it's deliberately easy  for the educated and informed to tell exactly what kinds of Mystic symbolism's are embedded in the imagery and rituals. That is exactly what hiding in plain sight it's all about. It's not just all out. It's not that it's offensive. It's at the language embedded is clear and plain for all to see. It's not just a little kid with her arms tape to a ping pong table. It's art that is made by people that are clearly deeply, deeply disturbed.

       Or maybe the mind is great at suggestability and patterning? I'm not dismissing anything, but to perceive that quote as "irrefutable proof" seems far-fetched. Why does that have to be a secret message? I also never said anything about the art or any specific photo. As creepy as some are I'm not fully swayed that they represent all that is claimed, but I'm also not saying there isn't anything there worth looking at.

       I like to think that I try to objective. I understand that you were just using that as an example, and I am aware of some of the more eye-raising emails (e.g., underage pool entertainment). Yes I will, if that picture emerges from an objective and fair investigation. I do worry that such an investigation will never happen, however, making most apathetic people forget and move on.

       True all it takes is a mistake here and there. But i doubt the people here have the right set of eyes and ears.

      <p>
       It just stupid to ask for a public inspection of the restaurant, like what will that do?  IF this is all true, you think they would leave any evidence behind?

       And a fucking Pizza place? Man if i ever get rich and fancy some young girls i know where to go!

       Tbh, IF this is true the individual that went in was a counter-move. Think about it. I agree about the business first seeming ridiculous, but I could also see how such an establishment could be used as cover for movement of certain individuals that others might notice compared to a private residence. Again, I'm not saying it is true, but you can see the utility of setting something up in the last place anyone would look, or if someone would look you're covered by somewhat of a logical explanation for your presence, language of, and presence of others.

       You're like one of those people who thinks OJ was innocent.  Oh well, sure there's plenty of smoke, but not enough proof so obviously nothing bad could've happened and of course there's no possible chance very powerful people could cover it up.

       See, there's the assumption of guilt. There's literally nothing proving that Comet Pizza is a front for a state-sponsored pedophile ring. The "smoke" has repeatedly turned out to be out-of-context bullshit made to look worse than it is; there's literally no fucking reason to believe that there's a pedophile ring and the assumption that there is, in spite of the evidence, is very dangerous. It'd be like trying to get the glove to fit but the glove is a petite woman's glove, to compare it to your OJ Simpson thing.

       Look I DONT WANT THIS TO BE TRUE! I hope it is all bullshit, but when it is children's well being at risk, I think as an adult I owe it to these children to spend some time with the other well meaning adults to look into ANY allegations of sexual abuse! It happens WAY more than you or I know. How do I know this? Because I have had more people than I would have ever imagined tell me they were abused as a child as I became friends with them.

       If you actually look into the pizzagate information you will see that although it is very uneasy to read, it is not just 1 or even 2 small coincidences that point toward child molestation.  If you care enough you might spend some time and look into the info that has been dug up and will probably continue to be dug up for a while. THANK GOODNESS AND THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE ATLEAST TRYING TO

       It really, really isn't about the children. If it was about the children, they wouldn't have moved largely to Voat. It is, and has always been, about discrediting and demonizing Hillary Clinton and the liberals.

       For every "damning coincidence," there's ten things that disprove the entire thing. That interview? Probably means the basement of his house, not of the restaurant. I've seen

       Do you understand that the subreddit for Pizzagate was banned from reddit?  It was it's own scandal.  They removed the subreddit do to "doxxing" or basically posting people's personal information on reddit which is not allowed. BUT the whole thing seemed very very much like a set-up.  The people posting the information on the subreddit were new users and the admins kept banning the users from posting the information in their subreddit. BUT get this: someone with greater admin privileges (i.e. Reddit staff) kept unbanning the users who were breaking the rules.

       I dont like Hillary, I dont like Trump, I dont like liars.  I and most people from my experience are not here because of politics we are here because child abuse can not be tolerated and if you sexually abuse children I hope we can ALL COME TOGETHER and protect these little guys from these bad bad people.  And yes it all sounds very far fetched but did you ever think priests of a church would be involved in raping children?  I grew up Catholic and went to Catholic Schools.  It is proven FACT thousands of children have been raped by priests and the Catholic Church was trying to cover it up all along.  But if you said 30 years ago "guys I think I see a link between Catholic priests and child rape!"  people would be flipping the fuck out because that is unheard of. People would not want to hear what you are saying or allegating because this shit doesnt compute, why would anyone want to do that to a child, especially a Priest? Especially a Government official? I do not know exactly why, but it needs to be exposed, and I hope to GOD ALMIGHTY that this shit comes to light and this evil is cast out!  ALL CHILDREN NEED TO BE PROTECTED.

       You are crazy. The allegations of child abuse within the Church have been floating around for a
       <em>
        long
       </em>
       time. Your comparison is pretty terrible. There's literally no proof at all that Comet Pizza is a pedophile front. All "evidence" relies on increasingly absurd logical leaps. The assumption shouldn't be that he's automatically a pedophile, because then you start ignoring everything that points towards innocence to justify your crazy conspiracy theory.

       Voksul do you see the red person in the back of flyer?  It is much smaller than the other people's bodies.  It looks to me as it is portraying a child.  And the person hunched over the child looks to be in a position of someone who is having sex with the child on top of a white cloth.

       The real world isn't like National Treasure. Actual pedophile rings don't leave little clever hints to their existence, especially not ones that a bunch of self-professed internet detectives would be able to find. You're reading too much into things with the assumption that the pedophile ring exists and ignoring everything that proves that it doesn't.

       Can you please just stick to the picture at hand and tell me what you see happening in that picture? I am trying to work with you here. You and I TOGETHER. Taking a look at these items that I and many find peculiar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to know what you think of that picture. What you see happening it.

       You said above:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        All "evidence" relies on increasingly absurd logical leaps
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I am trying to show you where the leaps are being made and I wondering what in your mind is not helping you make it take these leaps itself.  I know this subject is terrible and I wish it would GO AWAY. But sadly it wont.  Because it is the terrible truth, children are being raped by adults.  I have had numerous friends tell me they were abused by parents, aunts, coaches, etc. I didnt ask them by the way, they just wanted to tell someone they thought might care or just feel a need to share their terrible story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways if you actually care about TRUTH, then please lets continue with what you see in that flyer for Comet Pizza.  I know it does look artsy, and it is.  But there is obviously something happening in the picture.  What do you see happening in the picture Voksul? Please lets do this together. It matters I think, if you are an adult, then you probably want ALL children to be safe and accounted for, and to have the time of their lives, and not be EVER abused by anyone.

       What do you see in the Back of the Comet Pizza Flyer Voksul? Please let me see it through Voksul's eyes, not Jasno's.

       Ok I guess you dont wanna share what you see in the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to play nice and ask what you saw, and tried to show you what many of us see happening in the Comet Pizza Flyer.  If you wanna play dumb or actually are dumb this is your free will at work.

       I hope the best for you. I wish you were choosing the side of Truth and the side of protecting children. Bye bye.

       Hi, I've been reading this thread. While I'm completely convinced that the entire pizzagate thing is bullshit, I will admit that the flyer you posted does look like what you say it looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm curious about is how you take an image like that, with potentially a hundred other explanations, and then extrapolate it to an international sex ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's as
       <a href="/u/voskul">
        /u/voskul
       </a>
       said--what group trying to cover their tracks from the public would leave tiny little hints in the media for our oh-so-dilligent conspiracy theorists to discover?

       Right, we should dig up the graves of dead kids and release them to public, because that's the only way I'm going to know this was real. I fucking hate this logic.

       Really, there's not a snowball's chance he could've gone on the air on CBS and said anything other than what he did. Well, he could've, but what price would he have paid for going against the "fake news" narrative.

       Dude I just posted an article about the woman arrested for sending death threats to a Sandy Hook parent because of...you guessed it. "Fake news". I literally cannot fucking believe there is anybody that still doesn't question MSM's pathetic attempts to manipulate viewers. I hate this so bad. Makes me sick to my stomach. Nothing surprises me anymore. Colbert is just another puppet on the payroll.

       Especially after the ENTIRE media completely mis-called the election, I don't know how anyone can trust the narratives and numbers they put out. They were JUST shown as liars on this super huge story we all followed for months, and then they expect to be able to tell us what news is fake and what isn't? They can get fucked

      <p>
       Gaslighting or gas-lighting is a form of psychological abuse in which a victim is manipulated into doubting their own memory, perception, and sanity. For example, someone tells you the sky is red when you know it's blue and they attempt to convince you that you're insane or interpreting it wrong. Or they insinuate that you're ugly or stupid and then deny they ever said that, with a sincere smile on their face, yet you still feel something really off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, abusers gaslight a person (in this case, the mass public) to maintain control by distorting or omitting the truth so the person starts doubting their own perceptions of what is really going on. This doubting of one's intuition or perception of objective truth often results in cognitive dissonance, denial, confusion, or in many cases depression and anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, gaslighting is a ticket to crazytown, and in this case especially it is being employed for nefarious purposes.

       When you think reality is like X, and then people come along to tell you that X has never existed, and it's actually Y. Despite the fact you're
       <em>
        pretty damn sure
       </em>
       it was X. But with enough repetition you begin to doubt you saw X and maybe it actually is Y. That's gaslighting. People telling you your reality is false and that you cannot trust your own senses or gut feelings, and that instead theirs are the obvious truth.

       Wow, watching that was surreal. I was usually amused by the Colbert Report, but I never watched his show once he took over whatever big late nite show he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit is straight out of V for Vendetta. It's disgusting blatant propaganda. He outright tells you what is "true" and what isn't, tells you how to think, what to believe, how to act about it. And all in a creepy right in your face propaganda way. I guess since it's a familiar show/person, people just overlook this aspect of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if he's right about his subject matter, it's terrifying that people have slid far enough down the slope to not see what this is.

       The article Colbert reference which Flynn tweeted wasn't related to "Pizzagate" as colbert claims.  It's about the Huma emails found on Weiner's computer when he got busted sexting with underage girls.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein’s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries.

       Along with rituals that force compliance through peer pressure   there is also trickery, enticement and threats to  get people to compromise themselves. Many organizations have rituals and those rituals are for this purpose. It's a rite of passage. you will not be considered for power until you are compromised. The sociopaths that pursue power positions have no problem with compliance. They'll do anything  to get that power. Some enjoy it immensely.

       No matter how much old money a family has it can be outweighed by those who create money.. They will never run out no matter how corrupt or inept. You may have the worlds biggest and most expensive army but those who create money without oversight and under no one nations laws can hire endless numbers of mercenaries and undermine that army.

       Wait...you were a fan of Colbert til now? I think you finally actually paid attention to him today, that or your bullshit detector has been on edge lately so you were able to pick up on that today. John Stewart, John Oliver, Colvert, Trevor Noah, etc. all garbage hiding under the guise of "comedians" and people eat it up cuz it confirms their bias.

       Except the argument against Pizzagate isn't "that's ridiculous, they're politicians, how can the even be possible?"
      </p>
      <p>
       The argument against Pizzagate is, "You have literally no evidence whatsoever." It's in the same category as creationists and Flat Earthers - people who believe in Pizzagate not for any logical reason, but because they feel like they're somehow emotionally obligated to.

       Remember all those catholic pedophile scandals? Powerful people take advantage of children in an organized way, and it's covered up by the organizations. If this can happen it the church, it can certainly happen in the government.

       There's more than enough circumstantial evidence to warrant an investigation, that much is unquestionable.

       Yes, but see, in the case of the Catholic pedophile scandals, there was actual evidence that Catholic priests had molested children. For example, children claiming that Catholic priests had molested them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of Pizzagate, the "evidence" is:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The fact that if you pretend the word "pizza" means "child pornography", then people who talk about how much they love pizza sound like they're secretly pedophiles.
       </li>
       <li>
        The fact that Comet Ping Pong, a family pizza restaurant, has taken photos of children goofing off.
       </li>
       <li>
        The fact that Comet Ping Pong's logo was shaped like a stylized slice of pizza, and that a heading on their menu was shaped like a pair of ping pong paddles, which supposedly match secret pedophile symbols or something.
       </li>
       <li>
        Amazingly, the fact that Comet Ping Pong
        <em>
         changed their logo after people told them it looked like a secret pedophile symbol
        </em>
        .
       </li>
       <li>
        Most recently, and even more amazingly, the fact that a lunatic conspiracy theorist walked into Comet Ping Pong with a gun is somehow evidence that the conspiracy theory is true.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Or, to put it another way, there is
       <em>
        no evidence
       </em>
       for Pizzagate. It is a laughable and ridiculous idea that was cooked up by partisan hacks to justify a fascist takeover of the United States.

       You're actually talking about "Besta Pizza," which is across the street from Comet Ping-Pong, which is built above the same inaccessible underground tunnels as Comet and also implicated in this whole scheme. Interestingly, "Besta" translates to "Beast" in Portuguese.

       Then not to mention the absolutely HUGE media backlash at this story, and the rise of the "fake news" narrative in the MSM exactly in lockstep with when the pizzagate stuff comes out. It's very suspicious

       Have you considered the possibility that the reason there's a huge media backlash at this "story" is because it's completely ridiculous, and that the reason the mainstream media is in lockstep on the idea of fake news is because there was a real fake news problem, of which Pizzagate was an example?

       Microsoft, Youtube (Google), Twitter &amp; Facebook just announced cooperation to create signatures for every bit of news and censor them based on those hashes and what they like or don't like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at how the German New Years mass sexual assaults for 2016 unfolded with each of these entities attempting to censor the news on their own and failing, making their unorganized efforts that demonstrated the commonality of their efforts obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the same for the Orlando night club shooting here on Reddit were admins/mods were attempting, site wide, to follow in the steps of the German New Years story suppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now these companies are going to have a common database and you can bet your ass that other companies, like Reddit, are going to plug into those API's and censorship will be automated.

       Agree! It made me so mad that for so many young adults that this was their actual source of news. Both are actors! They are playing characters and reading off jokes and talking points. I saw a brilliant article written by a phycologist a while back on r\conspiracy that detailed the psychological mind control that was being used by these types of shows to brain wash people into a certain way of thinking.

       I KNOW. I informed my mom about pgate about a week ago, and yesterday she was like 'you know that all that pedo stuff was just a mock up from one of trumps cabinet members tweeting lies and he got fired' 
I was like WAT DUH SHIITE? She started saying fake news this and fake news that. No matter how I refute it, she's pretty set with what the news has told her about it.

       Leftists are in a full on panic.  They've been so far inside their own bubbles for so long that they never thought for a moment the election would go the way it did.  The snap-back to reality, post November 8th, has been very painful for them and they're lashing out like cornered animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       This transcends [redacted]-gate.  Watch the staged protests, faked assaults/vandalism and endless futile recounts.  Watch the leftist hair-on-fire ranting-cum-virtue signalling on social media.  Watch the way they call every single Trump cabinet appointee and every emerging policy - real or imagined - sexist, racist, bigoted and dangerous.  Everything Trump has put forward would have been called moderate or centrist twenty years ago, full stop, but they've moved the Overton window so far left that they feel justified in calling everyone who doesn't agree with them "literally Hitler."

       I call the HRC types leftists because they've strayed so far from classical liberalism as to be absurd.  In the simplest terms, liberals have a live-and-let-live mindset.  Leftists are thought-policing, narrative pushing authoritarians.

       I appreciate your reasonable response.  I do take issue with you characterizing the left as authoritarian, but I understand the confusion.  The "left" as it's commonly conceived in the U.S. is really just the supporters of the Democratic party, which is certainly an authoritarian organization.  But I would consider Democrats to be center-right in most political configurations.  I agree with you that they are far removed from the classic idea of Liberalism, but in the US the term liberal almost always means a supporter of the Democratic party or it's platform.

       I couldn't agree more. I have been tweeting to Colbert every once in awhile and just tweeted him the other day I'm saying that I am putting his show for a while. He has gotten way, way too negative, political, and frankly, since the election, his show just flat-out is not funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       And comma just between us, I couldn't sit there and watch him and Biden, mr. Pizza himself, joking around with Colbert the other day. No way. Not after what I've seen with pizza gate.

       I couldn't agree more. I just about idolized him on the report. But this election cycle has really changed my entire perspective. The way he but Bernie on the back burner, then charged full steam ahead for Hillary  really made the show hard to watch. I've seen every episode since he took over but after this election, and especially this segment, it shows that he's no better than any MSM talking head.

       I loved the colbert report but I never expected anything other than usual left/liberal/Democrat viewpoints out of him. I'm not surprised that he's toting the fake news line. Anyone on TV pretty much will, alternate viewpoints aren't going to get a voice on TV. Personally I think it's an example of "forgive them for they know not what they do". I think colbert and others would be outraged if they really looked at the (circumstantial) evidence but they're too ingrained in the official story to see anything but the official line.

       You guys do realize you're only helping the establishment with these idiotic remarks and allegations, right? You're spewing out so much bullshit that when a real issue arises that isn't being covered by mainstream media they'll either lump it in with " crazy conspiracy theorist BS" or just flat out ignore it. Then when you have an actual argument no one will listen to you or take you seriously.
