<p>all y&#39;all should address ppl who write long detailed narratives like this (which take either position, really) and hammer the fuck out of it to determine its veracity.  really give it the business.   because this is a fair amount of work.  someone put time into it.  just because it filters out on the shame-y and fingerpoint-y aspects (2 great smells of bad arguments) isn&#39;t any reason not to really look into all of the claims.  we can all really solve this thing with more eyeballs, eh.  delicious cheesy eyeballs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d call this thorough. From the amount of time you&#39;ve put into &quot;debunking,&quot; you seem dug in to your position, so I won&#39;t waste the time to address each point but will at least comment on the Silsby-Gayler connection.</p>

<p>I&#39;m having trouble following parts of that paragraph, but I&#39;ll just do my best. I don&#39;t see the source you&#39;re referencing for information on her. A simple wikipedia search shows you that Laura Silsby is indeed Laura Silsby-Gayler. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case</a> 
I think you were claiming she isn&#39;t, but, again, hard to follow your thoughts sometimes and there&#39;s no source provided for context. I can&#39;t say how much pull a VP of Marketing has over policy, etc., but it is at least a little disconcerting that her new gig is at AlertSense, in the way that it would be alarming (pardon the pun) if a convicted heroine smuggler was freed by a powerful friend and then joined up with DEA. </p>

<p>Oh yeah. The reason it&#39;s somewhat disconcerting is because AlertSense is very much responsible for broadcasting Amber Alert. Do a little digging and you&#39;ll find plenty. Here&#39;s a sample: <a href="http://azbroadcasters.org/wp-content/uploads/AZAMBER_History.pdf">http://azbroadcasters.org/wp-content/uploads/AZAMBER_History.pdf</a> </p>

<p>If that isn&#39;t enough, here&#39;s AlertSense&#39;s webpage detailing their IPAWS alert system <a href="https://www.alertsense.com/solutions/alertsense-ipaws/">https://www.alertsense.com/solutions/alertsense-ipaws/</a> which is used by FEMA to issue national alerts <a href="https://www.fema.gov/integrated-public-alert-warning-system">https://www.fema.gov/integrated-public-alert-warning-system</a> And, of course, FEMA is responsible for issuing national Amber Alerts <a href="https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/93950">https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/93950</a> </p>

<p>I hope your post didn&#39;t take too long to compile. Finding these links took five minutes.</p>

<p>SPEZ/EDIT: Upon rereading, am I mistaken or is your entire point about Silsby-Gayler that you missed the fact that people sometimes acquire a hyphenated name upon remarriage?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just a hobby :)</p>

<p>I was referring to the Pizza Guide I had found which didn&#39;t link AlertSense . I am aware Silsby is a VP at AlertSense. I am also aware that their platform carries AmberAlerts but isn&#39;t responsible for issuing them.</p>

<p>If what you&#39;re insinuating is true, the VP of Marketing would have to hide AmberAlerts, that weren&#39;t issued by the company she works for, to hide abductions that her associates commit.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t seem a bit... Convoluted to you?</p>

I said in my above comment that I didn&#39;t see the connection between VP of Marketing and the claims made. But to say it isn&#39;t the same person, or to say the company isn&#39;t responsible for Amber Alerts is wrong.</p>

<p>Lmao what do you need... CNN to cover it? Honestly, what would you consider evidence?</p>

<p>Do you understand what a &quot;cover-up&quot; is... It&#39;s when something is at first &quot;uncovered&quot;, and then becomes &quot;covered-up&quot;, like the Finders case.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an idea: <strong>actually read the report</strong> instead of just arguing about it.</p>

<p>It contains <strong>pages and pages of newspaper reports about this case</strong> and other corroborated info you&#39;re claiming doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>The &quot;Dan Brown novel&quot; you&#39;re describing has more information linked in it than evidently you&#39;re going to process in your lifetime. Might as well discredit it for its font, amirite?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I notice you don&#39;t mention the wikileaks released emails at all.  Some of them are easy to dismiss, but others are odd.  There&#39;s an email where somebody from a Stratfor security company mentions that Obama spent 65k dollars to fly in hotdogs and pizza and refers to waitresses in odd scare quotes, as if to suggest they are more than waitresses.  That email, if I take it as legitimate, strongly suggests to me that Obama flew in a bunch of sex workers to entertain elites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This one IS weird. But then again, it is from Stratfor. You don&#39;t think maybe the White House comment could be sarcastic? It&#39;s clear they&#39;re being tongue in cheek and joking around. It&#39;s a bit of a stretch to assume the 65k is an actual figure or that there is an accusation towards Obama to glean from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.complex.com/life/2016/07/obama-t-shirt-shop-in-hawaii">Source</a> Among the many interesting/weird anecdotes about the president&#39;s post-dinner life is one that came from former White House Chief of Staff and current Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, who remembered that time he and the president imagined running a t-shirt stand in Hawaii. The idea was that the shirt store would only sell size medium shirts in the color white, because their dream was that &quot;they would no longer have to make decisions.&quot;</p>

<p>During difficult White House meetings when no good decision seemed possible, Mr. Emanuel would sometimes turn to Mr. Obama and say, &quot;White.&quot; Mr. Obama would in turn say, &quot;Medium.&quot;</p>

<p>Confused hot dog with t-shirt?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t think they could have been a part of the t-shirt anecdote or made their own version? Does my explanation sound more reasonable, considering they mention Hawaii and a &quot;stand&quot;, than thinking they&#39;re speaking in euphemism?</p>

Unless you&#39;re postulating that Obama and Emanuel shared their inside joke with Podesta and/or Stern and then they loved it so much they started using it too.

    <div class="md"><p>If I were to respond as a pizzagater, I&#39;d ask whether you own a handkerchief with a pizza-related map on it. Or if you&#39;ve ever planned to have pizza for an hour.
