       all y'all should address ppl who write long detailed narratives like this (which take either position, really) and hammer the fuck out of it to determine its veracity.  really give it the business.   because this is a fair amount of work.  someone put time into it.  just because it filters out on the shame-y and fingerpoint-y aspects (2 great smells of bad arguments) isn't any reason not to really look into all of the claims.  we can all really solve this thing with more eyeballs, eh.  delicious cheesy eyeballs.

       I'm not sure I'd call this thorough. From the amount of time you've put into "debunking," you seem dug in to your position, so I won't waste the time to address each point but will at least comment on the Silsby-Gayler connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm having trouble following parts of that paragraph, but I'll just do my best. I don't see the source you're referencing for information on her. A simple wikipedia search shows you that Laura Silsby is indeed Laura Silsby-Gayler.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case
       </a>
       I think you were claiming she isn't, but, again, hard to follow your thoughts sometimes and there's no source provided for context. I can't say how much pull a VP of Marketing has over policy, etc., but it is at least a little disconcerting that her new gig is at AlertSense, in the way that it would be alarming (pardon the pun) if a convicted heroine smuggler was freed by a powerful friend and then joined up with DEA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah. The reason it's somewhat disconcerting is because AlertSense is very much responsible for broadcasting Amber Alert. Do a little digging and you'll find plenty. Here's a sample:
       <a href="http://azbroadcasters.org/wp-content/uploads/AZAMBER_History.pdf">
        http://azbroadcasters.org/wp-content/uploads/AZAMBER_History.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If that isn't enough, here's AlertSense's webpage detailing their IPAWS alert system
       <a href="https://www.alertsense.com/solutions/alertsense-ipaws/">
        https://www.alertsense.com/solutions/alertsense-ipaws/
       </a>
       which is used by FEMA to issue national alerts
       <a href="https://www.fema.gov/integrated-public-alert-warning-system">
        https://www.fema.gov/integrated-public-alert-warning-system
       </a>
       And, of course, FEMA is responsible for issuing national Amber Alerts
       <a href="https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/93950">
        https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/93950
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope your post didn't take too long to compile. Finding these links took five minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       SPEZ/EDIT: Upon rereading, am I mistaken or is your entire point about Silsby-Gayler that you missed the fact that people sometimes acquire a hyphenated name upon remarriage?

       Not really sure why the place of incorporation matters here. Are you implying companies can't do business across state lines? AlertSense operates nationally through FEMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check the FAQ section of the DOJ link: "The Wireless Emergency Alert program is operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It distributes notifications from authorized federal, state, local and tribal government agencies that alert customers with capable devices of imminent threats to safety or an emergency situation."

       WEA is also part of IPAWS (see my above link).

       Yes and see that they are two separate entities which you claim they are not. One is a federal alert system run by the Department of Justice, headed by Loretta Lynch and Sally Yates.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other is a software company based out of Idaho. Your link states they developed a "secondary Web technology...developed to assist with text and email notices for broader coverage." Of this company, Laura Gayler is VP of Marketing.

       It's just a hobby :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I was referring to the Pizza Guide I had found which didn't link AlertSense . I am aware Silsby is a VP at AlertSense. I am also aware that their platform carries AmberAlerts but isn't responsible for issuing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what you're insinuating is true, the VP of Marketing would have to hide AmberAlerts, that weren't issued by the company she works for, to hide abductions that her associates commit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't seem a bit... Convoluted to you?

       It is responsible for issuing them. Check the links.
I said in my above comment that I didn't see the connection between VP of Marketing and the claims made. But to say it isn't the same person, or to say the company isn't responsible for Amber Alerts is wrong.

       I don't see how that's credible. The mass abuse described in the report isn't corroborated by anyone. In fact, the only information I can find on it is from Educate-Yourself and Ted-Gunderson.info -- And an archive link with swaths of emails from Gunderson that read like an outlandish Dan Brown novel. I understand we're on r/conspiracy, but conspiracies aren't factual until they're uncovered. I won't use one conspiracy as evidence of another conspiracy.

       Lmao what do you need... CNN to cover it? Honestly, what would you consider evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand what a "cover-up" is... It's when something is at first "uncovered", and then becomes "covered-up", like the Finders case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an idea:
       <strong>
        actually read the report
       </strong>
       instead of just arguing about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It contains
       <strong>
        pages and pages of newspaper reports about this case
       </strong>
       and other corroborated info you're claiming doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Dan Brown novel" you're describing has more information linked in it than evidently you're going to process in your lifetime. Might as well discredit it for its font, amirite?

       I notice you don't mention the wikileaks released emails at all.  Some of them are easy to dismiss, but others are odd.  There's an email where somebody from a Stratfor security company mentions that Obama spent 65k dollars to fly in hotdogs and pizza and refers to waitresses in odd scare quotes, as if to suggest they are more than waitresses.  That email, if I take it as legitimate, strongly suggests to me that Obama flew in a bunch of sex workers to entertain elites.

       This one IS weird. But then again, it is from Stratfor. You don't think maybe the White House comment could be sarcastic? It's clear they're being tongue in cheek and joking around. It's a bit of a stretch to assume the 65k is an actual figure or that there is an accusation towards Obama to glean from it.

       Among the many interesting/weird anecdotes about the president's post-dinner life is one that came from former White House Chief of Staff and current Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, who remembered that time he and the president imagined running a t-shirt stand in Hawaii. The idea was that the shirt store would only sell size medium shirts in the color white, because their dream was that "they would no longer have to make decisions."
      </p>
      <p>
       During difficult White House meetings when no good decision seemed possible, Mr. Emanuel would sometimes turn to Mr. Obama and say, "White." Mr. Obama would in turn say, "Medium."

       You don't think they could have been a part of the t-shirt anecdote or made their own version? Does my explanation sound more reasonable, considering they mention Hawaii and a "stand", than thinking they're speaking in euphemism?

       Does it sound more reasonable? Frankly, no. Unless you're postulating that Obama and Emanuel shared their inside joke with Podesta and/or Stern and then they loved it so much they started using it too. If you could prove that "a stand in Hawaii" is a saying/meme, your guess would be more credible.

       It isn't viewed by itself by pizzagaters. It's instead viewed in the context of many other emails with seemingly cryptic references to food, particularly pizza and, to a lesser degree, hotdogs.

       How many mention pizza and/or hotdogs? Out of how many emails? White House staff work 60-80 hour work weeks and most aren't paid very well. I mean, I only work 55 and I eat pizza at least once a week. In fact, I bet if you had all my text logs pizza would be mentioned dozens of times in the last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       If my text logs were leaked, do you think I'd be considered a murderous pedophile? I say some weird shit to my friends, man.

       If I were to respond as a pizzagater, I'd ask whether you own a handkerchief with a pizza-related map on it. Or if you've ever planned to have pizza for an hour. Or why you'd email an attachment of two human trafficking researchers and one's daughter eating pizza with the message "Nice." I'd also ask why some of the most powerful people in the world, one of which (Podesta, who is paid very, very, very well) is a self-proclaimed foodie, email each other about pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't accuse you of anything. But I'd ask what you meant and hope you'd answer before two months had passed.

       You seem like a pretty good person. Deleted the topic. Work in progress. Gonna read up on Ted Gunderson because some asshole asked me to, hopefully find better arguments for what you've brought up, and pray I'm not kidnapped by the CIA.

       Thanks. And thanks for a civil conversation.

       Gunderson's an interesting read. Maybe you'll find some answers. Maybe you'll find more questions. Keep an open but critical mind, and good luck.
