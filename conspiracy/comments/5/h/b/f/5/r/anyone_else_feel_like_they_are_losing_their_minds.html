        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anyone else consider themselves an otherwise normal, healthy, logical human being....and yet you went down that pizzagate rabbit hole and now feel like you are living in bizarro world where EVERYONE is in on it?</p>

<p>Every single media source using the same talking point of &quot;fake news&quot;.  Seemingly every mainstream &quot;journalist&quot;, from the NYT, WaPo, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, using the same language ( &quot;debunked&quot; &quot;baseless&quot; etc) without even attempting to address the evidence.  The Pope telling people if they believe it that they eat shit.  Late night liberal comedians like Colbert and Samantha Bee doing segments on it in a mocking, dismissing manner.  Milo and Alex Jones, two people who make their living peddling controversy, seemingly refusing to touch this one in any substantial way.  </p>

<p>Even when I look at the comment sections from any of the mainstream &quot;news&quot; articles about pizzagate, surely there will be people laying out the evidence or at least approaching the situation with a skeptical mind....after all, the internet where pizzagate was born.  BUT NOPE, it seems to be ALL shills parroting the mainstream media talking points, calling people who are simply asking questions names like &quot;lunatics&quot; and &quot;nutjobs&quot;.</p>

<p>Even celebrities (and athletes for that matter) are uncomfortably silent on this one.  I&#39;ve always felt like you could count on at least ONE celebrity who wants to use their stardom, or perhaps regain a former spotlight, by sending out a series of antagonistic twitter posts.  Especially since many celebrities have to at least be AWARE of these rings if you are to believe Corey Feldman&#39;s accusation that &quot;pedofila&quot; is the biggest problem in Hollywood.  But nope. (some NBA player I think tweeted about it and was roundly mocked).</p>

<p>So then you talk to your friend about it, because SOMEONE has to believe you.  And even THEY think you are insane.  And you lay out the evidence, you show them the suspect instagram posts, and the podesta emails, and the weirdness surrounding the Comet Ping Pong, and the Clinton Foundation.... and they STILL dismiss it as crazy (WITHOUT REFUTING THE EVIDENCE!!).  That&#39;s when it hits you.  AM I CRAZY!?</p>

<p>But if it IS this deep, which the rational side of me has to believe is impossible, how are people controlled?  MKUltra on a mass scale?  Is everyone brainwashed?  Is everyone in on it?  </p>

<p>Are people too scared to blow the lid off this thing?  How can they possibly prevent someone from gaining actual evidence of this supposed &quot;ring&quot;, especially in the day of wikileaks and anonymous and practically everyone walking around with a potential spy camera in their pockets.  Not ONE person &quot;in the know&quot;, who is sickened by this shit, was unable to leak concrete proof?</p>

<p>....and this is where I start to think that all of this isn&#39;t true, it can&#39;t be true, it would be nearly impossible... and my reality finally starts to settle back down.  But it won&#39;t be long until the next piece of evidence drops and I&#39;m right back into digging.</p>

<p>Anyone else feel this sort of mind fuckery?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The aggressive defense you&#39;re seeing is not a sign that you&#39;re misguided. Actually the opposite - it&#39;s a sign of high stakes.</p>

<p>Sounds like your eyes are open for the first time to something that&#39;s been going on around you for a long time. This kind of orchestrated attack is nothing new. But this time it does seem more aggressive and desperate.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let it get to you. With time you will begin to recognize patterns, talking points, attack tactics... You are not crazy, you just may not have expected it.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll figure it out - you&#39;ll get to know quite well that our system is not designed to promote truth. In fact, it is the truth that&#39;s often made to seem craziest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve been programmed to think the situation we are currently in could never be real. These people really aren&#39;t all that careful, they are just really good at covering things up when it does get out. And they always relied on the fact that no one ever has the whole picture. The Internet is beginning to change that, we are putting the pieces together.</p>

<p>They publish all their plans in books anyone can buy and read. Few but their compatriots ever do. Books from over a century ago read like a road map to what has happened to the world in recent years. 1984 was a warning few headed. It was undoubtedly based on the older works published by these people.</p>

<p>Never let anyone tell you that you are crazy again. You WILL be vindicated. 2017 will be the year the man behind the curtain is revealed. Either through our actions or Trumps, or through the actions of these monsters as they try to put the genie back in the bottle. Your friends and family will need you to guide them when the time comes, so steel your heart and mind. Be strong, be prepared. Get a gun, learn to use it. Stockpile food and resources. You will need them soon enough. Likely within the next few months, and there may not be anyone but yourself to protect what you have.</p>

<p>The global push to ban &quot;fake news&quot; is the first overt move they&#39;ve made. Did you know China used the same term when it took control of its own media? China was a test bed, a successful one.</p>

<p>Never for a second forget that we are soldiers in a shadow war spanning the globe. At stake is the lives of everyone you care about, your freedom and future. I do not say this lightly or in jest. I have never been more serious in my life. Many people are going to die, if we don&#39;t want it to be us we need to be vigilant and prepared. Someday soon they will come for us, with guns and armies. And it isn&#39;t going to happen a 100 years from now, or 50 years from now. No, the rumors indicate that the final moves were to be taken sometime this decade.</p>

<p>There is hope though. I do not believe their organization is as in control as we might fear. The cracks and limits of their power are beginning to show. They can only do so much from the shadows, a push here, and nudge there. When they step into the light...then we shall see the full extent of their power. It is undoubtedly great, but we will, we must, rise up against it. These are the same type of people who perpetrated the Holocaust. What they plan for our future is orders of magnitude worse.</p>

<p>We will only get one chance. If they win... they win forever and mankind will never reach its full potential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are major think tanks already making sophisticated military planning for the next decade in anticipation of a large-scale resistance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/Future_of_the_Army_web_0921.pdf">Here</a> is one example. Some things that stand out to me are its discission of how &quot;the Army should designate units to specialize in urban operations and improve training for large-scale urban combat&quot; and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Army has not had to plan for mass mobilization since the end of the Cold War, but the growing threats in today’s world mean that it must once again build a mobilization plan to rapidly grow the size of the Army to meet a national crisis of existential danger. The plan
needs to address how to bring large numbers of new recruits into a growing force; energize the defense industrial base; track and improve the readiness levels of surplus materiel; and revitalize mothballed pieces of equipment and return them to service. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should all be examining insider and whistleblower testimonies regarding the covert above top secret space programs that are decades and beyond ahead of the rest of the world in advanced technology.  These breakaway groups include German secret societies, different branches of the US military as well as the military/industrial corporate complex.  The extent of the information that has been sequestered from the rest of mankind and used against us by the dark control system will be its undoing when the lid is blown off and full disclosure occurs.

    <div class="md"><p>You honor me. I&#39;m just a humble aggregator of information gathered by more talented investigators.</p>

<p>But you are correct. The world we give our children will be determined by our actions over the next few months. Assuming any of us survive. I have hope though. There are groups acting in the shadows in our favor as well. We must be prepared to support these people if they call us to step up. Get a gun. A rifle or semi-auto, plenty of ammo and some food. There is a chance, a small one admittedly but not an ignorable one, that we will end up fighting an existental ground war on American soil.</p>

<p>Even if that doesn&#39;t happen, there will almost certainly be massive civil unrest and chaos for a couple weeks. World views will be shattered, people will be angry. Many may think the end times will be upon us. They might not be wrong. We must all be prepared to protect our families.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this sounds scary similar to the Age of Aquarius and also something interesting I read about Pluto being in Capricorn (astrology stuff sorry but it&#39;s still interesting)</p>

<p>&quot;Right now, we are all experiencing Pluto in Capricorn (from 2008 through 2023) which means that we will see many things collapse, such as money, religion and government</p>

<p>but these changes will present an opportunity for everything to be rebuilt in humanity’s best interests.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pluto is known as the “Destroyer” and will relentlessly throw challenges into your face until you learn why specific things seem to continuously happen to you (and all of us). Right on schedule in 2008, when Pluto entered Capricorn, we saw a massive banking collapse. Since 2008, we have seen the Roman Catholic Church get exposed to numerous pedophilia ands trafficking allegations. </p>

<p>World governments have become overly tyrannical and in many countries around the world, there are revolutions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The last time Pluto was in Capricorn was during the American and French Revolutions, so it’s not at all surprising that revolutions are happening right now.&quot;</p>

PROTIP: Stop citing 1984 as if you&#39;re making a profound point or insight, every 14 year old read 1984 in school and wrote an essay on government surveillance. Also, 1984s main warning wasn&#39;t about surveillance anyways, people often forget this. </p>

<p>One of the big reasons I finally stopped watching TV years ago was pedophilia. Once you&#39;re aware of its scope, it&#39;s impossible to ignore that it&#39;s rubbed in our faces constantly. I was disgusted away from watching television and I couldn&#39;t regret it less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in the mental health sector, and I deal with a lot of pathological liars. What you say in your opening statement I fully agree with, from experience, small lies do not have the defence of the serious ones.
Even if i&#39;ve witnessed a person do something they deny, I&#39;ve been threatened, accused myself of doing the things I&#39;ve witnessed them doing.</p>

<p>Edit to add an example:</p>

<p>I witnessed an individual set fire to towels in a bathroom because they were upset, I saw them leave the room and the subsequent fire breaking out. The police were involved due to the severity of putting lives at risk and I myself was blamed by this individual for lighting the fire, and it was aggressive defence to which even to this day they will deny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read a lot about mind control. This will help you understand why people act the way they do. Think about it, &quot;culture&quot; is a controlled system in a contained space and television &quot;programs&quot; are called that because they are designed to program.</p>

<p>People are locked into mind control and don&#39;t know it. Those who do understand are too scared or unprepared to deal with this.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you a secret: Almost every family has a pedophile and/or victim of pedophilia somewhere in their midst. Facing this crisis means that they must revisit their own abuse or take action against the predator in their lives.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easier to do what they&#39;ve always done, and inertia is hard to break! Don&#39;t lose focus and don&#39;t overdo your research. Take some time for other altruistic activities, such as working with seniors or animals, etc.</p>

I remember him disappearing for a while saying the NSA was threatening him or something, and then later on hearing about him saying he was the resurrection of an alien from Venus or something? I don&#39;t remember the details but it was all quite odd. Don&#39;t know if he actually went nuts or someone actively trying to discredit his info. He&#39;s one of those dudes that makes ties to things that aren&#39;t related at all, but there&#39;s some great nuggets of truth within the conspiro soup he used to serve. </p>

It&#39;s like living in a culture of gaslighting. You could go mad trying to sort it all out. But we&#39;re not all hypervigilent about protecting this generation for no reason. </p>

<p>I think our whole culture is in a state of denial because we&#39;re so newly free from legal and cultural institutions that made humans actual slaves and/or subjugated to their own family members. We want to pretend it&#39;s all ancient history. Who wants the complicated, painful truth when you have a pretty hallmark version to sell?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I keep coming back to is this: the wording of the emails around food indicates they are not talking about food.</p>

<p>Maybe it is drugs or something else, but definitely worth investigating.</p>

<p>Then I look at the surrounding context of clues as to what might be indicated: drugs, prostitution, etc. A lot of indicators do indeed point to CP.</p>

<p>Personally I have prior knowledge of both pedohpile rings and satanic cults existing. So this part may be new to a lot of people. However these things exist.</p>

<p>Child trafficking and pedo is a big business. Really big. Following the money leads leads me to feel less crazy about this whole thing. </p>

<p>Bringing the art collection angle makes perfect sense, what better way to transfer money for illegal services than art and charity donation?</p>

<p>You are not crazy. This is such a tangled web there are a lot resources into the media to silence this. </p>

<p>Even without pizzagate, just take a look at the cases of satanic child abuse, of the money in human trafficking, of the missing children statistics. NO ONE has EVER wanted to discuss this, pizza or not. But it absolutely exists on a horrifying scale. And that doesn&#39;t need to include Podesta or spiritcooking.</p>

<p>What gets to me is that no news source is really talking about what already exists, the truth that CP and human trafficking exists on the scale that it does. That there are clubs and forums of pedos trying to normalize child abuse. They are too busy getting the heat off Podesta and his friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, I was arguing about this in the thread about Colbert taking on PizzaGate. I was saying that you can dismiss PizzaGate all together and you can still find that there&#39;s pedophilia in politics and Hollywood. You don&#39;t have to agree with how the &quot;evidence&quot; came about or like the people who found it but we can all agree that pedophilia in politics and Hollywood is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. Even then the person was like &quot;we&#39;re talking about PizzaGate, that has to do with the Clintons. You&#39;re talking about a completely separate issue that happens every day.&quot; </p>

<p>WHAT THE FUCK?! Granted I&#39;m paraphrasing but still I even said that I&#39;d argue that this revolves around the Podestas more than the Clintons. The dude just laughed it off...   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to look at the evidence presented from an unbiased angle but like you, I have been studying cult ritual abuse for a while now and I do have to remember that this conspiracy theory does appeal to my bias on the subject. </p>

<p>But even actively practicing an objective mind set, it is impossible to take emotion out of the equation completely. We are only human and I think emotion plays a more important role in critical thinking than we give it credit. A purely logical perspective is not possible for the empathetic human and in my honest opinion is a sociopathic approach to digesting information.</p>

<p>I try to appeal to an individual&#39;s empathy when dealing with such a subject as this. Whether or not they believe this specific theory of pedophilia on a mass scale, it is hard to deny the systemic problem of pedophilia just by looking at recent cases like Jimmy Saville and the 5,200 employees at the pentagon that got caught with pizza all over their computers. Hell, it&#39;s basically accepted common knowledge among everyone that the Catholic church is actively harboring pedos and we don&#39;t do anything about it. You can&#39;t argue against that reality and that is the only way to approach people about this conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t just about one case, it&#39;s about a history of perversion that goes back to the most ancient forms of government. Appeal to people with what we know beyond a shadow of a doubt to be true and only then can they begin to turn the wheels in motion that maybe this conspiracy theory is not so crazy. It&#39;s about conversation, not conversion. You want dissenting opinions and radical ideas in society. People shouldn&#39;t fear talking to their friend about what they believe in and you shouldn&#39;t fear others having a different opinion than yourself. This is the beauty of conversation and we&#39;re losing it and they want that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope to whatever god there is that this never &quot;dies out,&quot; at least until a very thorough investigation is conducted and the evidence is provided to the masses via a reliable source (something other than mainstream or even alternative media - what? I don&#39;t know) so that we can make informed decisions about the sickos that are involved in the despicable practice of harming children. &quot;Ignoring it,&quot; you know, the alleged child trafficking ring in D.C. that possibly spans across the globe probably isn&#39;t in anyone&#39;s best interest (especially the children&#39;s). Also, Alefantis&#39;s crowd funding is ridiculous. Some pedophile-POS-by day and creep-by-night, who is so highly regarded in D.C. for some fucking reason couldn&#39;t need crowd funding to help him cope with &quot;emotional distress,&quot; followed by &quot;bullying&quot; and &quot;menacing conversations.&quot; To top it all off a &quot;gunman&quot; (i.e. an actor from NC I believe), for some reason deciding to take justice into his own hands and go on some kind of vigilante rescue meeting. He was &quot;arrested&quot; for his half-ass rampage attempt, for coming &quot;to &#39;investigate&#39; fake news stories that Washington insiders were harboring.&quot; </p>

<p>And what kind of idiot wouldn&#39;t at least make some kind of statement or attempt to deny charges related to child human trafficking? Oh, that fucking idiot Podesta-the-molesta. Ending rant now. Sorry, not sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An investigation into this is never going to happen and maybe Podesta will never see justice in this life but  I have a feeling that there will be something else revealed soon enough that exposes these pedophile rings.   It would have to be a recording of some kind that is released and circulated through social media.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll never die out though. The pattern of these things is that people come to the truth in waves.   There have been people warning us that the government is involved in these things for decades.  For me, this is the first time I really heard and understood what that meant.  There will be other incidents that wake other people up too.  They are never putting the lid back on this pot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is one fatal flaw in this theory:</p>

<p><strong>There is not a single piece of evidence that a child molestation crime has been committed by the accused.</strong></p>

<p>Look at every single other &quot;sex ring&quot; conspiracy that turned out to be true. The difference between those, and this one, is that they include people (victims/families/witnesses) going to the police/authorities/somebody with allegations of their crimes. Pizzagate lacks a single person, witness, picture, etc that can actually corroborate this theory.</p>

<p>I have spent some time looking through all the &quot;evidence&quot; presented to me by proponents of this theory, and none of it links the Podesta brothers, or James Alefantis, to any <em>actual</em> crime.</p>

<p>When I say, &quot;actual crime&quot;, I mean there is no victim, or photos, or video of them committing any such crime. There is no confession. There are no paper trails. There are no witnesses. There is no blood, or bodies, or <em>anything</em> that links them to an actual, real-life crime (if anyone has such evidence, please present it). Nothing but innuendo (and sometimes complete fabrication) on behalf &quot;pizzagate&quot; proponents. The only victims that exists are in the imaginations of the people who believe this theory.</p>

<p>You cannot ask for further &quot;investigation&quot; unless you&#39;re willing to believe that anyone can be investigated for sexual assault with only the accusations of strangers and no proof. Not even a victim.</p>

I agree that people are running with this way too much considering the highly coincidental nature of the charges, and that&#39;s at the heart of these accusations. &quot;There are certainly some pedophiles high up in dc, therefore these creepy pictures and oddly worded emails would suggest that these might be them&quot; It&#39;s not impossible, but yea the aggressive attacks are totally uncalled for at this point in time. </p>

<p>The difference between these &quot;well documented&quot; examples is that they have actual evidence. Witnesses. Victims. Evidence of an actual, real-life (not imaginary) crime. &quot;Pizzagate&quot; lacks all these things. There is no evidence that a child molestation crime has been committed. At least not any that&#39;s linked back to Podesta &amp; co.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now the media is in full damage control mode trying to play it off like this is far-fetched.</p>

<p>No, they&#39;re not in &quot;damage control&quot;. You&#39;re imagining this. Just because they&#39;re not stupid enough to believe the &quot;evidence&quot; amounts to anything other than an imaginary conspiracy, doesn&#39;t mean they are in &quot;damage control&quot;. It&#39;s far fetched because there is no evidence to support the claims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their lockstep dicipline in attacking this particular fringe conspiracy theory while they ignore all of the other is suspect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It never occurs to you that they are attacking this theory because a maniac shot off his rifle in a pizzaria during broad daylight? Should they focus on Big-Foot instead? Maybe UFOs?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not far-fetched, this exact same scenario has been proven to happen again and again with very powerful people covering it up. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Name one scenario in which internet sleuths were able to uncover a sex ring in which not a single victim or witness exists.</strong> Go ahead. If it happens &quot;again and again&quot;, show me just <strong>one</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ve already crossed the threshold of suspicion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. We haven&#39;t.</p>

<p>Let me ask you something, though:</p>

<p>Hypothetically, do you think a woman&#39;s report of rape should be enough to warrant a full investigation into a person&#39;s life? Including, searching their homes, businesses, computers, etc?
What if the woman wasn&#39;t even the one who was raped herself?
What if she didn&#39;t even witness a rape, doesn&#39;t know the accused, and her only &quot;evidence&quot; are his social media postings?</p>

<p>Because this is where we&#39;re at, right now. A completely unsubstantiated claim, made by anonymous strangers, without a single witness or victim (or evidence that one even exists).</p>

<p>Yet you&#39;re willing to believe this trash? If so, there just may be no saving someone like you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, this topic is actually pretty tame considering some of the rabbit holes I&#39;ve been down (on a personal level), involving spirituality and reality. That&#39;s were mind fuck enters (for me at least). Pedophilia has been known/existed since the dawn of man kind. The age has only shifted. For example: people used to marry when they first started puberty (or younger). That now-a-days would be consider pedophilia. I&#39;m not condoning such things, just saying. Also, the whole ritual shit and cannibalism doesn&#39;t surprise me at all either. Mayans used to do that shit on the daily. Once again, I&#39;m not condoning this  fucked up shit, just saying if you&#39;ve been down enough rabbit holes, these topics shouldn&#39;t fuck with your mind/surprise you. </p>

<p>But, then again, maybe that is why I live out in the woods away from people.. I wouldn&#39;t necessarilly call myself a &quot;functioning member of society&quot;.</p>

I read somewhere (I forgot where, maybe it was The Franklin Coverup by John Decamp) where they explained the theory behind the whole &quot;Satanist&quot; aspect of the abuse.

<p>It&#39;s almost like they made this story so absurd and convoluted so that when you try to explain it to your friend you sound like a nutjob by default.  Just the buzzwords &quot;PIZZAGATE!!!

Intelligent, educated people who looked at the same evidence I did and don&#39;t see any basis for the conclusions I have drawn.&quot;  There is a reason you feel like you are losing your mind.  You are.  In ten years on reddit I have never seen such an example of a toxic hive mind forming that became devoid of logic, skepticism or critical thinking (except maybe after the Boston Bombing and infamous reddit &quot;investigation&quot; that followed). It honestly looks like a cult.  These beliefs removed from reality are accepted without real analysis, and &quot;believers&quot; are conditioned to call anyone who disagrees a shill.  And any dissenting opinion is dismissed out of hand.  I honestly have never seen anything like it, and it has been a powerful and disturbing lesson in human psychology.  What is the more probable explanation for you feeling like you are crazy for believing this stuff?  That everyone else is a complete idiot?  That the entire population is under some sort of mind control? Or that you and a tiny group of people in an internet echo chamber have in fact lost touch with reality?  Which is more probable?  I started following the pizzagate theory before the election, right when the Wikileaks emails hit.  I found the &quot;code words&quot; interesting.  I read and reviewed everything about it.  The more I looked at things with an objective mind and logical reasoning, the more it all fell apart.  Everything can be explained pretty easily with a little bit of thought and consideration of  context.  And I have pointed this out on specific points to people on this sub (since pizzagate all flooded it) over and over.  Each time, that piece of &quot;evidence&quot; is abandoned and i am told to &quot;look at all the other stuff put together.&quot;  Or just presented with the conclusion that &quot;anyone who looks at this stuff with an open mind would agree with me.  you must be a shill or a troll.&quot;  But also with time, the more I saw the growth of a very vocal and aggressive population on reddit of people who saw more and more &quot;evidence&quot; in less and less.  If you search you will actually find a post of a guy who made a video of every time the pizza delivery truck appears in the Pixar movies.  He is convinced Disney slipped this in as a nod to child kidnapping and pedophilia.  Other people will find a random business (I saw one posted of an ice cream business) where the webpage or logo has a picture of kids.  And they claim there is something sinister in a picture of kids smiling.  Yet others have posted that no kids exist to report abuse because they are killed and cooked into pizza. Seriously.  I have read so much about so many conspiracy theories and many have legs.  This one doesn&#39;t.  I have never seen so many crazy conclusions drawn from so little.  And the posts and comments I see online about it honestly have begun to disturb me.  That there are people out there so disconnected from reality, and with access to guns, is terrifying. </p>

<p>To answer your questions, I am not in on it.  I am not mass MK Ultra mind controlled.  In fact, my livelihood depends on objectively analyzing evidence (or the lack thereof) and reaching a conclusion therefrom.  I have no dog in this fight and I frankly hate Hillary Clinton.  You talk about people lacking skepticism.  In fact, the people who do not buy this stuff are the ones exercising some skepticism.  People are looking at you like you&#39;re crazy because you are telling them that the earth is flat and the moon is made of cheese. Please honestly consider that.</p>

<p>Behind all your supposed skepticism, you haven&#39;t adressed why you think that&#39;s the case, and from what I can assume, you seem to deny it from the things you see constantly which are the Instagram pictures.</p>

<p>No. By far the most &quot;red-flag&quot; circumstance from this are the Podesta emails and taste. It is the fact that Comet is linked <strong>DIRECTLY</strong> not to one, but two government officials that work in the human trafficking session.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the fact that everyone that has close ties to Comet, also seems to be quite content with depraved sexual innuendos that involve children. That are just too many connections and coincidences to just simply claim like you&#39;re doing, that this is all bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s at least a slightly more interesting one, at least.</p>

<p>First, you should consider: is it possible for a handkerchief with a map on it to exist? <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=map+handkerchief&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=ms-android-verizon&amp;amp;prmd=simvn&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5yKGRqefQAhUGKCYKHdanC5EQ_AUICCgC&amp;amp;biw=412&amp;amp;bih=652">Without any doubt, yes</a>. Possible for a handkerchief with a map that is <em>also</em> pizza-related to exist? Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have picture of such a specific thing on hand. But consider something like this: <a href="http://www.janeporter.co.uk/illustrations/a-map-on-a-handkerchief">http://www.janeporter.co.uk/illustrations/a-map-on-a-handkerchief</a>. It&#39;s a handkerchief with a map on it that was designed to promote a very small-scale cultural tour in London. If people are commissioning map handkerchiefs for things like that, why couldn&#39;t some pizza place somewhere have one made to promote their restaurant, with a map on it? It would be a good promotional item.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s possible for such an item to exist, then it&#39;s possible that the email can be taken at literal face value. Podesta simply had a pizza-related map handkerchief, and left it on a kitchen island while looking at real estate. <em>There is no reason to even begin to consider an alternate explanations</em> unless it&#39;s impossible/unthinkably improbable for an item like that - a pizza-related map handkerchief - to exist.</p>

<p>And even if you start considering alternate explanations, there are less outrageous ones to go to first. For example, I saw someone note that the email has a lot of spelling errors (the woman sending it even misspells her own name), so &#39;map&#39; could be a misspelling of &#39;mark&#39;. Or, even if you become convinced that &#39;pizza&#39; <em>has</em> to be a code word of some sort, it could easily be code for something else (drugs perhaps?)</p>

<p>But yeah, my thought here is that it probably just literally is a handkerchief with a pizza-related map on it. That doesn&#39;t seem anywhere close to being outside the realm of possibility to me.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t need the map, I&#39;ve got a scan of it--but make sure the others don&#39;t get a look. I know Mook especially plays for anyadvantage he can get. Haha! I want to see them squirm!</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s far more likely that they <em>not using code at all</em>. </p>

<p>Maybe their prediction of a &#39;false flag&#39; came true, or maybe some disturbed individual just took this conspiracy theory too seriously on their own with no sinister shadow government involvement. Is it so hard for you to believe that you guys&#39; reckless fearmongering might actually have unpleasant real-world side-effects that are no one&#39;s fault but your own? Well, okay, I guess that&#39;s an unfair question - of course it is. It&#39;s the one thing that conspiracy theorists absolutely refuse to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t begrudge anyone looking into these things, and I was even drawn into a slight sense of suspicion when Pizzagate as a concept was first coalescing. I understand where you&#39;re coming from, to some extent... I think. And I wasn&#39;t really trying to get into a loop of combatively shooting down pieces of evidence or suspicions, so I&#39;m sorry this comment chain turned into mostly that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just wrap up by generally saying (not just to you, but to anyone who&#39;s bothered to read down this far): please try to remember that your actions can have consequences, even if it&#39;s using heightened rhetoric on an online forum. It can inspire violence. And also, the reason that suspicions do not count as proof in a court of law is that <em>suspicious people are very often innocent</em>. Not always, but often. Just be careful about not trying to ruin the lives of people who don&#39;t deserve it. I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t enjoy it if the same was done to you.</p>

<p>Thanks for remaining civil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kat,</p>

<p>That handkerchief is my sketch for Level 5 of Castle Eisendorf. Brock&#39;s rogue is trapped in a water-chamber and Hillary&#39;s sorcerer is almost out of spells and HP! They&#39;re going to face a Glabrezu with 180 HP--I rolled!) and I doubt Mook&#39;s Paladin is up for it but if he can get back together with Sid&#39;s fucking munchkin&#39;d Dragonborn Barbarian. High drama--Can&#39;t wait!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got a bunch of new WhizKids figurines that I&#39;ve custom moded. Reapers. Red Skeletons. And Pit Fiends. Gonna have the room lit with sandalwood scented candles and a couple of vintage Lava-Simplex Lava Lamps for atmosphere!</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t need the map, I&#39;ve got a scan of it--but make sure the others don&#39;t get a look. I know Mook especially plays for anyadvantage he can get. Haha! I want to see them squirm!</p>

<p>Oh, and don&#39;t worry about the pizza. I think we&#39;re ordering Chinese tonight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I consider this to be concrete evidence.</p>

<p>The Podesta taste in art. 
The friend of Hillary who was involved in a child trafficking scandal and who was rescued by team Hillary. 
The video where a really creepy person at Rocket Pizza is joking about torturing a newborn and the audience is laughing. 
The massive donations to Hillary&#39;s campaign from exceedingly shady people in other countries for mostly unexplained reasons. </p>

<p>There is more, a lot more, but I think that is enough to start with. </p>

<p>The Podesta taste in art is basically what I think one could expect from serial killers. It is really sick. I don&#39;t assume they are innocent until proven guilty; I wonder what kind of people would run a crooked campaign like the one Hillary&#39;s team ran in order to put a mass murderer like her in office and then I work backwards. I already know Hillary&#39;s team are supporters of mass murder, so it not so hard for me to believe that they might also torture or traffic in children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If people are truly concerned with elite trafficking and child torture, there is actual evidence, in the form of victim testimony, that they could research. There are reports, studies, articles, memoirs, radio shows, going back into the 1990&#39;s. Peppered in the accounts of survivors (not just the famous, problematic case whose videos keep popping up), in memoirs, and online in various small corners, are the names of notorious high level people, one of whom is close to Hillary. In all this pizzagate mess, I have not seen one mention of his name or any hint that people are doing serious research on the topic. This is what really frustrates me, and leads me to question the fervor, if it&#39;s not borne out of sincere concern, what is driving it? There is a tendency these days for people to expend a great deal of energy decrying the symbols of problems, rather than confronting the problems directly. That might be part of what is happening. The more hopeful side of me thinks that perhaps these topics may be moving out of the realm of forbidden, this may be just the first awkward and timid step.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not at all what they are saying. They don&#39;t mean that they believe p-gate because they automatically disagree with what the MSM is saying. They are alluding to the weird way the media has been trying to discredit p-gate that makes things suspicious. It seems odd that media is reporting on this, rather than ignoring it like some fringe conspiracy nonsense (compare this with flat Earth coverage). Media has misconstrued the arguments that p-gate is putting forward, instead of offering a sincere response to quell suspicions. Media has cherry picked which bits of evidence to present to make the story seem outlandish. Some of the evidence presented by the media are things the p-gate community have already ruled out. You have news organizations calling it &#39;fake news&#39;. Blaming &#39;fake news&#39; when the bulk of the evidence coming out of this is crowd sourced, and not from any news organizations is shady. All of this behavior would be expected if there was a cover up going on. The way the media is covering this bolsters p-gate.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like we have become connected on a level unprecedented in human history, thanks to technology. Most people use social media now than ever before. This is why they <em>so badly</em> want to regulate the Internet. The entire public can be turned against the elite if this investigation goes viral. If pizzagate is proven to be legitimate in undeniable ways, people are going to be <strong>fucking angry.</strong> and it will spread like wild fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah, I&#39;m actually HOPING for a news organization to, ya know, actually do some reporting.  Like Anderson Cooper just reported on a story about the &quot;fake news story&quot; of Sandy Hook being a hoax, he went on to say &quot;this is their claim, and this is why they are wrong&quot; multiple times, to the point where he seemed reasonable (I admittedly don&#39;t believe Sandy Hook was a hoax and think people who think it was are insane....I know, I&#39;m a hypocrite).  Having said that, I literally haven&#39;t heard a SINGLE mainstream news organization mention WHY pizzagate became a thing in the first place, as if it was created by a &quot;fake news&quot; out of thin air.  But they can&#39;t wait to preface the story with how &quot;SO OBVIOUSLY FAKE!!!&quot; the story is....because the guy being accused said crimes says so?  Uhhh...that&#39;s it?  How is this acceptable journalism?  I understand journalism is dead, but come on...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct.  Sandy Hook was not a hoax.  It was a tragedy.  And while I wouldn&#39;t call people who believe it was &quot;insane&quot;, they are not basing their conclusions on evidence and logic.  These people have decided they want it to be a hoax, and then work backward to find things they deem suspicious.  Instead of looking at everything and weighing the facts, at some point they made up their minds and left critical thinking and skepticism behind.  That&#39;s the trap you have fallen into here.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;this is their claim, and this is why they are wrong&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t do that with pizzagate. Because pizzagate doesn&#39;t make &quot;wrong&quot; claims, that are objectively false.</p>

<p>Instead, what it does is use egregiously flawed logic and takes gigantic logical leaps from things that are true, and makes it sound like evidence for their claim.</p>

<p>For example, people take the picture of the little girl taped to a table on the restaurant, and say this is &quot;evidence&quot;</p>

<p>Evidence for what, you ask? They don&#39;t <em>explicitly</em> say what it is evidence for(because it isn&#39;t evidence for jack shit). </p>

<p>But the clear implication is that it is evidence for the main core of the conspiracy. Which is that this guy kidnaps, rapes, and murders children in the basement of his restaurant alongside the political elite during satanic rituals.</p>

<p>You can see how that&#39;s a leap in logic, right? And this is especially true when the picture in question is of his goddaughter, that <em>he personally posted on Instagram</em>, of her and her sister playing, two years ago.</p>

<p>Saying that this is &quot;evidence&quot; for anything is ridiculous. Let alone that it is evidence for raping and murdering children.</p>

<p>But you can&#39;t say &quot;This is not evidence for anything, you are using flawed logic&quot;, and have it be as objectively true as if they were making a concrete factually incorrect claim. </p>

<p>In other words, it&#39;s an argument. Not a fact. And even though it is the only side of the argument that uses logic and rationality, the people who believe in this shit can&#39;t be swayed by that.</p>

<p>If they could be swayed by logic, then they wouldn&#39;t be where they are in the first place.</p>

<p>You cannot use reason to get someone out of a position that they did not use reason to get themselves into in the first place.</p>

<p>circumstantial evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is my opinion on this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Giving the allegations that a guy kidnaps, rapes, murders, and eats children in the basement of his pizza restaurant alongside the political elite for satanic rituals credibility by calling instagram photos that do not indicate anything remotely like this in any way, shape, or form &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot; is intellectually dishonest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, a lot of people use the Instagram picture of the little girl taped to the table as &quot;evidence&quot;, and say that this is one piece of &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot; that gets put on the pile of other &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>But saying that a picture of his goddaughter from two years ago that <em>he personally put on Instagram</em>, as a joke about keeping kids from running around the restaurant, is &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot; that he rapes, murders, and possibly eats children in satanic rituals in the basement of his pizza restaurant among the political elite is ridiculous.</p>

<p>&quot;Circumstantial evidence&quot; of a claim necessitates that you can logically conclude the claim is true based on the circumstantial evidence, even if such evidence does not prove the claim beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p>

<p>Please, show me <strong>anything</strong> in the pizzagate theory that you could make the logical conclusion that he rapes and murders children in the basement of his pizza restaurant. Show me something that can be used in court and isn&#39;t just plain old character assassination.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t, you don&#39;t have circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>Should someone launch an investigation into your life when they don&#39;t even have circumstantial evidence that you committed a crime?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s already been determined that not one but two businesses on the block, that share a Democratic Party connection to Clinton and/or Podesta, have FBI cataloged pedophilia symbols in their logos, one of which was actually changed almost immediately as the suspicion was raised. Generally speaking, that should be enough to warrant at least a visit from the Feds. </p>

<p>That coupled with what the FBI could easily demonstrate is &quot;coded language&quot;, sadistic and pedophilic artwork that hangs in the restaurant, &quot;jokes&quot; about purchasing children, restraining children, unsolicited photo commentary such as &quot;Killroom&quot; &quot;Just wash it off when you&#39;re done&quot; and of course &quot;Yum baby.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;d say that&#39;s PC for at least a tour of the premises. </p>

<p>Edit-When you factor in the propensity for these things to be covered up by local authorities who may be involved (See Franklin Credit Union scandal) You have to act quickly with the information you have. These people tend to scatter like roaches when the lights come on.</p>

<p>Edit 2: It should be noted that there doesn&#39;t need to be any evidence that he is raping, murdering and eating children, for a serious crime to have been committed.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what examples are for.</p>

<p>Since it would be much less productive and intuitive for me to go through literally every single piece of &quot;evidence&quot; and explain how this does not logically indicate that he rapes, murders, and potentially eats children along with the political elite in satanic rituals carried out in the basement of his pizza restaurant, I invite you to show me a piece of evidence where this is a logical conclusion to draw.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not evidence of anything. It&#39;s just suspicious. When you add it to the guy calling a baby a &#39;hoetard&#39; it starts to look like this guy has a really weird attitude towards children.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it. I think, based on those things, that he has a really weird attitude towards children. He thinks that babies taped to the table is funny or cute or something, just like Podesta thinks that little boys in bondage is high art.</p>

<p>On its own, I would just shrug it off. But all together with all the other suspicious bullshit surrounding this, I don&#39;t think anything should be ignored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think about it a lot. In my head, I try to take the side of the &#39;fake news&#39; pushers, to understand why they&#39;d think it was fake. But the thought that always follows is: Okay, but what if it isn&#39;t? If it isn&#39;t, there are millions of children involved every year, being abused, sold, drugged up, used as sex slaves, and potentially even ritualistically sacrificed. Why, under ANY circumstance, would <strong>ANYONE</strong> take the chance on something like this being fake? How could you even write this off and not investigate it? What if it happens to your kid? And then it just all goes to question marks in my head.  </p>

<p>David Icke has been writing about why for decades. Maybe once you reach that point it <strong>is</strong> just a theory, but in realising that you don&#39;t truly know something until you&#39;ve experienced it, a lot of what you thought you knew can become just a theory in the same sense. After finding out how much of history is lies, how much of history is left out, and imagining what was left undiscovered, I&#39;m open to believing our race is currently controlled by snake people who abuse and sacrifice children. Or, at the very least, the most vile, despicable, closest-to-pure-evil people you can get. It&#39;s like Biko said, the greatest weapon the oppressor has is the mind of the oppressed. If we are absolutely controlled from the cradle to the grave, we will never even know what reality actually is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve lived my whole life with that feeling, so I guess I don&#39;t recognize it very often, just now and then. I grew up being abused along with other children, and was subjected to gaslighting among other psychological forms of abuse in regards to the physical/sexual abuse itself. My perception of other people has been less than stellar for as far back as I can remember. So the way people react to the pedogate topic is nothing particularly new to me. The topic itself is however triggering for me, yeah. A bit impossible for it not to be. </p>

<p>Like I&#39;ve explained on here before, most people are cowardly unless they have nothing left to lose, in which case they are more so desperate than courageous. If there is a serious problem, then it makes them feel like they ought to do something, even if it&#39;s just acknowledging the problem and spreading awareness. But they don&#39;t want to do that. Someone might laugh them, they might get fired, etc. But at the same time, they want to be able to think of themselves as good people. If there is an issue and they won&#39;t respond to it, then are they really &quot;good people&quot; or do they only care about themselves? Therefore, they need for there to be no serious problems.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just on the topic of child abuse, either. Consider how many waste money on food, then throw away the excess food, while never thinking about the millions of the people (including children) around the world who are starving to death. If you open the can of worms, they&#39;re <em>all</em> coming out together, which is why nobody wants to even consider opening it.</p>

<p>But there are still some impressive souls out there, they do exist. While I was homeless in California for a little while, I observed how most people acted as though the homeless were invisible, and would only engage so far as asking the LAPD to chase homeless people away from wherever they tried to find rest or shelter. Yet I also encountered/observed a handful of people who would acknowledge the homeless as fellow human beings, even if they couldn&#39;t help, and then also a group who was trying to actually help.</p>

<p>Humanity is a mixed bag when it comes to quality of character. You might not have any high quality souls in your personal life right now, but they do exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can explain that. It was number magic. First off you have to realize who really did 9/11, it was the Bush family, the Mossad, the Saudis, etc. All of these groups have a few things in common, they are all really, really nutty. Not only are they nutty, but they are also pedophiles and child abusers, some of them are even quite satanic. </p>

<p>So, they hatched this big plan called the Project for a New American Century (PNAC) that would enable them to take over the world. Anyway, 9/11 was a big burned human sacrifice to their Gog and Magog, or Moloch, or whatever they call it. </p>

<p>No really, they are a bunch of religious nuts who did 9/11 in order to start Armageddon. I always thought religious people were interesting in a weird way so I keep an eye on them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I am seeing are people who are normally well versed seem to be getting marching orders from up top. Probably because a lot at the top are involved in corruption or connected to people in pizzagate. </p>

<p>How they are covering pizza gate is not normal for them. </p>

<p>Any time they don&#39;t want people looking into something they try to paint it off as a conspiracy. Or the new Clinton smear &quot;Russians&quot; &quot;Grow up petulant little children!&quot;</p>

<p>Remember when Silverman said to the Bernie or Bust crowd that they were &quot;being ridiculous&quot; and everything came to pass that proved everything the BoB people were going on about was true? </p>

<p>Yeah I think that&#39;s what Colbert did when he told people looking into pizzagate to &quot;grow the fuck up&quot;. </p>

<p>Colbert is an icon to me. He&#39;s usually quick and unstumpable. I don&#39;t know if he was being cynical or manipulated or serious. The whole thing with the Hillary&#39;s candidacy was just so upside down bizzaro world when it came to TV networks. </p>

<p>Just keep going on looking into the connections with a healthy skeptic eye. Don&#39;t let it consume you into making prejudices and painting everything. If it gets to that point, you might want to step back a bit. </p>

<p>However just know what you know and you&#39;ll be vindicated later when it comes out later. </p>

<p>Yes, I also remember her &#39;joking&#39; about what could be described as pedophile type behavior. She is really disgusting, IMO, and NOT funny. Colbert showed himself to be a tool for the elite when he did his &quot;Keep Fear Alive&quot; event. I was trying to get Occupy off the ground and he and Jon Stewart held it back by a year by diverting the energy to their event instead. I was pissed. </p>

<p>He was serious. He is a also a Catholic and teaches Sunday school. He is starting to look very suspicious on this topic IMO. The networks are run by a very small group of people and they decided they wanted Hillary for our next president. This was apparent two years before the election. The press never gave Bernie a real chance because they knew their job was to get Hillary elected. She was the choice of their bosses. </p>

<p>Now all those same people are trying to tell us this big pedophile scandal in DC is not real. I think that is very interesting and extremely revealing. Who would cover up for pedophiles? Well I would expect the other pedophiles in their network would want to. What other motive could the press have for denigrating and ignoring this story? They might claim there is no real evidence but we all know that is not true. They are lying about it. Why? </p>

<p>if you are convinced that pizzagate is real, i can see why you would feel like you are losing your mind.</p>

<p>either there is a massive conspiracy that involves nearly every authority you can think of, because all of them dismiss pizzagate, or pizzagate just only managed to convince you(and likeminded individuals).</p>

<p>the problem is that you are viewing everything trough the lens of a malicious conspiracy when there are many other things to take into account.</p>

<p>fake news may be a talking point that is being pushed in the media, but the media always tries to create shorthand talking points. this does not feel different to how its always been, but now its proof that they protect pedofiles... you see how pizzagate is raising the stakes? intensifying fears?</p>

<p>feeling uncomfortable when somebody does not agree with you is natural, immediately thinking that they are a shill is a learned coping mechanism via blinders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The annoying thing is that <em>nobody</em> (or media) manages to actually address the claims. All they say is &quot;it&#39;s ridiculous&quot; and &quot;fakenews has struck again&quot;. Not one media outlet has ACTUALLY described WHY people think this place is suspicious.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/">Snopes article</a> is an example, I&#39;ll summarize it, but please read it yourself.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Pizzagate is not true because NYT says it themselves: &quot;It&#39;s not true&quot;. If you read the NYT article all they say is &quot;We asked Alefantis and he said &quot;It&#39;s not true and we are getting harassed&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Snopes links to the article that is deleted, so all you see is &quot;Removed&quot;. Snopes gives us a decent but far from complete summary. Why not link to an archived version?</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Several pages were linked to support the details of the claim&quot;. Snopes only links to one e-mail of two sentences that is barely relevant.</p></li>
<li><p>Snopes tells us that the instagram has bizarre images etc, but doesn&#39;t show them there. Instead they say that Alefantis took them from Facebook pages of his guests. Ok. The problem is not <em>where</em> the pictures came from. The problem is that they have been collected and are accompanied by comments that could use an explanation. This paragraph ends with &quot;Facebook&quot; as a clickable link - and it links to the NYT article that does NOT say he took the photos from Facebook. </p></li>
<li><p>Snopes continues to debunk <strong>one</strong> photo. A photo that is brought up by a journalist and one that I never saw listed among the other photo&#39;s. So why debunk one photo that is not even a part of the actual set of photos? And why not debunk the others?</p></li>
<li><p>Then some other suspisions about Pizzagate are mentioned (Haïti orphans, child trafficking, Madeleine McCann), but they are not refuted or proven wrong in any way.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally something good! Snopes mentions this <a href="https://archive.is/0r7Ky/91a31ef00d420ac16ffdec4fda269dcab579c4de.jpg">collage</a>. So they do have the information, but they choose to discuss fragments and forget the most obvious things, like the Besta-logo.</p></li>
<li><p>Snopes continues to explain that &quot;<em>fear of &quot;pedophile code&quot; imagery is occasionally the basis for panic</em>&quot;. Twice they link to their own article which has an example of a pillow with the hearts-in-hearts logo and it turned out not be about pedophilie. So because this single pillow turns out not to be a Pedo-signal there is no coverted signaling by pedo&#39;s in the entire world AT ALL?</p></li>
<li><p>From there on the article goes on about threats being made against Comet Ping Pong. Don&#39;t get me wrong, that is not good. But in no way it proves or disproves that there is something fishy going on there.</p></li>
<li><p>Also they link to a Washington City article that is just as bad as the NYT article as they only say &quot;it&#39;s ridiculous!&quot;. Also they say Politico has debunked it and then link to an article on Politico that covers a <em>completely different</em> childtrafficking conspiracy in D.C. involving Clinton.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now even if you think Pizzagate is nonsense and the people who think that some actually research should be done on this case are batshit crazy - you have to agree with me that an article like this one by Snopes (and the one by the NYT and Washington City) don&#39;t take on the subject <em>at all</em>. They talk about the negative consequences, they talk about Fake news being a problem, they talk about accussations that are not part of what is being said and all along they somehow forget to talk about what people ACTUALLY find damning in this case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, what I said was that despite Pizzagate may be total nonsense, there are no articles (that I know of) that just describe why people make the claims. As you can read the NYT article and Snopes claim they do, but they do a horrible job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may seem off topic, but I think it&#39;s on topic since this thread is less about details, and more about the emotional aspect.</p>

<p>A really good movie I watched on this exact subject recently that provided me with some catharsis is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/"><em>They Live</em></a>.</p>

<p>On the surface, it&#39;s just a cheesy 80&#39;s action movie, but that&#39;s what makes it overall uplifting and entertaining.</p>

<p>Underneath, it&#39;s so much more. The basic premise, without much spoiling since it&#39;s a pretty basic concept, is that a capitalist alien civilization has taken over our society and treats us like cattle. A nameless drifter, played by a professional wrestler, finds a pair of sunglasses that allows him to see the aliens that walk among us for who they really are.</p>

<p>Check out the reveal scene, which takes place not too long into the movie. I&#39;ve watched this clip dozens of times <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlLYQyA47d0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlLYQyA47d0</a></p>

<p>Immediately after that scene he gets pissed and goes on a shooting rampage killing aliens, which is where the line &quot;I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass...and I&#39;m all out of bubblegum&quot; comes from, improvised on the set by Roddy Piper on the day of shooting.</p>

<p>But the real climax of the movie, IMO, and the one most relevant to this thread, is the absurdly long 6 minute fight scene between Roddy Piper and Keith David. It&#39;s considered one of the best fight scenes in cinema history, and the &#39;cripple fight&#39; from South Park is a shot-by-shot recreation of that fight.</p>

<p>Outside of the context of the movie, or if you don&#39;t get the message, the fight only seems interesting because it&#39;s absurdly long. However, it&#39;s absurdly long for a reason. Frank, played by Keith David, is the drifter&#39;s best friend at the time. He just wants Frank to &quot;put on the damn sunglasses&quot; so that his eyes will be opened and he will see what is going on. Frank is so adamant on staying asleep and not getting involved that he puts up a hell of a fight, and only eventually sees through the sunglasses when they are forced onto his face.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: The most infamously absurdly long fight scene in cinema history is not that way for no reason. It is stretched uncomfortably long to drive home the point it is making about the struggle between those who have had their eyes opened and the ones around us who we love that refuse to open their eyes, which is precisely what OP is lamenting. If you feel like OP, I suggest taking a short break from your pizza gate research to check out <em>They Live</em> and enjoy yourself some cheesy 80&#39;s action accompanied by conspiracy theorist catharsis.</p>

You can cry about Franklin or Dutroux if you want to, I know as well as you do that it&#39;s real shit, but you&#39;re only going to have the impact of one single person, and when you&#39;re looking for a smoking gun or looking for some way to strike back, you&#39;re only going to have the resources of one single person. Momentum and modern crowdsourced investigation are both extremely valuable in this fight. Pizzagate might not be the ideal playing field, but it&#39;s unmatched on the basis of its ability to draw way more interested parties to one place right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, artificial momentum by DoD usernames on Reddit &amp; 4chan, let&#39;s ignore Bonacci and look for more logos.  There&#39;s a million local pizza places for us to convince ourselves to attack.  And therefore, <strong>to discredit authentic police investigation of authentic pedo-rings and insulate them against authentic exposure with a mountain of disinfo bullshit</strong>.  And, as you don&#39;t deny, Because Hillary.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a multi-layered protection operation designed to keep pedo-rings protected for another 40 years, way better than &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; did.  Plus, we can take down a whole bunch of politicians &amp; strengthen a whole bunch of others.  Cui bono?  Wonder which politicians will be strategically strengthened?  Maybe ... the real pedos?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I agree with you on a lot of this. The key difference in our positions though is that I see Pizzagate having something of a mass awakening effect and on that basis believe the investigation to have a net benefit even despite its problems. You talk about pedo rings protected for the next 40 years. We&#39;ve had a population with its collective head in the fucking sand bent on keeping the truth from itself at all costs for the past 40 years. The internet is the new mainstream. The culture of the past was dictated to us from above, the culture of the future is an emergent property of worldwide connections between people unfolding in real time. Do you really think we can even make it another 40 years with the common person being completely in the dark? I think that is absolutely the fuck impossible and I think memes like &quot;Pizzagate&quot; triumphing over memes like &quot;fake news&quot; is the way out of this mess. Just saying brah</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep waiting for &quot;evidence&quot; that isn&#39;t weird emails. I send weird emails. As a matter of fact, I bet if a stranger read my texts and emails they&#39;d come away with some VERY weird assumptions about me because I have a dirty and inappropriate sense of humor. So when I see that over half of the &quot;Evidence&quot; for pizzagate is pretentious art, photos of kids eating pizza on the instagram account of a guy who runs a pizzaparlor (SHOCKING!), a poorly drawn logo (I&#39;m sure you could find this &quot;pedo code&quot; on a lot of middleschooler&#39;s binders), I lose respect for the pizzagaters and their theory.</p>

<p>A missing kid with ties to the pizza parlor would be evidence. So far the lack of actual missing kids and grieving parents seems pretty damning to me. It&#39;s also weird that such powerful people need to meet at a shitty pizza parlor. Why not someone&#39;s house? Why not a yacht in international waters? Why not a private plane (see Jeffery Epstein)? And the list of people who would need to be &quot;in on it&quot; has grown so large it begs more questions than anyone cares to answer. </p>

<p>So no. Your theory doesn&#39;t deserve a major investigation. But rest assured, if you&#39;re right about all of this stuff I&#39;m sure someone is going to squeal sooner or later. Not even the Catholic Church could keep a lid on their scandal. I doubt a bunch of snake in the grass political operatives would be able to keep a secret this big for a substantial length of time.</p>

<p>This is an incredibly weak argument. Did they reference anything more concrete than their own humble and totally not biased or unqualified to make that call opinion?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, you can&#39;t fake emails because of the technology. You could look that up if you wanted to</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t have to look anything up because I already know for a fact that&#39;s a crock of nonsense. Unless they were signed cryptographically by the sender&#39;s with their known public keys there is nothing to stop someone from having completely fabricated or at least tampered with them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>assertions (lies)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Calling anything you disagree with a lie with no evidence is just childish.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Said the emails were faked (with zero evidence to back up this assertion, none).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, the onus is on people presenting evidence of a pretty far fetched conspiracy theory to prove that their evidence is not just made up, not the other way around.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it is up to you to decide who you want to believe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe anyone or anything, I follow logic and evidence to reach probabilistic conclusions. Currently I&#39;m not aware of any strong evidence that these emails aren&#39;t faked, so logic tells me that it&#39;s quite likely that they were.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe the technical people who repeatedly assert that the emails were not faked, but you can believe whoever you want to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m a software engineer so maybe you should listen to me. The only realistic way to prove beyond a reasonable doubt t that they aren&#39;t tampered with or fabricated is cryptography. If thats what the &quot;technical people&quot; are asserting based on then fine, but I would have expected that to be easier to find some reference to either through googling or asking others who seem so convinced that this thing is true. Unfortunately, though perhaps not surprisingly, neither appears to be the case so far. (Though I would love to be enlightened on that).</p>

<p>For a member of a community who loves to decry such things when it suits them, it seems as though your beliefs are leveraged quite heavily on the nebulous word of experts who you aren&#39;t qualified to validate.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Is everyone brainwashed?   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have to calm down and take a step back.  This has nothing to do with <em>everyone</em> being brainwashed, and simply the way society organizes itself, which it does so around core beliefs, which are very hard to shake.  </p>

<p>So if it was the 1600s the core belief would be that the Bible is 100% unquestionably true, and the Church&#39;s authority is unquestionable.  If anyone were to say &quot;hold on, some of the stuff in this book seems a little far-fetched&quot; everyone would say what a lunatic you you, they&#39;d say you are dangerous, and had been led astray by false doctrines.  It took society millenia for people to realize the Bible is something that <em>may</em> be questioned.  That&#39;s the whole thing here - there are certain things you <em>may</em> not question.  Generally speaking society as a whole does not question these things, and openly scorns anyone that does.    </p>

<p>That&#39;s what&#39;s so interesting about people&#39;s contempt for &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; - we are no different than free thinkers of the past, people that <em>doubted.</em>  That is all we are at the end of the day - people that have <em>doubts.</em>  That is why people hate us - people like security and certainty, they hate doubt, and that&#39;s exactly what we are starting to make their brains do everytime we start a sentence with &quot;yea, but couldn&#39;t it be that...?&quot; or &quot;doesn&#39;t it seem a little odd that...?&quot; or &quot;Have you looked into that...?&quot;    </p>

<p>This phenomenon of people cherishing their certainty and adherence to the status quo isn&#39;t limited to just religion either.  It also happens in science:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions</a><br/>
The scientific community consistently develops status quo beliefs that they refuse to shake.  Once again, they openly scorn people that come with ideas that challenge the status quo (think plate tectonics or germ theory).     </p>

<p>So what is this &quot;crazy&quot; feeling you have?  It is precisely the feeling of doubt and uncertainty that most people are trying to avoid.  You&#39;ve left the herd, church, cult, university groupthink - the echo chamber where everyone reassures everyone else they are right, and now you are left with not only your uncomfortable doubts, but also the entirety of society against you, precisely because you are willing to doubt.   </p>

<p>Stay free.</p>

<p>How can they possibly prevent someone from gaining actual evidence of this supposed &quot;ring&quot;, especially in the day of wikileaks and anonymous and practically everyone walking around with a potential spy camera in their pockets. </p>

<p>That&#39;s easy.  If you record real <em>evidence</em> then you&#39;re guilty of <em>child porn</em>.  Nice catch-22 they built into that legal framework, eh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes yes yes 
This post a breathe of fresh air to see that I&#39;m not the only one but mind is still constantly racing, It&#39;s hard to focus on anything else. It&#39;s beginning to effect my mental health. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been vocal on all social media sites trying to spread awareness but I feel like my efforts are wasted. I can&#39;t explain this to someone without them thinking I&#39;m either crazy or them just brushing it off like it&#39;s nothing. Just because it&#39;s not sensationalized it doesn&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>Do you know how I found out about pizzagate? My friken astrologer tweeted about it. </p>

<p>Then I saw the podesta art &amp; Wikileaks 
I started looking further into it, and I was all up on r/pizzagate  everyday 
Because how hard is it to make the connections? it&#39;s RIGHT THERE. 
I fREAKED when it got shut down. I still couldn&#39;t believe that no one was paying attention to the connections. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve started covering up my phone cameras and been updating my security on my devices etc just anything my basic ass self is capable of doing.</p>

<p>After MSM started calling Pizzagate fake and the discovery of the journalists tweet from 2011 was referring to pizzagate?</p>

<p>nuh-uh beeyotch , not taking any chances with anything. trust no one. I&#39;m careful with what I say out loud. Don&#39;t know if I&#39;m being recorded. Don&#39;t know if I can be careful with what I say online. 
Careful is maybe not the right word;
I don&#39;t feel safe.. </p>

<p>It still doesn&#39;t prevent me from being vocal about this. I can&#39;t. PizzaGate has to be exposed. </p>

I too believe that the location and those involved are a diversion, that&#39;s not to say that I don&#39;t think Podesta, the Clintons, Alefantis, etc, etc, etc, and the pizza joint are a part of the problem; however, in my opinion those aspects are but miniscule tidbits of very important info that should be thoroughly investigated, but this sick shit knows no borders and is way more widespread than many people can fathom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope to whatever god there is that this never &quot;dies out,&quot; at least until a very thorough investigation is conducted and the evidence is provided to the masses via a reliable source (something other than mainstream or even alternative media - what? I don&#39;t know) so that we can make informed decisions about the sickos that are involved in the despicable practice of harming children. &quot;Ignoring it,&quot; you know, the alleged child trafficking ring in D.C. that possibly spans across the globe probably isn&#39;t in anyone&#39;s best interest (especially the children&#39;s). Also, Alefantis&#39;s crowd funding is ridiculous. Some pedophile-POS-by day and creep-by-night, who is so highly regarded in D.C. for some fucking reason couldn&#39;t need crowd funding to help him cope with &quot;emotional distress,&quot; followed by &quot;bullying&quot; and &quot;menacing conversations.&quot; To top it all off a &quot;gunman&quot; (i.e. an actor from NC I believe), for some reason deciding to take justice into his own hands and go on some kind of vigilante rescue meeting. He was &quot;arrested&quot; for his half-ass rampage attempt, for coming &quot;to &#39;investigate&#39; fake news stories that Washington insiders were harboring.&quot; </p>

<p>And what kind of idiot wouldn&#39;t at least make some kind of statement or attempt to deny charges related to child human trafficking? Oh, that fucking idiot Podesta-the-molesta. Ending rant now. Sorry, not sorry.</p>
