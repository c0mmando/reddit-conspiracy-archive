        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What is the matter with you? As you go searching through your training manuals to find a response do you literally not have any remorse for the damage you are inflicting on your neighbours? I hope they pay you well cause at least it should be worth something to become a soulless mindless drones doing the dirty works of these people who you must understand now are evil and are using you!
You know you are speaking complete nonsense and that your tactics are aimed at diverting the debates away from a logical conclusion! Away from the truth!
I would not insult any animal by comparing you to them. You must literally be the lowest of the low. The most pathetic of all the lifeforms on this planet. I mean, the people on top are sick and disgusting but at least they demand a measure of respect to the extent that at least they got hustle! They made it pretty far with their insane plans but you! You are nothing! No more than a fucking robot programmed to the bidding of these people. I mean, those of you who aren&#39;t literally robots how do you sleep at night? If the answer is not on a pile of money surrounding by beautiful women than you are a fucking joke! And I mean that as a joke. Even if it is you are a coward. You have no morals. You could stand up and walk out any day if you dared but you are either too scared or you just genuinely don&#39;t care and I don&#39;t know which is worse.
My hope is that you stop fighting your lost pathetic cause and come join one that is worthy. My fear is that you won&#39;t and that the people you have been deceiving might not be as forgiving and understanding about it as I would be when they become your masters.
Think about it. Now would be a good time for you to abandon ship.</p>

<p>Plus they don&#39;t let you join this organization without you doing something for them that they can blackmail you with. Even if I wanted to quit they&#39;ll destroy my life by releasing what they made me do. And if I really get on their nerves I&#39;ll be suicided, and my friends and family will be in danger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s bullshit. But you&#39;ll find that a few too many people pushing the conspiracy have a guilty conscience. Too many comments about what they&#39;ve found on the darknet and the like, some even outright talk about viewing CP as part of their investigation. Not to mention supporting voat which is a den of this stuff. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re getting blackmailed but they&#39;re going to get into some trouble.</p>

<p>There&#39;s the idea that some homophobes have homosexual urges, and research backs it up. It might apply to paedophobes too.</p>

<p>You call people who call out your irrationality as shills, CTR, paid accounts. </p>

<p>In your world, facts are optional. So chances are anyone going against your paranoia is the defacto enemy. </p>

<p>People who are opposed to truth often project this. Apparently those searching for facts are opposed to them, while those who blindly follow the narrative are always, unarguably, correct. This statement also tends to make its author appear insane - does he really believe he is privy to so much information about OP&#39;s life? Does he really think it&#39;s possible that there&#39;s no factual proof for <em>anything</em> OP believes?</p>

<p>What truth are we talking here? pizzagate is totally real kind of truth Or truths like gravity is real, earth revolves around sun kind?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>does he really believe he is privy to so much information about OP&#39;s life?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe. I merely made inferences out of OPs own post. A typical conspiracy theorists mindset always accuse their opponents as shills of different kind. As evidenced by the very first sentence of this post. That first sentence is simply enough for me to infer that in his world, facts are just optional to concoct a narrative to make sense of the world. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>? Does he really think it&#39;s possible that there&#39;s no factual proof for anything OP believes?</p>

<p>Sure, it could be possible. But hey, if I add a 10 mg of powdered shit in your food and tell its no biggie, would you still eat it? If the foundations are bad, your building is going to crumble down even if you built the Taj Mahal on top of it.</p>

<p>What tactic? Care to be elaborate what other tactics are there in this so called book? You sound like you are offended by this statement. Whats wrong with visiting a doctor for mental health issue? </p>

<p>You think my suggestion to OP is bad over his call to some &quot;revolution&quot; ? Come on dude...</p>
