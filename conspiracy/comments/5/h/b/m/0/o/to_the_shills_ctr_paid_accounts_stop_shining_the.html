       What is the matter with you? As you go searching through your training manuals to find a response do you literally not have any remorse for the damage you are inflicting on your neighbours? I hope they pay you well cause at least it should be worth something to become a soulless mindless drones doing the dirty works of these people who you must understand now are evil and are using you!
You know you are speaking complete nonsense and that your tactics are aimed at diverting the debates away from a logical conclusion! Away from the truth!
I would not insult any animal by comparing you to them. You must literally be the lowest of the low. The most pathetic of all the lifeforms on this planet. I mean, the people on top are sick and disgusting but at least they demand a measure of respect to the extent that at least they got hustle! They made it pretty far with their insane plans but you! You are nothing! No more than a fucking robot programmed to the bidding of these people. I mean, those of you who aren't literally robots how do you sleep at night? If the answer is not on a pile of money surrounding by beautiful women than you are a fucking joke! And I mean that as a joke. Even if it is you are a coward. You have no morals. You could stand up and walk out any day if you dared but you are either too scared or you just genuinely don't care and I don't know which is worse.
My hope is that you stop fighting your lost pathetic cause and come join one that is worthy. My fear is that you won't and that the people you have been deceiving might not be as forgiving and understanding about it as I would be when they become your masters.
Think about it. Now would be a good time for you to abandon ship.

       Plus they don't let you join this organization without you doing something for them that they can blackmail you with. Even if I wanted to quit they'll destroy my life by releasing what they made me do. And if I really get on their nerves I'll be suicided, and my friends and family will be in danger.

       I dunno if you are being serious but I figured the blackmail thing was part of the deal... I saw IRL friends of mine go full shill on facebook so I guessed he was either hacked or someone had evidence of him cheating on his wife... Thats why some of them fight so hard.

       It's bullshit. But you'll find that a few too many people pushing the conspiracy have a guilty conscience. Too many comments about what they've found on the darknet and the like, some even outright talk about viewing CP as part of their investigation. Not to mention supporting voat which is a den of this stuff. I don't know if they're getting blackmailed but they're going to get into some trouble.

       There's the idea that some homophobes have homosexual urges, and research backs it up. It might apply to paedophobes too.

       Pizzagate is the crossroads between autism and schizophrenia.  And here we have this guy believing that the people responding to his bullshit are actually employees on someone's payroll who have been given a FUCKING MANUAL of responses to provide.

       Well, I get paid pretty well (let's just call it enough) and they're really flexible about hours so I can vary my schedule as I choose. We also get to use reddit normally of course, to fit in and stay in the loop.

       I feel sorry for you and your self-righteousness, not much of a life, try sharing your beliefs with family members and see what they think.

       You call people who call out your irrationality as shills, CTR, paid accounts.

       Why in seven God's name would any rational person want to even join you in anything.

       Just look at you with all that appeal to emotions fallacy you are doing to deny the lack of any factual proofs you have for any shit you believe in.

      <p>
       In your world, facts are optional. So chances are anyone going against your paranoia is the defacto enemy.

       How about you stop posting and enabling your mental health issues and go visit a doctor or something?

       People who are opposed to truth often project this. Apparently those searching for facts are opposed to them, while those who blindly follow the narrative are always, unarguably, correct. This statement also tends to make its author appear insane - does he really believe he is privy to so much information about OP's life? Does he really think it's possible that there's no factual proof for
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       OP believes?

       I don't believe. I merely made inferences out of OPs own post. A typical conspiracy theorists mindset always accuse their opponents as shills of different kind. As evidenced by the very first sentence of this post. That first sentence is simply enough for me to infer that in his world, facts are just optional to concoct a narrative to make sense of the world.

       Sure, it could be possible. But hey, if I add a 10 mg of powdered shit in your food and tell its no biggie, would you still eat it? If the foundations are bad, your building is going to crumble down even if you built the Taj Mahal on top of it.

       I look at the amount of hours that a username puts into their
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       participation.
      </p>

       I suspect that the most frequent participants on this sub have the highest probability of getting paid for what they're doing.

      <p>
       There are certain participants who are here all day long.  Some months, they're posting on an hourly basis for 12+ hours/day.

       I think a lot of the shill accounts are advanced AI bots
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of time and words on a lot of posts trying to discredit researchers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we find any consistencies between the bots? r/subredditsimulator is a good place to see bots in action and how they have advanced.
