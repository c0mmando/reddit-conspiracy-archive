<p>I think right now given the crackdown on &quot;fake news&quot; and the clear presence of CTR on the whole of reddit as little as 2 months ago make this is a very, very, very dangerous decision.  I do not know you, 9000SINS well enough to make claims. This could very well be ushering in a new era of censorship on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  I am not accusing you.

<p>I&#39;m just super suspicious.  Pizzagate got shutdown.  MSM is shutting down PG hard.  Reddit made <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> filter.  Reddit made it so that high voted conspiracy posts (we can get them up to 4k! still do) don&#39;t show up in <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.</p>

<p>And now we&#39;re trying to usher in a new supermod for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, the last bastion of pizzagate? No sir I am too suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ye ye I get your point lol, it very noble/ethical to do so but it seems to me some smart ass are now abusing/exploiting this respectable rule in order to fuck up this sub completly. Are you going let them do without reacting ? Ignoring this problem further won&#39;t be of any help. Letting them do their sabotage work will just ruin this sub on the long term. Also letting them do is like discouraging or even somehow censoring/insulting &quot;good&quot; / &quot;honest&quot; posters / commenters from this sub.
Also nothing personal against you but <strong>as a mod</strong> deleting your own post is not looking very good/appealing/serious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I deleted it because it is no longer an issue because I have rescinded the request completely . I have learned over many years of doing this job that the best course of action in such a situation is inaction. The users here are smart enough to figure things out for themselves without us the mods holding their hands and guiding them to 100% correct information. I don&#39;t know everything, nor do I claim to. My opinion on these subjects is no better than the people who decide with their votes what issues are important to them. Any actions taken by the mods here are held to insane amounts of scrutiny because of the nature of the sub and our natural instinct to distrust authority and anyone that has power over us. I have tried many styles of moderation in that time, and I had it pretty well down for a while. Then the major troll invasion of 2012-13 happened. It was a shit show. I tried like a madman to hold back a tidal wave of organized trolling, only to be chastized later by the same trolls and others in the community who they got to join the mob that I was being too heavy handed in my moderation. If we do nothing, we are accused of letting the trolls run away with the sub. We literally can&#39;t win unless we take an almost hands off approach and only step in when it&#39;s a priority. I love to be an active user here, and unfortunately being a mod here as well can be a really polarizing thing. Half the people will probably hate you for any action you take. I hope this help you understand things from our point of view a little better. I know I never understood how it worked until I got into it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thx for your explanations, not surprising. Obviously I prefer being a user than a mod in here... 😁 but if I was a mod for sure I would delete every pizza bullshit stuff and ban lots of posters (and even commenters) doing obvious pizzagate disinfo/ shilling. I won&#39;t do it for the nazi propganda stuff or the flatearther despite it hurts my feelings and belief but without hesitation I would do it for pizzagate or any similar &quot;well identified&quot; psy op (and pizzagate is obviously one to me) which sole purpose is to fuck up people mind, disinformation, and confuse people so they don&#39;t dig further into &quot;conspiracies&quot;, disbelieve everything  that is not in MSM etc. If you let those people doing freely largr scale psy op  in this sub without reacting then the vilains have already won/control this sub and all non shill / clean mods can already leave now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Such generosity. Much astonishment.      </p>

<p>It was that simple all along.<br/>
Faced with the reality that our super-secret, anti-establishment club is dependent on the goodwill of Condé Nast and its shareholders, all it needed in order to counteract this mainstream bludgeon was a plain request to remove a particular mod. Remove this interloper and r/conspiracy can go back to fighting the good fight!        </p>

<p>I wish to express my gratitude. Even though, as you indicate, your request is still pending.<br/>
Surely though, the movement you created cannot be stopped. So I wish to pledge my allegiance to you and your ability to resist further encroachment by TPTB.<br/>
Thank you for your gift. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... but from my point of view illuminatedwax is kinda like leaving your fully upgraded X-01 Power Armor parked unguarded on the outskirts of town... you never know when some scavenger will climb into it and use it to easily obliterate your now out gunned settlement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not in the least.  It&#39;s like leaving a your Sentry Bot unplugged and then it suddenly coming back to life.  YOu have no idea what programming it has, but it SHOUUULLDDD be there to protect you.</p>

<p>In any case if it&#39;s not an issue currently, why fix it?  What can a super mod do that the normal mods can&#39;t do?  Why is it an issue?  Why now? If it&#39;s fine to wait why not just wait.  6 months?  <em>3</em> months??  </p>

<p>seriously, this is super fucked up.</p>

Please don&#39;t take it as any thing personal.  But dead men are very trustworthy.  Seriously, I wish you all the best.  Just saying.  </p>

<p>Are there some functions we&#39;re missing out on, by not having a present top-mod?  </p>

<p>Is it just the button?  Can you vote to just not have a button?</p>
