        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">24</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-09 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/BP89.html">BP89</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been following this story for awhile now as I&#39;m sure many of us here have. While discovering what may or may not be true, I think many of us want to know what is the reality. It is not an easy thing to digest, especially for those who are coming here because they heard something about it from friends and now, interestingly enough, the news. But I&#39;ve been a lurker on this site for a long time and have seen things that were once considered important, just fade away in a month. </p>

<p>We cannot lose focus of this. We&#39;re about to see within the next couple months, a FUCKTON of distractions covered by the media. The more we start digging into pizzagate, the more nervous they get.  So do not be surprised if we hear more about celebrity deaths, something with Russia or North Korea, maybe even China. Donald Trump does something outrageous. Whatever it might be. I am not suggesting they are related, but the media will get ahold of something and blare it 24/7 if it means we forget about the current situation. But we have to continue poking into it.</p>

<p>We must continue asking questions about these people, who literally govern our lives. Many of us feel helpless, because THIS IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL, a GLOBAL THING, so what can we do? Well, we must always continue the conversation, we have to pick away at it until it collapses. You might not think that we have any power just by talking about it, but look at what we&#39;ve managed to accomplish already! Facebook and other social media sites are passing it around. Some news channels are picking it up. It started on a message board, and made it to national news. People are becoming aware and we have to continue to fan the flame if we want to bust this thing wide open. </p>

<p>This sub has long been infiltrated by those who wish to discredit us, but we can&#39;t give up when someone criticizes us or calls us names. South Korea riots their government for satanic rituals. (Child sacrifice?) Not too long ago, someone blew the whistle on the pedo ring in the UK. Don&#39;t hear about that anymore, do we? Hollywood has a pedo ring, and actors and actresses have even testified to its truth, Drew Barrymore and Judy Garland, also Corey Feldman. The Vatican has a massive pedophilia problem, most of us make jokes about it now. The Pentagon was investigated 4 years ago for child pornography, while leaving 1700 of the 5300 employees, uninvestigated. Is it really that hard to believe that The White House or other governments or agencies might be involved with this as well?  This is the very beginning of what may be a global revolution. And we need to continue asking questions about this. Don&#39;t be distracted by what the media will throw at us. Do not let this die.</p>

We know that they wouldn&#39;t give it the time it deserves, most likely because they want to discredit it, and to convince people it&#39;s false, and to stop them from looking into it further.

    <div class="md"><p>Can you prove that you have not raped any children?</p>

<p>Seriously, can you?</p>

<p>Fucking no. You can&#39;t. Because it is impossible to prove a negative. Unless you have had someone record you on video for your entire adult life, and have incontrovertible proof that this video&#39;s integrity is unassailable, then you cannot prove that you have never raped a child.</p>

<p>If someone accused you of raping a child right now, would it be your job to prove that you have never raped a child in your life, or would it be their job to prove that what they&#39;re saying is true?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone were to say, &quot;Hey, I saw ProgrammingPants doing things to children in his house.&quot; I would assume they&#39;re crazy. If another person says, &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s up to any good. He has children over at his house alot, but has no kids.&quot; I&#39;d start getting a little suspicious. If a third person says ,&quot;I saw him looking at kids with binoculars at the park.&quot; Then I start asking questions. </p>

<p>While the things I listed don&#39;t count for hard evidence or proof that you&#39;re a pedophile, does that not sound like something we should probably look into? Calling for an investigation is not a witch hunt when there&#39;s circumstantial evidence pointing in a certain direction. And they&#39;re not even giving us THAT. They blatantly said it was false claims without doing a proper investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you saw me looking at kids with binoculars at the park, a logical conclusion you could draw from this is that I am sexually attracted to children.</p>

<p>This is circumstantial evidence, and the conclusion you drew might prove to be entirely false, and sure as fuck is not enough to warrant a police investigation, but it is a logical conclusion to draw.</p>

<p>If this were to happen, and you made the claim that I am sexually attracted to children, you could use this as circumstantial evidence to back your claim.</p>

<p>Please, tell me of a single piece of &quot;evidence&quot; from pizzagate where a logical conclusion to draw is that this guy rapes, murders, and eats children in the basement of his pizza restaurant alongside the political elite during satanic rituals. And please explain to me how and why this is a logical conclusion to draw.</p>

<p>This is a legitimate request. I&#39;m assuming you have seen most or at least a lot of the evidence presented in pizzagate. I would like for you to think as critically as you can about every piece of evidence you know, and ask yourself if, based solely on this evidence, believing that this man rapes and murders children in satanic ritual is a logical conclusion to draw.</p>

<p>If you can fulfill this request, I would be either (1) legitimately impressed and genuinely change my position on this topic entirely, or (2) be bitterly disappointed in the horribly flawed logic, which you believe to be good logic, to reach this conclusion</p>

<p>If you cannot fulfill this request, then maybe you can understand my position better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. We can recap on some of the things covered in this sub. I have to preface this post by saying I believe that we are uncovering a massive elite pedophile sex ring here in the US, as well as many places globally. Not that any cannibalism is involved. </p>

<p>We can start by The Handkerchief code that was found in Podesta&#39;s emails. The code refers to keywords associated with pedophilia. <a href="http://yournewswire.com/wikileaks-pedophile-code-words-podesta/">http://yournewswire.com/wikileaks-pedophile-code-words-podesta/</a> Very strange way to be talking to someone, don&#39;t you think? But let&#39;s say it&#39;s not related to pedophilia at all. Ok.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s Comet Pizza&#39;s instagram. They sure do post interesting poses for children to be in, for being just a pizza shop. Almost looks like bondage..WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO BE A KEYWORD IN PODESTA&#39;S HANDKERCHIEF CODE! <a href="http://pedocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Taped-kid-at-Comet-Pizza.png">http://pedocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Taped-kid-at-Comet-Pizza.png</a> And for the even more strange.<a href="http://pedocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/priced-out.png%5B%5D(http://pedocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/priced-out.png)">http://pedocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/priced-out.png[](http://pedocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/priced-out.png)</a> Why would they post something like this on their instagram, if it&#39;s only a pizza shop? Ok that&#39;s kind of weird, but let&#39;s continue. Let&#39;s say that has nothing to do at all with pedophilia. </p>

<p>So none of the above is true. But wait. Comet pizza and that darn Instagram again. They post this. <a href="https://vultureofcritique.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/cpppmurderbasement.jpg?w=640&amp;amp;h=422">https://vultureofcritique.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/cpppmurderbasement.jpg?w=640&amp;h=422</a> With comments like #killroom and from JimmyComet saying things like #murder, does that not rouse your suspicion at all? Does it mean there is an elite pedo sex ring taking place here? No. But the circumstantial evidence is now beginning to stack. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that this whole fiasco WAS real. That would mean that there would have to be some sort of basement, right?  James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong, denied that they had a basement. But not too long after claimed that they use the basement to produce sauce from tomatoes. Why or how could the owner of the restaurant, simply forget about how they make their sauce and if he has a basement? Must have just slipped his mind. <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/3762538/pizzagate-news-bbc-supports-james-alefantis-but-did-they-catch-him-lie/">http://www.inquisitr.com/3762538/pizzagate-news-bbc-supports-james-alefantis-but-did-they-catch-him-lie/</a></p>

<p>So what, what&#39;s the big deal about having a basement anyway. Well, first it would mean he lied about something insignificant, which looks suspicious, and second, it would give more circumstantial evidence that a #killroom exists in the vicinity of Comet Ping Pong. But, does a basement exist? YES!</p>

<p>As you can see here, this was the original floorplan. It was listed as 2 stories. From the streetview, we see only one story. Soooo, where&#39;s that second story? Oh yeah, Alefantis ALREADY SAID he had a basement![ <a href="https://i.sli.mg/HViPml.png%5D(https://i.sli.mg/HViPml.png)">https://i.sli.mg/HViPml.png](https://i.sli.mg/HViPml.png)</a></p>

<p>So, does this prove that there&#39;s a massive global elite sex pedo ring? No. But does ANY of this seem strange to you? Doesn&#39;t ANY of this seem like it should be investigated?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you saw this conversation, <strong>without being explicitly told beforehand that the words they&#39;re using stand for pedophilia</strong>, would you assume that this is evidence that they are raping children?</p>

<p>Probably not. But you <em>are</em> explicitly told before you even read the conversation that these words stand for pedophilia, so you more readily believe that this is evidence of that.</p>

<p>Without being explicitly told from an outside source that this is evidence of them raping children and that these words they are using stand for pedophilia, you could not possibly logically conclude that they are talking about child rape.</p>

<p>In other words, if all you look at is the evidence, you don&#39;t have evidence of anything.</p>

<p>Yes, it is a weird way of talking. But it is a private conversation between two people not meant for everyone to understand. If I read every single private conversation you&#39;ve had with anyone, would I be able to understand what you&#39;re talking about at all times?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The first picture is his goddaughter, in a joke picture about keeping kids from running around the restaurant, taken two years ago, that <em>he personally uploaded to Instagram</em>.</p>

<p>But even if you had literally none of that context, and just saw the picture, does a picture of a kid held to a table with fucking masking tape that a toddler could rip, in no apparent pain or distress or anything of the sort, immediately scream to you &quot;the person who took this picture, and subsequently shared it with the public for everyone to see, rapes and murders children&quot;? </p>

<p>That is not a logical conclusion to draw.</p>

<p>As for the second picture, I would legitimately like you to explain how a posting a picture of a weird, expensive doll on Instagram is evidence that you rape and murder children in the basement of your restaurant.</p>

<p>How is the conclusion a logical thing to draw from what you have?</p>

<p>Does someone saying that there is not a basement in an establishment where there, in fact, is a basement count as evidence that he rapes and murders children alongside the political elite in said basement? Is this a logical conclusion to draw?</p>

<p>No? Well then <em>this is not evidence to back up that claim</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The question isn&#39;t &quot;does it seem strange&quot;. The question is &quot;is the allegation that he rapes and murders children alongside the political elite in satanic rituals a logical conclusion to draw from this&quot;.</p>

<p>And the answer to that question is no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#39;t ANY of this seem like it should be investigated?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should investigate things when there is evidence or a logical and rational reason to believe that a crime has been committed.</p>

<p>As I have spent this comment pointing out to you, none of what you submitted could possibly draw the logical conclusion that he rapes and murders children in the basement of his restaurant during satanic rituals.</p>

<p>So no, it should not be investigated. You should not investigate people without a logical cause to. Do you have any idea how hellish and totalitarian our country would be if the police could invade your personal life and conduct an investigation on you without even being able to produce a logical argument as to why they believe you&#39;re committing a crime?</p>

<p>It is literally in our constitution that they can&#39;t do this, and for good reason.</p>

<p>Even if the dude is raping a child <strong>right now</strong> in the basement of his restaurant, we have <em>literally nothing</em> to prove or logically conclude that, so we should not launch an investiation.</p>

<p>After all, I have no evidence that you are not raping a four year old while you&#39;re reading this comment, so <strong>even if you were</strong> I would have no basis to call for an investigation on you. Even if I believed with all my heart and soul that you were, <em>and was right</em>, I have no basis to call an investigation on you.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how free societies operate. You need facts, not feels, to investigate someone. Well, at least ideally.</p>

<p>Not being able to understand the way two people talk to each other is one thing. For they may have a specific way of saying things. You&#39;re right, we are not meant to understand. But when it pertains to a specific code involving pedophilia, and has been documented in many other cases, it&#39;s kind of hard to say that they are innocently speaking of things. And that&#39;s WHY they speak in the manner they do, so WE don&#39;t catch on. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Do you think that the child understands what is going on in that picture? To her, it&#39;s her dad just being playful and taking a picture. But there is such thing as undertone. Is it possible that there could be a meaning deeper than what we are presented with at face value? We know from The Handkerchief Code that child bondage is a real thing. How is that picture not literally a visual representation of that? Just because the dad posted? It means there&#39;s absolutely nothing else? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right. The picture of the doll isn&#39;t a direct link proving child rape and murder. Why would I include that? Like I mentioned before, it&#39;s very strange that they would post something of that nature, when the store sells fucking pizza. It would be like Apple posting a picture a picture of rollerblades. Rollerblades have absolutely nothing to do with Apple products. How is that not strange to you?</p>

<p>You suggest that we take each single piece here as it is. Does this post alone? Well of fucking course it won&#39;t indicate there&#39;s something bigger going on, if we look at JUST THE POST. That&#39;s like saying ,&quot;How can you say there&#39;s a dragon?! If we look at these toenails ALONE, how can you conclude there&#39;s a dragon, there&#39;s just toenails. Nope there&#39;s no evidence of a dragon here&quot; It&#39;s everything else in conjunction that gives it credibility. Individual pieces won&#39;t stand up, pieces together start forming the picture. You&#39;re stuck on the individual part.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, you&#39;re only focusing on one thing as evidence as opposed to the collective to support a theory. It&#39;s very easy to discredit someone on single pieces. &quot;This piece of the puzzle looks like it could fit into a picture of what might be a dragon.&quot; &quot;Nope, that piece doesn&#39;t look like a dragon. It&#39;s not a dragon&quot;</p>

<p>he question isn&#39;t &quot;does it seem strange&quot;. The question is &quot;is the allegation that he rapes and murders children alongside the political elite in satanic rituals a logical conclusion to draw from this&quot;.</p>

<p>And why exactly can&#39;t we ask, &quot;Does this seem strange?&quot; It seems like a perfectly reasonable question to me. Afterall, I&#39;ve already claimed I have no proof that these things are happening. What I am saying is that we should dig into this deeper. But just because we don&#39;t have all the pieces yet, and the picture is unclear to you, we should stop? </p>

<p>All you&#39;ve done is taken each piece at face value, without considering the others into a bigger picture and thrown them out because &quot;each piece doesn&#39;t make sense, therefore nothing is happening and shouldn&#39;t be investigated.. &quot;If that isn&#39;t the easiest way to discredit someone, I don&#39;t know what is. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But when it pertains to a specific code involving pedophilia,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Code that you are given beforehand that you have no way of knowing that the people in the conversation are using, or even know exists.</p>

<p>Your evidence isn&#39;t what was said. Your evidence is what someone, also not involved in the conversation, told you what they said meant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that&#39;s WHY they speak in the manner they do, so WE don&#39;t catch on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that I can say with some high degree of certainty, and please tell me if this is a large leap in logic, that they didn&#39;t expect their private conversation had in a private communication method to be read by us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think that the child understands what is going on in that picture?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are you automatically assuming that something nefarious is going on in the picture?</p>

<p>Notice how you&#39;re not even asking the question. You&#39;re taking it as a given fact that there is something nefarious happening with the picture, and then when you view in that light you assume that the child is just an ignorant participant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But there is such thing as undertone. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t just walk into something assuming undertone and expect to find evidence that is reflective of objective reality. If I looked through any of your social media or private conversations with the assumed undertone that you are a child rapist and murderer, I can guarantee that I would find a whole lot of &quot;&quot;evidence&quot;&quot; to prove it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible that there could be a meaning deeper than what we are presented with at face value?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s <em>possible</em> that when you posted a picture of your cat stretching on Facebook you were signaling to people that you want to fuck your cat.</p>

<p>It&#39;s <em>possible</em> that it is a cry for attention and if you don&#39;t get a certain number of likes on it you&#39;ve absolved to kill your self.</p>

<p>It is <em>possible</em> that there is a coded message in that picture that you rape and murder children.</p>

<p>Lots of things are possible. But we should not be concerned with what is merely <em>possible</em>, we should be concerned with the probable, and what can be logically deduced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know from The Handkerchief Code that child bondage is a real thing. How is that picture not literally a visual representation of that? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can only possibly be a literal visual representation of that if the picture was taken <em>explicitly</em> with the intent for the image to represent that. </p>

<p>If I take a picture of something and you claim that it looks like something <em>radically</em> different from the context or intent of the picture I took, that does not mean the picture I took represents the thing you said it looks like.</p>

<p>If I intentionally took a picture to mirror a thing, then it represents that thing.</p>

<p>If we use your criteria for what represents children being raped in bondage play by child rapists, then conceivably <em>literally any image that exists</em> of a child being restrained is a representation of child rape.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re right. The picture of the doll isn&#39;t a direct link proving child rape and murder. Why would I include that? Like I mentioned before, it&#39;s very strange that they would post something of that nature, when the store sells fucking pizza. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what you&#39;re saying is, this is not evidence to back up your claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is that not strange to you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether or not it&#39;s &quot;strange&quot; is wholly irrelevant here. We are looking, specifically, for evidence that he rapes and murders children in the basement of his restaurant. We are looking, specifically, for something from which we can possibly logically assume or deduce that he rapes and murders children.</p>

<p>With access to enough information, you can pull up a veritable mountain of things that seem &quot;strange&quot; on virtually anyone. But that does not prove, or is even count as evidence for, them raping and murdering children.</p>

<p>This is not evidence of any kind that he rapes and murders children. It is not even circumstantial evidence for that claim. But when you talk of all of the &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot; you have, this is one of the things you&#39;re talking about or thinking of. Which is just wrong.</p>

<p>Him posting an expensive doll, that is unrelated to his pizza restaurant, on Instagram counts for <em>literally nothing</em> towards substantiating the claims made against him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You suggest that we take each single piece here as it is. Does this post alone? Well of fucking course it won&#39;t indicate there&#39;s something bigger going on, if we look at JUST THE POST. That&#39;s like saying ,&quot;How can you say there&#39;s a dragon?! If we look at these toenails ALONE, how can you conclude there&#39;s a dragon, there&#39;s just toenails</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you say, &quot;look at these big ass dragon-like claws. Even though this, on its own, does not directly prove that there is a dragon nearby, it is evidence that there is a dragon because it is possible to logically deduce from this piece of evidence that there is a dragon nearby&quot;</p>

<p>You are making a logical statement.</p>

<p>If you say, &quot;Look at this instagram post that in no fashion indicates that the person who made it rapes and murders children, and it is impossible to logically even think that he rapes and murders children based off of this Instagram post. If you couple this with a bunch of shit that is <em>literally in no way whatsoever connected to this specific Instagram post</em> outside the fact that the same guy who made it is connected with that shit, this Instagram post now suddenly counts as evidence that he rapes and murders children in the basement of his pizza restaurant&quot;</p>

<p>You are not making a logical statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s everything else in conjunction that gives it credibility. Individual pieces won&#39;t stand up, pieces together start forming the picture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can form a logical connection between this Instagram post and something else, then you could present both of these things together and say that they, together, count as evidence.</p>

<p>Saying he made this Instagram post of this room like a year ago and he made an Instagram post with his goddaughter like two years ago and presenting them together as evidence and saying, &quot;Alone, neither of these things are evidence that he is raping and murdering children. But together, they are.&quot; is logically flawed. </p>

<p>And this is just an example, but a lot of pizzagate, and it&#39;s perceived credibility, is literally just a bigger version of what I just said, with more shit tacked on.</p>

<p>You say that these pieces together form a picture, but you have to logically argue and explain why these pieces belong together, how they fit together, and why they, together, form any evidence that he rapes and murders children in his basement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And why exactly can&#39;t we ask, &quot;Does this seem strange?&quot; It seems like a perfectly reasonable question to me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If all people were doing, and if all you were doing, were asking &quot;does it seem strange?&quot; I would have no problem with pizzagate whatsoever.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re not just doing that. You&#39;re accusing someone of raping and murdering children in their basement.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re going to do shit like that, accusing someone of literally some of the most heinous acts you can imagine, you need to <em>at least</em> be able to logically show how this is a sound conclusion to come to based on what you know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But just because we don&#39;t have all the pieces yet, and the picture is unclear to you, we should stop?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should definitely stop accusing someone of raping and murdering children despite not having evidence or even a logical argument backing this claim. Outside of &quot;These things which in no way indicate that he rapes and murders children are <em>strange</em>&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All you&#39;ve done is taken each piece at face value, without considering the others into a bigger picture and thrown them out because &quot;each piece doesn&#39;t make sense, therefore nothing is happening and shouldn&#39;t be investigated.. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can logically show exactly how each piece, together, with their logical connections to each other, paint a picture of a man raping and murdering children in satanic rituals, then I will hop all aboard the pizzagate train.</p>

<p>But taking a bunch of things that don&#39;t serve as evidence for a thing, and saying &quot;together they all serve as evidence for that thing tho&quot;, without explaining how, other than they&#39;re &quot;strange&quot; and there is a bunch of them, is not a logical argument or position.</p>

<p>I highly doubt I changed your mind on this. But I hope I at least got you to think about it more.</p>
