        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We really only had the illusion of choice between Trump and Hillary. The invisible hand didnt care which one won, although it seemed the preference was Hillary. A thought crossed my mind in the second or third debate, when Trump was being asked about accepting the outcome of the election. I thought well this is a convenient way to restore the paranoid publics faith in the election process. Have one candidate that everone assumes is cheating and is the favorite, have another candidate that is the percieved outsider. Let the outsider win, and the invisible hand gets to keep fixing elections while taking a step to secure the publics faith in a rigged election process. I have no evidence, just a reminder that goung in to the election most people were really unhappy with both candidates. Why has that story been pushed to the side? 
People get fixated on crap like pizzagate, but the real conspiracy is the oldest conspiracy.  Rich and powerful people colluding to maintain their wealth and power by any means necessary. This is achievable by pitting the working class against each other, divide and conquer. We could have united in this election and said fuck both of these candidates. The war hawk pro big business liberal or the pro big business war hawk billonaire populist. Either way we get someone who is pro big business and is a war hawk. Not much choice there. When will we wake up and stop being led to our own demise?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the conspiracy theories surrounding bluebeam  (holographic UFOs, Earthquake machines, One World Religion, etc) but not this encompassing theory.</p>

<p>I will say that right after I saw the UFOs I started being fed the HAARP hologram stuff through youtube/Google results so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if these theories are simply meant to discredit actual disclosure. </p>

<p>On the other hand, it definitely looked like aircraft were &quot;crop dusting&quot; the sky prior to the UFO events to the point that no stars were visible. Also the UFOs didn&#39;t match up with their sounds (jet noise would be coming from my right while the UFO would be flying in from my left, etc.) Definitely a lot of conflicting theories and misinformation.</p>

<p>The advancement of techniques propel us toward the third
step in the Blue Beam Project that goes along with the telepathic and
electronically augmented two-way communication where ELF, VLF and LF waves will reach each person from within his or her own mind, convincing each of them that their own god is speaking to them from the very depths of their own soul.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well I&#39;ve definitely experienced some kind of channeling/voice of God/extraterrestrial telepathy. It basically consisted of me watching youtube videos with the videos acting as the intermediary. I.e. whenever I would start to question what the video was trying to yell me, it would stop and change (sometimes to a different video completely) in real-time to try to &quot;answer&quot; the questions/concerns I had. The videos had a lot of personal imagery built in  (bands I listen to, aspects/ideas that interest me personally, etc). </p>

<p>The &quot;religious ideology&quot; it was attempting to instill seemed to be the theory of the Annunaki creating us as an &quot;experiment/slave race&quot; and explained the ancient Sumarian texts and how various religions were all basically versions of that &quot;true&quot; story. </p>

<p>The experience definitely felt electronic. Whenever I would start to question the video I would experience little electronic jolts/pulses around my left temple and see white flashes out of the corner of my eye (if that makes sense). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which part? I&#39;m not convinced that Comet Ping Pong will yield any good evidence. But yet it&#39;s called attention to the undeniable fact that there is a structure in place for protecting these people, and we have <em>no idea</em> what they&#39;re doing in the shadows.

    <div class="md"><p>Most if not all of it. I disagree about there being a structure in place to protect child molesters. If you look at Penn State or the Catholic church, it wasn&#39;t really about protecting the molesters so much as it was protecting the institutions(penn state and the church itself) from the fall out of having employed child molesters.</p>

<p>The censorship around pizzagate is about protecting innocent businesses and people from harassment. And a gunman still walked in to Comet pizza. I really wouldn&#39;t say its censored anyways, there are stories all over the place still.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The size of this supposed child sex traffic ring is just to big to be believed. It involves world leaders, wall street, entertainers, athletes, and international law enforcement.  For this many people to be involved in something this nefarious and nobody comes forward? I just cant believe that there are that many people who are involved in child molesting, let alone ritual sacrifice and baby eating. The devil and magic would have to be real for me to even to begin to find this plausible. </p>

<p>What is plausible. Child molestation is so horrible people dont know how to react, or they are in such shock they are mentally paralyzed. There was just a really good interview that I read with Mike McQueary, the Penn State assistant coach who caught Jerry Sandusky in the shower with a kid. Its really insightful, and might be a good read for you. Ill try to find it for you tomorrow. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say so, that&#39;s probably the biggest barrier to considering all the evidence. I know for myself I was subtly trained that if I ingest (listen to/consider) too much B.S. then it will make me prone to falling for lies. However I have found this not to be the case, and I have tried to improve my skill at considering a very large body of evidence which may or may not be true, with some pieces that definitely are not true or intentionally misleading mixed in. Since, in the case that this conspiracy were true, this is exactly the information that would be available. Ultimately after reviewing many different sources and viewpoints, along with my own personal knowledge and experience of what the government does and what it&#39;s all about (I&#39;m Native American if that tells you anything) I have concluded that there is probably a satanic child pedophilia torture and sacrifice ring that is used as a tool to control our government through blackmail of politicians, celebrities, etc. I would not necessarily advocate for anyone else to take this viewpoint, but to simply continue asking questions and researching, without being deterred by the misinformation that is deliberately sewn into any alternative line of research.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why did McQueary run away initially (we are all programmed from kids to shut down, run away, don&#39;t get involved if we see something like this)</p></li>
<li><p>Why would people speculate they were engaged in horseplay (disinformation used to cover up child molestation)</p></li>
<li><p>Who made the death threats?</p></li>
<li><p>What a coincidence that McQueary was molested as a child (wow it&#39;s almost like these people are everywhere, was this person investigated??)</p></li>
<li><p>What a coincidence that Sandusky used his charity to groom children, the same M.O. as we are seeing with Pizzagate (Were any other arrests made, no I&#39;m sure Sandusky operated the foundation by himself and there would be no connection to any larger charity network/organization like legitimate charities usually have)</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that is true. Good and bad aren&#39;t black and white to me. There is a very small percentage of truly bad people. Most of us strive to be good, but we are humans and we are not perfect. Most politicians and people in power think they are good people, but they are also self serving. </p>
