    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I never watch either.  Their ratings are probably worse than they let on.  The challenge is, most people find it hard to accept any bit of news as &#39;official&#39; until one of the MSM outlets cover it.  Even people who despise the MSM and know they are full of shit tend to sit on pins whenever breaking info comes out, waiting to see if the msm will pick it up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct... when you see what they all coordinate at the same time you can see the narrative they are being paid to push... Plus watching MSM has some benefits cause they can and will slip up live on the air quite often.

    <div class="md"><p>We have to read MSM &quot;news&quot; in order to be able to debunk it in the minds of those that still consider them to be the sole arbiters of Truth. From the days of William Randolph Hearst leading the country to war, all the way to their collapse at the feet of HRC&#39;s corrupt campaign, we must keep vigilant as long as a large percentage of Americans go by their word. </p>

<p>It has been glorious this year, though. All it took was a few &quot;little&quot; and &quot;fake&quot; independent journalists with good, honest, intelligent staffs of tiny numbers and budgets to bring this crazy cunt down. Look at some youtube channels that are just a dude with talking to his phone camera once every couple of days and see that he has 30,000 views. The world of mass corporate media has shattered. We&#39;re watching it bleed to death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made the decision a long time ago to avoid 99% of TV/movie media if possible. It&#39;s really not easy in today&#39;s world though, especially having girlfriends who want to do a movie date night and stuff like that. I used to spend maybe two to five hours a day watching TV, but maybe almost fifteen years ago I realized how much time I was wasting.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so many reasons why I avoid it. Number one, I started realizing how much advertising was getting shoved down my throat. You literally watch like 120 seconds of &quot;show&quot; to 200 seconds of advertisements nowadays, especially for popular shows like the Walking Dead. They shove as much YOU MUST SHOP NOW shit down your throat as they can without you turning off the TV. It&#39;s really unsettling to me to sit there and watch that stuff. They literally want to just convince you to spend money - that&#39;s it. I have absolutely no desire to sit and watch ads, but that&#39;s most of what you do. You spend an hour and a half to watch a forty-five minute show. And the thing that gets me is they repeat the same ad every 5 minutes! I don&#39;t understand how people tolerate that shit.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s the way to control people. The people that control the news control the public opinion. You are watching an engineered agenda. It&#39;s always been that way. They&#39;ve known since WW2 days that propaganda works wonders, and TV is the machine that made it mainstream. Nothing gets into people&#39;s heads like TV. I read somewhere that people enter into a trance somewhat like being hypnotized when they watch TV. If you look at people who&#39;ve been watching for an hour straight, you can see it. That shit penetrates deep into your consciousness.</p>

<p>But the main thing that made me quit is I had some sort of enlightened moment where I realized I had been sitting in the same place and staring at a wall for 4 hours straight without moving or saying anything. I noticed my family had been too. Something just felt sickening about that. There&#39;s so much shit to do in today&#39;s world, so much shit to learn, but I&#39;m literally spending my free time doing absolutely nothing at all, getting force fed shit I&#39;m supposed to buy and ideas I&#39;m supposed to have. I replaced half of it with productive stuff and half of it with video games. At least with games, I&#39;m doing something and my mind is engaged. I&#39;m not spacing out. I&#39;m actually thinking about how to do something, trying to figure out some strategy. I&#39;m mentally engaged. And I don&#39;t have to stop every 30 seconds and watch a commercial about laundry detergent. I didn&#39;t feel like I was getting conned into spending money.</p>

<p>These days I have my few shows like the Walking Dead and Game of Thrones, but if at all possible I will try to watch it in a way where I can avoid all advertisements. That was my compromise. I&#39;ll do my girlfriend a favor and go to a movie here and there since she&#39;s into that, but I&#39;d much rather do anything else. I think around the same time I quit watching TV I had also started learning python programming, and with all that extra time I managed. Fast forward ten years and it&#39;s my career. Maybe not directly related, but I did have a lot of extra time on my hands to do stuff like that when I stopped watching TV.</p>

<p>I really wish more people would stop spending so much time getting brainwashed by TV and start doing productive stuff. There really is a lot of opportunity in the world if you start spending two hours a day learning a new skill. For a lot of people, that time is easily available if you just stop watching TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the real danger isn&#39;t coming from the cable news networks anymore.  Its from the talk shows, the comedy news, TV series, and local news outlets who all fall in line with the MSM narrative.  The comedy news is particularly insidious because anytime it isn&#39;t accurate; &quot;its just a comedy news show, so we don&#39;t need to be accurate.&quot;  Even when people are disgusted and disinterested in cable news, these other sources on TV really re-enforce the agenda.  I also hate how in hospitals, and other public places the general public all need to go, they always play cable news. This creates the subconscious illusion that they are the defacto legitimate source for information.  Also an obvious problem is the fact that when the government wants to disseminate emergency information(say a natural disaster), they go straight to the cable news networks.  So many layers to this hellish beast of a system.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No to MSM in any form.</p>

<p>It is very clearly an awesomely powerful “weapon”, just look at this country, One side vehemently supporting a fascist, the other vehemently defending one of the most corrupt politicians of all time, both spewing lies virtually whenever their mouths are moving, and win or lose, both sides have voted against their self interests, sped up the process of dismantling the middle class and Most Americans either lapp it up, or have become so disengaged that they don’t matter.  I could go on and on, but there should be no doubt that the MSM has America in its gentle death grip.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it still is. as for myself, i enjoy watching the Sunday shows with first coffee. i have invented some interesting curse words while doing so. like today whilst trying not to puke back me espresso, watching George snuffle ass offagus. during his round table completely filled with all trump bashers. after the break, that bastard had the nerve to play the famous ike clip warning Americans of the military industrial complex. i would surmise less than 10% of his &quot;news consumers&quot; have even ever heard of Ike much less that speech. so yes...i invented about ten new ways of saying horse shit, bull shit  and  omfg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its powers are diminishing... People are looking in to things for themselves then they tell their friends and family. People are waking up...if we don&#39;t shutup it&#39;ll keep happening. Our main focus and loudness should be on saving kids of all ages from these organized rings of douchebags. Look up Ted Gunderson former fbi he connected the dots years ago!</p>
