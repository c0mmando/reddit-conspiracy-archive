        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/aSX5s">Solar wind speeds</a> the last three days.</p>

<p>Based on previous theory about earthquakes being caused by the increase or decrease of the solar wind speed, there might be another big one soon within 24-48 hrs.</p>

<p>Solar wind speeds up on December 8th 17:30:  <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20007z80#executive">M7.8 - 68km WSW of Kirakira, Solomon Islands</a></p>

<p>Solar wind speeds up at 14:30 December 8th:  <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20007z6r#executive">M6.5 - 160km W of Ferndale, California</a> </p>

<p>Solar wind speeds now tracking downward from 700 km/s to 650 km/s, so this should increase chances of something bigger than 7.9+ on the pacific rim soon based of this data.  Hopefully not, but we shall see....</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/XtlzX">6 hour data plot stops receiving data at 21:00</a>.   This happened 15 hours ago as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have concerns that something is not right at the moment as far as our weather is concerned. I don&#39;t know about anywhere else but right now in my home town (in England) it is far too warm for this time of year. The evening temperature has been in double figures two nights running. The crisp misty, icy mornings have ended for the time being. It&#39;s not normal for this side of Xmas. This is probably the wrong thread and the wrong sub Reddit for my comment but something is wrong here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most thoughts are its unlikely to see another large 7.0 range outside the initial 7.8&#39;s seismic fault zone. </p>

<p>&#39;Maybe&#39; some 6.0&#39;s in frequent area&#39;s. (nepal / japan / nz chile or Argentina). 
Or a rare stranglet like east of NY / florida or west England (5.5-4.0). (Madagascar). Simple areas where seismic activity wouldn&#39;t be expected. (moderate range nothing tops). When you get these large velocity upticks, they are sort of the beez knees. Everything that follows is really just the same energy&#39;s wave dissipating there after. (imo). </p>

<p>I believe it is basic wave distribution. Like a piano keys hammer pounding a string. The main winds brush being the hammer on the planet, and the Semitic activity that follows as the keys being played. (Would have called it string theory however)...
So ya, Trumpet theory I suppose was equally fitting :)</p>

<p>But I would guess there was a significant Schumann resonance before the earthquake in hindsight ;)</p>

<p>The big problem is their not accounting for elevated winds on days 2 and 3 of the sunspot passing, so we will have to wait for another velocity shift before anything big really takes place, and that is initially after the calming period where winds substantiate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries. I am happy people are engaging it; The more researchers there are, the more of a difference I feel like I made :)
Naturally, I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s ever going to take me seriously so the more cages I rattle the more there is a chance that a future successor will gain the services their team needs should more material like this surface and support the initial cause. </p>

<p>Lately there is an asshat selling an application in a beta phase that pissed me off significantly, being its far too soon to market and may cause far more embarrassment then it ever does purpose. </p>

<p>I specifically label this man a charlatan as its sort of an edison tesla scenario, where he is a great salesman, but I don&#39;t respect his theories. Just stolen thoughts, elaborated to the highest bidder while playing off the hard work of others. </p>

<p>To me I suppose it used to be a private idea we all shared vocally with a puristic purpose, that this user has now insulted and sullied in greed. I suppose someone had to do it at some point; Just wish it was still a community comparable idea; </p>

<p>Just be sure to come up with your own thoughts in the end. Even spiting my own aside - </p>

<p>That is whats going to lead to our species mastering this field. Not listening, but challenging others. That&#39;s my advice :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just hope Tepco (The nuclear power utility in japan) took the note that I  left them to leave extra generators onsite up the road from the previous tsunami wake path with a slight bit of seriousness. </p>

<p>I truly assume a moderate tsunami to be associated with the seismic event I am tracking; likely 70% range of the 3.11 incident; </p>

<p>I have a feeling they take my earthquake predictions more seriously then they would mention but then again I have specifically warned them about several large quakes in the past; </p>

<p>This next one isn&#39;t a large earthquake however; It is a mega quake very very comparable to the 3.11 eq; That much I am sure of, taking this (Medium) incident in california and at the soloman islands as an example of the &quot;pregaming&quot; to expect as this region begins to make its way back onto the visual disk. </p>

<p>So think NZ impact, just in Japan now; It won&#39;t be pretty at all...</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>
Seismologists will call this sun educed earthquake an &quot;aftershock&quot; of the 3.11 e.q. on record completely negating the solar influences. Hence why I have particularly outlined it as such far ahead of time (to enhance the general presentation of my initial concept). :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See the heliplots are experiencing what I called a &quot;bell ringer&quot;. </p>

<p>These are all showing the significant resonances of the primary zone impacted. (Literally echoing the initial impact of the wind shift). </p>

<p>The data gaps are essentially satellite malfunctions It could be a loss of signal as our earth based receptors struggled to get past the static energy in the upper atmosphere to read the small signals they produce. Notably these satellites displace a small ping (likely every minute). (fluctuations based on launch date and software etc). However when there is a large amount of cosmic radiation with electric properties (electrons, protons, positrons etc) in our upper atmosphere the signals between them themselves get lost in translation. If anything they aren&#39;t losses of data, but hard readings that didn&#39;t register a material finding during that period. 
they are quite notable in the extent that they show an element of heavy particle density, but we already have an idea of those factors in reference to the existing datasets post and prior the lost signals having taken place. </p>

<p>I suppose I&#39;d be more worried about the signals we can&#39;t account for, then the ones which happened in periods which we knew a g5 solarstorm was taking place. 
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/aliens-proof-evidence-facts-stars-scientists-extraterrestrial-life-et-intelligence-a7377716.html">Signals like these are far more notable:</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mind you that was a really good point with the heliplots, which is ironic because the study of the sun is known as helio-physics. It was watching the first bell ringer (prior to the Japanese earthquake) that really led me to doing eq predictions. Having noticed them in prior earthquakes, then comparing them to the 3.11, 9.0 was the primary reason I began monitoring for a seismic / solar connection. </p>

<p>What I believe is that there is a resonating wave of stimulation within solar winds; The magnetic, and electric properties competing with our own magnetosphere likely super conduct leading to an electric pulse travelling from the fluxtubes themselves (around the planet) grounding the energy deeply into our core and marma levels. I believe that once the energy is there it essentially has no grounding source and uses the weakest faults (paths of less resistance) to make its way back out to the surface. </p>

<p>This is essentially solar materials ejecting themselves from the planets core itself. Likely like two magnets rejecting each other when you press their negative together. I am not sure if it is in relationship to the magnetic or electric properties, yet I believe it is the culmination of both, which explain both the schumann resonances in the upperatmosphere *pre eq. And Eq lights *post earthquake. </p>

<p>Seismologists believe earthquake lights are from crystal layers crushing deeply within the magnetosphere; However How would that explain them above an ocean in NZ for example?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hIQaJg3lVM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hIQaJg3lVM</a></p>

<p>So that is why I sort of came out of my little shell to speak up, because initially and factually it is more likely decay products with ions are responsible for the bright bursts of energy. This underwrites seismic energy into solar energy. It won&#39;t explain all earthquakes like from fracking well sites, and extreme plate displacement like the Chinese dam in example; But it would explain why the planet seems to uptick in unison with most major incidents of solar activity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see things much differently from the traditional conspiracy theorist in most extents; Maybe I am naive however I tend to lean on most scientific communities as generally optimistic and morally compelled individuals. Like we made the A-bomb, but it was to stop a larger war in its tracks. Not kill the occupants of the entire planet. </p>

<p>More about the missile if curious :)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_Low_Altitude_Missile">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_Low_Altitude_Missile</a></p>

<p>So when I hear of haarp I consider that it may have actually had this ability but aside from testing it on occasion; (to prove proof of concept) I doubt that anyone would use it with a nefarious purpose. I also feel that chemtrails our our way of reinforcing a known / dying planet, and that is why they themselves are a conspiracy. </p>

<p>It would make more sense for them to be distributing materials into the upper atmosphere to enhance its stability, then to simply be harming people. For the most part we have an epic amount of tools in light of death and destruction which are far more optimal for the job. So with that in mind, I always saw it as a situation where the real truth was that were now attempting to save the planet from advanced carbon emissions, and decaying ozone levels, which are nearly depleted in some areas of earth hence the pm10 particulate, and smog in china, and the recent releases of methane now dominating aerial studies; It&#39;s no conspiracy that we are living within the Holocene extinction. While it may or may not be humanities time to go; We really aren&#39;t leaving an amazing foundation for our future selves, and I don&#39;t see a reason for us to be hiding anything greater then our current problems from the general public; As when you take into account all the factors in which we are harming ourselves there really isn&#39;t much of an argument that, extinction isn&#39;t anything other than exactly where we are heading. </p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t know that we have a nuclear based rocket that can release multiple payloads of dirty radiation over selected areas by automated control, that is capable of flying for multiple years, without need for manned intervention. So thinking that we would cause an intentional earthquake and anger our international counterparts / communities; When in hindsight using a single multi tipped nuclear weapon would be so much more efficient in reducing the global population in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will not even remotely claim to have the understanding of this subject on your level, but I enjoy reading your analysis on the subject. </p>

<p>I understand the frustration with seeing someone bastardizing the theories. You will always have people like that looking to make a dollar off of others hard work and dedication. Try not to let them get you down. You are doing great things and I hope it continues to grows in an organic and beneficial way. </p>

<p>Keep doing what you do and to hell with the asshat! They are a dime a dozen and in the end will fall by the wayside! </p>
