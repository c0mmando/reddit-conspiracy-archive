       Pizzagate is not connected to any elite pedo scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       To lump pizzagate with a actual scandal or case that took place and has testimony, it straight retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Franklin scandal involved alot of high powered politicians and even the whole republican national convention. Alot of people involved still to this day have never been named..
      </p>
      <p>
       But no connection to pizzagate, same with every other scandal that has witnesses and victims. Its just wrong knowing what these kids went threw.

       I'm not discounting past cases with witness testimony. I'm just stating that thinking these are completely isolated incidents isn't taking into account the whole picture. Maybe the franklin scandal only entrenched their beliefs that they can't leave anyone alive, therefore no current witnesses. Just my opinion though.

       According to a fucking magazine. And the emails are the heart of it..
Im not saying there isnt shady shit going down. Just saying pizzagate sounds retarded and half the "evidence" needs to be dismissed because its very circumstancal and out of context. 
And your basing these opinions on chan threads. 
We all know how reliable that is.

       Im basing it on wikileaks, the own guy's fucked up instagram, and the fact that Jeffrey Epstein and Laura Silsby are convicted child traffickers/rapists and didn't even have to spend a year in jail combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think Jeffrey Epstein worked alone? Knowing 100% that 100s of high profile people flew to his rape island on the "lolita express". The victims that got him convicted also named others like Prince Andrew. Why hasn't there been an investigation?

       When i learned about prince andrew i was pissed that this isnt bigger news.
I agree with you 95%.
Pizzagate came from the wikileaks podesta series emails.
The weird phrasing of pizza in the emails led researchers to look for pizza links into the cliton campaign. Then it just started spiraling into 100 different directions.

       Exactly. Pizzagate isn't really even like a conspiracy about a specific event like 911 or Sandy Hook. It's just a sprawling, decades old, drip of information. Slight glimpses behind the curtain. They're spirit cooking behind there dude....

       I've seen the idea floated around that Comet Ping Pong and the Podestas' art collection could be used for money-laundering. But it's important to point out that pizzagate is an investigation and not a claim of any proof of guilt. Most of the people supporting pizzagate, myself included, are simply saying that there's enough evidence to make us question what these people are involved with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedophile rings at the highest levels of government do sound preposterous on the surface, and cases such as the Franklin Scandal, the Dutroux Affair, Jimmy Saville, and Lt. Col. Michael Aquino simply show the average citizen that pizzagate is not unprecedented and it's not as crazy as we'd like to think. Is pizzagate directly linked to any of the aforementioned cases or individuals? Maybe, maybe not. But at the very least, we need to be aware of them and keep them in mind because they are at least relevant to the topic at hand

       Glad you mentioned aquino. He is the godfather of psychological operations. And he is someone that completely disappeared after the 90s. Ive tried to find current info on him but nothing yet. The thing with your cases that you mention, there were no rumors or investigations till people started making accusations. Then it became something that was quickly covered up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now im not saying saying its not true till it happens, but we went too far already. Our investigation is compromised. I dunno i just give up. Its fucking disgusting around here lately, and the fact they pulled that false flag on us with the gunman is scary. Feel like this pizzagate shit will eventually bring a end to this sub, or worse. I dont want to be targeted. But seems like the more i speak out about pizzagate being a psyop, more im being called a shill.

       No, that is not what pizza gate is about. You have idea what you are talking about. Not even close. DC is just the tip of the iceberg of evidence being dug up. This not going to go away.

       Haiti for one, several Clinton human trafficking relations including the mysterious murder of a independent investigator a few weeks back who was looking into it. Note the Haiti Childrens office across the street from Comet also linked to the same people.

      <p>
       Hawaii as well, these people own property there, including a school and what appears to be an underground pot farm and the cheesebay (actual name) child porn online shop.

      <p>
       And don't forget Lolita Island, just a short distance from Haiti.

       Okay so in your world, there are no pizzagate victims that we know of. That is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, your definition of PG is wrong.  PG is not "anything to do w/ podesta or alefantis."
      </p>
      <p>
       PG is a conspiracy of the elite to abuse, rape, torture, and murder those amongst us whom nobody cares about.  They do it for money, power, and control over those who govern them and us.  These people operate in the shadows and in code.  Their code involves many words and phrases, like pizza.  In order to have plausible deniability for using their code words they do shit like buy pizza shops.

       No, that is your made up definition in order to cover for the fact there is nothing to pizzagate. You can't just redefine terms when things don't go your way. Child exploitation was around long before pizzagate. Don't try to mislead people for your own selfish purposes.

       Dog, pizzagate is real.  I have never redefined my terms. My definition is a much more accurate definition of PG when compared to yours.  If you don't believe it go post about some other conspiracy you care about, don't try and dissuade people from talking about a conspiracy on the conspiracy subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm encouraging discussion and investigation.  I care about these kids.  I think if there's even a .000000000001% chance of PG being real it should be taken seriously because I care about these kids.
       <em>

       Absolutely not. I'm the guy who said 9/11 was Hegelian Dialectic and paved the way for them to spy while giving a false sense of protection. I'm also the guy who says if you believe the global elite will allow the common joe to decide the leadership of the richest and most advanced country on the planet, by filling in bubbles next to names printed on paper, that you're an idiot. I'm also the guy who says it is
       <strong>
        dumb as fuck
       </strong>
       to believe that puppets of the global elite are going to arrest, indict and convict their puppet masters based on reddit and 4chan posts.

      <p>
       But you? I bet
       <strong>
        YOU'RE

       the guy who throws logic and reason out the window.
       <strong>
        YOU'RE

       the guy that probably would go to a pizza shop waving a gun but end up shooting himself in the face because he's dumb as fuck.
       <strong>
        YOU'RE

       the guy that can't seem to grasp critical reading and is a testament that education in the U.S. does

       Have you read all the facts on PG?  Are there any major ones you would care to dispute? And I mean real facts not the fucking strawmen the MSM and internet puppets are spewing.  When was the last time the NYT interviewed some crazed DC gunman?  Does that seem normal to you?  When was the last time you saw a massive coordinated media assault on a subject? Have you seen any news stories that prove that PG is fake news without calling it fake news because it's obviously fake?

       I've pretty much read everything while the emails were coming through and when people started putting things together. I knew things started to go to shit when I was cussed out, in this very forum, for saying the image below looked like a slice of cake and not like a pizza.

       As for anything I would like to dispute, well it's on the people presenting the evidence to show that there is a crime. So my first question is where is the proof of wrongdoing/crime? Any video evidence? Any audio evidence? Any images? Any ledgers? Did anyone actually break ranks and come forth? How do we know pizza  is code name for something sexual and not playstation 4, reddit, knives and forks, Madonna, Jesus Christ or [insert whatever you want]? Did anyone actually tell us what these words mean or did someone on 4chan and reddit say the FBI said this or that?

       I answered this yesterday night. If I am being charged with a crime I'm not saying shit. The only time I will speak is when I am asked if I understand my rights after I've been mirandized.
       <strong>
        Afterwards, when they start talking, I'm asking for a lawyer and I'm keeping my mouth shut.
       </strong>
       I'm not answering questions, not giving interviews, etc. But this guy? He's an actor or has connects to acting via his father right?

       Shit every time a black man is gunned down by a policeman there is a massive coordinated media assault to make it seem like he is a criminal, like the cop absolutely feared for his life, can do no wrong,  etc.

       Absolutely. Yesterday someone posted a link where a news outlet, I can't remember which one, completely crushed PG. I saved it on my iPad and will link it later.

       I don't think anyone has claimed that they're related, and if they have, they probably don't have any (even circumstantial) evidence to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason they're brought up is to refute the shill/mainstream assumption that elites are somehow above pedophilic corruption.

       In fact, the "lumping" you're talking about is what happens to us, when MSM brings up "flat earthers" before even mentioning pizzagate.
