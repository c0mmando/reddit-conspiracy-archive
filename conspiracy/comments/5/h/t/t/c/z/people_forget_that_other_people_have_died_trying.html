        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Look this is more of a shit post and rant more than anything.</p>

<p>But I just wanted to hammer home that feeling of disgust I get when I think of the average person, reading this stuff about pedophile trafficking rings, government corruption, HUGE covers ups..(911)(kind of a big deal) and just being so neutral about it. Just so blaze blah and hoping someone is going to risk their life to post the truth they are looking for.</p>

<p>Not the truth, but the truth they are looking for. Thats another topic on its own but it seems like the pizzagate community have moved on to more productive boards where people will focus and actually try to contribute more than an emotional opinion on the matter. The enemy plan of divide and conquer slowly working thanks to shill efforts.</p>

<p>And most that are left are trying to figure the story out for themselves but sort of sit here expecting reddit to not be filtered and censored, it is to a certain degree but conspiracy is still a realm of free speech. </p>

<p>Just don&#39;t expect the hub of the investigation to be reddit, I&#39;m sorry it just wont be. It&#39;s too public to do any serious real time sensitive investigation work. Don&#39;t limit yourself by only consulting 1 source of information. That&#39;s how they win. We are divided and not united in our efforts.</p>

<p>Most of all these inferences and guesswork is based on information that people should WANT to know about. we SHOULD want to know all about our government and its dirty laundry, about human trafficking in all forms, about government plans to program society towards a certain vision that a few people think we deserve.</p>

<p>And people gave their lives trying to continuously expose fraud and corruption of all humanity across many topics. It is a direct insult to all those lives to just casually go on about our day with the amount of injustice going on in the world. It&#39;s why the media doesn&#39;t report the bad shit happening half the time so we stay in our hamster wheel and just keep on spinning.</p>

<p>People are so ready to let other people do the work for us. Please investigate for me. Please report to me who the bad guys are. Please tell me who to hate and who is my ally. No critical thinking to determine these things themselves. Willing happily to let someone else shoulder that burden. No wonder it was so easy to trick people. How else can something like WACO happen and no one gets in trouble on the side of the police and FBI hostage team? 30 children burned alive in the name of saving children. HOW CAN YOU BUY THAT BULLSHIT?!?!</p>

<p>The burden that people are tortured, raped, and killed every day, adults and children. All the horrors of the world, but noone wants to leave their safe bubble for fear of not knowing how to help and feel helpless because of it. </p>

<p>They want us to feel helpless. </p>

<p>To feel that we can&#39;t control the destiny of this country. EVERY person has the opportunity to change the destiny of this country. Whether you act upon it is your own decision to live with. </p>

<p>We are all on the same side. Our enemy is the people actively trying to enforce their world view on our lives. We have been the followers too long because the guiding hand that we used to follow was leading us towards a cage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now I hadn&#39;t wanted to mention pi44agate, but in my demand to be informed it is most troubling that not a single fucking media outlet speaks of the amount of dead journalists in the 17 years after 9 eleven.  Or scientists. Or doctors. Acedamia, journalism, and the medical field have been dying out. Then have the nerve to invent fake news and smear independent media.  This pizzagate media blitz focuses a few in close proximity to my day to day reading. </p>

<p>RIP Max Spiers  d.2016 (although he was a conspiracy theorist he was a very popular one, UFOs, US military child p<em>do rings *AQUINO</em>, supersoldiers, the works. His text message to his mother is what is striking &quot; your boys in trouble, if something happens, investigate me&quot; , his mother mentioned he was investigating the political connection to the occult)</p>

<p>RIP Michael Hastings d.2013 (Rolling Stone contributing editor, and author of numerous books. I recommend &quot;I Lost My Love in Baghdad&quot; Said to have been on to something sinister w politicians and celebrities w black magic and the occult. And after his article w Gen.  McCrystal. His Mercedes was hacked and he died at 100+ mph in LA. 4 years before this pizzagate story even broke) </p>

<p>Adding to that Veteran journalist Seymore Hersh just broke that he has found members of Knights of Malta and Opes Dei in the highest echelons of American&#39;s military.  He hasn&#39;t been killed yet the story broke a few days ago. </p>

<p>RIP (in hell lol) Andrew Brietbart  d2012 (after calling out podesta the molesta over twitter the alt-right newsman that has a 45 mil + following was found dead crossing the street of a heart attack ( Google: Church Committee hearings, officially known as the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities: Heart attack gun) His coroner was poisoned w arsenic 2 days later.  (hate him but they did break a massacre in Mexico where the mayor cooked people in ovens. Verified thru Mexican media) His office was taken over  effectively destroying his alt right followers credibility and smearing them as nutjobs.  (Lol no offense we&#39;ve been labeled the same )</p>

<p>RIP Seth Rich d. 2016 ( supposed DNC leaks whistleblower)</p>

<p>RIP Aaron Schwartz d.2013 ( released MIT files in 2011 purported to have found child p**n in their servers. Threw the book at him and was facing charges of felony wire and computer fraud. Agreed to plea bargain of 6mo.s was suicided two days after) this dude helped create the RSS feed y&#39;all know and love today.</p>

<p>RIP Monica Peterson d. 2006 (financial journalist in haiti investigating the clinton foundation for finances and found child trafficking instead. killed day after election)</p>

<p>All whom were investigating &quot;some type of occult dark black magic w leaders and politicians including trafficked minors&quot; during different times in the past 10 years and were either suicided or murdered or natural cause murdered.  I read the news religously and at one point or another i have read thier different articles respectively on lots of subjects aside from the exposé in question. I respect journalism. I respect the documentaries, the historians, the messengers. I praise documentation so much bc as a whole ours was stolen and hidden from us. So I know suppression of information is real. I know the heinous history behind the massacres and heads on stakes bloodbaths in the name of conquer and control inside the US. We see it globally and collectively together on demand even now. syria/iraq/libya/yemen. We see the bloodshed in our own back yard. baltimore/ferguson/nyc/stl/nola/detroit/chicago/miami What makes &quot;Americans&quot; so special that they wouldnt do it to you?  Or lie to you? </p>

<p>Back to the issue at hand. This &quot;nonsense&quot;, I just ask, plead really, that instead of dismissing it read a few articles. Its hitting the mainstream media, does that make it anymore a possibility or make it anymore real or fake? Thats the beautiful thing about critical thinking.  It allows you to read a different opinions than your own. Read news from the opposition, know your enemy BC they sure as hell know you.  On all realms of passion, love the environment ? Read some texas permium basin news for some fucked up shit. Information is out there. If I had four bones and another dog came and left, now I have 3 bones. It doesn&#39;t take a Lassie to figure out who took my bone. Who took my journalism? Who killed my journalists? 
There have been 1000 journalists all over the world that have died in 2016 alone. </p>

<p>I felt like ranting too it seems. I&#39;m truly heartbroken about the state of affairs. I really like news.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right on. </p>

<p>The biggest problem I see is lack of patience combined with anti-intellectualism:</p>

<p>&quot;If you can&#39;t sum this up in two short sentences, it&#39;s obviously extremely complex and I really don&#39;t have time to pick up a new hobby in <em>questioning things</em>.&quot; Or similar.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard not to notice that the rise in this attitude to the world has happened at the same time of instant-gratification spending culture and media narratives.</p>
