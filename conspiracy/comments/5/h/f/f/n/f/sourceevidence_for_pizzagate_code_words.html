       You won't get an answer. Instead, you'll get a link to the "handkerchief code" on wikileaks and "cheese pizza" on urban dictionary.

       I've been asking for a long time now and all you get is downvotes and being ignored. They love to tell stories that coincide with their expectations and absolutely do not care about truth. So what if they're destroying a man's reputation and livelihood! He's gay, anyway! And a friend of the Clintons! He deserves anything he gets for that alone!

       I'm not saying you or anyone is wrong.  But it seems to me that in years of law enforcement investigation, journalism investigation and psychological study of pedophiles, there would just have to be evidence here in the real world inside the pages of books, official documents, online discussion.  Something at all aside form personally going to the dark web yourself to have a look.

       Agreed!  I became aware of this a few weeks before the election, so I am not an expert.  I wish an expert from law enforcement in CP would post here so we can ask questions.  I also wishan expert in the occult would also post here.

       That would be great.  If people really want to call themselves part of a "citizens investigation" they need to hold themselves to the absolute highest ethical level of standard and demand proof and evidence for everything they see and read regarding this.  Because if you advance incorrect information you end up doing the opposite of what you set out to do and you instead play a role in discrediting possible true aspects.

       Yes, we should be better than the media.  It is why I like posting on Reddit.  There is always someone that knows more or has a different point of view.  Over time, the truth comes out.  It just takes time.

       I agree the truth will eventually come out.  Advancing false information does likely slow it down though.  Even if 3/4 of an investigation's evidence is absolutely true, the mainstream will cherrypick the 1/4 of poorly researched evidence to discredit you.

       If this stuff is true widespread in the government, then they will protect themselves and cover it up.  They control law enforcement and the courts, so they can get away with it.  They know it, too.

       People were saying this is an FBI list of code words. That is obviously not true. As far as verification of the code words, there isn't any verification...and unless you're looking at child porn yourself, I doubt you have any idea what's on the dark web.

       The FBI very well may know of code words used by pedophiles and have them classified.  But that doesn't help us here any because we don't know them.  The next best thing to official documents would be demonstrations of provable real world use.  Also it would be helpful to see any published articles and/or books about pedophilia that state these codewords.  You would think that this evidence would be easily presentable if it were true.  But again, I'm not saying anyone is wrong.  But I cannot believe anything without evidence.

       You're absolutely right. I only harp on the FBI list because that was what people were saying for the longest time and many still believe it. Amazing how many people just accept a story without questioning such things. I mean, wow. This is the basic premise. It must be really easy to fool these people into believing anything...think about religion and politics. Scary.

       I think that it's very easy to make the mistake of accepting unproved facts because there are a high number of very unusual things about all of this.  The Spirit Cooking emails, the Jeffrey Epstein connection, the strange deaths surrounding the Clinton Foundation, the large amount of highly bizarre artwork, the number of Podesta emails that do seem to be speaking in code, the logos that do seem to coincide with FBI pedophile symbols, etc.  There is a lot of strange stuff that begins to paint a picture.  And people want to do their part to expose it and sometimes fall for unproven points along the way.  It happens but it should be diligently fought against.

       The thing about all those unusual things is they are not unusual to me. I see logical explanations for pretty much everything you listed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two things I do want to comment on are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Jeffrey Epstein - this is disturbing, but not so unusual considering Epstein apparently knows everybody. Epstein is certainly well-connected to the Clintons (his girlfriend who took sexy photos of underage girls was at Chelsea's wedding after Epstein got busted and we all know Clinton flew Lolita Express many times), but that doesn't mean anyone who knows the Clintons is guilty. Especially pizza "code words" at a pizza shop. Like Alex Jones said, "pizza is a super-common word!" and "[James Alefanti] might well be innocent for all we know!"
        </p>
       </li>

         strange deaths surrounding Clinton Foundation - yes, definitely...so why are we getting distracted with Comet Ping Pong? Clintons are the ones who needs to be investigated. There is a lot more substantial evidence about them in all the information we have up to this point than anything about Comet Ping Pong.

       Ask the FBI then.  The FBI hosts a lot of CP on the dark web to catch people.

       You want verification, and I told you where to find it.  It is up to you to look or not.

       There was an image on 4chan that someone posted.  A screenshot from a forum they found.  This was before the election, and I have no idea how to find it again.  It was enough for me, though...

       But, now I imagine you have to look harder because any searches should turn up "pizzagate" information, which proves nothing about pizzagate.

       It is better to ask a legitimate source at this point, but I do not know who.  I suggested before to ask law enforcement, but that might be a bad idea now that I think about it.  They will be suspicious of you.  Maybe ask a lawyer that specializes in these cases, especially computer related.  He or she should be familiar with the terminology used, and lawyers are bound by attorney-client privilege.

       Well a real true serious investigator or journalist could simply contact experts on pedophilia.  Whether they are a current or retired FBI agent.  A journalist or psychologist who studies pedophilia.  Or perhaps a private investigator who has experience in studying the field.  Or hell, even someone who is an actual pedophile.  There's got to be a reformed pedophile who could answer these questions.

       That's the evidence that I would like to see.  A code word list from the FBI or other law enforcement agency.  Or a book about studying pedophilia that lists them. Literally anything for evidence or proof.  In the years and years of law enforcement and psychological study of pedophilia you would think that there would have to be some evidence somewhere other than personally going to the dark web to look.

       If Podesta would simply explain what he meant by "Ps. Do you think I'll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta"  Unfortunately the code words is currently the ONLY sensible conclusion to this ridiculous statement found in the leaked emails.  But I welcome any other possible explanations of course...

       No, I already said I disagree with that and was downvoted for it. As I said before, it sounds like carb/energy related. Like something I would email my wife. Basically interpreted as "do you think I will play dominos better with a belly full of cheese pizza or pasta?" People do play dominos while drinking and eating casually, especially at a ping pong place. As soon as you introduce one game, people start playing other games. They play dominos and cards at the local beer garden by me.

       Oh I see.  And I'm sure those investigating the pizza gate thing suspiciously died (Andrew Breitbart, Monica Peterson) because Podesta was having an internal debate on how to improve his dominos game based on what carb he chose.  Riiiiiiiiiighhhhhht.

       I searched my local area using google for an attorney that specializes in child sex crimes and child pornography.  There are several, but I do not know them personally.  I will have to see how I can ask them about the code words without being billed for it.  LOL.

       Does anyone here have better connections to an attorney that specializes in these cases?

       That would be a perfect person to ask.  If I were seriously investigating this as a journalist I would probably email dozens of these types of lawyers and specialists. Honestly I would email as many as I could find.  They don't have to be local to you.  Just email.  Short and sweet.  Simply sk if there are code words that pedophiles use to covertly communicate with each other.

       I don't know what CTR is.  I genuinely want to know the source for the code words.  I am open minded and want to see the evidence.  The podesta emails are very strange for sure.  I want to see real world examples, evidence and sources for these pedophile code words being used.

       That's the conclusion I'm coming too as well unless real world evidence can be presented.  There are plenty of highly strange things that are facts about all of the wikileaks emails and pizzagate.  But the so called code words do not seem to be grounded in solid presentable evidence as of right now.

       I almost never agree with Alex Jones, but I agree with him on Pizzagate: it's a distraction and it's pretty sad that it was so easy to manipulate people into getting caught up in this. There is so much more in the Podesta emails to investigate and there are definitely pedophile ties to the Clintons and pay to play and the Clinton Foundation should be invetsigated...but they won't be because a bunch of fools fell for pizzagate instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the same thing that happened with the 9/11 Investigation. A bunch of kooks came up with really absurd claims not based in reality and made the whole truther movement look nuts when it counted. After the judgement was made by the general population, it didn't matter anymore that the majority thinks something is fishy with 9/11; it was cemented in public opinion. The same thing is going to happen with the Podesta emails. People are going to say condescendingly: "oh, you're a pizzagater?" without any clue what all is in the Wikiemail dump.

       Yeah, cheese pizza. But all you have are people talking about pizza, pasta, and cheese. Not very shocking. You know what

       means? Maybe you should search all the wikileaks emails for

       and

       Yes, that's a well known joke based on the initialism CP, it's not a secret code. And if it was "cheese pizza" doesn't come up in relation to Podesta and co.

       How about you answer instead of talking about CTR again like an idiot? Or, if it was ever answered, link to that answer. Maybe sticky the answer. Because there is no answer.

       Definitely agree the emails are very strange and suspicious.  As is Podesta's artwork and the spirit cooking and the Abramovic connections.  The restaurant logos.  Lots of strange and suspicious things.  But no proof of anything.  It should be paid thoughtful attention to and investigated - but in a way that threatens, harasses and bothers nobody.

       What I'm saying is that your advice to search around on the dark web for CP related materials is not well advised.  No doubt people will find things that enrage them, and give them bias for this topic though.

       Understood, but that is my point.  It is not possible to provide proof of this crime without committing this crime.  You can search text only, but I do not want to do it.  Nobody here wants to do it.
      </p>

       We need to figure out who the expert is in law enforcement for CP and ask them.  That would be the best and safest way.

       Sorry, nope.  Why wouldn't any law enforcement agency, anywhere in the world produce this information as a way for parents and concerned individuals to beware of these things?  It's false on its face.  There would be alerts from police in France, or their FBI equivalent.  Maybe a document from police in Japan, or any western european country if this were indeed some well-known pedo language.  This FBI document was produced supposedly in 2007, so where is any other document, from anywhere in the whole world, and from a reliable source like law enforcement in the last 10 solid years?  Or do law enforcement agencies now just allow all of this to go on without ever alerting the public?  This is supposed to be a world-wide phenomenon, not just something on the east coast of the USA.

       I became aware of this issue two weeks before the election when people started asking about the strange language in certain Podesta emails. I was looking to see if Hillary was sharing classified information.  When people started mentioning children, I thought it was crazy.  I still do.

       I am not the expert in any of this, but there has to be someone out there in law enforcement that is...  I am willing to look, but I also have a full time job.

       I find this to be an honest assumption though:  Whic is more likely, that a huge elite satanic child abduction ring exists and is being run out of a pizza restaurant, or since Assange is missing, and these documents are not verifiable (documents that hinge on the whole thing being legit) this is all a ruse that blew up in order to hide the proven corruption of the Clinton foundation and the complicity of many Clinton insiders?  The public has a short attention span.  Just watch as this scandal fizzles and the Clinton's are never charged with anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think there is a lot more validity in the latter.

       When I first heard of this, I thought it was crazy and people were making shit up.  Then someone posted a link to Conspiracy of Silence on youtube.  That was an eye opener.  There are also other documentary videos on youtube about this issue (see below).  So, I think it is likely that children are being abducted by powerful people and used for sex.  I see the same patterns and behaviors being described in these videos.

       You are right, the public does have a short attention span, but we can communicate with each other easily.  This does not have to die if we keep pushing for change.  Soon, Trump will be in the White House and the Republicans will have both houses of Congress. The Democrats will not be able to interfere with the investigation.  If the Republicans cover this up, then we will know that they are also involved.

       I provide this video because they are more open about what they do even though it is illegal.  You can get some insight into how they keep things going without police interference.  You can also get some insight into how they find boys.  For example, one man operates a kite shop because he knows that young boys love to fly kites.  That way, he does not have to go searching for young boys.  They come to him...  Young boys in American love pizza and ping pong, but it would be inappropriate for me to jump to any conclusions, so I won't.

       There's enough real stuff without these crazy panics that keep on happening. In the UK we had this happen too many times, crazed tabloid outrage that led to things like a paediatrician being abused (really). But that's tabloids, they like angrying people up to sell papers.

      <p>
       Actually this does make me wonder about all the sites and YouTube channels 'reporting' on this. Some frequently talk up how they're in danger and fake threatening emails, and they're getting money for all this. It's like the fake stories during the election campaign that people spread to make money.

       How many children go missing in Britain each year?  In the US, it is estimated to be about 800,000.

       It's not 800,000, you're getting confused by how they calculate these things. When you see a shocking looking statistic it only takes a quick search to check it out. I mean that would be greater 10% of all children going missing annually.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Just 115 of the 797,500 children were subject to what Finkelhor and his co-authors define as a "stereotypical" kidnapping - that is, they were abducted by a stranger and detained overnight, perhaps permanently, or taken at least 50 miles away.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And those aren't all permanently missing, and old numbers when this has been on the decline.

       The way the stats are reported in the UK is the same, so I can't be bothered to dig through and find the real total (and I like to be up to date). But some old reports suggest that the UK equivalent to the that 115 for the US is 20~.

       Yep.  The "FBI" document was brought to light only after Assange went missing.  That same FBI document comes from 2007.  It's been almost ten years and no other similar document from another agency has been found. Hmmm.

       Right.  But wikileaks isn't wikileaks without assange.  Assange was already taken, and the site compromised.  In the following few days, his DMS went off, and if you'll recall there were internet outages and DDoS attacks in every major city on both coasts, all day long.

       Who knows.  If it was, why wouldn't there currently be a database online anywhere with these symbols from the FBI, or new ones as they emerge?  You know, for public safety?  It's been 10 years, that document was dated 2007.  Wouldn't there be something with a half-dozen of these same symbols corroborating it all?

       Yes I have seen that.  It's the closest thing to proof that I have seen.  But it could be completely made up and fabricated.  She has all of the addresses and so forth blocked out.  In order to have real evidence and proof that will be taken seriously there needs to be many many examples and the addresses cannot be blocked out.  For all we know someone just made that up off the top of their head and typed it up.

       Is it not possible his code words were for drugs? Or something else? I used code words at my work like "hey did you paint this weekend?' "Yes i did a lot of painting" refering to cannabis

      <p>
       With him being a "foody" it would be logical to cover something say like cocaine which i know is quite prolific among people with high powered jobs. That and hes awfully skinny for someone who likes a lot of pasta and pizza. I'd expect him to be like his bro.

       I agree the truth will eventually come out.  Advancing false information does likely slow it down though.  Even if 3/4 of an investigation's evidence is absolutely true, the mainstream will cherrypick the 1/4 of poorly researched evidence to discredit you.

       The thing about all those unusual things is they are not unusual to me. I see logical explanations for pretty much everything you listed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two things I do want to comment on are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Jeffrey Epstein - this is disturbing, but not so unusual considering Epstein apparently knows everybody. Epstein is certainly well-connected to the Clintons (his girlfriend who took sexy photos of underage girls was at Chelsea's wedding after Epstein got busted and we all know Clinton flew Lolita Express many times), but that doesn't mean anyone who knows the Clintons is guilty. Especially pizza "code words" at a pizza shop. Like Alex Jones said, "pizza is a super-common word!" and "[James Alefanti] might well be innocent for all we know!"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         strange deaths surrounding Clinton Foundation - yes, definitely...so why are we getting distracted with Comet Ping Pong? Clintons are the ones who needs to be investigated. There is a lot more substantial evidence about them in all the information we have up to this point than anything about Comet Ping Pong.
