    <div class="md"><p>As another commenter pointed out, these terms have been used for likely decades. It seems it&#39;s part of their encoded language to slip suspicion.</p>

<p>John and Tony Podesta likely became really big into cooking, and made their dinner hosting events famous so they could use that as a cover when pursuing their real interest, the other kind of pizza. I&#39;d say this theory is more valid than some arse creating <em>fake news</em> as a joke. (Fake news is a blatant propaganda tactic.)</p>

<p>A big part of the problem in seeking justice is that the vast majority of people like us are not aware of the intricacies of their practices, language, &#39;events&#39; (hot tubs, spirit cooking, seriously wtf is that?!) and communication protocols - nor do we want to be, that shit is probably nightmare inducing. This kind of stuff is inconceivable to most of us. I feel real sympathy for FBI agents tasked with gathering this evidence, but somebody has to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think our government spent $65,000 to fly hot dogs and pizza to the white house for one private party? I mean, even if let&#39;s say it&#39;s an average of $20 per item, that would still be over 3,000 hotdogs and pizzas for one private party. Or that someone was missing Podesta&#39;s hot dog stand in Hawaii?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s far more debatable what the code is actually code <em>for</em>, if some want to say drugs or prostitutes, but trying to debate that it&#39;s not code at all is a bit weak. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to believe, to be honest with you. There have been other cases (like actual cases and not just civilian investigations) of sadistic pedo rings being uncovered where government was involved, either partaking or covering up. So it&#39;s not like the notion is &quot;crazy&quot; or &quot;impossible&quot; to me, and then combined with my own trauma, my mind jumps into protective mode at the thought that kids might be getting hurt like that. </p>

<p>But I admit you are right, it is more logical and likely explanation that it was just a matter of wasteful spending, and the person writing the email likely felt that way since they specifically mentioned &quot;taxpayer money&quot; which is makes it even more likely that it was just wasteful spending, given the tone used by the person who wrote the email.</p>

<p>Thank you for debating with me in a respectful way. It does help me to calm down a bit and think more clearly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that you&#39;re not actually looking for truth, you&#39;re looking to have your beliefs confirmed; and you&#39;re in with a crowd that will endlessly find wriggle room. This entire thing was dreamed up by shitposters, there is nothing to even vaguely indicate a specific crime was committed; and more is invented each day through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</a>. How can you find truth in that?</p>

<p>Every voat user could be given free reign in Comet Ping Pong with pneumatic drills and the response would be &quot;coverup!&quot; &quot;shills!&quot; and some new tangent.</p>

<p>By the way, the Pentagon thing was 5,200 people who were subscribed to CP sites, that&#39;s in total. Because a few had .mil emails or addresses they were checked for DOD connections (employees or contractors, and not just Pentagon) by the DCIS and 264 had such a connection. There are details + lengthy reports linked to in this article - <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/upshot/pentagon-declined-investigate-hundreds-purchases-child-pornography.html">https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/upshot/pentagon-declined-investigate-hundreds-purchases-child-pornography.html</a> .</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re projecting here. I&#39;ve been completely willing to acknowledge it when someone proves I am wrong. But I know a lot of skeptics try to paint all of us who are interested in the investigation with one brush. I don&#39;t know if maybe because there <em>are</em> people who are interested that scream &quot;shill&quot; at the top of their lungs when anyone questions anything, and I&#39;m willing to admit when I am wrong, if that is somehow setting off some go for the throat response, or something.</p>

<p>And maybe you need to get off your own high horse, as well. Looking at your own post history, I see you are trying to insist that multiple cases like this were fake, including the Franklin scandal, where you link wikipedia as your proof that it was a hoax, even though the wikipedia page just says that grand jury <strong>suggested</strong> that the abuse stories originated from a vindictive employee, and also it is assumed that it was a hoax just because that grand jury interviewed the witnesses and then decided it was a hoax, without actually having a trial with King.</p>

<p>Which is interesting, because one of the victims showed the camera burn scars on his arm, claimed that King had matching scars from the way the scars were made, and so they could have looked at King&#39;s arm to see if that was true or not, but they didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>So who isn&#39;t looking for the truth? </p>

<p>I have known (and still know, actually) skeptics like yourself in person. For every one of us who is an emotionally-driven conspiracy theorist, there is a skeptic who also doesn&#39;t care about the truth, but just has a passion for taking down conspiracy theories. I&#39;d say we could both use some introspection, honestly. I&#39;ll admit that I do, anyway. </p>
