       As another commenter pointed out, these terms have been used for likely decades. It seems it's part of their encoded language to slip suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
       John and Tony Podesta likely became really big into cooking, and made their dinner hosting events famous so they could use that as a cover when pursuing their real interest, the other kind of pizza. I'd say this theory is more valid than some arse creating
       <em>
        fake news
       </em>
       as a joke. (Fake news is a blatant propaganda tactic.)
      </p>
      <p>
       A big part of the problem in seeking justice is that the vast majority of people like us are not aware of the intricacies of their practices, language, 'events' (hot tubs, spirit cooking, seriously wtf is that?!) and communication protocols - nor do we want to be, that shit is probably nightmare inducing. This kind of stuff is inconceivable to most of us. I feel real sympathy for FBI agents tasked with gathering this evidence, but somebody has to do it.

       Well, what do you think is more likely of these possibilities:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some child predators adopt code language they learn from the internet in places on the internet where child predators hang out, like 4chan.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         4chan is the only place on the internet that uses those codes.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Or, which of these do you think is more likely:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Members of 4chan have taken control of wikileaks and were able to create fake emails that use their code language.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Members of 4chan recognized the possible use of code in wikileaks emails, because those codes have been used on 4chan.

       It's not a series of codewords that most would know about.

       Not saying it is about pedos because I'm not part of that world thank god, but I can definitely see them using codes to communicate freely.

       So you think our government spent $65,000 to fly hot dogs and pizza to the white house for one private party? I mean, even if let's say it's an average of $20 per item, that would still be over 3,000 hotdogs and pizzas for one private party. Or that someone was missing Podesta's hot dog stand in Hawaii?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's far more debatable what the code is actually code
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       , if some want to say drugs or prostitutes, but trying to debate that it's not code at all is a bit weak.

       an innocent inside joke perhaps. if they're going to be communicating about their exploits over email they could just use google maps in place of drawing a map on a handkerchief like an idiot.

       and Podesta actually does own some small square of land in Hawaii, but I can't find the link to it now. This is a midlife crisis thing, "some day I'll get away from it all and sell hotdogs and surf all day".

       I appreciate it. I'm personally invested in the whole pizza/pedogate investigation because I'm a CSA survivor, myself. I just want to know the truth, because it drives me mad to think that red flags of child abuse could be raised and most of the government, media and public just point and laugh, or at best "debunk" without actually doing the debunking. Crushes what little faith in humanity I have left. But having things
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       debunked is very helpful.

       You should also read the $65,000 email. It's a completely unrelated person saying that they think Obama did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       No other information anywhere on such an event happening. But if it did occur you'd be flying in staff, ingredients and equipment + other event costs. Such things must happen all the time at the Whitehouse. Not a $65,000 delivery order... Although they probably spend a fortune on delivery for events and that too.

       I don't know what to believe, to be honest with you. There have been other cases (like actual cases and not just civilian investigations) of sadistic pedo rings being uncovered where government was involved, either partaking or covering up. So it's not like the notion is "crazy" or "impossible" to me, and then combined with my own trauma, my mind jumps into protective mode at the thought that kids might be getting hurt like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I admit you are right, it is more logical and likely explanation that it was just a matter of wasteful spending, and the person writing the email likely felt that way since they specifically mentioned "taxpayer money" which is makes it even more likely that it was just wasteful spending, given the tone used by the person who wrote the email.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for debating with me in a respectful way. It does help me to calm down a bit and think more clearly.

       Would you not be better off staying away this topic if it's a trigger? Especially when it's in the forum of conspiracy where too many people are making all sorts of leaps and bounds of logic, plus some outright madness (blood rituals, satan, etc). It's not a very healthy place in general.

       Yes I probably would be, and I've even had multiple people in my personal life tell me that they are concerned that I am obsessing over it. I understand. But it's hard not to obsess over it. I showed a lot of warning signs of being abused growing, and nobody cared. When I did try to tell someone at one point, I was called a liar and threatened. I know how that feels, and so it is nearly impossible for me to just go, "Oh well better think about myself and ignore all of this." Political figures have been busted before, I know it exists. Hell there was a CP sting in the Pentagon where a lot of people were busted, yet relatively so few actually prosecuted. So yes, a ruckus breaks out online over potential evidence that some children might be getting harmed and my mind latches on very strongly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that some people who are interested in pizza/pedogate are just trolls, and that for some it is political/partisan. But for some people like myself we just want the truth.

       The problem is that you're not actually looking for truth, you're looking to have your beliefs confirmed; and you're in with a crowd that will endlessly find wriggle room. This entire thing was dreamed up by shitposters, there is nothing to even vaguely indicate a specific crime was committed; and more is invented each day through
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">
        Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon
       </a>
       . How can you find truth in that?

      <p>
       Every voat user could be given free reign in Comet Ping Pong with pneumatic drills and the response would be "coverup!" "shills!" and some new tangent.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, the Pentagon thing was 5,200 people who were subscribed to CP sites, that's in total. Because a few had .mil emails or addresses they were checked for DOD connections (employees or contractors, and not just Pentagon) by the DCIS and 264 had such a connection. There are details + lengthy reports linked to in this article -

       I think you're projecting here. I've been completely willing to acknowledge it when someone proves I am wrong. But I know a lot of skeptics try to paint all of us who are interested in the investigation with one brush. I don't know if maybe because there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       people who are interested that scream "shill" at the top of their lungs when anyone questions anything, and I'm willing to admit when I am wrong, if that is somehow setting off some go for the throat response, or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe you need to get off your own high horse, as well. Looking at your own post history, I see you are trying to insist that multiple cases like this were fake, including the Franklin scandal, where you link wikipedia as your proof that it was a hoax, even though the wikipedia page just says that grand jury
       <strong>
        suggested
       </strong>
       that the abuse stories originated from a vindictive employee, and also it is assumed that it was a hoax just because that grand jury interviewed the witnesses and then decided it was a hoax, without actually having a trial with King.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is interesting, because one of the victims showed the camera burn scars on his arm, claimed that King had matching scars from the way the scars were made, and so they could have looked at King's arm to see if that was true or not, but they didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       So who isn't looking for the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have known (and still know, actually) skeptics like yourself in person. For every one of us who is an emotionally-driven conspiracy theorist, there is a skeptic who also doesn't care about the truth, but just has a passion for taking down conspiracy theories. I'd say we could both use some introspection, honestly. I'll admit that I do, anyway.

       The point of a code is to hide the true meaning.

       Yes I probably would be, and I've even had multiple people in my personal life tell me that they are concerned that I am obsessing over it. I understand. But it's hard not to obsess over it. I showed a lot of warning signs of being abused growing, and nobody cared. When I did try to tell someone at one point, I was called a liar and threatened. I know how that feels, and so it is nearly impossible for me to just go, "Oh well better think about myself and ignore all of this." Political figures have been busted before, I know it exists. Hell there was a CP sting in the Pentagon where a lot of people were busted, yet relatively so few actually prosecuted. So yes, a ruckus breaks out online over potential evidence that some children might be getting harmed and my mind latches on very strongly.

       I know that some people who are interested in pizza/pedogate are just trolls, and that for some it is political/partisan. But for some people like myself we just want the truth.
