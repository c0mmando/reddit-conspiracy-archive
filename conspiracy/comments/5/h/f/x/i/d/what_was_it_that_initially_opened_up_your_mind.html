    <div class="md"><p>Building 7.  After 9/11 I did my &quot;patriotic&quot; duty, joined the army, went to Iraq.  I was pretty disappointed with what we were doing over there (nothing good), but I didn&#39;t have any epiphanies.  It wasn&#39;t til I got back, about a year later, I saw a documentary with building 7, which I&#39;d never seen.  Once I &quot;investigated&quot; the building 7 farce, the rest of the official 9/11 conspiracy theory collapsed, and I haven&#39;t been the same since.  This discovery was ~2005.</p>

<p>For me, it was the destruction of Libya at the hands of NATO. Something just didn&#39;t seem right, and as we all know investigating one thing leads to another and another until you&#39;re way down the rabbit hole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First thing EVER in my lifetime??<br/>
I was about 20 and happened to pick up Malcolm X&#39;s Autobiography (which I highly recommend).<br/>
What blew my mind was distinctly remembering, actually seeing in my mind the three sentence paragraph about him in my social studies textbook as opposed to the entire section about MLK and his  stance. How MLK&#39;s vision fit in with the over-riding narrative of us all getting along as opposed to X&#39;s standing up and demanding his freedom, questioning the Government&#39;s power and abuses, etc...<br/>
I went to my mom and was like &quot;...not saying MLK wasn&#39;t brillant but so was X, wtf?! So the writers of the textbook only want WHOLE populations of kids to only know one perspective and not another and the publisher and school board AGREE?!&quot;<br/>
She kinda shrugged and said &quot;Yea, welcome to the real world...people have agendas, there is censorship, if you want to know anything you have to read, do your own research, question everything, what and why people are writing and promoting something, hiding the other...&quot;<br/>
My response was &quot;...OOOOkkk, I know we&#39;re readers in this family ma...question stuff but a little head&#39;s up sooner would have been nice, at the time, with access to other kids there could have been a discussion instead of just bored head-nodding and accepting the pablum we were &quot;allowed&quot;...&quot;<br/>
She shrugged again &quot;...you have to be careful...a lot of people aren&#39;t ready to even consider that the machine, including schools, are part of the problem, its like asking people to consider religion and politics are too...(this was like &#39;91/&#39;92) if they aren&#39;t ready they&#39;ll freak out...&quot;<br/>
Don&#39;t know if I agree with all that 100%...I was really p*ssed she hadn&#39;t told me that the extent of censorship/false narrative/skewed narratives until then (to be fair, no subject was off limits in our house, we could question and discuss anything BUT if I believed the information I had was the WHOLE truth I didn&#39;t know that truth needed questioning).<br/>
So with my kids I&#39;ve taught them about perspectives and asking questions, to investigate for themselves, just asking about their day helps enormously.<br/>
For example, if they&#39;re talking about the Civil War, we discuss what the &quot;lesson&quot; was they talked about in school but then I bring up the differences...how seceding from the Union isn&#39;t that weird if taken into context of the us a group of colonies having JUST done it; the difference it makes in having been &quot;fired on&quot; and &quot;invaded&quot; as opposed to &quot;marching off&quot; to a faraway place that doesn&#39;t really affect you; that Lincoln didn&#39;t really want to free the slaves; that not all slavery was abolished as a result of the Emancipation Proclamation, whole States being left out and I ask them to figure out why only a certain narrative is told etc...    </p>

<p>So not sure if your question was &quot;first time ever&quot; but that was my &quot;initially&quot;.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>The JFK assassination was the first conspiracy theory I really got into. In high school I was lucky to have a great history teacher, she was Armenian and so we did a whole section, outside of the curriculum, on the Armenian genocide. I actually got to then meet some survivors of the genocide, these 90 year old men and women who had been little kids at the time. It was mind boggling to me that a government could refuse to acknowledge something so horrible that affected so many. I think that&#39;s what really solidified it in my head that the government would do anything and everything to protect itself and it&#39;s interests, even at the cost of human life and dignity.</p>

Watched a video on youtube of a woman who said her husband went missing and he was a high ranking offical in the military, she named off people in the government who were pedophiles and the illegal things they did. I believe her, then when all of this stuff came out i knew it was real. Who would fake this sick shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha, taking me back to watching 9/11 videos in my room at my parent&#39;s when I was 15. That was four years ago. I was very intrigued in the secrets of the planet. Now I&#39;m interested in the secrets of the universe. Started getting into the deep web when I was 16. Learned about demons and other wild spiritual things. Fucked me up for a while. Now I pay more attention to what&#39;s really happening, instead of feeling out the frequencies. Got diagnosed with schizophrenia recently, so I take the big pharma meds, but the voices really made me question everything. </p>
