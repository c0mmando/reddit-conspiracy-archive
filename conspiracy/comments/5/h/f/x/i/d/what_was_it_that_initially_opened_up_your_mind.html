       Building 7.  After 9/11 I did my "patriotic" duty, joined the army, went to Iraq.  I was pretty disappointed with what we were doing over there (nothing good), but I didn't have any epiphanies.  It wasn't til I got back, about a year later, I saw a documentary with building 7, which I'd never seen.  Once I "investigated" the building 7 farce, the rest of the official 9/11 conspiracy theory collapsed, and I haven't been the same since.  This discovery was ~2005.

       For me, it was the destruction of Libya at the hands of NATO. Something just didn't seem right, and as we all know investigating one thing leads to another and another until you're way down the rabbit hole.

       First thing EVER in my lifetime??
       <br/>
       I was about 20 and happened to pick up Malcolm X's Autobiography (which I highly recommend).
       <br/>
       What blew my mind was distinctly remembering, actually seeing in my mind the three sentence paragraph about him in my social studies textbook as opposed to the entire section about MLK and his  stance. How MLK's vision fit in with the over-riding narrative of us all getting along as opposed to X's standing up and demanding his freedom, questioning the Government's power and abuses, etc...
       <br/>
       I went to my mom and was like "...not saying MLK wasn't brillant but so was X, wtf?! So the writers of the textbook only want WHOLE populations of kids to only know one perspective and not another and the publisher and school board AGREE?!"
       <br/>
       She kinda shrugged and said "Yea, welcome to the real world...people have agendas, there is censorship, if you want to know anything you have to read, do your own research, question everything, what and why people are writing and promoting something, hiding the other..."
       <br/>
       My response was "...OOOOkkk, I know we're readers in this family ma...question stuff but a little head's up sooner would have been nice, at the time, with access to other kids there could have been a discussion instead of just bored head-nodding and accepting the pablum we were "allowed"..."
       <br/>
       She shrugged again "...you have to be careful...a lot of people aren't ready to even consider that the machine, including schools, are part of the problem, its like asking people to consider religion and politics are too...(this was like '91/'92) if they aren't ready they'll freak out..."
       <br/>
       Don't know if I agree with all that 100%...I was really p*ssed she hadn't told me that the extent of censorship/false narrative/skewed narratives until then (to be fair, no subject was off limits in our house, we could question and discuss anything BUT if I believed the information I had was the WHOLE truth I didn't know that truth needed questioning).
       <br/>
       So with my kids I've taught them about perspectives and asking questions, to investigate for themselves, just asking about their day helps enormously.
       <br/>
       For example, if they're talking about the Civil War, we discuss what the "lesson" was they talked about in school but then I bring up the differences...how seceding from the Union isn't that weird if taken into context of the us a group of colonies having JUST done it; the difference it makes in having been "fired on" and "invaded" as opposed to "marching off" to a faraway place that doesn't really affect you; that Lincoln didn't really want to free the slaves; that not all slavery was abolished as a result of the Emancipation Proclamation, whole States being left out and I ask them to figure out why only a certain narrative is told etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       So not sure if your question was "first time ever" but that was my "initially".

       The JFK assassination was the first conspiracy theory I really got into. In high school I was lucky to have a great history teacher, she was Armenian and so we did a whole section, outside of the curriculum, on the Armenian genocide. I actually got to then meet some survivors of the genocide, these 90 year old men and women who had been little kids at the time. It was mind boggling to me that a government could refuse to acknowledge something so horrible that affected so many. I think that's what really solidified it in my head that the government would do anything and everything to protect itself and it's interests, even at the cost of human life and dignity.

       Started smoking weed around the time I found out about the 9/11 conspiracy. (10ish years ago) Kept me open minded this whole time. Watched a video on youtube of a woman who said her husband went missing and he was a high ranking offical in the military, she named off people in the government who were pedophiles and the illegal things they did. I believe her, then when all of this stuff came out i knew it was real. Who would fake this sick shit.

       I saw Conspiracy of Silence around that time, my story is very similar to yours.

       Also stopped believing in God around that time. I believe again, but in a different way. Feels like I'm back in touch with something I once knew.

       I have a belief of a higher power, if "his/her" name is God then so be it, (I think we were brought here by aliens/extraterrestrials.) But the whole aspect of religion is something I have always questioned my 27 years on this planet... too much shit just doesn't add up. I never had religion shoved down my throat and I refuse to teach it to my kids. I tell them we were brought here by aliens lol. I also tell them that Marijuana is medicine.

       Ha, taking me back to watching 9/11 videos in my room at my parent's when I was 15. That was four years ago. I was very intrigued in the secrets of the planet. Now I'm interested in the secrets of the universe. Started getting into the deep web when I was 16. Learned about demons and other wild spiritual things. Fucked me up for a while. Now I pay more attention to what's really happening, instead of feeling out the frequencies. Got diagnosed with schizophrenia recently, so I take the big pharma meds, but the voices really made me question everything.

       Loose Change - the 9/11 documentary. Then re-watching all of the X-files in college. The show is fiction but there are many gems in the show that illustrate some 'hows' and 'whys' and the banter between the 'hard-facts-always-logical Skully' and 'Spooky Mulder' helps one to understand why both parties way of thinking never converges.

       William Coopers prediction of 911. Te fact that he based his prediction on CNN alone broke my brain for days. Back then I never thought the media would be planting fake stories, now it's all just out in the open

       I was just a boy then. When I turned 18 or 19 I started seeing things, especially related to 2012. All the die offs, conspiracy theories, espionage, and myths started bleeding together, and the picture became clear.

       Listening to Jello Biafra in high school.  His letter to Tipper Gore or something.  Twenty years later and there still is so much to learn, so much really going on.  Looking into the JFK assassination,  red flags everywhere. And most recently interested,  wikileaks several years ago until now.

       A teen in my city died from doing ecstasy. It was all over the news. "Took one pill. Bad ecstasy. Don't do ecstasy because there's a bad batch in town and you'll die". That sort of thing. I ended up meeting some friends of the guy a few days later, and they said he was walking around eating ecstasy like skittles. Told the police that, too. The media and authorities used the event to influence the public.

       The saying "don't believe everything you read" suddenly made perfect sense.
