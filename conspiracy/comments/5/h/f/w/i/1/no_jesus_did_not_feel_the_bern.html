<p>YOur statement is false. Jesus did not hate rich people first off . He hated how riches and wealth corrupted mans hearts. Two completely different concepts of thinking. He even forgave and prayed for those &quot;rich&quot; men who put him on the cross.</p>

<p>Just because he forgave them, does not mean he approves of money or rich people. In fact this statement is very clear in that someone who is rich will have a difficult time getting to &#39;the kingdom of God&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its obvious that he is referring to the love of money there friend. And how someone would rather have wealth over eternal life. Not that wealth is an evil thing. I have already shown you that many men of God and the biggest names in the Bible were rich. </p>

<p>Remember how many times God tells men to not go after strange woman and lust after them? Jesus also said &#39;if a man lusts after a woman IN HIS HEART then he already committed adultery&#39;.. 
This doesn&#39;t mean that women are evil because men lust after them , and neither is money evil because men lust after it the more... Come on , JEsus Christ almost always is talking about the heart and minds of man and how to overcome the world. Not condemning the world but condemning the hearts and minds that go after the world</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Moses , Aaron and Joshua. All the Kings of which include David and the richest human being ever to walk the earth David&#39;s son Solomon. Don&#39;t forget Daniel.
Even in the New Testament the man who gave Jesus his tomb was a disciple and was really rich. Matthew was wealthy but I&#39;m not sure how much. 
Anyways many men and women were rich and served God with a true heart and loved their fellow man.. Its just that the majority of the human race when confronted with power or wealth will tend to be corrupted by it and then the heart becomes cold. Which then God says its so hard for a Rich man to get to heaven because they cant let go of their riches.</p>

<p>And I believe Christians think we are all equal in that we are made in God&#39;s image, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tithing is old testament. BEcause tithing was given directly to the stability of the house of God in Jerusalem at that time. Now God clearly through Paul states that &quot;we&quot; ARE THE building blocks of the temple of the Lord and that Charity is our new Tithing. I Do believe if you continue to take a tenth of your earnings and use them to help others you will see the fruits of that . But it is not a commandment of Christ to give a tenth of your earnings to any particular building. </p>

<p>And yes all humans are made in the Image of God. We are not God but are considered even by Christ the gods of the world and it was and is our duty to maintain order and balance in both society and nature. Yet Christ also make this distinction is that if men or women who don&#39;t understand this and do the very opposite of what God has made straight and clear are sons of the devil (spiritually) and that their reward is what ever they earn here on earth in their lifetime. But they wont see heaven because they loved the world and dwelt in desire more than the righteousness of God and the Spirit.  And yes of course more elderly are conservative to a degree but remember liberalism started not with the youth of today, they are just regurgitating past ideologies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa. You lost me when you pretty much discounted tithing because it&#39;s OT.</p>

<p>Where did the 10 commandments come from? OT</p>

<p>Where did the story of creation come from? OT</p>

<p>And Jesus in Matthew5:17 (or 18 idr) states he was here to fulfill the law, <strong>not abolish</strong></p>

<p>OT is still relevant bro </p>

    <div class="md"><p>10 commandments are still relevant 100%. 
Tithing is still considered but it is not a commandment it was a statute of the Mosaic Law. Which the mosaic law is no more.
Tithing was also before Moses , when we read Abraham gave a tenth of his spoil to the priest Melchizkideck (sorry for misspelling)
however it was One time. And it was not required of Abraham for all his earnings all the time. </p>

<p>The reason why the 10 commandments are still in effect because they started at creation.. And they will never fall or fail from being alive.</p>

<p>A new Covenant is made with the blood of Christ and the temple is now inside you and anyone else who accepts Christs sacrifice and walks in the Holy Spirit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but Christ himself stated that he was not here to abolish old law (OT) but rather fulfill it. New Test Jesus was still all about the OT</p>

<p>10 commandments were not given at creation, they were given to moses.</p>

<p>And I find it oh s convenient that Christians believe the 10 commandments are still ok and valid and supported by the bible and by god, but none of the old stuff is like stoning your daughter if she&#39;s not a virgin on her wedding day, stoning anyone that works on sabbath, stoning anyone that wears more than one fabric. Why don&#39;t we sacrifice animals anymore like they used to in OT?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No sorry that&#39;s incorrect. He stated not to abolish GODS LAW but fulfilled the Mosaic law.. Jesus Christ being obviously God in the flesh, stated with Moses that the covenant and laws of the convent of the OT, will not remain forever because a new covenant would be made through the sacrifice of the messiah.. Read Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy again. Mosaic Law was for the Jews and Jews only. The 10 Commandments are made for mankind...And its confirmed here again that a new covenant will be made and its stated here oh so clearly.</p>

<h1>Jerimiah 31:31</h1>

<p>&quot;31Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 32Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD: 33But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. 34And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.&quot;</p>

<p>So sacrificing of animals  is fulfilled in Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. And like the OT states was &quot;a shadow of things to come.&quot;</p>

<p>We are supposed to keep Sabbath still because its a law that started in creation for creation , but like Christ stated the beast system &quot;will think to change times and laws&quot; -Revelations.. The Catholic Church openly testifies that they changed the Sabbath day from the last day of the week &quot;SATURDAY&quot; which the early Christians did honor to &quot;Sunday&quot; and that any Protestant church that honor Sunday is in fact giving alms to the Catholic Doctrine. </p>

<p>and here is a link of a quick video of the Catholic Church confessing to this. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrB21mc2fmI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrB21mc2fmI</a>
SO Christians as whole usually keep Sabbath however its on the wrong day, that is why out of many people now are starting to keep Sabbath(Saturday) as the day of rest &quot;As it was in the Beginning&quot;
The death and stoning of people breaking the Sabbath law back in the Jewish Mosaic Laws times &quot;OT&quot; was held very serious to God because as again the OT states &quot;he was their king and Father and the people were his servants and son&quot;. And he expected his people to be HOLY.. And again to break such a law even though the punishment was death seemed harsh but was still only able to be broken by choice. There was not a major blood bath every Saturday because people couldn&#39;t not keep it.. ITs foolish to think so as Jews in Israel still keep this.</p>

<p>And I find the reality of this clearly seen. What day is the most celebrated but in the very opposite of what God said it should be ? Saturday! It is the top economic day of the week because people buy and sell more on that day than any other. And yet it because its a FU to god by man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YEah throughout the old testament it was the duty for the Jews to keep the Laws of Moses, or the Mosiac Law. BUT and its a big BUT. lol Was that even Moses stated and rehearsed the words of God to the people of Israel that God will in due time end the OLD covenant and bring in a new one , all due to the peoples DISOBEDIANCE. ANd he makes this comparison to that of marriage. Say&quot; I field for divorce as a husband does with his wife&quot; and then started a new marriage with new rules. Does this not make sense?

    <div class="md"><p>No it doesn&#39;t make sense because then you either keep all of the OT or reject all of it. And Jesus said keep it, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget all of this from an &quot;immutable&quot; God. But his ideas on child abuse, slavery, sexual abuse, and lots more is mutable. That doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read then the new Testament again, and see how many &quot;new laws&quot; are made for the church and body of Christ. there are a lot.. How to act as a father and husband, a wife and mother as children , what bishop(leader) is supposed to be and how they must fulfill certain requirements.. These are all given to us by the apostles who were anointed by Christ to give those laws out..
And Christ said again so clearly &quot;ye are my friends if ye obey MY COMMANDMENTS&quot; ..
The 10 commandments are still in effect in every single government today except the first 4..
You still cant kill, or steal or lie or commit adultery. Its a crime to do so. So God likewise says we must obey them because like I shown you he not only makes them for mankind to live in order and peace but also &quot;HE PUT THE LAWS IN ALL MANS HEARTS&quot;.
Why do you think Christianity spread so rapidly after Christ rose from the dead??? Because when missionaries started going around the world bringing the &quot;good news&quot; aka &quot;the gospel&quot; the people in Africa and south America and tribes all around the world , stop their cannibalism , stopped their child sacrificing stopped their mistreatment of women, stopped slavery (in some parts) and yet still in Christian nations things like hospitals and retirement homes , and orphanages all started because of Christians. These basic fundamental concepts of righteousness was made know by Christians who actually followed the laws of God of the New Testament. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, Yeah thats my boy Tim Smith aka Waffled Colored Negro&#39;s article. Ha I laugh at the name ,but he is one cool cat.</p>

<p>The reality in which we face today is shocking , on the matters of how people even today read the scriptures and especially the words of Christ and completely take things out of contexts. </p>

<p>Like for example, a commandment is always literal. Like when a father gives instructions to a son or a boss gives to their associates.Yet people interpret it in fashions other than what is written?? imagine the chaos if bosses found out that their associates literally the polar opposite of what was clearly commanded of them..lmao it would be nuts.
Or A parable is a like metaphor (which did not happen) but used to explain something else in reality,  but people interpret it as literal??
Or A prophecy for future events is made and is taken literal without making sure all points have been met??</p>

<p>People forget that one reads the Bible they have to consider that its like an autobiography and biography mixed together on God&#39;s presence with mankind since the beginning of time and what happened that caused the reality in which we live in today to be as it is today and then how he &quot;promised&quot; or &quot;prophesied&quot; on how he would put upon himself &quot;flesh&quot; to redeem mankind and teach them the ways of salvation and how they should act towards one another,  and to later in the end of time revive them for eternal life. But its our duty as human beings to overcome the desires and temptations of the world so that we can obtain the things not MADE of the world.</p>

<p>People just keep spiting out BULLsheeeettto because they look towards either specific details and versus that will try and justify their worldview.. Gods view and how he judges is shown and from front to back of the Library(Bible) he shows us how we should view the world and judge everything. IN love , in defense towards life, in righteousness and Truth . 
But the way people become foolish and fall of this very easy concept is that they start again to interpret &quot;truth&quot; as they want. they start to interpret what &quot;love&quot; is. And start confusing love and lust. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure Jesus did hate money and the &#39;free market&#39; trading as described how he hated the tax man and people selling stuff near the temple.  Although I do agree it&#39;s ridiculous to even try to debate it.... but his teachings are empathetic and void of anything else which does not resonate with conserving money</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus again did not hate money. He hated how men served money more than God hence the quote &#39;You can not have 2 masters for one will be loved and the other hated, you cannot serve mammon(money) and God).</p>

<p>And Jesus never spoke on Trade at all. And again money is not sin, its &quot;the love of money that is the root of all evil&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you are right he despised the action of traders in the Temple because again, according to the law the Temple was supposed to be kept holy and free from outside worldly ways...

    <div class="md"><p>YEah your absolutely right.. There is going to be no trade or anything of the like or economy that we see today. But that&#39;s also because when Christ comes back , we will be given new bodies &quot;that of the angels&quot; which obviously never die and so things like food and shelter etc are no longer worth anything. Neither is money since even the roads will be paved in Gold. </p>

<p>This article is fucking stupid.</p>

<p>Republican christians be like &quot;socialism is bad, they take away your stuff and give it to other people&quot;</p>

<p>And Jesus quotes be like &quot;he with two tunics share one with the man who has none&quot;</p>

<p>Any republican holding an ideology of material possessions higher than another humans life is not a true Christian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cant judge by the word of God if you don&#39;t live by it. Second your judgments are opinion based and not backed by scripture. You used scripture verses to support an opinion. Thus leading them to fall short.</p>

<p>The Bible makes it clear to obey all mankind&#39;s government ordinances as long as they don&#39;t violate the 10 commandments of God.
You can just type in &quot;Government&quot; into a strongs concordance and see how many times government comes up. You forget that God said clearly many times that God will be coming back to the earth to establish a government or aka KINGDOM that will last forever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>its not my opinion. Like I quoted to you , but also if it really is something you wish to understand then just google &quot;strong concordance&quot; and type the word &quot;government&quot; or &quot;authority&quot; or &quot;kingdom&quot; and see how many times God references the importance of them.. </p>

<p>Now what I think you might really enjoy and consider the best government is the govnerment of early Israel when Israel had no king.. There was no &quot;central&quot; government and there were no police forces or fire fighters or soldiers armies or navies.. Yet the whole nation as awhole was all of these things. And everyone just lived on their land without authroities demanding anything from them except the 10% of their earnings went to the Temple and that they perform a sacrifice for any sin they did at the end of every year. And the only heads of the people were called judges who were usually just the elders of the people and there was one main Judge who never taxed the people or demanded anything from the people but lived on his or her own land just like the rest of the people. It sounded like paradise to me. small government at its finest. it was very similar to that of the native Americans.</p>

<p>I mean seriously read the first chapters of 1 Samuel when the people ask of Samuel to have a king.. Samuel the last Judge almost loses his shit. lol Hes like &quot;don&#39;t you realize what a king and big government will do?&quot; </p>

<p>And Jesus in Matthew5:17 (or 18 idr) states he was here to fulfill the law, <strong>not abolish</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Moses , Aaron and Joshua. All the Kings of which include David and the richest human being ever to walk the earth David&#39;s son Solomon. Don&#39;t forget Daniel.
Even in the New Testament the man who gave Jesus his tomb was a disciple and was really rich. Matthew was wealthy but I&#39;m not sure how much. 
Anyways many men and women were rich and served God with a true heart and loved their fellow man.. Its just that the majority of the human race when confronted with power or wealth will tend to be corrupted by it and then the heart becomes cold. Which then God says its so hard for a Rich man to get to heaven because they cant let go of their riches.</p>
