I&#39;m trying to stand in the middle here and look at this objectively but it&#39;s almost impossible right now with the level of reverse fakery going on around here.</p>

<p>How so? By exposing the truth, Russia is evil? I&#39;m not buying all of the claims that Russia is responsible, but even if they did leak the emails, I see it as a service to humanity. And let&#39;s not forget America&#39;s history in Russian politics. It&#39;s open knowledge that we funded and provided advisors to Yeltsin when he ran for reelection in the 90s. The guy was an alcoholic and not fit to lead any country, but the Russians got him thanks to us. And just look at how much of a shithole Russia was under his rule. I&#39;m not even including all of the suspected covert operations we&#39;ve done to destabilize Russia, especially during their last presidential elections.</p>

<p>So let me ask you this. Which is worse? The clear meddling by the U.S. that led to one of the worst decades in Russian history (and they&#39;ve had some pretty fucked up decades)? Or Russia telling us the truth about our corrupt politicians?</p>

<p>Or we can approach this from another angle. Which is worse? Russia telling us the truth about our corrupt politicians? Or the DNC rigging the election against Sanders, cheating at presidential debates, pushing endless propaganda over the mainstream news, staging fake attacks to make Trump supporters look like racists, and Hillary&#39;s endless lying to Congress and the American people in order to hold the most powerful office in the world? Seriously, who interfered in the election more here? </p>

<p>Not going to disagree that exposing helping to expose Hilary and her brand of corruption is not a service. But I&#39;d argue that the service being offered is to their benefit, not ours.</p>

<p>If you think that any <em>democratically elected</em> leader around the globe is not some form of puppet or another you are mistaken. The quality of life in Russia is not very good and the subversion tactics they use are not all the dissimilar than our own gov&#39;ts to the dissenters. Poverty wise though, we are actually worst. But thankfully, from a Trump voters perspective, most of our poverty are minorities and they aren&#39;t fully human anyways.</p>

<p>Again, my feeling is there is financial incentive in Russia propping one crook up over another. Regardless of who they were to support they&#39;d have made money off of:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hillary&#39;s war rhetoric would have bolstered Russian Military contractors to produce more war toys and the United states would have done the same. Economy boost in the Military sector because lets face it, the only manufacturing work that really exists in either country is on the weapons side. So same ole same ole gun show, boogie man vs boogie man. Cold War part 2 when behind the scenes the fat cats on both sides get fatter while both sides populations get behind their crooked governments in the name of patriotism.</p></li>
<li><p>They got behind Trump and will open up drilling where the permafrost has receded making them a bigger player on the oil battlegrounds likely selling to us because we&#39;ll be buddies fighting terrorism together... But in addition Trump is going to stick with the current boogieman and bolster our already staggering Military in the name of killing those goat fucking Muslims. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Either choice the common man is going to get fucked and the elite are going to get richer.</p>

<p>Are we really taking any of this at face value? We are in a time in our history where the divide is so systemic that there are less and less of us willing to stand in the middle and see how asinine everyone is acting. This is divide and conquer 101 and it is prevalent in all Western powers. Which is worst? It&#39;s all fucking bad and I refuse to praise either candidate. However, as apathetic as it may sound, I am an Environmentalist, I&#39;m pro-choice, and I am a proponent for the separation of church and state. So forgive me if I do not agree with the current appointees who would seem to seek to dismantle the few portions of American life that I actually think we shine at. </p>

<p>In closing there is no lesser of two evils when it comes to Russia and the US. They benefit TREMENDOUSLY from each others public stances. They both eliminate any opposition that gets too close to the proverbial truth but I&#39;d argue that America does a better job at diversion where the Kremlim makes examples of people. Both countries have propaganda media the similarities are very close and as time moves on we&#39;ll end up looking more alike than not. However, one big difference I think we have is that I don&#39;t think 9/11, Pearl Harbor etc could have been pulled off in Russia. It&#39;s either that our population is so apathetic and easily swayed that they&#39;ll buy into anything their Gov&#39;t tells them or Russia is actually genuinely afraid of their populace as our Govt should be. This whole planet is fucked. </p>

<p>I promise you that I am not a shill. I have been on this planet for a long time and was taught at an early age to question everything and try not to get too much smoke blown up my ass. I question this sub and it&#39;s users tactics over the last year as well and the only hate I seem to get are those with a blind infatuation to a man who is unfit to be a leader in my eyes if not for the simple fact that he represents us on a superficial level to the rest of the world. I respect the new right movement in that they played a much better ballgame than the democrats. It was like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen before. The strategy was superb. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this sub is a place to display our allegiances. I&#39;m not here to do so. I&#39;m trying to engage people objectively</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit, while I didn&#39;t vote for Hillary, that I do have a problem with Trump&#39;s picks regarding my own social reasons: pro-choice, separation of church and state, and the environment. But I can look past a lot of it because these issues that people get so worked up over are merely crumbs fed to the masses to tip the scales from election to election. I am not attempting to attack any group as a whole but hope that we can work on this divide because under current circumstances TPTB have us in their most favorable position. I&#39;d ultimately like a many of us to work together as possible to go down the same rabbit holes and come to the right conclusions based on cold hard facts. I do the best I can to look at both sides of the coin and arrive at a place that is most logical in the end based on that evidence. I don&#39;t desire to be hostile to you or any of the other patrons that readily defend just another politician because the more evil one lost. I just hope that when the time comes we are both able to look at the man objectively instead of standing by him like Tammy Wynette.</p>

<p>If creationism gets shoehorned into our public school system I&#39;m going to be mad because he appointed her. If our forests get clearcut for the greed of the elite I&#39;m going to be pissed. If access to abortion is restricted, I&#39;ll be upset. I&#39;ll get called a leftist but these are close to about the only social issues I&#39;ll fight for. The ritualistic pedo ring isn&#39;t going to stop under Trump. The Clinton&#39;s or Bushes being held accountable for their actions won&#39;t happen under trump. Prove me wrong and I&#39;ll be cheering him on, but forgive me if I&#39;m skeptical. I&#39;m glad Hillary isn&#39;t in but I know that those who pull the same strings are still there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let&#39;s say it turns out Putin helped push some pro-trump content on the webs. </p>

<p>So what? Is Trump a puppet now? </p>

<p>Countries try to influence each other all the time. Merkel and Saudi Arabia donated millions to the Clintons Foundation. Literally every western media helped push Hillary. </p>

<p>Besides, it wasn&#39;t Russia that hacked those emails, they were leaked by Seth Rich, a Democrat insider who was killed soon after. </p>

<p>In a world where China is starting to grow stronger and stronger I&#39;d rather team up with Russia than let the Chinese and Russians get any closer than they already are.  </p>

<p>Besides, there is fucking ZERO actual confirmations that it was the Russians behind the hack. </p>

<p>Stop being a retard. We got our guy in the White House , stop spreading shit.</p>
