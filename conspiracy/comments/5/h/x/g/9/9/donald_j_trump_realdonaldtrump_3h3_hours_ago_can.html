    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link. Apparently, the machine counters fucking suck in Michigan and the containers can easily get holes in them? Though, it doesn&#39;t mean there was voter fraud. I still think the full recount should have happened to make sure. SAYING THAT....</p>

<p>I just found the final recount stats before it was closed. It said that the final net change was for Hillary, 102 votes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does that even mean? There was some mild protest but yes, no one took up an official position that the emails were fake (because they weren&#39;t). They said the emails were leaked  to wikileaks by the Russian government before the election, to aid Trump - that&#39;s the claim. And that&#39;s fucked up,  that shouldn&#39;t  be  a partisan issue  - that should be something everyone is interested in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is - they&#39;re angry because the emails show that they&#39;re corrupt liars that will do anything to stop any opposition. They don&#39;t say the content or information is wrong - they know it&#39;s 100% real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And my point was that if Trump was helped by Russia, it shouldn&#39;t be a partisan issue. And it&#39;s a very supported theory.</p>

<p>The only people who give a shit about Hillary now, are Trump supporters. And this sub is not suppose to be the place, those people peddle their shit. It&#39;s suppose to be about abuses of power.</p>

<p>Trump clearly is either in direct contact with Russia, or at best his policies align with them (these are  facts as well). If Russia created a selection bias intentionally to influence voters to vote in favour of  their own interests, that&#39;s a conspiracy theory and abuse of  power. That level of influence is on the level of open war - I saw the term the political equivalent of 9/11 thrown around. Not because it&#39;s Trump but because it&#39;s external influence.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why anyone would be so quick to defend Trump when really people should be demanding that they declassify what information they have. Any reasonable person that hasn&#39;t made their mind up that Trump=MEME JESUS and Hillary=child rapist should be demanding that. Even if they support Trump, as it should not even be a partisan issue but a national security one.</p>

<p>How do we know Wikileaks isn&#39;t compromised? Assange is mia so do we have anyway to know who&#39;s running the show there? Is it an open company or a secret organization?</p>

<p>Sorry if this is a dumb question I just have no clue how Wikileaks works and we have been putting so so much faith in what they publish. </p>

I think he&#39;s right: his margin of victory in Wisconsin was less than a conservative estimate of the number of voters thought to have been disenfranchised by Wisconsin&#39;s voter ID laws. Between gerrymandering, voter suppression, and other forms of electioneering, we&#39;re looking at the system being rigged to ensure certain partisan outcomes. And it&#39;s not the first time this has happened either - we saw Florida and Bush v. Gore decide the election in 2000 and Ohio and the Blackwell-SmarTech controversy in 2004 was probably the same. Michigan is turning up irregularities in the on-again-off-again Green Party-led recounts.</p>

<p>All the positive and negative hype about recounts has left me scratching my head. Businesses get audited. Government operations gets inspected.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting question. I, and I assume everyone else, probably has opinions on that issue, but I have great confidence that a group of bi-partisan experts could come up with a practical solution that people could accept. Plenty of people graduate with degrees in accounting, statistics, engineering, computers, and software. </p>

<p>We check scales used in commerce  and recalibrate them, shouldn&#39;t voting machines be functioning probably before the election? Maybe they are, but if so, the MSM doesn&#39;t put that on the front page. Imagine this --&quot;All of Detroit&#39;s machines checked and found to be working properly heading into tomorrow&#39;s election.&quot; </p>

<p>I think the public needs to agree that we want a fair election process first. We&#39;re still at the point where plenty of people, some of whom I know, don&#39;t believe that every citizen should be allowed to vote. I&#39;ve personally seen the over 2 hour voting lines and was disgusted by it. If you don&#39;t want groups to vote against you, figure out a way to bring them in to the fold, not another way to keep them from voting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t agree with you more, don&#39;t_suicide_me. In 2008 in South Florida I experienced the unreasonable voter lines. I was motivated to complain and also to do some research. Turns out that everything that should be so fair, may not be. Too few polling places in areas that vote opposite to the Governor seemed to be common. Blacks go to Church on Sunday and then go together to early vote, well, close the voting on Sundays. All while saying that anyone in line when the polling places closed on election day could vote as long as they remained in line. Polls closed and in some spots 5 hours later people were still waiting in some spots. </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll step down from my soapbox now, but I will be quoting you. &quot;We need an election system that is impossible to exploit.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard it referred to as dual voting. Dual voting is hard detect on the spot.

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand, there were three main ways of cheating.</p>

<p>First, enroll a heap of illegal immigrants. In various states, there are mechanisms that get these people state ID, and all they need to enroll is that ID + proof that they are working + proof of address. They can then setup shell companies and easily fake the latter two parts. In California for example, all they need is that state ID, which requires nothing. They can enroll with just the ID (people have been linking to the site that enables this, and have made guides on how to do it).</p>

<p>The second method involves registering in two or more places. It follows most of the first method, except they can use existing names, or fake names. They then ship these people around to vote multiple times.</p>

<p>The third and probably most prevalent method is to simply mail ballot under dozens of names. There have been multiple incidents where people have been caught receiving dozens of ballots at a single address under multiple names.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For California, one can enroll with the state ID but you need to provide your driver license number and that license has separate designations if you received it as an illegal immigrant. For example, the license says federal limits apply on the card and you are not eligible for automatic enrollment for voting. If you try to register on the website if you have never enrolled before, you must provide the last 4 digits of your SSN or your driver license, which again is labeled as invalid.</p>

<p>In order to qualify for an eligible California ID you need a US passport, a birth certificate, or a previous valid California ID.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dmv.org/ca-california/id-cards.php">http://www.dmv.org/ca-california/id-cards.php</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/votecal-project/">http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/votecal-project/</a></p>

<p>VoteCal checks for duplicate entries in different counties.</p>

<p>I think you have been mistaken on how easy it is for an illegal to register to vote in California.</p>

<p>The dozens of ballots under a single address you are talking about is this:
<a href="http://ktla.com/2016/11/03/possible-voter-fraud-being-investigated-in-san-pedro-after-83-ballots-are-mysteriously-delivered-to-one-womans-apartment/">http://ktla.com/2016/11/03/possible-voter-fraud-being-investigated-in-san-pedro-after-83-ballots-are-mysteriously-delivered-to-one-womans-apartment/</a></p>

<p>LA County claimed it was probably a computer error, but that it would be investigated.</p>

<p>Then allegedly, someone will get in contact with the applicant and there are other processes they can use to circumvent the remaining step. And this is all assuming that there is no one helping these illegals from the inside by providing bogus proof of address and proof of employment (which Project Veritas revealed to actually be happening).</p>

<p>This of course also assumes that there is no corruption at play, and no incentive to be signing up people that TPTB assume would definitely vote for a specific party. If there was such an incentive (and I&#39;m not saying there was), then all bets are off, and we could see far more than 3 million illegals registering up to vote.</p>

<p>While writing this up, another method came to mind. Some illegals were grandfathered into full licenses as long as they did not declare they were illegal, when Cali passed the law to hand out licenses to everyone. I would need to dig up the details, but I recall that potentially thousands of people got full IDs without the red writing on them saying they were not for federal usage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live here next to undocumented people and minorities but I haven&#39;t heard a peep of this. I am with you on the possibility, but</p>

<blockquote>
<p>far more than 3 million illegals registering up to vote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is a complete farce. We don&#39;t even have 3 million illegals in California. The most recent number we have in 2013 is 2.67m undocumented. There is no fucking way they would register each and every single one of them to vote, let alone more than 3m. They have to find them first. You lost me, man.</p>

<p>Shit, we didn&#39;t even have 1m undocumented people with licenses by the beginning of this year. Minorities have abysmal registration and voting rates and those are the ones allowed to vote. Latinos make up 34% of the state’s adult population but only 18% of <strong>likely</strong> voters. Plus, you have to make them do the online form, mail it in, and provide proof of residency and an approved ID.</p>

<p>3 million is a complete fucking joke, dude. Even at their best they could maybe, maaayyybee, register 1.5m. Democrats are not that well funded to do that here. I didn&#39;t even see anybody canvasing. Then you got to get them to vote, lol. I guarantee, they aren&#39;t voting.</p>

<p>Edit: If I were to be completely honest about a number that would be likely in our state given the demographics and our <em>bureaucracy</em>. The highest amount of illegals that may have voted statewide, ballpark 250 - 300k. Highest.</p>

<p>Edit2: This is also speculation to the highest degree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Scott Foval was pretty damning. It was really hard to determine the context, whether they were asking him to come up with ideas, or whatever. Still, I think Scott Foval was pretty bad. Moving voters across state lines to vote is not a good move. </p>

<p>Though, the logistics seem a bit too high to cause an effect in a major election like the presidency, but I can definitely see it for local elections or reps for the house. The others seemed mild and typical political maneuvering.</p>

He says he thinks the voter ID laws allow for a lot of fraud because you don&#39;t have to verify yourself.

<p>I don&#39;t think that video was as damning as it is portrayed. Do you have something else?</p>

<p>Just by the way the US election is set up you see there is a lot of room for fraud and I would bet that Hillary was in a much better position to explore those opportunities then Trump ever was.</p>

<p>If you go back you can see that the side that was most concerned with the possibility of fraud was those who supported Trump while Hillary supporters, Hillary herself and her team, publicly mocked the idea that there could be any fraud (they assumed they were going to win easy).</p>

<p>Trump was underestimated by his opposition and simply run a much better campaign. Now why the Dems were so confident they would be Trump I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>he didn&#39;t say that at all.  he was asked in the debate, given his statements about a &quot;rigged election&quot; (in reference to the dncleaks findings about dws institutionally supporting hrc over sanders, and to the media systematically attempting to derail trump&#39;s candidacy), whether or not he would concede the election to hillary in the event of losing on November 8th.  </p>

<p>His response was essentially: &quot;We&#39;ll see&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WALLACE: But, sir, there is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying that you&#39;re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country. Are you saying you&#39;re not prepared now to commit to that principle?</p>

<p>TRUMP: What I&#39;m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I&#39;ll keep you in suspense. OK?</p>

<p>CLINTON: Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that&#39;s horrifying. You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not, nor have I ever been a Trump supporter.  But the media reaction to his response made my blood boil.  We DID have evidence of a rigged process, and to assume that he should concede without question is ridiculous.  Al Gore didn&#39;t do it, and no candidate should be expected to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Polls, history, and demographic changes are all ways to predict an election. And 49 out of 50 states were guessed correctly by a website that said Trump would lose. Him winning was surprising for everybody. If it wasn&#39;t for you, you were delusional. Just because he ended up winning, (losing the popular vote by the biggest margin ever, mind you) doesn&#39;t mean if you said he would lose you are a shill/cuck/whatever altright fuckheads say these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice going to the extreme, but their polls were fake, and to say they actually speculating is absurd.</p>

<p>Some places did good polls, as results showed.</p>

<p>You seem to not know that many people were pretty sure that it was going to be very close, only a few people that bought into the MSM articles actually believed it was an easy win for Hillary man, I was pretty sure it could go both ways, just like my family, just like everyone.</p>

<p>I accept that there were delusional people saying it was a sure win for Hillary, usually with their HuffPo articles lmao.</p>

<p>Again, no it wasn&#39;t, just because most MSM outlets repeated it like a broken disc it means it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>We can catalogue those news from the media as &quot;fake news&quot; because they weren&#39;t telling the truth, they wanted people like you and your father (an ardent Trump supporter) to think there was no chance, and they were victorious with that.</p>

<p>Funny enough, convincing even the most ardent Trump supporters that they had no chance didn&#39;t change their vote, and in the end the truth was revealed and a new term was born: Fake News... Stay away from every news outlet giving you false info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont really know that source, but I&#39;d say go with the news that are the most close to reality.</p>

<p>A lot of news outlets made it easy by lying so much during the election, the best thing we can do is learn from it and keep looking for alternatives that are closer to whats actually happening and not so biased.</p>

<p>I admit its hard to find good sources, what I did this election was read everything from both sides, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> was my source on the left and <a href="/r/the_dolan">/r/the_dolan</a> my source from the right, I figure truth may be between those two, its not the best method but at least you understand both are pretty extreme and you basically learn that TV and biased web news are full of sensationalist bs.</p>

<p>The only way you can get accurate information is following the money. If someone says &quot;Buy this because its great!&quot; and they get donations from the company that makes that, be skeptical. Don&#39;t outright say it&#39;s lies, but have doubt. If someone says what we are doing for crime is working, and they take money from CCA, be skeptical. Once again, it can be their actual opinion, but don&#39;t out blind trust in them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The claim that Russia hacked the DNC to influence the elections isn&#39;t only a Trump vs Hillary issue, it&#39;s also a Russia vs USA issue. And the CIA isn&#39;t a Democratic tool, it&#39;s an American tool and it&#39;s more likely that it&#39;s acting for America rather than against Trump, its upcoming boss. You could reasonably claim that it&#39;s under President Obama currently, but if you listen to what Obama has to say it certainly seems he&#39;s trying to make Trump&#39;s transition into power as smooth as possible.</p>

<p>Trump dismissing the intelligence institutes that he&#39;s going to be in charge of soon is extremely worrisome to me and should worry you too. They&#39;re not infallible, but the problem here is that Trump thinks his own gut feeling is infallible, and his gut in this case tells him that he won fair and square - no, wait, it was all rigged against him, the polls were lying and millions voted illegally - and that Russia good Putin friend. This is serious business, which puts huge question marks not only on Russia-America relations but also all over Trump&#39;s personality and temperament. We&#39;re all in for a show. I hope it doesn&#39;t end badly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great points. Everyone is acting like Russia influencing the election is a straight up lie by the CIA to help the Democrats. I mean like you said, the CIA is far from infallible, but they do not exclusively work for the Democratic Party. There is clearly credible intel on Russia influencing this election, and everyone should be concerned about that. This is the conspiracy sub for Christ sake, and if Russia intervening in our election isn&#39;t a conspiracy worth looking into then what is? It&#39;s alarming how quickly it&#39;s being dismissed just because of all the Trump love here.</p>

<p>You know, it&#39;s possible to entertain an idea without accepting it as gospel. You can think critically about something and discuss it without completely subscribing to it. That was my point. Do I 100% believe the &quot;Russian hack&quot; narrative? No, there are serious questions I still have, mainly the fact that no real concrete evidence has been released publicly. But this doesn&#39;t make it automatically a complete fabrication. Everyone is being too dismissive. That&#39;s all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Crowdstrike et al basically believe the Russians did it bc it looks the way it did the last time(s) that &quot;the Russians did it&quot;... which was also never proven.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so sure Russia would leave an obv Russian fingerprint! And then do it again, the next year, and the year after that?</p>

<p>This is CIA playbook 101 - blame the current enemy, whoever that may be, whenever they are called upon to rampage. Have we all forgotten that the CIA is <em>actually</em> at war with Russia in Syria right now? Talk about a conflict of interest wrt &quot;truth&quot;.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, it&#39;s painful to watch how people just hold blatant disregard for the profession of others when the information doesn&#39;t suit your worldview.  It&#39;s no wonder we have so much war when you see something you disagree with and go &quot;See! FUCK this person.  They&#39;re a lying sack of shit shill!&quot;</p>

<p>If the tables were turned and it turns out Russia was vying for Hillary (which is a conspiracy people were pushing nonstop with the Uranium deal as well), you&#39;d be shitting a fucking brick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s former foreign policy adviser during the campaign was Russia this week pushing the narrative that 1. The Dems made evidence for hacks up and 2. The way the Crimean annexation was covered in the media was &quot;Fake news.&quot;</p>

<p>Paul Manafort was booted from campaign for Russian ties.</p>

<p>Cory Lewandowsky was booted for Russian ties.</p>

<p>Trump wants to remove ALL sanctions for no concessions from Russia.</p>

<p>Trump wants to concede that Crimea belongs to Russia.</p>

<p>Trump appointed a known Russian-friendly person to SoS.</p>

<p>That said, the democrats have been more fucked up this election cycle. But the key is to not forget the republicans are just as evil, even if they seen more reasonable now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting question. I, and I assume everyone else, probably has opinions on that issue, but I have great confidence that a group of bi-partisan experts could come up with a practical solution that people could accept. Plenty of people graduate with degrees in accounting, statistics, engineering, computers, and software. </p>

<p>We check scales used in commerce  and recalibrate them, shouldn&#39;t voting machines be functioning probably before the election? Maybe they are, but if so, the MSM doesn&#39;t put that on the front page. Imagine this --&quot;All of Detroit&#39;s machines checked and found to be working properly heading into tomorrow&#39;s election.&quot; </p>

<p>I think the public needs to agree that we want a fair election process first. We&#39;re still at the point where plenty of people, some of whom I know, don&#39;t believe that every citizen should be allowed to vote. I&#39;ve personally seen the over 2 hour voting lines and was disgusted by it. If you don&#39;t want groups to vote against you, figure out a way to bring them in to the fold, not another way to keep them from voting.</p>
