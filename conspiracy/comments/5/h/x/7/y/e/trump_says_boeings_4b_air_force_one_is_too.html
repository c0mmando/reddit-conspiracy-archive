       Excellent question, however I would think that if they hadn't the CIA would have already made a public statement distancing their agency from that article.  Instead what we heard was John McCain, a well known defense corporation shill, second the concerns raised in the article.  Both he and Obama were calling for an investigation.

       Which is fine so long as the is a real concern that an investigation is warranted.  But the FBI and wikileaks have explicitly stated that Russia was not the source for the DNCleaks nor the Podesta leaks (I believe they've stated neither. Could be one or the other, need to check again).

       I think an investigation of foreign influences on our election process is warranted, but what I find odd is the fact that it is only going to examine one very weakly alleged aspect of that influence.  We know Clinton took millions of dollars from a number of foreign governments.  Why has that not been investigated?  We know she took millions from the now EVIL Russians in the Uranium One deal. Where is that investigation?  This has a lot of stink on it.

       Tons of stink.  The election of Trump (of who I am not a fan, but also not super anti) was a sound rejection of liberal politics and policies.  This whole "fake news" narrative and "Russia did it" meme is their final gasp before a tumble into obsurity.  One that cannot happen quick enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I too support a full investigation into foreign influence in the 2016 election, but only if it's a full investigation, into both candidates.

       Trump is living very dangerously.  I think I would have waited to say something against the other aerogiant at least until the electoral college had voted.  He obviously does not know the power of the dark side.

       The powers that be know the American people won't accept any shenanigans from the electoral college.  Well, actually, they
       <em>
        don't

       because they're not that self-aware, but I've got the feeling that they're just going to sit quietly and keep smear campaigning for now.  And besides, fuck them. Trump's got balls, we can't live in fear of what the opposition

       ).  I'm sure they have other portions of the corporation that provides people and support to the intelligence agencies too, but that one is easy to spot.

       Trump just fabricated the budget for Boeing, crashed their stock and now is taking credit for a deal that has been in the workings for years by a lot of smart people. Now he is taking credit for getting the job done under 4 billion....this was his own fabricated figure. wow.

       Sorry if I'm not too weepy for Boeing.  Of course, overall their stock is up since Trump was elected.  The Air Force One program is pretty small for them.  Also I think you're right to be skeptical.  Talk is cheap and defense program budgets are cheaper still.

       What I would really like to see Trump do is put a stop to is the military's practice of paying these defense contractors more to drag out programs and ratchet their costs sky high.  I think I'm more hopeful on that front than you, but we'll see what happens next month.
