    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>It is in the FBI&#39;s best interest to make it appear as though they are not as powerful as everyone thinks. Maybe they don&#39;t care about the phone, or maybe they already broke in super easy. But they don&#39;t want people to know this. So they make a big deal about not being able to get in, and oh the terrorists are winning let&#39;s pass more legislation to help!</p>

<p>And Apple is already in bed with them. They might have unlocked the phone for them, in fact. But their customers wouldn&#39;t like this. So they also pretend, and say &quot;we are defending our customers!&quot; when actually it&#39;s all bullshit.</p>

<p>This is the same reason you will never hear of any instance of mass surveillance stopping a terrorist attack. They want people to think that it doesn&#39;t work, and that they&#39;re drowning in so much information they can&#39;t make sense of it, etc. That&#39;s all bullshit too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard this on a great podcast called &quot;Guns and Butter&quot; where they talk about recent false flags. They focus on Pulse and Paris mostly, but do mention San Bernardino where witnesses say the SB shooting was done by 3 white (paramilitary) men.
