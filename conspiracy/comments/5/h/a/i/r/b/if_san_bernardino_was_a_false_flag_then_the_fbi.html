       Yes.

       It is in the FBI's best interest to make it appear as though they are not as powerful as everyone thinks. Maybe they don't care about the phone, or maybe they already broke in super easy. But they don't want people to know this. So they make a big deal about not being able to get in, and oh the terrorists are winning let's pass more legislation to help!
      </p>
      <p>
       And Apple is already in bed with them. They might have unlocked the phone for them, in fact. But their customers wouldn't like this. So they also pretend, and say "we are defending our customers!" when actually it's all bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the same reason you will never hear of any instance of mass surveillance stopping a terrorist attack. They want people to think that it doesn't work, and that they're drowning in so much information they can't make sense of it, etc. That's all bullshit too.

       If anything, you can remove the battery from most phones except iPhones.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the battery is in, even if the phone is off, you are delivering metadata such as location.

       It did get worse. The FBI no longer needs to have others hack/decrypt/whathaveyou  to use it in court. They can do it themselves with help from alphabet agencies.

       Just like the UK as well, and I now get your point, they don't need these ploys as a curtain to breaking into someone's phone because it is now

       It returned user confidence in the possibility of privacy, though in reality it is a pure illusion. That made people buy more shit, which fixed the ecomony.

       I heard this on a great podcast called "Guns and Butter" where they talk about recent false flags. They focus on Pulse and Paris mostly, but do mention San Bernardino where witnesses say the SB shooting was done by 3 white (paramilitary) men. Here is the link, it is worth a listen:
