       From their google reviews: "Besta Pizza is a family owned and operated since August 1992. It was bought by the family from John Umble, it was named then Pizza Movers. We joined Pizza Boli's franchise a year later till early 2000. We had our differences with Pizza Boli's organization and parted ways around 2001 after a court battle in DC. (Pizza Boli's vs HIZ Inc.) Unfortunately we lost the case and with it, we lost the name and our phone numbers. We had to work hard to come up with a new name and logo and phone number. a friend recommended a friend , who turned around and recommended another friend to design a logo and the new name. We did that in two days and started printing our flyers under the new name and logo since. Lately we were accused of adopting that vulgar symbol and being associated with Comet pizza (Actually, they claimed that the owner of Comet Pizza also own Besta Pizza, Which is far from the truth), of running a sex-trafficking ring. We existed and been in business long before Comet became a neighbor. Actually, the land lord had to ask us for permission to allow Comet's owner to lease that space. We respect everybody's way of life, but at the same time we expect any person to verify their source of information before accusing innocent people of such a terrible behavior and in turn ruin their business. As soon as we were aware of the Logo's meanings, we immediately changed it. We apologize for any misunderstanding. Please feel free to contact us if you still need more verification or answers to your questions. It will take us a little time to update our signs due to tight cash flow situation. Thank you all for understanding. Regards, Besta Pizza"

       This is much more like the kind of response innocent people would give. Why wouldn't the others allegedly involved in PG make similar statements rather than dismissing as fake news?

       My gut tells me the besta pizza guys aren't involved. The biggest tie, other than proximity was that Andrew kline was the registered officer, but he is for 200 or more restaurants. We've debunked that it's the DOJ guy, and it's a normal hospitality/restaurant activity to have a registrar as DC requires a lawyer to handle filings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you debunk that, and look at the fact that besta has been around for 25 or so years, I think it could be a coincidence the logo is similar to known pedo stuff, especially since they've used that logo for 10 plus years.

       I loved it -- totally worth it if exploring strange and fantastic alien worlds sounds like a good time. There isn't a lot of gameplay or any multiplayer -- the developer overpromised a lot of features. But when I play games like Far Cry, I just like the exploring, I'm not an FPS guy.

       Pizza Movers? Doesn't sound much better to me. Sounds like another term for child trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did you decide on the name Besta Pizza again?
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll need the name of the man who designed your original logo. He needs to be questioned as it appears he is involved in pedophilia. Do you plan on suing him for damages?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you acknowledge the fact that you have a basement? Would you allow live feed video of your restaurant and the basement?

       Yes, I couldn't ever imagine why they wouldn't just give out someone's information to an angry mob of internet 'investigators'. What are they trying to hide?!?

       if they had nothing to hide it shouldn't be a problem to reveal the professional artist or firm who designed that logo. enough names have been revealed and no one has been hunted down for it.

       expect for a "lone gunman" plant, I have not seen any angry mobs. just investigators who are in fear for their lives, and millions of children that have  been abused and murdered for the disgusting beliefs of sick humans.

       This person owns a restaurant literally doors down from where a gunman showed up specifically because of this. You don't see why he might not be keen on publicly releasing personal info?

       Why don't you send me all the names of your relatives? If they have nothing to hide there should be no reason why you shouldn't send them to me, right?

       This is the proper way to argue:

      <p>
       Step 1) Don't make ad hominem attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 2) Try to find flaws in both your argument and your opponent's.

       Do you not realize that many small business don't have professional designers or firms when they start? More often than not they pay their friend's kid who is decent at art, to throw something together for $100. I know because I was that kid. Later in life, I redid logos for free because I was embarrassed that they were still using such trash.

       From what they're saying the logo is like 20 years old, which I believe as it certainly looks like something from the mid 90s.  Spirals were big back then.

       To anyone complaining that this is "too late", did you send a polite email asking for an explanation of the logo? Did you actually follow up on your beliefs through citizen journalism, or are you just fucking whining?
