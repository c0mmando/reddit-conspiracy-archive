        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not someone who believes everything the mainstream media says, so when I heard there was a child abuse ring centering around a local pizza restaurant (I live in DC and have been to Comet many times), I looked into it. I know about all the same evidence that you all do, but I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s any evidence pointing to a connection between Comet and child abuse. I also don&#39;t see any evidence that the Podestas have any involvement in child abuse. This is not to say that child abuse is not a serious problem, or that people in power don&#39;t engage in it. It is extremely serious, and it is almost certainly more widespread than most people know. But I have come to believe that Pizzagate is distracting from the real story.</p>

<p>I&#39;m posting this so that I can explain why I&#39;ve reached these conclusions. Ask me anything.</p>

<p>Update: Here are a few points to start with.  I will add to this as I go.</p>

<ul>
<li>Comet hosts &quot;edgy&quot; bands and shows.  This explains a lot of the satanic imagery, etc.  It may seem weird in the context of a restaurant, but it&#39;s not that weird if you have been to punk/indie shows.</li>
<li>Marina Abromovic is also an edgy artist, but she&#39;s very mainstream.  It&#39;s not weird that rich people would be interested in attending an event with her. </li>
<li>The Besta Pizza spiral logo is a coincidence.  It&#39;s not that hard to imagine that a pizza shop would use a pizza logo, and the spiral is not that far off.  It&#39;s also not clear how prevalent the spiral logo is as a symbol for pedophilia.  It seems like this is all based on a reference to a single FBI document.<br/></li>
<li>The Podesta emails referencing pizza don&#39;t actually show anything.  The &quot;pizza related map&quot; email is strange, but it probably refers to a map that has something to do with pizza.  There&#39;s just no connection to pedophilia based on this email alone.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Tony Podesta is a powerful Washington insider.  Dennis Hastert was a powerful Washington insider.  It is not strange that they would know each other.  Hastert had many friends in politics, and no one knew about his disgusting crimes.  At the time of the email where Podesta mentions keeping in touch with Hastert, I don&#39;t think the extent of his crimes were known.  Even if the charges were public, it&#39;s possible that he did not believe the allegations.  And it is not unusual for people to stand with their friends who have been accused of horrible crimes.  It does not implicate Hastert in those crimes.  (EDIT: I meant to write Podesta in that last sentence)</p>

<p>It is edgy, weird artwork.  But lots of artwork is edgy and weird.  Comet  hosted a lot of edgy, weird bands and artists.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t explain what a pizza related map is.  Maybe it is a map of manhattan with pizza places identified on it.  Who knows?  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair or reasonable to accuse someone of child abuse based on a reference this vague.  To turn it around on you, why would there be a map related to child abuse on a handkerchief, even if Podesta was a child abuser?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hotard/Chickenlovers/why does daddy like in the butt (picture of male toddler with legs raised showing bum)/gay baby/must have/put her on a menu (icons of heart eyes)/German baby -- &quot;don&#39;t touch!&quot;/baby..yum/ping pong in London sounds tempting! (images of cash and pills) etc. etc.   </p>

<p>Alefantis&#39; business partner &quot;Dr. Pong&quot; in Germany, menu contains three pictures: baby, pizza, hot dog plus sexual references.  </p>

<p>Amanda &quot;we all have our preferences&quot; Kleinman music video &quot;Neutered Nole&quot; contains images of babies and toddlers dressed up in pizza outfits and sexuall suggestive costumes (&quot;sugar babies&quot;, whoopee coushion etc.) interspliced with images of a Hindu pedophile guru and images of rape and sexual torture.   </p>

<p>Tony Podesta&#39;s artwork contains: images of children being abused in a sexual context, images of dead children, huge photograph of baby with adult hand reaching toward its crotch, painting of child&#39;s bedroom with boy hiding under bed, and bedroom filled with photographs of naked children.   That&#39;s the stuff he openly displays.   </p>

<p>How many super rich people dream about &quot;hot dog stands&quot; in Hawaii?  </p>

<p>Why did Luzzatto send unaccompanied children to a pool party at John Podesta&#39;s house, list their specific ages and describe them as &quot;entertainment&quot;?   Why did she refer to &quot;raw and uncut&quot; time with a toddler?  </p>

<p>Efit in Maddie McCann case exactly matches Tony and John.    </p>

<p>That&#39;s just the really obvious stuff.   Perhaps the more interesting investigations involve the Clinton Foundation, Hawaii connections, Haiti connections, organizations for &quot;troubled youth&quot; involving sketchy individuals donating massive amounts to Clinton foundation etc.      </p>

<p>The best that can said about the Podestas and the Comet crew is that they are utterly obsessed with pedophilia but that there is no hard evidence they&#39;ve gone beyond the fantasy stage.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a lot.  Let me try to respond to all of it but please let me know if I miss something.  I&#39;m typing this up really fast but would be happy to discuss anything in particular</p>

<p>Instagram: He probably has a lot of friends and relatives with kids.  It&#39;s not that unusual to post pictures of your relatives&#39; cute kids.  &quot;Put her on the menu&quot; is not that weird; people say things like &quot;I could just eat him up,&quot; meaning it&#39;s a cute baby.  The German baby is a picture of a creepy doll that he thought was funny.  Ping pong in London sounds tempting -- I&#39;m not sure, but why does this suggest child abuse of any kind?  &quot;Hotard&quot; -- again, not sure.  Weird comment to post on a picture of a baby.  But it does not come close to suggesting child abuse to me</p>

<p>Dr Pong -- the sexual reference is describing a cocktail.  It&#39;s not that weird.  There&#39;s a famous cocktail called sex on the beach.</p>

<p>Kleinman -- she&#39;s an edgy punk/indie artist.  There are many musicians who do / say provocative things and make subversive videos.  I can give many examples if you want that have nothing to do with Comet</p>

<p>Art -- again, art is often weird and subversive.  I wouldnt put this stuff in my house but there&#39;s no accounting for taste.  </p>

<p>Hawaii -- they probably had a really good hot dog in Hawaii.  It doesn&#39;t seem weird to me.</p>

<p>Pool party -- kids are entertaining.  It also might mean they are a handful (using entertaining in a sarcastic sense).  Raw and uncut is a term people use to refer to unedited footage.</p>

<p>Efit -- Can you tell me what you think is suspicious here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A for effort, D for execution.   For future shilling efforts I would recommend a little more give.   No one&#39;s buying the idea that grown men go around constantly making explicit sexual comments about kids and toddlers.   Same with Tony&#39;s art collection.   One or two dark themed pictures could be explained away, but this guy&#39;s house is practically overflowing with pedophilic art.   Here&#39;s an idea: you could say that Tony may have been molested as a child and art is his way of coming to terms with his abuse.   Something like that.   Kleinman?  Her whole schtick is about sexually molesting and murdering kids.   If her work is just supposed to be &quot;provocative&quot; then why not explain her motivation instead of claiming everything is &quot;fake news&quot;?   </p>

<p>Again, these people are obsessed with pedophilia.   I&#39;m not sure why they are acting surprised that people are raising concerns given that they hang out at a place crawling with kids.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I told you I was typing fast, I can get into more detail but I don&#39;t have unlimited time.  I promise you I&#39;m not a shill, I&#39;m trying to discuss this with people and hopefully convince them or learn something I didn&#39;t know.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see &quot;constant&quot; sexual comments about kids and toddlers.  I don&#39;t really see any, actually.  The only thing that seems close is &quot;hotard.&quot;  What other ones are most concerning to you?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a couple piece of art that are dark.  Can you point me to a collection of all of them?  Again though, it just doesn&#39;t seem that strange to me.  </p>

<p>I have no idea what Kleinman&#39;s motivation is.  Maybe to shock people.  But the fact that she played at Comet doesn&#39;t meant Comet/Alefantis/Podestas have anything to do with child abuse.   And please don&#39;t accuse me of calling something &quot;fake news.&quot;   The term is obviously BS made up by the mainstream media to explain the election results.  I would never use that term. </p>

<p>&quot;They hang out at a place crawling with kids.&quot;  It&#39;s a restaurant where people go with their families.  Kids like pizza.  They also have shows there and a bar, so adults go there.  It&#39;s just not that weird. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your explanation for hotard?  </p>

<p>Chickenlovers, &quot;baby...yum,&quot; Gay baby, German baby -- don&#39;t touch!   </p>

<p>Start there.  </p>

<p>Hell the picture Alefantis chose for his avatar is the patron saint of pederasts.   His &quot;family tradition&quot; for a birthday cake (Tony and Alefantis share birthday dates and party together) is modeled after a baby&#39;s flaccid penis (or a man with a very, very small penis).  </p>

<p>I mean, if it was just one comment or one artwork or one image then I could see why skeptics would dismiss everything.   But you have to look at the totality.   </p>

<p>Do you think it normal for a grown man to have numerous photographs of naked kids in his bedroom?   Along with stuffed animals? </p>

<p>I also find the reaction utterly bizarre.   Kleinman appeared on a radio show and claimed everything was &quot;fake news.&quot;  Yet as I said, her whole schtick is about pedophilia and child murder.   Why in the world would should be surprised that people were expressing concerns?   Why didn&#39;t she try to defend her &quot;art&quot;?   </p>

<p>You alleged &quot;skeptics&quot; would suffer less shill accusations if you simply acknowledged that these people have an inordinate infatuation with pedophilia.   Instead you dismiss what is plainly obvious to anyone with two eyes.   </p>

<p>Edit: on &quot;hotard&quot; -- as I said here <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5havvg/i_have_investigated_pizzagate_with_an_open_mind/dayvoox/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5havvg/i_have_investigated_pizzagate_with_an_open_mind/dayvoox/</a>, the commenter says &quot;you are becoming my favorite hashtagger #hotard.&quot; Isn&#39;t it likely he is referring to Alefantis, and not the baby in the picture?  And even if he is referring to the baby, isn&#39;t it possible that&#39;s just an awful and incredibly tasteless joke? People make &quot;dead baby&quot; jokes all the time, but they don&#39;t mean it sincerely. It&#39;s possible it&#39;s just someone with a sick sense of humor.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t have time to dig around for all this stuff.   But it&#39;s out there.   Re: Chickenlover.   There are academic books about gay slang using the term going back to the 70&#39;s.  There is zero possibility that Elfantis didn&#39;t know what it meant.   </p>

<p>Okay.   But I think she would be much better off explaining what she was trying to achieve by eg The Neutered Nole.   Claiming everything is &quot;fake news&quot; only increases the suspicion.  To re-iterate, the video intercuts images of children and babies dressed up in pizza costumes, &quot;sugar babies&quot; costumes, puppies etc with graphic images of torture, rape, sexual torture, and Hindu pedophile gurus.   Her callous, snarky and nonchalant attitude towards pedophilia and extreme sexual abuse (&quot;we all have our preferences&quot;) is made more disturbing by the fact that she used to work with mentally disabled children.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not even Tony Podesta?   This is why people like myself have a hard time believing you &quot;skeptics&quot; are arguing in good faith.   You&#39;re telling me that decorating your room with stuffed animals and photographs of naked children, then decorating your living room with pictures of abused kids and dead kids and paintings of little kids hiding under their beds doesn&#39;t denote an obsession with pedophilia?   That doesn&#39;t make any sense to me.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many of us who have seen the evidence and dont believe it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no problem with that, provided you acknowledge that these individuals seem to be infatuated with pedophilia.   It&#39;s certainly possible that they&#39;re just depraved weirdos and have never committed an illegal act.   That is a defensible position, &quot;fake news&quot; is not.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have a dark sense of humor.  I&#39;ve laughed at pedophile jokes.   But it would never occur to me in a million years to make jokes about pedophilia when friends/relatives send me pictures of their kids.   </p>

<p>I&#39;ll have to sign off now.   I give you credit for at least attempting to address some of the relevant information instead of yelling &quot;alt-right conspiracy theory fake news!&quot;   The media is only compounding suspicions by absurdly pretending this is &quot;Russian propaganda.&quot;  </p>

<p>I&#39;m no sexual prude but I see a lot of very disturbing stuff here.  As I said, it&#39;s all circumstantial and there is no hard evidence (unless you count the Podesta bros efits) but there is a reason so many people are concerned.   It doesn&#39;t help that authorities have a history of covering up elite pedo rings.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I searched &quot;chickenlover&quot; on google and google books, and didn&#39;t find any reference to it being used as &quot;gay slang.&quot;  The only evidence I&#39;ve seen is the screencap.  If there is more, please show me.  If you don&#39;t have time to research these things, you shouldn&#39;t cite them as evidence.  </p>

<p>It seems like Kleinman plays a character in her performances.  That&#39;s why she says &quot;we all have our preferences.&quot;  Why would she admit to child abuse on video?</p>

<p>Again, show me some links to Tony Podesta&#39;s art that depicts naked children.  I&#39;ve seen extremely creepy paintings from artists that the Podestas like, but none of them are shown to actually be owned by the Podestas.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some very disturbing stuff if you look at things that aren&#39;t connected to the people being targeted in this.  But they&#39;ve had their reputations ruined by people who are accusing them of a horrible crime, when none of the evidence actually suggests they have a connection to it. </p>

<p>Also, people come to DC&#39;s hirshhorn modern art gallery with their small kids all the time. Google their collection you will see some weird inappropriate stuff. It doesn&#39;t mean the people who bring their kids there are satanic, abusers, or even bad people.</p>

<p>The other one is in the bathroom I believe.  The male figure with the erection playing ping pong with an alien.  LOL.  Someone wrote something about fucking nearby.  I do not recall the exact phrase.  </p>

<p>Yes, I looked at the Hirshhorn Modern gallery, and I see what you mean.  That is one of the problems.  I cannot take my community standards and apply them to another community, like DC.  For example, I have visited San Francisco several times, and their community standards are out there, as you can imagine.  I do not recall seeing anything that made me feel weird in San Francisco, but I probably just did not go to the &quot;right&quot; places.  LOL.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main problem is that alone or in a few scattered instances these could be explained away by someone determined NOT to believe this is possible.</p>

<p>The problem is that you explain one... and there&#39;s another... you try to explain that... there is another.</p>

<p>At what point to you back up and say... there is just a whole shitload of circumstantial evidence here. Perhaps we should at least ask questions, how we uncomfortable of the people in these emails. </p>

<p>What makes me really wonder what the duck is going on is the coordinated media campaign designed to pooh pooh this and claim that it has been debunked which literally no one has  or that it started with Comet Pizza or that it was started by the alt right. This is outright lying.</p>

<p>If they lie to cover up is it not likely they are covering for an even LARGER lie?</p>

<p>I think we are going to see this whole thing blown open soon. I think they ( the corrupt degenerated establishment)are shitting themselves because Trump won which was not in their calculations and now they run the risk of this whole thing coming to light because they&#39;ve lost control of the power levers. </p>

<p>Look in to the banned Discovery Channel documentary &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot;. It shows how these things can be covered up.
This is not a Partisan issue... the sickos are in both parties.</p>

<p>to start I am not a prude, and very open minded to lifestyle choices. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve known &quot;edgy artists&quot; my whole life, and never have seen them so blatently obssesed with the Occult and Pedophila on this level - maybe some death metal bands or shock rockers, MM etc...but nothing compares to the amount of sick from this group.</p>

<p>to even joke AT ALL about hurting children is beyond my comprehension, and these people are just flaunting it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah &quot;keeping in touch&quot; with someone isn&#39;t incriminating, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>The pizza-related map sounds like something my wife would say when she was hungry. Dropping a hint. It&#39;s dinnertime at the time of that email, maybe they had plans?</p>

<p>If you read the whole email chain, the realtor informed Susan about the handkerchief that was left behind. The realtor gives no information other than it&#39;s a &quot;square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black).&quot; Nothing about a map. Susan forwards the chain to Podesta.</p>

<p>So where does this additional information about the map come from? A phone call from the realtor? Or is it just added in by Susan because she knows all about his handkerchiefs? We don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>The fact that Susan adds the information about the map in there leads me to believe it&#39;s just a reminder that she&#39;s hungry, or it&#39;s an inside joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but it does mean there is is probably a code being used if there are tons of weird uses of the english language that I don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>You are right, we don&#39;t know for sure what the code is about, but we can make reasonable guesses by looking into the other stuff they are into, what they do in their spare time, who their friends are, what crimes they have been convicted of, etc. True, there is no 100% undeniable hard evidence such as video of rapes and such. The thing is, not looking further because of this lack of hard proof when there is mountains of extremely suspicious circumstantial evidence is irresponsible, and trying to get other people to quit looking is incomprehensible to many people.</p>

<p>I wish you the best, but imagine for a second that this turns out to be undeniably true, like what happened with the UK government pedo scandal, which side do you want to be on?</p>

<p>These people are close friends with convicted rapists, they have an island known for having sex slaves, they have been arrested in other countries for pedophilia, some have done time here for pedophilia. I&#39;m not saying it is certainly true that everyone involved is raping children, but this is what happens when you surround yourself with these types of people. If you are even doubting the satanic rituals, then you are clearly uninformed or willfully ignorant, but trying to convince when you have already made up your mind(from the looks of things before you even investigated, if you even did) is most likely a lost cause at this point in your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I addressed the Marina Abramovic thing in my post.  She&#39;s an edgy performance artist and her art references the occult etc.  I think she was hosting a dinner, referencing the name of one of her old &quot;spirit cooking&quot; performance art pieces, for some rich people.  I don&#39;t think the dinner was art.  It was a way for her to connect with rich people.  Artists need rich people to collect their art, so they&#39;re going to try to flatter them and interact with them.  On the other side, rich people like knowing artists because it makes them feel cool and relevant.  </p>

<p>Spirit cooking was the name of one of her old pieces.  I think she named the dinner after it as an homage to that.  I don&#39;t think they were actually performing rituals.  THis is the only evidence people have of such rituals so it&#39;s definitely not enough to say that the Podestas perform satanic rituals.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are many reasons that people do this stuff, but one of the big reasons is that it is politically bonding. These people are the ones watching each other in their political lives, once they have done this kind of stuff with each other, they don&#39;t have to worry about morally questionable acts in their work life and they are able to get a lot more done. Also, it keeps them from ratting each other out for anything because they have the power to destroy each others lives with this kind of stuff. Nobody wants to stab anybody in the back either because of the threat of the group, imagine what kind of turmoil extremely powerful &#39;satan worshiping&#39; people would be ok with putting someone through.</p>

I get it, it is a bummer, but ignoring facts to try to create a narrative that makes it seem like your leaders are saints really truly doesn&#39;t serve you in the long run. Remember awhile back when you said it was truth you were after? Go for truth and see where it leads you, if it helps maybe try backing of for a bit and look through history some and see how things have played out and then maybe you will be able to see more of what people are talking about here with a fresh perspective. Try to separate how you want it to be, and what the writing on the wall is implying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not stabbing someone in the back is quite different from covering for a pedophile.  I wouldn&#39;t cover for a member of my family if I found out they were abusing children and I definitely wouldn&#39;t  cover for a co-worker no matter how much we bonded. Also, I watch a lot of horror movies and have played video games where you shoot people. Does this mean I&#39;m a devious person?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I am not being clear, what is bonding about doing horrible stuff is that it bonds everyone who is doing it, because it makes them all know that they don&#39;t have to worry about accidentally doing something in front of each other later on that is morally questionable, they already went all the way together. Furthermore, it gives them all stuff to hold over each others heads to keep them from ratting each other out. Satanic worship is nothing new in government and royalty, it has been going on for ages, we just tend to want to act like it only ever happens in the past.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you mean about video games, I see staring at a screen as completely different than using blood, semen, breast milk, urine, and feces in rituals that are supposed communications with the devil.</p>

<p>&quot;Everything depends on which context you are doing what you are doing. If you are doing the occult magic in the context of art or in a gallery, then it is the art. If you are doing it in different context, in spiritual circles or private house or on TV shows, it is not art. The intention, the context for what is made, and where it is made defines what art is or not.&quot; - Marina</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;If there’s nothing to PizzaGate, why have researchers found an image on Jimmy Comet’s Instagram of him at a private book party with Lady Lynn Rothschild—one of Hillary’s strongest backers in elite circles—and David Brock, creator of troll shop Correct The Record and propagandist establishment rag Media Matters. Although this proves nothing, we now know that “Jimmy Comet” of PizzaGate fame, at the least, had social relations with Lady Rothschild and Brock. That is unusual; why is a random pizza shop owner hanging with Rothschilds and longtime Clinton insiders like Brock? Some have found the trolling against PizzaGate researchers to be almost identical to Correct The Record’s flavor of attack during the election, rather than being an attack sourced back to any state-sponsored entity. Why would a random pizza shop, maligned by “Internet trolls,” have the resources for a national Correct The Record counter-campaign? It doesn’t make a lot of sense.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ted Gunderson was one of the <a href="https://glomardisclosure.com/2016/07/06/ted-gunderson-from-cointelpro-planner-to-criminal-and-conspiracy-theorist/">architects of COINTELPRO</a>, and was the Los Angeles FBI Bureau Chief.  </p>

<p><strong>Ted Gunderson single-handedly destroyed the investigation into the 1984 McMartin preschool pedophile case</strong>, which was prosecuted by Gunderson&#39;s pal, Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner.</p>

<p><a href="http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2005/07/interview-with-jackie-mcgauley-part_19.html"><strong>Here is an interview with one of the mothers</strong></a> <strong>who credits Gunderson with being COINTELPRO.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did Ted Gunderson enter both the investigation and your personal life? How long did you live together?</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to clear up the misconception that gunderson (I never capitalize his name) was involved in the investigation. He was never formally hired or paid in any way. He simply stuck himself in by offering to do things. Who wouldn&#39;t trust the retired chief of the Los Angeles division of the FBI who introduced you to senators and former State Attorney Generals? Some things we allowed him to do but many of his ideas and attempts to take over were rejected.</p>

<p>He was a persistent presence. He became so annoying that <em>eventually the parents would not talk to him</em>. I always thought in some way that he would help our cause. He was present at the Archaeological dig as often as he could and he talked to the ever present media as the rest of us were exhausted or did errands for the crew. At the time we did not know what he was up to and did not think it would be harmful to let him talk, as we thought he said positive things.</p>

<p>I want you to know that allowing him to be involved was the demise of any credibility we had.</p>

<p><strong>His reputation was well known by law enforcement, but he is such a slick con man that we had no clue what we were getting ourselves into.</strong> I have to say that it was mostly my fault for letting him be involved. Later I found out he was COINTELPRO. Years later when I read the description of that program it all made perfect sense.  I met ted at a California State Social Services Hearing ion San Diego, where I was formally asked, by an invitation I got in the mail, to testify. He approached me in the hallway because I was known then for keeping a file of documentation on the issue. I had appeared on several news programs and talk shows.</p>

<p>How he wormed his way into my home is a rather long story. Basically he tried to hire me to not only work with him, but do research for attornies, which I did maybe twice, then started hanging around our apartment. I had just been diagnosed with malignant melanoma and while waiting for results of the test, was told I may only have three months to live. He got into a nasty fight with my downstairs neighbor and my landlord doubled my rent. I had thrown him out once because of his nasty temper towards the neighbors. While looking for another place to live and still communicating with him, he found a big house one block from my children&#39;s school. Needless to say the children loved the house. Against my better judgment, I agreed to let him move in with us and share expenses. This was almost immediately after we finished finding the tunnels at the preschool. I was not only exhausted, but I had contracted Psittacosis (parrot fever) which can be fatal. My temperature was so high seemed as if I were cooking from the inside. I was very sick for weeks, ted refused to help me. He took the checks I had made out to pay bills and told me he had to give his daughter the money. That was just the start of almost 4 years of my decent into debt and serious health problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have some ideas I have shared before.</p>

<p>I believe it was started by opponents of HRC as a way to discredit her. After it gained steam, and especially after the election, the Trump campaign decided to use it for their own purposes as well.</p>

<p>What purpose? Flood the internet with &#39;Fake News&#39; to stir up outrage. This provides perfect cover for Trump&#39;s often stated desire to censor enemies in the media and online.</p>

<p>He has already suggested we need wider libel laws and &#39;someone&#39; to regulate what is allowed to be said and written. Specifically about HIM.</p>

<p>Trump has coupled this approach with an attack on the First Amendment by co-opting the battle over the flag. Many people feel very strongly that the flag should not be burned. They would probably support new laws to that effect. Which would open a Pandora&#39;s Box of issues in terms of the First Amendment.</p>

<p>This is all happening now, and all around us. The &#39;Fake News&#39; movement likely started with a different purpose and has now been seen as a good tool for future use in the name of censorship. An effort to curtail Freedom of Speech.</p>

<p>I am sure others have different answers, but this seems the most likely to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My view is that it may have started as in inside joke on 4chan. Or wherever. Or it WAS an effort to help a political opponent. I do not really know or have an opinion on how PG got its start.</p>

<p>And then it REALLY took off and became a self sustaining force.</p>

<p>But I think it is now being used to provide an excuse to clamp down on media and political opponents of the incoming government.</p>

<p>All the complaining about fake news, the exposes, the righteous anger. Someone is going to put this to use and is likely fanning the flames.</p>

<p>The most obvious suspect, in that event, has to be the new government. It benefits them exclusively.</p>

<p>Edit: No, I don&#39;t believe PG. If a smoking gun is ever produced I may change my mind but I am not holding my breath. Whether it&#39;s real is irrelevant. The people believing it are real, and they can be used for real political gain. They will be unwitting enablers of the Trump government if my ideas have any steam. Also to be determined.</p>

<p>but the downside, if I am right, is to lose our Freedom of Speech. That is a rather serious downside.</p>

<p>the people who do this stuff get away with everything else, our assertion is that certain things are considered winks that only they get and the rubes will never pick up on.  </p>

<p>Except we did.  </p>

<p>I would like to know what a pizza related map is.  What do you actually think a pizza related map is?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with you that there is a lot of strange symbology everywhere.  A couple weird paintings and bands in a restaurant that hosts indie music and art shows doesn&#39;t suggest anything weird.  And which instagram pics are bizarre? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s strange to post pics of your friends and relatives&#39; kids.  What else involves children, except for a pizza restaurant in a neighborhood full of families?  </p>

<p>Who are the people involved who get away with everytihng else?  What criminal activity have the Podestas gotten away with?  Think about Hillary Clinton, who is way more powerful, getting investigated a week before election day.  Or Denny Hastert, one of the most powerful DC politicians, who is rotting in jail for abusing kids.</p>

<p>The pizza related map thing is a weird phrase.  Maybe it is a handkerchief with a picture of Manhattan on it with pizza places identified?  Who knows.  Doesn&#39;t suggest child abuse to me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not seen any evidence that &quot;chickenlover&quot; refers to any sort of sexual slang, except for the one screenshot that people keep posting.  If you google &quot;chicken lover&quot; or &quot;chickenlover&quot; all the references are to pizzagate or an episode of south park, except for that one screenshot.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my guess: &quot;chickenlover&quot; is a reference to pizza.  Pizza hut makes pizzas with similar name: &quot;meat lover&quot; &quot;veggie lover&quot; and guess what, &quot;chicken lover&quot; <a href="https://www.pizzahut.ca/menu/pizza">https://www.pizzahut.ca/menu/pizza</a> .... Perhaps the guy and his kid just had a pizza with chicken on it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a complete guess.  But it is far more likely that it&#39;s true than that it is a reference to child rape that they are just putting out there on a public Instagram for the world to see.  When you go around accusing people of horrible crimes you need to have better evidence than this. </p>

<p>When I look at that pic it looks like a father (or uncle, etc) holding his child.  For people to assume that a picture of a man holding a child, plus a random hashtag that you don&#39;t understand, means that these people are sexually abusing children is incredibly disturbing to me.  Do you think all fathers of young kids are suspect?? </p>

<p>me: &#39;there is evidence of a global elite pedophile ring and the people in it use code language&#39; </p>

<p>you: &#39;no there isn&#39;t evidence of that&#39;</p>

<p>me: &#39;how about conspiracy of silence, the dutreaux affair, the dupont case, the pentagon child porn reported by anderson cooper on cnn, the DEA sex parties, jeffrey epstein and bill clinton, the isle of little st james, jimmy saville and the bbc cover up, and x00,000 missing children a year and global epidemic of human trafficking&#39;  </p>

<p>you: &#39;nope, there&#39;s no evidence&#39;</p>

<p>me: &#39;here&#39;s a bunch of emails of elites who enjoy naked pictures of children talking about code language in exactly the code language pedophiles are known to use&#39; </p>

<p>you: &#39;nope, still no evidence&#39; </p>

<p>me: &#39;here i have dragged you to the place where they are actually raping trafficked children, they are in that room there doing it and a child just left bleeding and crying&#39; </p>

<p>you: &#39;still no evidence&#39; </p>

<p>me: &#39;(dragging you in the room where they are actually raping children before our very eyes) SEE RIGHT THERE AS THE GENITALS TOUCH AND THE CHILD IS CRYING&#39; </p>

<p>you: &#39;no, see reality isnt contiguous, that could just be our imagination playing tricks on us, and really, at the molecular level are any two genitals really touching?  the subatomic model states that at smaller scales everything is really just kept apart by electromagnetic fields&#39;  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s called the &#39;no true scotsman&#39;, where you are so crazy that you discount all evidence because there actually exists no evidence in the world that would convince you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, no.  I haven&#39;t denied all those other incidents you cite.  I specifically said that I created this thread to explain why I don&#39;t think the Comet/Podesta allegations are true.  Are you saying that because those other things are true, this is true too?</p>

<p>There is so little evidence that this is a code language that pedophiles are known to use.  That part is all based on a couple screenshots passed around a thousand times.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, people are known to talk about pizza in non-code language, because pizza is a popular food.  </p>

<p>I am discounting evidence that I don&#39;t think shows anything, and explaining why I don&#39;t think it shows anything.  I specifically explained to you what I thought an instagram comment meant and your response is this nonsense, citing every conspiracy in the world.  The proof that I won&#39;t discount all evidence is that I believe a number of these, but only when there is actually enough evidence to do so.  For Comet/Podestas, there&#39;s just none.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard for me to understand how you and so many others have deluded yourselves into believing this based on so little.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. No one should be convicted before the facts are aired. However the media coverage on this has just been disingenuous.</p>

<p>It has NOT been debunked or even investigated.  It smacks of a &quot;nothing to see here, move along, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain&quot; mentality. </p>

<p>The only thing I have to say about Comet is that there is no way in hell that place should be an all ages place,and after seeing the shit on instagram, the artists the owner admires, and the company he keeps I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t eat there never mind bring my kids to it. Doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a criminal but it doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t either.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking about the White House flying in hot dogs from Chicago?  Sounds like a really bad example of bad government waste if it&#39;s true.  Chicago is known for it&#39;s hot dogs, and Obama is from Chicago, so it&#39;s not surprising that the White House  would fly in Chicago dogs for an event.  I&#39;ve been to an event (nongovernment) where BBQ was flown in from Texas.  The $65k pricetag seems really high even for that, but then remember the email referencing it is total hearsay, I don&#39;t know of any other confirmation that the White House actually spent that much.  Could just be a random person&#39;s exaggeration.  Even if they did spend that much, how does it in any way suggest child abuse unless you already assume &quot;hot dog&quot; is a code word??  Also, this doesn&#39;t implicate the Podestas or Comet at all.</p>

<p>true - hong didn&#39;t have phots of himself fucking a child.  but as a direct result of the &quot;code&quot; in podesta&#39;s emails, 100&#39;s of pedo accounts that twitter were exposed (and quickly shut down - including Jack Dorsey&#39;s account, temporarily).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your bar for what constitutes grounds for asking some basic questions is pretty high. </p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping that even if it&#39;s being done quietly the proper people are asking questions of these people.</p>

<p>If someone was accusing me of this nasty shit I&#39;d be at least very vocal about how ridiculous the charges are being leveled against me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. He was asked if this symbol was a signal that this particular child was in danger. He explained that no it wasn&#39;t a mark targeting a child it was common code in pedophile circles.</p>

<p>On another note. Apparently, this isn&#39;t he first time Podesta has had pedo accusations thrown at him.
That&#39;s a bad track record for a political figure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have some ideas I have shared before.</p>

<p>I believe it was started by opponents of HRC as a way to discredit her. After it gained steam, and especially after the election, the Trump campaign decided to use it for their own purposes as well.</p>

<p>What purpose? Flood the internet with &#39;Fake News&#39; to stir up outrage. This provides perfect cover for Trump&#39;s often stated desire to censor enemies in the media and online.</p>

<p>He has already suggested we need wider libel laws and &#39;someone&#39; to regulate what is allowed to be said and written. Specifically about HIM.</p>

<p>Trump has coupled this approach with an attack on the First Amendment by co-opting the battle over the flag. Many people feel very strongly that the flag should not be burned. They would probably support new laws to that effect. Which would open a Pandora&#39;s Box of issues in terms of the First Amendment.</p>

<p>This is all happening now, and all around us. The &#39;Fake News&#39; movement likely started with a different purpose and has now been seen as a good tool for future use in the name of censorship. An effort to curtail Freedom of Speech.</p>

<p>I am sure others have different answers, but this seems the most likely to me.</p>

I don&#39;t know what is going on for you that you feel it so important to jump through these mental hoops, but I sure hope for your sake that are able to look back on this part of your life someday and let out a big &quot;What the fuck was I thinking?&quot;. I imagine if you saw the Clintons holding hands and sliding babies onto poles in your back yard you would say it is just Fox News uploading thoughts to your brain, there is always some way to try and skew things the way you want to, and you are skewing hard my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking about the White House flying in hot dogs from Chicago?  Sounds like a really bad example of bad government waste if it&#39;s true.  Chicago is known for it&#39;s hot dogs, and Obama is from Chicago, so it&#39;s not surprising that the White House  would fly in Chicago dogs for an event.  I&#39;ve been to an event (nongovernment) where BBQ was flown in from Texas.  The $65k pricetag seems really high even for that, but then remember the email referencing it is total hearsay, I don&#39;t know of any other confirmation that the White House actually spent that much.  Could just be a random person&#39;s exaggeration.  Even if they did spend that much, how does it in any way suggest child abuse unless you already assume &quot;hot dog&quot; is a code word??  Also, this doesn&#39;t implicate the Podestas or Comet at all.</p>
