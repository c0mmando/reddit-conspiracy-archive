    <div class="md"><p>The earth can’t be a flat plane, because we’ve measured its curve. You, too, can precisely measure (and assign a number to) how much curvature, without having to estimate things with ships over the horizon, or trusting NASA not to lie to you!</p>

<p>First, picture a regular ball.  If you pick a spot on the ball, you can trace a line a quarter of the way around, turn 90 degrees, trace another line a quarter of the way, turn 90 degrees, and trace a line a quarter of the way around, you’ll end up back where you started.  <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Spherical_trigonometry_basic_triangle.svg">Here</a> is a visual.  You just made a triangle with 270 degrees!</p>

<p>If the earth is round, you can do the same thing on it as well.  Go from the north pole to the equator, a quarter of the way around the equator, then back to the north pole.  If the earth really is a sphere, you’ll always be going straight, and always making right turns, but you’ll still end up where you started.</p>

<p>However, I’m not rich enough to do that, and I doubt you are too.  So we can do it on a smaller scale.  You can pick ANY 3 point on the globe.  The farther they are the easier it will be to measure, but any local hills, mountains, or tall buildings will do.  So, now that you have your land marks, you can use a theodolite or other surveying equipment to measure the distances and angles to the other two points.  From this, you should be able to construct a triangle.  You’ll find that your triangle will be slightly larger than 180 degrees (the bigger your triangle, the more it will be over).  If you’re really hard core you can use <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalTriangle.html">some</a> pretty annoying <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalTrigonometry.html">math</a> and figure out the whole triangle with only a part of it actually measured.</p>

<p>This is actually how people were able to precisely measure the curvature of the earth for centuries before GPS and other such systems became available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, gravity draws matter to the same point. Not in to a complicated hollow sphere torus shape. That&#39;d be like if you dropped 100 rocks and they fell perfectly in to the shape of an arch. </p>

<p>So you think the electromagnetics of the planet are so strong they override the gravity? What is generating this electromagnetic field? Why hasn&#39;t it ever been measured? Instead the one we measure is much weaker than what would be required for something so fantastical.</p>

<p>Why are you pushing this narrative? Are you getting paid, or are you just caught up in trying to see beyond what most people can see and falling for nonsense as a result? I&#39;m worried about you either way, you can find better employment, and you can find better hidden truths that are actually true. You should have more respect for yourself than to believe such nonsense. </p>

<p>Look at this video, look at how the earth goes from convex to concave as the camera rotates, total fish eye lens effect, and every clear shot of earth from space has the same fish eye lens effect.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cLl7oqdm_B8?t=14m46s">https://youtu.be/cLl7oqdm_B8?t=14m46s</a></p>

<p>Magnetic fields don&#39;t require round objects, in fact toroidal objects are better at distributing magnetic fields.</p>

<p>The Earth&#39;s tilt is 23.4 degrees right? 90-23.4 = 66.6</p>

<p>How do you determine the tilt of the earth it&#39;s inferred by circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>What view from outer space, all we have is composite images.</p>

<p>How is it that the image taken from Apollo is different from an image you see today? Which one is real?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not pretty obvious it&#39;s confusing if you actually look at both sides of the argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like it. If you had observed the sky you&#39;d know Venus is essentially tidally locked to us, for whatever strange reason, it&#39;s the only planet in the solar system that spins in counter rotation to the earth. Whenever it makes an Earth approach it always does so by the same face, and no, neither Venus nor Mercury are tidally locked to the sun(which you&#39;d expect given their proximity, especially Mercury), however the sun rotates at the same speed as the moon. You can confirm all of this yourself, and you can also confirm that neither NASA nor anyone else can explain these facts with nothing more than circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>Another thing we can&#39;t explain is where the gravitational boundary of massive objects lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No prob, just trying to get at the truth, like I said, I don&#39;t believe either, I believe something else entirely. I think it&#39;s close to a sphere but not quite, there&#39;s a lot of peculiarities, but they could just be vagaries of perception. The problem is it&#39;s hard to come to a solid conclusion because you&#39;re always going to be making that conclusion based on certain assumptions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But <em>why</em>? Why would gravity make a hollow torus instead of a sphere like every other planet? And why would humanity 1) never figure this out and 2) hide it forever among those who <em>had</em> figured it out?</p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t make sense. Because it&#39;s wrong. Unless you believe the Earth is artificial and this is all some super-advanced alien experiment, in which case I <em>still</em> don&#39;t know why it wouldn&#39;t be a sphere because that would be the easiest for many many reasons, like every other planet. Why would they expend so much energy to keep the earth in this fantastical shape, against gravity.</p>

<p>Also if the earth were hollow it would be much less dense, and it would have a different orbit, and all planetary physics would be wrong as a result</p>

<p>So you think the electromagnetics of the planet are so strong they override the gravity? What is generating this electromagnetic field? Why hasn&#39;t it ever been measured? Instead the one we measure is much weaker than what would be required for something so fantastical.</p>

<p>No it <strong>causes</strong> the gravity.</p>
