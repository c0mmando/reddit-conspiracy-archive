       This is most probably just a shit post but has raised good conversation. 
I just saw a post with buzz Aldrin about the pyramid and this shot into my head I dot know why but it did. When we was at primary school (uk) we was learning about ancient Egypt and he told us about the mysticism surrounding the pyramids and the ins and outs of them. He was just a primary school teacher but taught us always about history he was a fascinating guy. Well anyway he told us that if you put a apple under a pyramid shaped object and then a apple under say a square or rectangular shaped object. The apple will not rot under the pyramid shaped object. Or indeed it takes way much longer. I'm no physics or chemistry expert or biology whatever that falls under. But we actually all did the experiment and left it for months and it was actually true. They were far less decayed. I don't know whether this could be the shape or whatever. If anyone wants to try give it a go I'd be intrigued to see what happens.

       What? That makes no sense. The fact there's 7 or how many ever is just the way humans chose to divide it. In reality there are infinite notes in an octave and infinite colors between blue and red. The 7 thing is just a human convenience thing, we chose to divide it in to 7 pieces. In asia the scale has less than 7

       so you missed this part in the sidebar then..
      </p>
      <p>
       "Newton's color circle, from Opticks of 1704, showing the colors he associated with musical notes. The spectral colors from red to violet are divided by the notes of the musical scale, starting at D. The circle completes a full octave, from D to D. Newton's circle places red, at one end of the spectrum, next to violet, at the other. This reflects the fact that non-spectral purple colors are observed when red and violet light are mixed.
"
      </p>
      <p>
       or this part
      </p>
      <p>
       "Newton divided the spectrum into seven named colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. He chose seven colors out of a belief, derived from the ancient Greek sophists, of there being a connection between the colors, the musical notes, the known objects in the solar system, and the days of the week"

       guess they didn't teach you about grep or search in your "engineering" course.  quick!  tell me what a Von Mises stress is, guy.

       Why would a astronaut be wary of negative energy from a pyramid unless he knows something we don't. There's that black picture on the nasa website someone enhanced and brightened up and it contained a pyramid on the God darnn moon on the official site of nasa. If he does know something of pyramids we don't and they are negative it would give a kick up the arse to the fake moon landing theory but he doesn't want to spill why they are negative.

       Interesting stuff. It does not seem that the materials used in the pyramids is relevant? Do you have any more detailed info/links? I feel like these are things I can try at home.

       Just thinking here, wouldn't EM waves traveling on a horizontal and vertical plane (from below) to the pyramid be reflected so that they construct in a vertical column? Maybe this concentration of EM waves acts as some kind of an energetic focus point in the Universe?

       You know what mate I cannot remember but I do remember telling my grandma about it and she had 100s of brass little ornaments one was a pyramid and I tried to do it there can't remember what happened I was young sounds far fetched I know.  It's no science lab a school classroom but it blew my mind thinking back to it.

       I remember hearing that the shape of the (for example) Egyptian pyramids were the reason they were so resistant to erosion. This is of course not necessarily related.

       It's not much of a get-rich-quick scheme since they're fairly easy to make. I've also seen them in shapes that weren't pyramidal, though they were still tapered.

       I'm thinking using a three sided pyramid is going to yield different results than a four sided one. The pyramid is a mass and will hold and transmit heat via conduction, a four sided pyramid of the same height as a three sided pyramid will have more mass and therefore more heat will be conducted. A square or cube will have even more mass than a pyramid.
