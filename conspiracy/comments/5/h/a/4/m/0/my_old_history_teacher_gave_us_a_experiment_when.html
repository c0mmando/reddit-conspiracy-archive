<p>This is most probably just a shit post but has raised good conversation. 
I just saw a post with buzz Aldrin about the pyramid and this shot into my head I dot know why but it did. When we was at primary school (uk) we was learning about ancient Egypt and he told us about the mysticism surrounding the pyramids and the ins and outs of them. He was just a primary school teacher but taught us always about history he was a fascinating guy. Well anyway he told us that if you put a apple under a pyramid shaped object and then a apple under say a square or rectangular shaped object. The apple will not rot under the pyramid shaped object. Or indeed it takes way much longer. I&#39;m no physics or chemistry expert or biology whatever that falls under. But we actually all did the experiment and left it for months and it was actually true. They were far less decayed. I don&#39;t know whether this could be the shape or whatever. If anyone wants to try give it a go I&#39;d be intrigued to see what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? That makes no sense. The fact there&#39;s 7 or how many ever is just the way humans chose to divide it. In reality there are infinite notes in an octave and infinite colors between blue and red. The 7 thing is just a human convenience thing, we chose to divide it in to 7 pieces.

<p>so you missed this part in the sidebar then..</p>

<p>&quot;Newton&#39;s color circle, from Opticks of 1704, showing the colors he associated with musical notes. The spectral colors from red to violet are divided by the notes of the musical scale, starting at D. The circle completes a full octave, from D to D. Newton&#39;s circle places red, at one end of the spectrum, next to violet, at the other. This reflects the fact that non-spectral purple colors are observed when red and violet light are mixed.
&quot;</p>

<p>or this part</p>

<p>&quot;Newton divided the spectrum into seven named colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. He chose seven colors out of a belief, derived from the ancient Greek sophists, of there being a connection between the colors, the musical notes, the known objects in the solar system, and the days of the week&quot;</p>

<p>guess they didn&#39;t teach you about grep or search in your &quot;engineering&quot; course.  quick!  tell me what a Von Mises stress is, guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking using a three sided pyramid is going to yield different results than a four sided one. The pyramid is a mass and will hold and transmit heat via conduction, a four sided pyramid of the same height as a three sided pyramid will have more mass and therefore more heat will be conducted. A square or cube will have even more mass than a pyramid. </p>

<p>But there is some discussion of materials in the comments below this article:</p>

<p>I wish I knew more, but... only so many hours in the day. Should we all be living in pyramid houses?</p>
