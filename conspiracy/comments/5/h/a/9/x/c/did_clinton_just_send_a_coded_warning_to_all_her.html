<p>Maybe they feel that if PG gains even more traction, it could truly expose the scale of all this shit and that they could all be executed!  </p>

<p> <br/>
Remember <a href="https://youtu.be/kfGeXth-Do4?t=289">Clinton&#39;s meltdown</a> after Matt Lauer&#39;s Commander-in-chief forum?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If that fucking bastard wins, we all hang from nooses!&quot;  </p>

<p> <br/>
Why would a person like Clinton address something like PizzaGate in an event completely out of context and say that U.S. Democracy was at risk because of a small pizza place?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;&#39;Fake news&#39; is a threat to US democracy&quot;  </p>

<p>That makes no sense!<br/>

My guess is big shit is currently going on behind the scenes...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is they are already censoring this story as fake, and if the pope is telling people not to look or talk about such dark things it&#39;s already beginning the process. It won&#39;t get far because obviously we aren&#39;t all part of their flock. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t expect Trump to do anything until enough people force his hand. Look what is happening in south Korea. That could easily happen here.</p>

<p>Them not wanting us to talk about it is censoring free speech. I mean it&#39;s pretty sad. They are so guilty. But they aren&#39;t going to come zip your lips together so you can&#39;t talk, they will just push the narrative that you shouldn&#39;t talk about it. That is censorship in disguise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weiner is too small. It would just add fuel to the fire. They need a bigger fish to throw to the sharks, and the emails that kicked this off were written by or addressed to Podesta, as released by wikileaks. Weiner has some shit, no doubt, but he was politically/socially neutralized by his failed mayoral bid. Plus there is no evidence of what exactly was in that life insurance folder since the NYPD clammed right up after the fbi got involved. I don&#39;t think that folder had anything to do with anything Weiner was doing- more what was happening around him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point about how search engines and social media can be used to manipulate peoples perception not by censoring, but by sorting... just promoting certain info over other pieces.

<p>just contribute, dude. its okay, you have time. </p>

<p>unless you&#39;re being paid to do the opposite.</p>

<p>since when did a conspiracy subreddit become the fascist dictator on common abbreviations used in online communication mediums? </p>

<p>finally, i know you probably would prefer a world where someone else tells you how to live and lead your life but i am a free citizen and it shall me be my own prerogative on how i address people and the amount of time &amp; care i will input in order to illicit a response if i so do desire one.</p>

<p>finally, ever heard of txt speech? ever considered some people browse on their phones? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you guys should make this about the people who are investigating this thing <a href="/u/average_shill">/u/average_shill</a>.  The fact that the guy is an actor with an IMDB page is a huge red flag.  That said, you needn&#39;t worry, interest in this topic will not suddenly vanish.  We are, in fact, waiting for real developments.  Maybe you&#39;d like to pitch in and assist this collective effort which, at its core, is about helping children.  Did you know the Virginia/DC area has the highest rates of missing children by far in the entire nation?  When you begin to investigate this you will start to see many oddities such as this.  Also, I invite you to look up spirit cooking with some of Hillary Clinton&#39;s friends like Marina Abromovic.</p>

<p>These aren&#39;t conclusions, they are postulations, they are theory.  If these were conclusions we would be pushing in a different direction. This is a conspiracy theory sub.  You claim to have been part of this community for 5 yrs so you should know that.

<p>Anything is possible, but I try not to comment stalk people, that&#39;s what shills tend to do.  Also, if I were looking to employ shills to marginalize piazzagate, I would have all kinds.  For example, a useful shill would be one who appears to agree with the overall investigation in a vague and meaningless way, yet detracts from key pieces of potential evidence.  In this way, he or she can appear to be legit, and can effectively muddy the waters.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s you, but it does provide for how someone can appear to be one thing but be something else entirely (i.e.: playing both sides of the fence).  Shills have evolved over the years but there will always be one thing that makes them easy to spot.</p>

<p>How do you know it means absolutely nothing in this case?  This case hasn&#39;t even gone to trial yet.  It <em>may</em> not mean anything, but the possibility exists.  I am not looking at this in a vacuum.  That&#39;s the difference between us.  I haven&#39;t made up my mind, and you have.

    <div class="md"><p>Having been an actor will not even come up at trial, because it&#39;s only relevant if you&#39;re taking the position that he&#39;s a plant.</p>

<p>So, it <strong>may</strong> mean something. But the reality is, it doesn&#39;t because:</p>

<ul>
<li>if I&#39;m correct, it wouldn&#39;t come up in trial at all because it&#39;s an irrelevant point to a prosecution/defense - the same as if he washes with Irish Spring soap. It may be a fact, but it&#39;s one that is irrelevant. </li>
<li>if you&#39;re correct and he is a plant, it also won&#39;t come up in any trial. Because, well, the power elite would never allow that information to go public.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no end-result here that can satisfy your assumption other than him saying &quot;They brought me on to do this because I was an actor&quot; which, obviously won&#39;t happen for either of our assumptions. </p>

<p>Again you speak in absolutes.  It means something if, hypothetically, someone hired him to be there and play a role in order to further an agenda.  Saying it definitely won&#39;t come up in the trial presupposes far too much for my taste, but you are free to dismiss anything you like on whatever grounds seem reasonable to you.

<p>Republicanism is really explicitly designed for this kind of shit. Public officials are errand boys, not genuine leaders. The occult bankster oligarchs remain unaccountable behind the scenes, and if anyone takes heat, it sure as hell will be the talking head, not the de facto ruler.</p>

Now they say &quot;fake news&quot; because they don&#39;t even want to address the claims, much less the evidence.</p>

<p>&quot;PURPLE: Psychic ability, wisdom, divination, remove curses, healing, psychic work, business success, to influence people in power. Powerful color with the energies that can be difficult to manage. It can be used to apply incited others to tyranny, abuse of power, idealism and influence people who have power over you.

<p>Not my theory:</p>

<p>Antarctic will be used as a &quot;partial disclosure&quot; for advanced military technology / UFOs.</p>

<p>Look out for the following narrative as it is a partial disclosure only and the real full discl. is much MUCH bigger.</p>

<p>PD Narrative:
There were aliens thousands/millions of years ago in our solar system, we have found ruins both these and our military tech are all there is. There is only our military in the skies, nothing else to see here. This will distract from the Pete Zag4t3e narrative and push a very limited propaganda narrative, with bases, and tech found under Antarctica.</p>

<p>Newsflash, there&#39;s way more than just Antarctic bases/tech on this planet and solar system and more than just our planet militaries in space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It honestly feels more accurate to call it paganism. But the people on the sub tend to lean right and be Christian. So they&#39;re kind of paranoid about the devil and the usual things that Christians freak out about. It&#39;s totally believable that there would be a common ritual, religion, or philosophical practice among a ruling class. Doesn&#39;t seem very scandalous to me. Now this stuff about cannibalism and sacrificing humans that needs some hard proof before I believe it, because, logistically it seems like a higher risk form of religion. However, on the other hand, the more extreme the risk to social capital a religion is in its practice, the closer its practitioners are bound together. What better way to control a class of people than through a pseudo religion?</p>

Easy to win and be ahead in a game with rules you made up that your opponent doesn&#39;t even know they are playing.

Have you ever met someone who really was only in the position they were in because of their family or connections?  In my experience those people are often quite incompetent.</p>

<p>They are many steps ahead but most people are only just figuring everything out and they are acting super desperate.  Another normal human example is being in an abusive relationship.  When the victim finally snaps out of feeling lost and hopeless and tries to leave the relationship, the abuser becomes desperate and does extremely crazy shit.

They know what they are doing because they are able to manipulate people due to the normal every day human being not realizing how totally fucking insane and inhumane a psychopath is and the lengths they will go to to fuck with people for fun.  </p>

<p>It is a type of intelligence, a knowing of how humans think, feel and act and respond to fear but they aren&#39;t that smart otherwise and can for sure be outsmarted once you can see them for what they are. They will lie about everything though as they are definitely cunning. </p>

<p>Anyway a really clever person would know how to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeZQ5VROfBE">act better</a> but that&#39;s just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much them, but more that they follow a plan that spans decades, if not centuries. Like if our personal families worked toward a common goal over several consecutive generations... our lives would obviously be a little different.</p>

<p>We&#39;d be more comfortable in our lives (but of course the middle &amp; lower class has to spend their whole lives struggling just to get themselves &amp; their own family through it). And we&#39;d be way more focused and adept... so much of our lives is unknown, so much of our energy is either sent in the wrong direction or simply spent figuring out which direction is best for us. We&#39;re not following someone else&#39;s plan, we don&#39;t always confidently know the next step.</p>

<p>I mean they may not be stupid but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re as clever as they are tight-lipped and obedient.</p>

Did you know the Virginia/DC area has the highest rates of missing children by far in the entire nation?  When you begin to investigate this you will start to see many oddities such as this.
