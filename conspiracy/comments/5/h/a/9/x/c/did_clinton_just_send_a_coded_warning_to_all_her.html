       Dude you know exactly what's going on. We know their playbook now and they have no more tricks.

       "Fake news" is a desperate gambit that is gonna fail and then backfire on them horribly. Not like they have any more options though, the noose is tightening. It's gonna be a damn good year to be a peasant, my humans.

       The point is they are already censoring this story as fake, and if the pope is telling people not to look or talk about such dark things it's already beginning the process. It won't get far because obviously we aren't all part of their flock.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't expect Trump to do anything until enough people force his hand. Look what is happening in south Korea. That could easily happen here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Them not wanting us to talk about it is censoring free speech. I mean it's pretty sad. They are so guilty. But they aren't going to come zip your lips together so you can't talk, they will just push the narrative that you shouldn't talk about it. That is censorship in disguise.

       I have a feeling that Podesta is looking like the weak link in the chain with these people.  I seem to remember someone here or on the Chan's talking about events happening between 12/7-12-9 . Regardless, if "they" decide Podesta is too big a liability, he will be taken care of and everything will be pinned on him. And that would probably end any additional investigation just like in the UK. I just want a real investigation into the child trafficking, people held accountable and put in prison forever. I think we'll just get another pasty and a fairy tale.

       If Podesta get thrown over the bus everyone goes with him because msm is already lying and calling the Podesta news fake. If conet gets caught or podesta everyone will wake up. Podesta was in bed with Hillary.

       Weiner is too small. It would just add fuel to the fire. They need a bigger fish to throw to the sharks, and the emails that kicked this off were written by or addressed to Podesta, as released by wikileaks. Weiner has some shit, no doubt, but he was politically/socially neutralized by his failed mayoral bid. Plus there is no evidence of what exactly was in that life insurance folder since the NYPD clammed right up after the fbi got involved. I don't think that folder had anything to do with anything Weiner was doing- more what was happening around him.

       Thats a brilliant fucking observation - the goddamn High Level insider even said in his 4chan ama's that they speak in code; they speak so it doesnt mean much to normal people but speaks volumes to other audiences.  I need to go back and re-watch a bunch of these fuckers' interviews.

       This could be a warning, this could be a code red alert to all members of the ring, this could be a threat to the people pursuing the indictments.  Fucking, even #Fakenews to them could mean something totally different to them than what it means to us.

       I think they came up with "fake news" because they couldn't use conspiracy theorists anymore because that label has been placed on them over the Russian hacking conspiracy theory they are clinging to.
      </p>

       Fake News came out of know where and was used by everyone all at the same time which was right when Pizza Gate started.

       Naw, "Fake News" is the exact term they used in China to take over the media and ban all dissenters. Kind of like they are doing globally now. This has been planned for a while. We are looking at Act 2.

       Really? The "exact" term? Like they speak English during policy discussions and said the EXACT term "fake news". Because they didn't and China's media has always been censored. Like literally the government forbids you from viewing the article, it's nowhere near that in America and to suggest so is laughable. You can believe whatever you want, but language is language and you don't speak Chinese. You're just vomiting some info you read somewhere that "sounds right" but you probably never researched it beyond reading a headline.

       Schools often fail standard drinking water tests for lead. I've long stopped believing it is unintentional.

       It would not surprise me in the least if the schools were actually designed as toxic environments in an effort to disrupt strong military families.

       You're using Google probably. Google structures info according to what it thinks you want to read. So if you search a lot for conspiracy stuff, you'll get the crazy conspiracy stuff before anything else when searching for stuff like Air Force Base. This is one of the things that leads to these vast echo chambers, and also probably explains how some of the people in here could've arrived at the insane conclusion that there is some sort of global conspiracy of paedophile politicians that sacrifice and eat children.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate internet censorship, but it's stuff like Pgate that makes me understand why politicians feel the need to curtail the internet.

       That's a good point about how search engines and social media can be used to manipulate peoples perception not by censoring, but by sorting... just promoting certain info over other pieces. Duckduckgo and yahoo also have some conspiracy talk near the top of the results... but who knows if they are on the level with my data as well... Bing didn't show up anything nutty in the first couple pages.

       If the "shooter" really thought pizzagate was real, why wouldn't have he asked his dad for help? His dad is in the perfect position for this kind of thing, &amp; would have the knowledge, experience, and the reputation to at least have some sort of investigation happen.

       That actually might have something to do with it. If you're a child molester who is a gay, it's much easier to hide if you normalize gay men hanging around underage boys.

       I don't think you guys should make this about the people who are investigating this thing
       <a href="/u/average_shill">

       .  The fact that the guy is an actor with an IMDB page is a huge red flag.  That said, you needn't worry, interest in this topic will not suddenly vanish.  We are, in fact, waiting for real developments.  Maybe you'd like to pitch in and assist this collective effort which, at its core, is about helping children.  Did you know the Virginia/DC area has the highest rates of missing children by far in the entire nation?  When you begin to investigate this you will start to see many oddities such as this.  Also, I invite you to look up spirit cooking with some of Hillary Clinton's friends like Marina Abromovic.

       Another strange fact about abromovic who is like a modern day madame bathory/crowley/blavatsky, she is 70 years old but looks like she's in her mid 40s. One of the cornerstones of their ritual activity is that by consuming the flesh of babies and small children as well as sexual pedophile acts that they will gain some sort of perpetual youth or immortality

       I've been on this sub for 5+ years, I don't need the 'welcome to the community' condescending tone. No, it isn't odd he was an actor. Plenty of people do crazy things from all backgrounds. That's irrelevant in my mind to whether or not he was "in on it" this time. The conclusions everyone seems to be jumping to are unfounded

       These aren't conclusions, they are postulations, they are theory.  If these were conclusions we would be pushing in a different direction. This is a conspiracy theory sub.  You claim to have been part of this community for 5 yrs so you should know that.  Funny thing is, you seem to be the one who has concluded there is nothing to this piazzagate at all, when more and more connections are made each day.  Again, I find that very telling

       Anything is possible, but I try not to comment stalk people, that's what shills tend to do.  Also, if I were looking to employ shills to marginalize piazzagate, I would have all kinds.  For example, a useful shill would be one who appears to agree with the overall investigation in a vague and meaningless way, yet detracts from key pieces of potential evidence.  In this way, he or she can appear to be legit, and can effectively muddy the waters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I'm not saying that's you, but it does provide for how someone can appear to be one thing but be something else entirely (i.e.: playing both sides of the fence).  Shills have evolved over the years but there will always be one thing that makes them easy to spot.

       Did you get the part where I said now I am not saying this is necessarily you?  That said I know the difference between someone who is debating and someone who is trying to shut down debate.  Which category do you think you fall into regarding the shooter and his acting background?  Sorry, you said to have a good day so you needn't answer.  Have a nice weekend.

       Do you realize how incredibly easy it is to have an IMDB page, for simply "acting" in your friend's shitty indie film? I've got probably 20 friends who have some form of "acting" credit on IMDB. If any of them commit a crime, it means absolutely nothing.

       Having been an actor will not even come up at trial, because it's only relevant if you're taking the position that he's a plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it
       <strong>
        may
       </strong>
       mean something. But the reality is, it doesn't because:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        if I'm correct, it wouldn't come up in trial at all because it's an irrelevant point to a prosecution/defense - the same as if he washes with Irish Spring soap. It may be a fact, but it's one that is irrelevant.
       </li>
       <li>
        if you're correct and he is a plant, it also won't come up in any trial. Because, well, the power elite would never allow that information to go public.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There is no end-result here that can satisfy your assumption other than him saying "They brought me on to do this because I was an actor" which, obviously won't happen for either of our assumptions.

       Again you speak in absolutes.  It means something if, hypothetically, someone hired him to be there and play a role in order to further an agenda.  Saying it definitely won't come up in the trial presupposes far too much for my taste, but you are free to dismiss anything you like on whatever grounds seem reasonable to you.  I'll do the same.

       AR-15-style rifles are a well-known symbol because almost every gun enthusiast in this country owns at least 1.

       Alex Jones is a well-known lightning pole worthy of blame because he is one of the most outspoken people covering this whole thing, his site has been plastered with the exposés and he's become much more well-known and popular since one of his followers got elected President.

       God help us. The biggest "above the law" "too big to jail" criminal on the planet got caught, lost the election, and now she says this law she just got passed is going to help with the censorship campaign she wants so that no one like her is ever caught again? Chilling. Facebook and Google and Twitter aren't biased in favor of US government wrongdoing enough already?

       This doesn't really describe HRC. She's middle management, not truly elite. If the Rothschilds and Rockefellers (the highest stratum of "the elite" discernible to my knowledge) of this world deem her a liability, she's going down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicanism is really explicitly designed for this kind of shit. Public officials are errand boys, not genuine leaders. The occult bankster oligarchs remain unaccountable behind the scenes, and if anyone takes heat, it sure as hell will be the talking head, not the de facto ruler.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I can never buy into the "MAGA" stuff. America was ALWAYS thoroughly corrupt (hardly surprising considering that it was founded on liberal capitalist and Masonic ideals), just like the Roman and Venetian republics before it. There truly is nothing new under the sun.

       According to Clinton, everything but her is a "threat to U.S. democracy."
      </p>
      <p>
       That is her go-to line, now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is true that people knowing the truth is a threat to her, those like her, and their collective brand of government/'democracy.'

       No doubt about that one.

       She doesn't (apparently) know or care much about "democracy." Whenever she says "democracy" I mentally replace it with "The status quo corruption machine."
      </p>
      <p>
       Because for her that is what is at stake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump said he wouldn't roll over and blindly accept an election with evidence of mass fraud. But for HRC that is a "threat to democracy" which makes no sense. But, if you say - "it is a threat to the status quo corruption machine" then it makes perfect sense.

       As if there's not been fake news constantly for so long in this country. The coffin handbills. There've been FBI people saying since at least the 80s there are satanic cult things going on. Duranty at the New York Times made fake stories to cover up Stalin's Holodomor for 50 years in this country. Some say the Iraq was started on extremely fake premises. Now they say "fake news" because they don't even want to address the claims, much less the evidence.

       what else could she mean if she's not referring to Pizzagate? also are they seriously trying to call Wikileaks 'fake news' to cover their own asses? Pizzagate was born from their own fucking emails. We can't let them get away with this.

       Funny how she always claims things are a threat to democracy. If you don't respect the election results, it is a threat to democracy. (Well, she is not respecting the results and getting Stein to do all those recounts).

       Now Fake News is a threat to democracy too. (Guess she forgot how she lied about being under sniper fire and how that was fake news).

       Is there any solid evidence that Clinton actually said these things? Not to say that I don't believe it, but that I really can't take anything at face value anymore. I need more information to make informed decisions.

       Ive come to the conclusion that PizzaGate is the ultimate false flag and is being used to censor the internet.

       The government already controls all MSM. If they can get full control of the internet we become a capitalistic Russia or North Korea.

       However, her tone when she said 'of particular concern to members of congress' (with a sidelong glance). . .it sounded like both a warning and a threat. This election may well come down to congress--I think I read that they submitted a bill to abolish the electoral college effective immediately, also a bill to relieve all electors of the law binding them to their vote (don't quote me on the details). If they are making a play for electoral votes and it comes down to a congressional vote, she could well be threatening: Don't vote in Trump or your very lives are at risk with PG--you all know who you are, and I'm not going down alone.

       well, keep in mind they're throwing around this idea that Russia spread "fake news" during the election and that's why hillary lost.  Of course, I never seem to see any examples given when stuff like this is said... just a broad accusation that somehow russia put forth fake stories that made people vote for trump instead of a pristine candidate like hillary.

       as during her Concession speech, she again wore PURPLE - the occult use purple to remove curses as well as incite tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       "PURPLE: Psychic ability, wisdom, divination, remove curses, healing, psychic work, business success, to influence people in power. Powerful color with the energies that can be difficult to manage. It can be used to apply incited others to tyranny, abuse of power, idealism and influence people who have power over you. Great for inviting sadness and resentment in others. Jupiter rules the purple. The purple crown chakra governs."

       There's a lot, a lot going on behind the scenes. Establishment/syndicates need a distraction from Pete Zag4t-3e.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not my theory:
      </p>
      <p>
       Antarctic will be used as a "partial disclosure" for advanced military technology / UFOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look out for the following narrative as it is a partial disclosure only and the real full discl. is much MUCH bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       PD Narrative:
There were aliens thousands/millions of years ago in our solar system, we have found ruins both these and our military tech are all there is. There is only our military in the skies, nothing else to see here. This will distract from the Pete Zag4t3e narrative and push a very limited propaganda narrative, with bases, and tech found under Antarctica.
      </p>
      <p>
       Newsflash, there's way more than just Antarctic bases/tech on this planet and solar system and more than just our planet militaries in space.

       They do practice Satanism though, I honestly feel like most of them don't actually believe in it though. It's more about tradition &amp; it's actually a great scapegoat because people like you automatically write off corruption/pedo stuff once you start hearing about "crazy satanic rituals"

       It honestly feels more accurate to call it paganism. But the people on the sub tend to lean right and be Christian. So they're kind of paranoid about the devil and the usual things that Christians freak out about. It's totally believable that there would be a common ritual, religion, or philosophical practice among a ruling class. Doesn't seem very scandalous to me. Now this stuff about cannibalism and sacrificing humans that needs some hard proof before I believe it, because, logistically it seems like a higher risk form of religion. However, on the other hand, the more extreme the risk to social capital a religion is in its practice, the closer its practitioners are bound together. What better way to control a class of people than through a pseudo religion?

       Right. The satanic thing is just a front, although I'm sure some of them believe in it, especially when these people are offered high ranking positions of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how when people bring up the child trafficking, &amp; then the satanic part, that's when people really stop listening. It's too absurd &amp; crazy.

       Depends entirely on whose standards and what standards. I see plenty of horrors called standards perpetrated by MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now journalistic standards across the board that say report fairly both sides of an issue, find three sources to back up any claim and seek truth and accuracy before speed and sensationalism.  Also reject and denounce propganda.  But our MSM of today would never agree to that.

       I've no clue what you're speaking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       And frankly, I don't really care. I wasn't saying "pizzagate is a hoax". I was saying "FFS, clean up your communication game".

       If you want to be taken seriously, cut the "WE'RE ALMOST AT IT GUYS, LOOK, THEY SCARED OF US" and rather try the "J'accuse" tone of a Zola.

       Hey everyone, watch out for waves of fake news coming in like tidal waves. Because now that we've said it, Russia thinks it's not a signal to stop and try again later, but rather to go ahead and continue on sending the fake news.  Because that's how terror plots work.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you advertise that you know about terror plots, they always continue exactly as they were originally planned and they are not altered at all by hearing about any so called countermeasures.  This is done because terror plots are not designed to succeed in any way. /s (did I really have to?)

       Eh it's more like they have a "higher" perspective. Easy to win and be ahead in a game with rules you made up that your opponent doesn't even know they are playing. But mostly, like u/inbetweentime says, they have inherited instructions, information and knowledge.  Have you ever met someone who really was only in the position they were in because of their family or connections?  In my experience those people are often quite incompetent.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are many steps ahead but most people are only just figuring everything out and they are acting super desperate.  Another normal human example is being in an abusive relationship.  When the victim finally snaps out of feeling lost and hopeless and tries to leave the relationship, the abuser becomes desperate and does extremely crazy shit.  We're witnessing the beginning our collective abuser starting to lose their grip on us.  Same with cults too.
      </p>

       People really shouldn't over estimate their intelligence but they shouldn't underestimate how arrogant and ruthless they are.

       You make some good points. It's definitely illogical to generalize all politicians as "clever". I do think that the politicians in question (Especially Podesta and the Clintons) are
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       cunning, though.

       I can agree with cunning.

      <p>
       This is what I think in part due to my own personal experiences and what I've learned for myself... They are just psychopaths.  I mean maybe they are all the other things everyone says too but at the very least they are psychopaths. They know what they are doing because they are able to manipulate people due to the normal every day human being not realizing how totally fucking insane and inhumane a psychopath is and the lengths they will go to to fuck with people for fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a type of intelligence, a knowing of how humans think, feel and act and respond to fear but they aren't that smart otherwise and can for sure be outsmarted once you can see them for what they are. They will lie about everything though as they are definitely cunning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway a really clever person would know how to
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeZQ5VROfBE">
        act better

       To be honest I don't think it's so much them, but more that they follow a plan that spans decades, if not centuries. Like if our personal families worked toward a common goal over several consecutive generations... our lives would obviously be a little different.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'd be more comfortable in our lives (but of course the middle &amp; lower class has to spend their whole lives struggling just to get themselves &amp; their own family through it). And we'd be way more focused and adept... so much of our lives is unknown, so much of our energy is either sent in the wrong direction or simply spent figuring out which direction is best for us. We're not following someone else's plan, we don't always confidently know the next step.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean they may not be stupid but I don't think they're as clever as they are tight-lipped and obedient.

       Orwell did a great job in his depictions in 1984.  The proles are so weathered down with the drudgery of their lives they can barely hold a coherent conversation whereas the high ranking party members are so ahead of everyone else because they have nothing to think about but advancing their own interests.

       Hillary even said she called the owner of comet pizza yesterday to give her condolences about the "shooter" that went there.

       Pretty weird for someone who supposedly doesn't even know Clinton.

       So this is all the evidence you have that Hillary is involved in a sex ring? That Alefantis went to the White House when Obama was president? That she offered her condolences after the fact?

       This is so delusional, how did "fake news" become codename for "pizza gate" in your minds? Pizza gate is just one instance of fake news, right-wing nuts like breitbart are spreading this garbage everyday, and people eat it up and share it, because it fits their narrative, pizza gate just happens to be the one that sparked a dude to act violently on it.

       Back in July (and before that), Reddit was accusing Hillary of staging
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       mass-violence news event as a "distraction" ... such as
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4ry63e/the_dallas_shootings_were_a_distraction_from_the/">
        the Dallas Police snipers "to distract us from Comey's declining to recommend indictment"
       </a>
       .

      <p>
       Why isn't Hillary dropping nukes on NYC to distract us now?

       tells me that Pizzagate is bigger than 9/11 + JFK put together.  But Pizzagate has been ongoing for weeks.  The Comet Pizza Shooter who didn't shoot anybody is the best Hillary can do??

       We don't even know to what extent Hillary and the Clinton foundation are involved.    She may take a hands off approach and just use the rings for blackmail and leverage.   Or she may be in neck deep like her husband and Epstein.

       Hillary supposedly was gonna bring a suitcase nuke into NYC after election night and blow up all them protesters... White knights in the NSA have been leaking her whole NWO handbook to the New FBI... all of her big big plans have gone down the drain... just a few of the minor ones have slipped thru... derailments, protests, forest fires... the big stuff has all been averted.

       Well obviously not her personally... But Susan Lindauer said before the election that her CIA background led her to think that HRC planned a dirty bomb or suitcase nuke for NYC near election night... would also fit in with why the FBI and NYPD cancelled HRCs firework display for election night... that might have been part of it.

       I'm sure there's no FBI employment coloring your propaganda, since your comment history shows you've been working on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       posts for 13 straight hours, then a 3-hour break a day ago.  If you're not getting paid, you should consider the benefits of a job.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt that your concept of Comey Justice and Honor does not involve justice regarding 9/11 or the FBI's role in 9/11, or Anthrax or the FBI's multiple cover-ups in that murder spree, or Freeh's Penn State pedo-ring cover-up or Mueller's Ray Gricar cover-up, or Comey's kiddie porn production for "FBI stings".
      </p>
      <p>
       But you seem to have forgotten all the ways to spell a Comey subreddit, so you're either a lazy fanboy, an inept sycophant, or an online "persona" who knows he can't afford to look too obsessed, lest you lose street credibility.  Because FBI has too many innocent victims for such an easy rebranding.

       I can agree with cunning.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what I think in part due to my own personal experiences and what I've learned for myself... They are just psychopaths.  I mean maybe they are all the other things everyone says too but at the very least they are psychopaths. They know what they are doing because they are able to manipulate people due to the normal every day human being not realizing how totally fucking insane and inhumane a psychopath is and the lengths they will go to to fuck with people for fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a type of intelligence, a knowing of how humans think, feel and act and respond to fear but they aren't that smart otherwise and can for sure be outsmarted once you can see them for what they are. They will lie about everything though as they are definitely cunning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway a really clever person would know how to

       I don't think you guys should make this about the people who are investigating this thing

       .  The fact that the guy is an actor with an IMDB page is a huge red flag.  That said, you needn't worry, interest in this topic will not suddenly vanish.  We are, in fact, waiting for real developments.  Maybe you'd like to pitch in and assist this collective effort which, at its core, is about helping children.  Did you know the Virginia/DC area has the highest rates of missing children by far in the entire nation?  When you begin to investigate this you will start to see many oddities such as this.  Also, I invite you to look up spirit cooking with some of Hillary Clinton's friends like Marina Abromovic.
