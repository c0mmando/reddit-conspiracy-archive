    <div class="md"><p>This person claims she&#39;s not a racist, but whips out the anti Semitic (((echoes)))...</p>

<p>The use of triple parentheses or triple brackets, also known as an (((echo))), is an antisemitic symbol that has been used to highlight the names of individuals of a Jewish background. The practice originated from the far-right blog The Right Stuff; the blog&#39;s editors have explained that the symbol is meant to symbolize that the historic actions of members of the Jewish ethnicity had caused their surnames to &quot;echo throughout history&quot;.[1] The triple parentheses have been adopted as an online stigma by antisemites, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists to identify individuals of Jewish background as targets for online harassment, such as Jewish journalists critical of then-Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump.[2][3]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Lyme disease is a real illness that millions of people a suffer from. LGBT is sexual choice. what you do in your bed is your business and you dont deserve any special protection just bc you pork people with the same genitles as you.&quot;--u/istherelifeafterlyme. 
Nah, you&#39;re a cunt because today you have proved yourself to be homophobic, called all liberals &quot;brown shirts and pedophiles,&quot; claimed that the users of r/childfree are promoting child abuse, defended your use of antisemitic triple parentheses, and suggested two posters on r/pics might be involved in child abuse after they posted very innocent pictures. Stop spewing hate and accusing people of preying on the disabled when they call you out on it.</p>

Edit: I re-read, and the kid was not actually tested, but doc advised against it and mom went &quot;hysterical&quot; (her word). She then asked about treating the daughter on her own
