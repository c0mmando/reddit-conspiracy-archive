       I do not think our country has ever been more divided in modern history than it has been throughout this entire election.  With Facebook, twitter, MSM, it seems now, more than ever, information and disinformation is spreading faster than it ever has and consequently, so are the nation's emotions and opinions.  The ability to mass manipulate the population seems like it is getting easier ever year.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the difference between the left and the right?  Both sides are backed by corporations and billionaire elites.  Do people really think their political parties and ideals matter to these people?  I only see one thing they all have in common; money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like we are missing something here.  I feel like this is all a distraction and a ruse in order to get us to fight amongst ourselves.  And it's working.

       What you are referring to is called "controlled opposition" where both sides of any conflict are orchestrated by one group to distract from the real problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people felt that Donald Trump was set up as a pied piper candidate, like Bernie Sanders, and expected to lose by a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was possibly elected specifically because many people felt that he was not part of the controlled opposition and that this plan of his has been in place for a long, long time, based on a fwe prophetic tweets.

       Correct. It's also the satanic principle of "thesis VS antithesis leads to synthesis", or in other words, the Hegelian Dialectic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not entirely convinced that Trump was planted with a real chance to win, though. I think they would have preferred a Bush V Clinton race with Trump as all-around media whore and attention-well. But Jeb! wasn't happening, so they put all their bets on the Clinton card and lost, entirely thanks to Wikileaks and the mechanics of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now is cleanup time, meaning they'll try to get her in brute force now. One thing they won't do is allow for Trump to spoil their plans, though, so I'm not getting my hopes up. But if Trump was truly a plant, I don't see why they would still be trying so hard to knock him down.

       I don't think we have the faintest idea how little we actually control in the United States.  If the whole truth was laid bare the nation might tear itself apart.  In 2016 we turned one page and few critters got loose.  The CIA, NSA, HS are working overtime to keep the rot from coming loose and cutting their billionaire masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       America became a playground for the world elite post-wwII.  Now they throw stone at each other from across the political divide.  We defend the elite's political ideologies while never fully understanding why. The elite don't care whether we sink or swim.  They can always get another weak country to embrace the global grinder face first.  One day we find out U.S. was barely able to keep itself from collapsing, on that day it will be too late.

       Isn't it almost trivial to prove this? Our candidates have stupid as fuck ideas, say stupid as fuck things, and are corrupt shit bags where the word "dishonest" describes nearly all of their political dealings. You don't even need r/conspiracy for that, either. The news just only points it out for the party it is against(fox points out HRC is shitbag, CNN points out trump is shitbag) and these sources are labeled as biased because they are....but the unbiased view isn't that one of the candidates is actually an ok guy who will maybe do some good stuff, the unbiased view is our candidates are dumpsters of people, dumpsters full of money, but still absolute trash.

Financial reform was made nearly impossible for the Monarchy as those in position to make the changes to economic policy did believe that France was facing finical collapse as author's data and authenticity went unchallenged until it was too late.

       If there's any conspiracy I'll believe here, it's this. The fact that so many Trumpetors are ready to kill the lefties and start a civil war is pretty indicative that the powers that be would love to destablise this country.

       Some people argue lots of things, but the generalizations on both sides of the field need to end. It's damaging to try and live a life where you believe that anyone who votes differently than you do is a pedo-loving or nazi-loving demon in disguise.

       What are you talking about some people think that "pedophilia is a sexual orientation". that "they can't help" lamenting "imagine how it feels". all i'm doing is safegaurding him against a strawman attack bad day to you and bad bye.

       "Why is no one discussing the possibility that this entire election has been orchestrated by both republicans and democrats in an attempt to divide the country? Isn't the saying "Divide and Conquer" still relevant today?" Well according to Hillary Clinton's dirty old thesis she wrote in college, "Divide and Conquer" is one of the most effective means of controlling people.
