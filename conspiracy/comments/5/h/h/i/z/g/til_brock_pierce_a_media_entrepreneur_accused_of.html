<p>From a Wired article about Brock Pierce:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the drive back up to his house in the Laurel Canyon hills, he kept talking, telling me about his current list of projects, entrepreneurial and otherwise. He had just sold a casino in the Phillippines. There was an oil deal in Kazakhstan. <strong>He was doing philanthropic work with the Clinton Global Initiative.</strong> He was working with the family of the president of El Salvador to make some worthy documentary or another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you look at IGE which made its money selling off MMORPG gold for &quot;real&quot; cash, Bitcoin emerges as kind of an improved version of IGE&#39;s operation. The currency is decentralized, not tied to a bank or a particular MMOPRG universe. You can trade it for cash all around the world and its as good as cash anywhere online. I half-seriously think that after IGE imploded, the founders (who have a long history in money laundering an building Internet architecture going back to early 1990s) created the &quot;Satoshi Nakomoto&quot; persona, secretly launched Bitcoin, and then came out in the open a few years later to &quot;discover&quot; it as an investment opportunity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I summarized this in a Twitter thread - there&#39;s some links at the bottom. Bannon&#39;s involvement in the Collins-Rector / Brock Pierce hasn&#39;t been fully investigated. Pierce suppressed the court records of a business partner who sued him (Alain Debonneville) to cover up just how far back they might go. Rector, Pierce, Randy Maslow (their attorney for several ventures) and Bannon (in and out of Goldman Sachs) probably go back for 15 years to some of Rector&#39;s first ventures and the beginning of the commercial Internet.  <a href="https://twitter.com/cuttlefish_btc/status/807060819943063554">https://twitter.com/cuttlefish_btc/status/807060819943063554</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I compiled some research on Pierce a few years ago - he works hard to scrub his history, with blogs being hit by Cease &amp; Desist letters and court cases sealed after the fact. Alot of stuff that was once online about him has to be dug up from the Web Archive. 
Primary Sources for Digital Entertainment Network  and its aftermath <a href="https://medium.com/@cuttlefish_btc/den-sources-af289efd690b#.89apx3fvi">https://medium.com/@cuttlefish_btc/den-sources-af289efd690b#.89apx3fvi</a></p>

<p>A timeline of what Brock Pierce knew and when he knew it which seeks to establish that he was knowingly evading prosecution while in Spain (running IGE with Steve Bannon) instead of merely being &quot;unaware&quot; of the legal action against him as he claimed to the Bitcoin Foundation. 
<a href="https://medium.com/@cuttlefish_btc/brock-pierce-timeline-a230ad1ecdc5#.pp7g5arzl">https://medium.com/@cuttlefish_btc/brock-pierce-timeline-a230ad1ecdc5#.pp7g5arzl</a></p>

<p>The &quot;oil deal in Kazakhstan&quot; would probably also turn up some interesting stuff - Turkish cleric Fetuallah Gulen runs a state-within-a-state in Central Asia and is probably a CIA asset. He&#39;s also a major donor to the Clintons. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/08/23/turkey-coup-plotter-clinton-donor/88991622/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/08/23/turkey-coup-plotter-clinton-donor/88991622/</a>
What are the chances that a pipeline deal in Central Asia would connect Gulen (who operates dozens of charter schools in America and is the recipient of major US foreign aid in Asia) and Pierce with the Clintons? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the problem. If you were running a international charity and if you did not know this guy was a pedo, you&#39;d want him on your team. Bitcoin might be the way of the future, it eases international movement of money, and if your a manager involved in Bitcoin you probably have a fair amount of cash. </p>

<p>In addition he&#39;s got his feet in Hollywood and likely knows some big players. We all would likely hire this guy. </p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s a bit weird to have him pop up as a Clinton employee, but it still isn&#39;t proof of anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just saying another true thing, framed in the same way as title of this post. I know that sentiment isn&#39;t really super welcome here, but I also wasn&#39;t sure how open this sub was to other voices. But I&#39;m honestly not trying to troll. Also why is your account called Tebow&#39;s Hand?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I summarized this in a Twitter thread - there&#39;s some links at the bottom. Bannon&#39;s involvement in the Collins-Rector / Brock Pierce hasn&#39;t been fully investigated. Pierce suppressed the court records of a business partner who sued him (Alain Debonneville) to cover up just how far back they might go. Rector, Pierce, Randy Maslow (their attorney for several ventures) and Bannon (in and out of Goldman Sachs) probably go back for 15 years to some of Rector&#39;s first ventures and the beginning of the commercial Internet.  <a href="https://twitter.com/cuttlefish_btc/status/807060819943063554">https://twitter.com/cuttlefish_btc/status/807060819943063554</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you look at IGE which made its money selling off MMORPG gold for &quot;real&quot; cash, Bitcoin emerges as kind of an improved version of IGE&#39;s operation. The currency is decentralized, not tied to a bank or a particular MMOPRG universe. You can trade it for cash all around the world and its as good as cash anywhere online. I half-seriously think that after IGE imploded, the founders (who have a long history in money laundering an building Internet architecture going back to early 1990s) created the &quot;Satoshi Nakomoto&quot; persona, secretly launched Bitcoin, and then came out in the open a few years later to &quot;discover&quot; it as an investment opportunity. </p>
