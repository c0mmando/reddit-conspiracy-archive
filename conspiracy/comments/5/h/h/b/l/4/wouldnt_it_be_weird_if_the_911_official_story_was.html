<p>RealNews<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup></p>

<hr/>

<p>for u/Tinie_Snipah </p>

<p>Man in black suit and tie wearing breathing mask and sunglasses walks up to a live reporter from behind and touches him on the back. The reporter, while still talking, turns to see who is behind him. As he does the man in the black suit turns and gestures further behind, although it is not clear what specifically he is pointing at. There is no clear activity and the reporter is not asked to move out of the way of a vehicle or other people. The man in the black suit  simply seems to act like he justified in interrupting the live reporter and redirect him to nothing specific.</p>

<p>reporter: &quot;Sir, can we talk to you - what&#39;s you role out here right now?&quot;</p>

<p>man in black suit: &quot;Um, I&#39;m just standing by right now. Can&#39;t say what role I&#39;m playing right now.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... Basically, during the LAX Fake News<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> Event, he was interviewed. Paraphrasing, he was detained at the airport by cops for around 10 minutes. He had no ID or ticket &quot;or anything&quot; but they could see that he no weapons and no evidence of &quot;doing any of this stuff&quot; so they let him go.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the same guy, but this video shows both clips: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzog9yTRVNQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzog9yTRVNQ</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So tell me, if the guy he interviews is an actor, what did the government get out of him saying that it fell due to fire? Why not just have no actors  (which would reduce any risk of them getting &quot;caught&quot;) and just release a press statement by the fire service or something saying you believe that the fires were ravaging the buildings which is likely what caused the collapse? That would be so much more believable and more news agencies would pick up on it than just some bloke on the street </p>

<p>Also you&#39;re surprised that there&#39;s a guy in a suit and shades when it&#39;s midmorning in autumn in downtown manhattan? Come on. He&#39;s wearing a suit to work, he&#39;s wearing shades because it&#39;s sunny and he&#39;s wearing a face mask because they were likely being given out by police/fire/whoever</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So tell me</p>

<p>It took over a year to convene the 9/11 commission and it did not publish it&#39;s results for another 21 months after that. There was great resistance to even having a commission in the first place. They did not want to release or create an &quot;official&quot; record or document. The use of planted information in interviews was their way to put those descriptions and vocabulary into the public consciousness without having it tied to an agent or agency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also you&#39;re surprised that there&#39;s a guy in a suit and shades</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Didn&#39;t say I was surprised. Merely provided a description of the man (actually that description fits at least two of the men in the video). So, I agree 100% that it would be perfectly reasonable to expect man in lower Manhatton to be wearing a suit and tie, sunglasses, and even a breathing mask (the reporters is also wearing a mask, but it&#39;s not on his face during the clip but instead hangs around his neck). Now the behavior of the man in the suit as another story. However, to me, his behavior is more interesting than his clothes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the record the guy that is standing watching the interview is different to the one that taps him on the back</p>

<p>Seems like the first guy is in shock and is just fascinated by the interview/wants to know what is going to be said/see if he could chime in with his own opinions. There&#39;s a lot of people just standing and watching the interview, nobody mentions them because they aren&#39;t black or in suits</p>

<p>The second guy I don&#39;t know, maybe he was just moving the reporter away from the curb so he doesn&#39;t fall over? Maybe he wants to get past? There&#39;s tons of reasons he could be doing it, I find it very hard to believe that this one action gives him away as some sort of government plant. I mean how many of these plants would they need throughout the streets to spread these interviews out? Dozens, maybe hundreds. And none of them ever came forward or leaked information about it being a cover up? Seems like an enormous risk to take when you could just get some agency to release a report saying the exact same thing... </p>

<p>Yeah, no shit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s strange that you keep assuming things or trying to tell me things that I did not discuss. Yes, there are two guys in black suits. One is black and isn&#39;t wearing glasses or breathing mask, the other isn&#39;t black and is wearing sunglasses and a breathing mask. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what he does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe he wants to get past?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. He comes in from behind the reporter, taps the reporter, and gestures backwards over his shoulder. That is not how you &quot;get past&quot; someone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean how many of these plants would they need throughout the streets to spread these interviews out? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know, one or two maybe?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dozens, maybe hundreds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh?! Based on what? Are you aware of dozens, maybe hundreds of interviews with witnesses who claimed the towers collapse &quot;mostly due to structural failure because the fires were just too intense&quot; and who also refer to &quot;ground zero&quot; within minutes of the collapses?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And none of them ever came forward or leaked information about it being a cover up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This again. So the proof that it&#39;s not a cover-up is that no one came forward? I mean, maybe none of the witness handlers came forward, but we know of &quot;dozens, maybe hundreds&quot; of people who have come forward. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems like an enormous risk to take when you could just get some agency to release a report saying the exact same thing...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, that&#39;s the greater risk. A statement from an agency will have an agent or agency director tied to it. Someone to interview later for greater detail about the nature of the release, the source of the info in the release, etc. </p>

<p>Maybe it is his way, not everyone does the same thing. Maybe in his state of shock he&#39;s acting a bit weird, like most people that are in shock. Neither of us know what he&#39;s doing so neither of us can rule anything out, I&#39;m just saying that I find your idea hard to believe</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know, one or two maybe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One or two that just happen to be in the area of the camera and interviewer and just happen to be picked to be interviewed? What if the guy moved to another location before talking to them, would they follow him?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Ground zero isn&#39;t a term that originated on Sept 11th, it&#39;s been used for decades in regards to bombs, earthquakes, disasters etc. Maybe he heard someone else say it, like a TV reporter or someone on the news, or a police/fireman? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Such as who? Who has said they were involved in a 9/11 inside job? I&#39;ve never seen any of these people before, maybe they&#39;ve just been hushed on an international stage!</p>

<p>Also it isn&#39;t proof that it&#39;s a genuine attack, it makes it less likely. I never said it was proof. People are notoriously unreliable at keeping secrets, especially ones of such national importance. You only need one person to be of a guilty conscience and to report it to the news and it would, metaphorically, blow up</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Which can all be fabricated to make a realistic story, no? Seems odd to be relying on some &quot;random&quot; bloke on the street to explain the deadliest terrorist attack ever </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have but it makes no sense. If the government were going to bring these buildings down on purpose why would they tell news agencies before hand? Seriously think about it for a minute.  They just pull off the country&#39;s biggest terrorist event ever, and you&#39;ve set up the premise, the reasons, you&#39;ve made it look like the buildings collapsed by fire, everything is going smoothly. Why would you tell a foreign news agency? What benefit do they get from that?</p>

<p>Please answer these questions seriously instead of just dismissing what I&#39;m saying because I&#39;m trying to think about things critically (what all conspiracy theorists should do)</p>

<p>So one group of theorists say that it was all planned to be consistent and the other group say that there&#39;s too many inconsistencies? Which one is it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The interview is my evidence. You don&#39;t have to watch it. They had to make sure no media personnel said publically that &quot;wtc 7 is on fire but I doubt it will collapse because it wasn&#39;t hit by a plane&quot; or &quot;civilians reported explosions at the scene.&quot; They had to make sure their story was straight and they didn&#39;t have anyone worth listening to going against their agenda.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying that the interview suggests that there is more that we don&#39;t know than we could even imagine. And yes, all of those people were in on it and are blackmailed into silence. Do you see how the US treats whistleblowers? You can&#39;t just say &quot;be realistic&quot; when the fact is that BBC <em>did in fact</em> report that WTC 7 fell a half hour before it actually did. I don&#39;t think anyone watching wtc 7 would have thought that it would collapse. It wasn&#39;t even hit by a plane. But somehow all of the supporting steel structures were severed at the exact same time resulting in a freefall? That does not happen. Physically that <em>cannot</em> happen. You can&#39;t dismiss the larger conspiracy just because you think it would be too much to cover up. You don&#39;t know that. South Korea covered up a cult controlling their president. Think about the facts. Don&#39;t base your opinion on an assumption that it was too big to cover up. Look at the facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They covered it up and now it&#39;s been exposed, because it was too big to be kept secret. How do you not realise this is exactly my point?</p>

<p>Also that&#39;s not how building 7 fell, the connections to a central column were weakened by fire which lead to one floor to fall on the one below, cascading downwards. This brought down the central columns with it as some of the connections were still in tact. Then when all the central columns had collapsed there was just a mostly empty shell still standing, which wasn&#39;t strong enough to support itself so it collapsed, essentially at free fall.  The building didn&#39;t fall at free fall, the external shell did. You can even see that happening in the videos of WTC7 collapsing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a thought the other day.  What if the World Trade Center buildings being loaded with explosives and the Al Qaeda attacks were two mostly unrelated occurrences?</p>

<p>Back in &#39;93, the original Al Qaeda WTC terrorist drove a bomb into the basement of the WTC with the intent to detonate it and send the WTC tumbling over sideways onto five football fields of NY real estate, killing tens of thousands.</p>

<p>The Discovery Channel special I saw on the bombing said it was almost successful, that it was a minor miscalcuation and some lucky engineering that prevented them from falling.</p>

<p>So what if some small group of city fathers, the mayor and a half dozen unelected mucky mucks, get together and decide on their own that there needs to be a secret system to prevent terrorists from knocking NY buildings into other buildings.  Under Giuliani, every WTC building gets wired up with thermite.  Hell, maybe he had entire island of Manhattan wired up, like the mad King of the Targaeryns.  And somewhere, in a secret NY vault in the Port Authority or the Penthouse of the 4 Seasons, is a box with a secret code that could turn half the island into rubble.</p>

<p>So on 9/11, these city fathers are shitting themselves watching jet fuel burning inside buildings that are wired from top to bottom with explosives.  They can&#39;t say anything, because they would be implicated in any deaths, because they would lose any insurance claims, and because knowing about the system would potentially hand terrorists the keys to destroying half the city.</p>

<p>So they watched the buildings burn, until they saw that the jet fuel would trigger the detonation system.  That&#39;s why the first part of any building to collapse was the top part above the collision.  If the floors collapsing on each other were enough to create a free fall collapse, the entire building would have come down.  At the same time, if someone had intended to make it look like a natural collapse, they would have brought down the entire building.  That portion came down through mistake, and the subsequent collapses were triggered once it became inevitable.</p>
