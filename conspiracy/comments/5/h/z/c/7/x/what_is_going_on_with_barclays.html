        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before #pizzagate there was #crazydaysandnights. This post is taking a look at what we missed back in 2012.</p>

<p>After doing lots of digging, I have realized there was an attempt to warn about the elites and their shady practices in 2012 that was written off as a Hollywood rumor. I realized there was more to the story when I looked into organizations mentioned in the leaked Clinton emails.</p>

<p>My research, over and over, kept leading me back to Barclays. That bank is a key player in whatever is going on.</p>

<p>A few fast facts before we get into any speculation. Yes, these are 100% SOURCED facts.</p>

<ul>
<li>During his second term, President Bill Clinton signed the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which helped banks like Barclays <a href="https://libertyroadmedia.com/2014/02/13/price-rigging-is-the-name-of-the-game-taibbis-latest/">rig financial markets</a> in their favor.</li>
<li>Barclays bank <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/29/clinton-foundation-discloses-40-million-in-wall-street-donations/">donated millions</a> to the Clinton Foundation and has <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/commitments/barclays-dream-accounts">strong ties with the org</a></li>
<li>Clinton aide Doug Band has ties to Barclays through private consulting firm called Teneo Holdings. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/10/27/499601267/bill-clinton-inc-wikileaks-shows-links-between-foundation-personal-cash">Barclays is a client</a>
and Seth Martin, Teneo’s managing director, is a <a href="http://www.teneoholdings.com/leaders/seth_martin">former Barclays employee.</a></li>
<li>Jeffrey Epstein <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/banking/article4602063.ece">has ties to Barclays</a></li>
<li>Many prominent, former holders of office like Jeb Bush <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-jeb-bush-spent-his-years-on-wall-street-1438741822">have ties to Barclays</a></li>
<li>The Clintons <a href="http://freebeacon.com/blog/prominent-clinton-foundation-donor-imprisons-crew-of-journalists-investigating-worker-exploitation/">have ties</a> to prominent Middle Eastern families who also <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1082006/Barclays-7billion-deal-Arab-investors-scandal-mammoth-proportions.html">have ties to Barlcays</a></li>
</ul>

<p>How is any of this related to a Hollywood rumor?</p>

<p>Because <a href="http://dianajenkins.com/bio">Diana Jenkins</a> has ties to the Clintons, prominent Middle Eastern families, and Barclays. And Diana Jenkins is the subject of this Hollywood rumor.</p>

<p>For those who have not seen it, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/N7aFR">here’s the rumor</a> that got conspiracy theorists interested in Diana Jenkins (and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/zML4X">the blind item</a> that led to this rumor being posted). I have no clue if there is any truth to this rumor. There have been attempts to confirm these claims are legit and to discover <a href="http://jezebel.com/5892565/is-robert-downey-jr-spreading-insider-celeb-gossip-on-blogs">who the source of the rumor is.</a></p>

<p>I will go into this further, but first I want to address what many people missed while looking into Jenkin’s background: the Barclays connection. Many people focused on her Hollywood social circle and did not do much digging into her (and her ex-husband’s) business dealings.</p>

<p>(BTW Jenkins is not the only person associated with Barclays that has been accused of child abuse, who had rumors spread about them on the internet in 2012. That same year Jeffrey Epstein was supposedly trying to make his friend Jes Staley the new CEO of Barclays. Jes Staley did not get the job then but he is the current CEO. Which begs the question: why does someone like Epstein - a known sex offender at this point - have a say in who this bank hires? More on this later.)</p>

<p>Now, back to Jenkins.</p>

<p>Let’s dig into the Qatar/Libya connection.</p>

<ul>
<li>In 2006 Diana Jenkins <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/22/business/22bonus.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business">introduced</a> her husband (Barclays banker) Roger Jenkins to Hamad bin Jassim. (HBJ later became Prime Minister of Qatar. He was the PM during the start of the Libyan Crisis.)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Jenkins_(banker">In 2008</a>)
&quot;Barclays appointed Jenkins <strong>Executive Chairman of Investment Banking and Investment Management for the Middle East.</strong>[3] <strong>In November his connections in the region were influential in securing £7.3 billion of investment in Barclays</strong> as the bank sought private funding to recapitalise following the financial crisis of that year. Jenkins delivered Qatari involvement in the deal worth £4.5 billion”</li>
<li>It’s unclear when exactly Diana Jenkins became involved with the Clintons, but in <a href="http://dianajenkins.com/president-bill-clinton-foundation/">2010</a>
<strong>Diana Jenkins raised more than $1 million for President Bill Clinton’s Foundation.</strong></li>
<li>Also in 2010, <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/libya/2011-09-28/behind-qatars-intervention-libya">Qatar began supporting Libyan rebels.</a></li>
<li>In March 2011 Diana Jenkins encouraged international intervention in Libya. She even wrote an article entitled <em>Libyan Slaughter Cannot Go Unanswered</em> for <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/diana-jenkins/libyan-slaughter-cannot-g_b_830335.html">Huffpo.</a></li>
<li>That same month Qatar sent fighter jets to support NATO <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/libya/2011-09-28/behind-qatars-intervention-libya">air operations in Libya.</a></li>
<li>On August 20th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Crisis_(2011%E2%80%93present">2011</a>)
<strong>Gaddafi was ousted from power in the wake of the fall of Tripoli to the rebel forces</strong></li>
<li>When Gaddafi was ousted, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-foundation-idUSKBN12Z2SL">the Clinton foundation</a> 
&quot;accepted a $1 million gift from Qatar while Hillary Clinton was U.S. secretary of state without informing the State Department, even though she had promised to let the agency review new or significantly increased support from foreign governments. <strong>Qatari officials pledged the money in 2011 to mark the 65th birthday of Bill Clinton</strong>&quot;</li>
<li>Bill Clinton’s birthday is August 19. Interesting that this sudden gift, attributed to his birthday, came right around the time Gaddafi lost power.</li>
<li>That same year Qatar went on to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Libya#.C2.A0Qatar">significant influence within Libya.</a>
&quot;On 16 October 2011, the Qatari and Libyan governments signed a memorandum of understanding in Doha for cooperation between the justice ministries of the two states. Officials said the fledgling government of Libya could benefit from Qatar&#39;s experience in establishing justice, law and order.[115]
Despite the close relations between Qatar and the transitional authorities in Libya, Libyan UN Ambassador Abdurrahman Shalgham sharply criticised the Qatari government in early November, accusing it of attempting to manipulate affairs in Libya and comparing its leaders to Muammar Gaddafi. &quot;Let us decide our own destiny,&quot; said Shalgham. &quot;We do not consider them as neutral. We want neither Qatar nor the U.S.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, let’s look at the Ukraine connection.</p>

<ul>
<li>Former Ukraine Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko was accused of “‘ordering the murder’ of a member of parliament” in 1996. Tymoshenko and another former, PM Pavlo Lazarenko, were accused of paying nearly three million <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/tymoshenko-murder-life-sentence-286/">for the killing.</a></li>
<li>Both have connections with Barclays. “According to testimony of a witness, Lazarenko directed in the interests of Tymoshenko at least two bribes to Viakhirev, through the nominees Lucky Star Enterprises, Ltd. ($1.4 million on June 5, 1996) and Eagle Enterprises, Ltd. ($1,280,000 on June 11, 1996), <a href="http://uaba.org/Resources/Documents/Blog%20Docs/11-07-16%20Universal%20Trading%20v%20Tymoshenko%20Counterclaim.pdf"><strong>both accounts at Barclays Bank in Cayman Islands.”</strong></a></li>
<li>Ukranian boxing brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko, and Hollywood A-lister George Clooney are all close friends of Diana Jenkins. Although rumors of her treatment of Hayden Panettiere are unsubstantiated they have a well-known relationship since her early years, and HP became Wladimir Klitschki fiancé a few years ago.</li>
<li>The Klitschko brothers and Clooney were <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2013/12/10/george-clooney-ukraine">supporters of Yulia and supported the uprising in the UK.</a></li>
<li>And Vitali showed an interest in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/dec/02/vitali-klitschko-next-president-ukraine-boxer">running the country.</a></li>
<li>Hillary Clinton’s state department pushed an anti-Russian agenda that led to trouble for Yulia Tymoshenko’s enemies <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2016/02/hillary-clintons-six-foreign-policy-catastrophes.html">in Ukraine.</a> “The groundwork for a coup d’etat in Ukraine was laid by Hillary Clinton, when she made her State Department’s official spokesperson Victoria Nuland, who had been the chief foreign-affairs advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney. Nuland then became the organizer of the 20 February 2014 coup in Ukraine, which replaced a neutralist leader of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, with a rabidly anti-Russian U.S. puppet, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, and a bloody civil war. Nuland is obsessed with hatred of Russia.”</li>
</ul>

<p>The Haiti connection</p>

<ul>
<li>Andrew Kessel was instrumental in making the Clinton Foundation a billion dollar, global organization. He was a big part of coordinating the foundation’s work in Haiti. He was a managing director at Barclays <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/about/leadership-team">for nearly a decade.</a></li>
<li>Diana Jenkins also got involved in Haiti relief efforts. She founded the J/P Haitian Relief Organization with Sean Penn. (Yes, <a href="http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2016/01/is-sean-penn-cia-operative.html">THAT</a> Sean Penn.)</li>
<li>Pamela Anderson ran in a marathon to support the J/P org’s efforts <a href="http://www.espn.com/espnw/athletes-life/article/9909023/pamela-anderson-haiti-run-espnw">in Haiti.</a> (Yes, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2016/oct/17/strange-case-news-hogging-vegan-sandwich-pamela-anderson-julian-assange">THAT</a> Pamela Anderson.) She has been friends with Jenkins for years: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/27/celebrit">“...the mystery blonde who was bridesmaid at Pamela Anderson&#39;s wedding...”</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It’s sort of odd that someone who is such good friends with a Clinton Foundation contributor like Jenkins would be bring Julian Assange of all people vegan food, no? TBC. I have a lot more research to layout but this is getting long and I’d like to hear others’ thoughts on this.</p>

<p>Here is something you might find interesting.  It is called &quot;Confessions of a Satanist&quot; and is a post that appeared back in 2010 on David Icke&#39;s site (reposted on mark passio&#39;s site).  </p>

<p>I just ran across it this weekend and was looking for a way to get it into the hands of someone doing research.  It is most definitely NOT &quot;the missing link&quot; etc. since it does not directly reference DJ.  However,  it is somewhat of an explanatory essay on how the sex sorcery, pedo abuse, etc goes on in the upper echelons of society.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whatonearthishappening.com/images/stories/woeih/podcast/071/Confessions-Of-A-Satanist.pdf">http://www.whatonearthishappening.com/images/stories/woeih/podcast/071/Confessions-Of-A-Satanist.pdf</a></p>

<p>It seems to me it is written in a similar voice as this piece:
<a href="http://whale.to/c/insider.html">http://whale.to/c/insider.html</a></p>

<p>I was not shocked when recently a bunch of pics of Pam Anderson at a spirit cooking &quot;art&quot; event  involving a mock cannibal ritual showed up (somehow this is okay because she&#39;s veeeeeeegan right?).  I am perplexed as to why JA was in contact with her given her connections to the dark occultists.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really have anything else to offer you at this time.  You are doing an excellent job putting forward the connections and relationships.  It will be interesting to see what else you have connected.</p>

<p>Specifics would be nice so I can address the issue. Let me know what links are messed up so I can correct them or replace them with another source. Also, please explain what you see as &quot;nonsense-gibberish&quot; so I can address that as well. Some links will not take you straight to whatever I&#39;m discussing in the post, which is why I tried to include quotes from sources so you can easily review the information at the link by searching with the quote I&#39;ve provided.</p>

<p>What is the credibility of the author?</p>

<p>What credibility are you looking for? This is personal research and nothing more, which is why I have painstakingly sought out what would be considered &quot;credible&quot; sources. I&#39;m not a journalist, not even an amateur journalist with a blog or anything. I have personal reasons for taking an interest that don&#39;t need to be shared with the internet and couldn&#39;t be independently confirmed anyway.</p>

<p>Are you claiming I am those other accounts or...? I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re implying. Please send a message to admins if you think someone is using other accounts to promote their own post. I can assure you I am not and have no worries about an admin checking to be sure.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted before. I deleted my account. I won&#39;t go into specifics because things I&#39;ve posted on multiple sites have led to harassment of regular people, which was never my intention. Now I&#39;m keeping my focus on public figures (CEOs, celebrities, etc). I don&#39;t want my current posts linked to any of my old posts because some of the research is related and involves non-public figures.</p>
