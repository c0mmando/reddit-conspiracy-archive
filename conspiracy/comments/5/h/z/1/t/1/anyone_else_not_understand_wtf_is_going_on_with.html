       I'm trying to find a detailed, logical explanation of what the hell is going on but frankly I don't know where to look. There isn't a single newspaper I've seen that is addressing a few basic questions that imo need to be answered. Furthermore,
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is full on batsh*t insane while
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       is just treating it like a joke. I even checked
       <a href="/r/neutralpolitics">
        /r/neutralpolitics
       </a>
       and the thread is full of biased misinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't post on this site much but to be honest I think I'd be more likely to find at least open-minded discussion here. So if people wouldn't mind trying to answer a few of these questions I'd appreciate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) What is the difference between a hack and a leak, were these hacks or leaks? As far as I can tell there is a great range of opinion on this, and it seems very important.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) What exactly was hacked/leaked by whom? As far as I understand there are DNC hacks/leaks, Podesta email hacks/leaks, Clinton server hacks/leaks, Weiner hacks/leaks etc. Why don't people differentiate when discussing these? What exactly is the CIA claiming to have been hacked by the Russians?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Was the RNC actually hacked and IF so how does this have any connection to Trump? Was the RNC hacked before he was the nominee or after? Was it the national RNC or simply the Illinois RNC as some sources are claiming? Would withholding information on the RNC really help Trump (considering the two groups were at odds for so long)? How is it that NOBODY is considering this. It really is absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Were these supposed hacks of PUBLIC or PRIVATE servers? Is it the US government that was hacked or simply private entities (RNC/DNC). To me this is incredibly important particularly when people begin throwing around terms like treason.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Is there ANY proof of Trump being hacked - by this, I mean is the CIA/NSA/FBI investigating Trump being hacked? Is there ANY investigation ongoing into Trump's connection with Putin? Please do not link to some blog shit like I saw on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Is there any reason to think this would have any effect on Trump taking office at all? Or would the effects be more likely felt after he takes office?
      </p>
      <p>
       This story is so convoluted and full of absolute BS all around that I honestly have no idea where to look for even a summary of events.

      <p>
       1) A leak is a leaking of information, a hack is the unauthorized access to a computer system.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) No one knows the actual source of the DNC emails, however it is suspected that Seth Rich supplied them before his death (RIP). The Podesta emails were "hacked" by means of a simple phishing scam, literally any 15 year old script kiddie could have pulled that off. There's also the matter of the emails found on Wiener and Huma's laptop, which as far as I know have not been leaked to the public, there's hundred of thousands of them according to the FBI. From what I understand, Wiener was syncing Huma's emails on the shared computer to use as "life insurance" (blackmail) in the event he needed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) No evidence that I've heard of indicates the RNC was hacked. Assange did state on one occasion that they did have some information leaked from the RNC, but "it was no more damaging than what Trump says on a daily basis".
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The Podesta emails were from his personal email, a public domain. The DNC emails were from a private server. As I said, we do not know the origin of the DNC emails, it is completely possible they weren't hacked at all, just leaked to Wikileaks by someone who had access to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) As far as I've heard, the only evidence of Russian "interference" is the media saying that an ex-CIA member says there is. There is absolutely no proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Can't say for sure, if TPTB really are scared of a Trump administration, they will do whatever they can to stop him. I think it's a bit more complicated than that, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully this helps.

       Original Guccifer and Seth Rich are likely the unsung hero's of this. Guccifer 2.0 couldnt be more obviously a limited hangout. Who knows when assange was killed or comprimised. Tptb have mastered the art of deflection and distraction. They are always a few steps ahead.

       If Russia hacked the elections you would not be hearing about it in the news.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Craig Murray, the former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan, who is a close associate of Assange, called the CIA claims “bullshit”, adding: “They are absolutely making it up.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “I know who leaked them,” Murray said. “I’ve met the person who leaked them, and they are certainly not Russian and it’s an insider. It’s a leak, not a hack; the two are different things.
       </p>
       <p>
        “If what the CIA are saying is true, and the CIA’s statement refers to people who are known to be linked to the Russian state, they would have arrested someone if it was someone inside the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        “America has not been shy about arresting whistleblowers and it’s not been shy about extraditing hackers. They plainly have no knowledge whatsoever.”

       Yeah I read this and find it very interesting, but I do disagree with the idea that the hacker could/would necessarily be arrested. If the hacker was indeed Russian then wouldn't the Russians refuse to extradite him and therefore even asking for extradition would be pointless?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to know more about the hack vs leak dynamic though. To me that's the key to determining whether this has any basis at all.

       So just to be clear, there are two guccifers? And the first one was responsible for hacking the clinton email server while the second one is supposedly responsible for hacking the DNC email server. Or am I confusing things?

       You are correct and neither is Russian. The british politician met with the guccifer 2...or the collective that is g2. Guccifer1 is the real hero of this whole story. Well worth the detailed look. Pay close attention to his open letter to Hillary about her server...He called it back in May that she was DOA.

       I feel like the CIA does not answer to the President, and hasn't for a long time. Seems like the CIA is largely controlled by those with more power than the President, or at least a different niche of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI seems divided, the recent Wiener scandal showed that Comey had no choice but to bend over to the corrupt DOJ. I don't know enough to say whether Comey is a bad guy, but I don't believe so, he's just in a real crappy position of having a lot of intelligence but not being able to act on it for political reasons. I do believe there are a lot of good people in the FBI that do want to expose the high level corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope, if anything, Trump does clean up the intelligence agencies. We're seeing he's definitely not going to be shy to making deals with very rich and powerful players, I guess we can only hope that most of the players actually do want good for society and not just themselves.

       I agree. The CIA is the de facto controlling power from what I can tell. At least they do whatever it is they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand there are far more "powerful" groups that have never been discussed or mentioned to the public or even congress, but for all the coercion, propaganda, overthrows, drug running, child kidnapping, torture, etc., the CIA is linked. Honestly I have felt that Obama was a child of one of their programs, as there is good circumstantial evidence that both his "parents" were either CIA or similar assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am willing to extend the benefit of doubt to Trump regarding his cabinet selections. The man is obviously very good at what he does. What I am requiring however is dissolution of the CIA, and complete prosecution for the entirety of the trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before anyone says I'm gonna get my heart broken, I fully expect it. I'm just hoping on the 1% chance he means and will do what he says.

       Batshit insane is an understatement.  I'm starting to wonder if I'm the crazy one because their evidence of Russian hacking is insufficient.  What do they see that I am not?
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The belief is that Guccifer 2.0 stole a bunch of shit from the DNC via hacks, then leaked them to Wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Guccifer 2.0, who is alleged by the DNC and our government to be a Russian agent despite his denial of Russian origin, leaked a bunch of shit to Wikileaks.  I don't know if he had anything to do with the Podesta leak, but he took credit for the DNC emails leak.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) I don't know if the RNC was hacked.  Wikileaks has stated on multiple occasions that they have not received any leaks from Trump's campaign or the RNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) AFAIK, the DNC is a special private club, despite being part of the ruling class, and their servers are likely considered private as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) I haven't seen any.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) I hope not.  I have a funny feeling that if they try to take it from Trump with the electoral vote on the 19th, the people with guns will want to go to war against the people without guns.

       According to wikileaks, and anyone who claims to know about them, they were leaks. The suggestion by Assange is that they came from Seth rich, a DNC insider who was murdered in the streets. They don't say it directly, but they offered a reward for info on his death and have strongly hinted at the leaks coming from him.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the DNC leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pedestal leaks came from the DNC leaks where his email password had been exchanged. Even following leaks stemming from his email, the password remained unchanged and people from 4chan logged in and got his twitter password and tweeted from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest, have not heard about it. Sounds like smoke and mirrors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outcome is to attempt to delegitimize Trump as much as possible. He threatens the globalist agenda and the easiest way to attack a leader is to challenge his moral authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       The globalists will fight tooth and nail all the way, lying as much as they can to do so.

       So how does this tie into the Clinton server scandal that the FBI was investigating?
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be great if there were any way to actually figure out whether this was a hack/leak but as far as I'm aware neither the CIA nor wikileaks would ever be willing to divulge their sources. I guess that's the ultimate problem.

       When the NYPD's search of Anthony Weiner's laptop revealed 650,000 Clinton emails, the FBI reopened the case against Hillary merely to come in and confiscate the emails from the NYPD and keep them from seeing the light of day.

       I know the answer to this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       In April, the DNC realized that that unauthorized users may be accessing their servers, and had a private firm investigate- CrowdStrike.
      </p>
      <p>
       The private security team came to the conclusion that there were (at LEAST) two groups somewhat independently illegally accessing the DNC servers.
      </p>
      <p>
       When wikileaks leaked documents supposedly stolen from the hacked servers, the immediate rebuttal was that the leaks were given to wikileaks by russian intelligence agencies.  CrowdStrike has associated the hallmarkThe rationalization for this conclusion were that the hackers bore the hallmarks of known Russian intelligence cyber-operatives (dubbed "fancy bear"/ The Russian GRU, and "cozy bear"/ Russian FSB.) As I understand it, those supposed "hallmarks" are actually just hallmarks of hackers in general- including their use of fake websites for phishing account names and passwords (or something of the likes).  And the particular times that they were accessing the servers seemed to indicate they worked within Russian timezones, and there was maybe a Russian holiday where they were not active on the servers.  There also may have been certain IP addresses used, which would indicate their location.  CrowdStrike has not published any particular information to justify how they've associated these particular hackers with the FSB or GRU as far as I can tell, but they continue to repeat it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guccifer 2.0 was supposedly the moniker of the hacker who claimed to be Romanian, and to have released the documents to Wikileaks.  Apparently, there was some communication with Guccifer 2.0 which indicated that Romanian was not their first language, thus leading to the presumption that they were actually russian, pretending to be romanian as cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you deconstruct this investigation, it is clear that the evidence is weak- but that the accusation is based more on motive.

      </p>
      <p>
       As far as additional leaks go- like the podesta emails- i think the suggestion is that his email addresses were found through the dnc leaks, and the passwords were really obvious or discoverable through brute force cracks. As a recall, there were 4channers still accessing his social media accounts even after his emails were leaked.  His emails included some much newer than the DNC emails, which end in april, if i remember correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a follow-up to claims by the DNC and HRC campaign that the emails were hacked by russia/ andor faked:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On October 7, 2016, the United States Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated that the US intelligence community was confident that the Russian government directed the breaches and the release of the obtained or allegedly obtained material in an attempt to "… interfere with the US election process."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This letter was signed by James Clapper- who is known and acknowledged to have lied to congress about the Snowden revelations, so it's important to parse the language used.  From what I can see, they didn't actually accuse the Russians of the leaks- but rather suggested that there was evidence to show they had been involved in hacking the DNC servers and that them being involved in the leaks would line up with a supposed M.O. of disrupting our democratic process.

       I can elaborate with links on anything, but I wanted to answer this myself too.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) A leak would be someone taking the information and giving the information to wikileaks that already had access to the information. A hack would be someone hacking into email accounts and downloading them and then giving it to wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Presumably the Podesta emails are the DNC email leaks being discussed for the most part. No one knows who hacked what, really. The official story that has been out for months(not recently) is that two Russian Agencies, Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear, were identified to have hacked the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as leaking goes, people anonymously send leaks to Wikileaks and they leak stuff. So the question is always "Who anonymously sent wikileaks these emails?"
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Not clear if RNC were hacked. The republicans say only individual people were hacked, not their party computers. This is a wash. Since it isn't clear if the RNC was hacked and what was hacked, it isn't clear if there was any information worth leaking in the RNC hack. As I said, this is a black hole unless if we get something more definite.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       4) Private servers.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump being hacked isn't something I have ever seen discussed. There is no public investigation into Trump's connection with Putin, only non-government entities doing so. Considering this is r/conspiracy tho, you can bet intelligence agencies have checked on it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I don't think the Russia stuff will stop Trump from office, the worry is more that it will be used to pass bills that say they are to stop foreign influence but are really used to control the media and internet.
