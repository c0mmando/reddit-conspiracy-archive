       It appears to me that this recent push against "Fake News" is nothing more than a ploy to begin the process of nullifying our "Freedom of Speech". If we allow Governments to dictate what is "Real News" or "Fake News" then we are surrendering one of our most important rights as free people. It shouldn't matter if you believe a story is fake or not, whoever wrote it has a right to do so. It's up to us to defend that right. If we don't stand up for them, who will stand up for us when the time comes?

       "Fake news" is just a replacement for "conspiracy theorist", because so many conspiracies have been proven as true that it can no longer be used as a term for discrediting conspiracies.

       PizzaGate may or may not be real. But the incoming government, under TRUMP, has already told us exactly what they plan to do. Their declarations are lost in the smoke of PizzaGate.

      <p>
       Don't get me wrong. There may be something to PizzaGate.

       But currently, it is being used as a cover to go after the First Amendment.

       Enough 'Fake News' and the gov has a compelling, and widely supported, reason to censor everyone.

       This is not conjecture. LOOK at what Trump has suggested for locking up journalists and dissenters of all stripes.

       I've posted videos from
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Vote3rdParty/videos">
        this channel
       </a>
       before and was told it's nothing but liberal propaganda. One person even refused to address it on the grounds that he tries to avoid breaching Godwin's Law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny thing about those videos - they were completely and utterly ignored by
       <em>
        everybody
       </em>
       . Not just the Trump supporters, but Clinton's as well. When I posted one of those videos just after the election, it had less than a thousand views despite being up for over three months, and all his other vid's were the same - almost non-existant viewers despite having a treasure trove of material that Clinton could have used against Trump.

       the 'spirit cooking' and kiddie sex scenes are two different but possibly overlapping scenes in DC.

       overlapping explain why attacks on one scene provokes outrage by the MSM, the rest are likely to unravel.

       Yep. A commented on npr's pizzagate fake news story on fb and one guys rwply to me was that an exception ahould be made about fake news in the first amendment.
I said he was basically promoting propaganda and authoritarianism. I asked how he proposes that caveat works. Alex Jones isnt bringing you the truth. He is the tool to crack down on alternative media. He is pretty much the opposite of wikileaks. Everything he touches is tainted because he is so full of it. You create someone like that and then you can have him utter whatever you want the citizenry to dismiss out of hand while giving those same people an instant argument "where'd you read that, infowars." Perfect tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you buy into his garbage its time to wake up. He exists so there is a seeming excuse for attacking free information flow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones and info wars exist to give people a viable excuse for giving the government more control to stop things like wikileaks and other publishers that arent on the establishment payroll, but publishing truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left has lost its mind. "Fake news gave us the worst candidate and made a guy do something crazy (eveb though wikileaks published real information and the msm is the forerunner in glorifying violence) so lets restrict the freedom of the press and alter the first amendment."
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no web building skills, but I am pretty reasonable, considerate , and want to write. We need a new unbiased media source.

       I was watching ABC NEWS and they continuously repeated "Fake News" when talking about that shooter and the title and description of their report both said "Fake News". They were denying it so much that I believe in Pizzagate more now than I did before.

        this channel

       before and was told it's nothing but liberal propaganda. One person even refused to address it on the grounds that he tries to avoid breaching Godwin's Law.
      </p>

       Funny thing about those videos - they were completely and utterly ignored by
       <em>
        everybody
       </em>
       . Not just the Trump supporters, but Clinton's as well. When I posted one of those videos just after the election, it had less than a thousand views despite being up for over three months, and all his other vid's were the same - almost non-existant viewers despite having a treasure trove of material that Clinton could have used against Trump.
