If we allow Governments to dictate what is &quot;Real News&quot; or &quot;Fake News&quot; then we are surrendering one of our most important rights as free people. It shouldn&#39;t matter if you believe a story is fake or not, whoever wrote it has a right to do so. It&#39;s up to us to defend that right.

<p>And been called a psy-ops shill.</p>

<p>This is a deadly warning, and everyone is ignoring it. It&#39;s terrifying.</p>

<p>PizzaGate may or may not be real. But the incoming government, under TRUMP, has already told us exactly what they plan to do. Their declarations are lost in the smoke of PizzaGate.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. There may be something to PizzaGate.</p>

<p>But currently, it is being used as a cover to go after the First Amendment.</p>

<p>Enough &#39;Fake News&#39; and the gov has a compelling, and widely supported, reason to censor everyone.</p>

<p>This is not conjecture. LOOK at what Trump has suggested for locking up journalists and dissenters of all stripes.</p>

<p>This is horrifying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. A commented on npr&#39;s pizzagate fake news story on fb and one guys rwply to me was that an exception ahould be made about fake news in the first amendment.
I said he was basically promoting propaganda and authoritarianism. I asked how he proposes that caveat works. Alex Jones isnt bringing you the truth. He is the tool to crack down on alternative media. He is pretty much the opposite of wikileaks. Everything he touches is tainted because he is so full of it. You create someone like that and then you can have him utter whatever you want the citizenry to dismiss out of hand while giving those same people an instant argument &quot;where&#39;d you read that, infowars.&quot; Perfect tool.</p>

<p>So if you buy into his garbage its time to wake up. He exists so there is a seeming excuse for attacking free information flow.</p>

<p>Alex Jones and info wars exist to give people a viable excuse for giving the government more control to stop things like wikileaks and other publishers that arent on the establishment payroll, but publishing truth.</p>

<p>The left has lost its mind. &quot;Fake news gave us the worst candidate and made a guy do something crazy (eveb though wikileaks published real information and the msm is the forerunner in glorifying violence) so lets restrict the freedom of the press and alter the first amendment.&quot;</p>

<p>I have no web building skills, but I am pretty reasonable, considerate , and want to write. We need a new unbiased media source.</p>
