       This makes me really disappointed. I used to live coming to this sub, even enjoying some of the UFO posts.. it's like trump created this army to infiltrate actual "free thinkers" and did l try to distract us from stuff he'll be doing the next 4 years

       Trump didn't create it, his corporate handlers did.  These people are here not on behalf of Trump or even the GOP, but rather corporate think tanks that have a vested interest in Trump maintaining good public relations with certain demographics, the majority right-wing 'conspiracy demo' being one of them.   Any submissions that reflect badly on Trump, Big oil, Wall st, etc are either ignored or downvoted just enough to keep them off the front page without raising suspicion.  If you don't believe me, just wait until theres a thread regarding this activity and watch the vote count.

       What are you even talking about? The reason this bullshit doesn't gain any traction is because it's partisan as fuck. This is not the Donald, this is not drain the swamp. We don't blindly support Trump and I don't know why you think we would.

       Conspiracy forums tend to lean towards mistrust of the government, and with due cause, but corporate interests often capitalize on that distrust by associating the government with other issues they see as obstacles to greater profits, like climate change and environmental regulation, for example.  It doesn't excuse their behavior, but it explains why they invest resources in manipulating conspiracy forums.
      </p>

       Unfortunately, for every person who isn't bought on these types of subs there are several who are, if not more.  Can't manufacture false consensus without the numbers to back it up..

       You do realize that the planet is already fucked for other reasons, and climate change has nothing to do with it, right?

       So you're saying the name suggests it's natural? Dig a little deeper dipshit. 
Look at the trajectory our earth is on. It's heated up more in the past 100 years than in the millions of years before. 
"Global warming? It's cold as SHIT outside!" Is not a valid argument against global warming.
"The climate changes all the time! It's called seasons!" - this is so dumb I just realized there's no sense in replying but oh well I already wrote it.

       Are you telling me that when you hear the term "99% of experts" agree on something your bullshit meter doesnt go off? just look at the way climate treaties are unconstitutionally ratified, that's for a reason. The very term "climate change" is absolutely neutral, yet it evokes religious levels of apocalyptic fever from some people. Pollution, deforestation, mass animal farming, are all bad things, but not enough of a reason to hand over your sovereignty, especially when the solution always seems to be: MORE TAXES!!

       Facts don't care about consensus. Science is literally the opposite of consensus. If 6,999,999,999 people all believe one thing is a fact, it only takes 1 person to prove them wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time and time again throughout history sciences have exclaimed this or that is an absolute fact, despite it being completely wrong. The history of science is replete with failures and dogmatic thinking.

       The earth has been way hotter, and way colder than it is today many times. It's also had way more and way less co2 many times. None of that variation due to humans. We're talking about several billion years of extreme variations yet in 100 years humans are blamed for a small change? Huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a quick 8 minute explanation from founder of the weather network:

       The climate change movement is antihuman at its core. It's designed to wipe out the middle class, and cause billions of deaths from lack of industrialization, while creating a trillion dollar carbon credit economy. The carbon credit scam will make a few people rich, allow big business to pollute as usual, and make it impossible for small competitors to enter markets.

       Idgaf about big oil. And I don't disagree with scientist but I don't simply believe everything I read either. I'm not going to listen to scientist headlines and predictions with little proof.

       Trump didn't create it, his corporate handlers did.  These people are here not on behalf of Trump or even the GOP, but rather corporate think tanks that have a vested interest in Trump maintaining good public relations with certain demographics, the majority right-wing 'conspiracy demo' being one of them.   Any submissions that reflect badly on Trump, Big oil, Wall st, etc are either ignored or downvoted just enough to keep them off the front page without raising suspicion.  If you don't believe me, just wait until theres a thread regarding this activity and watch the vote count.

       So you're saying the name suggests it's natural? Dig a little deeper dipshit. 
Look at the trajectory our earth is on. It's heated up more in the past 100 years than in the millions of years before. 
"Global warming? It's cold as SHIT outside!" Is not a valid argument against global warming.
"The climate changes all the time! It's called seasons!" - this is so dumb I just realized there's no sense in replying but oh well I already wrote it.
