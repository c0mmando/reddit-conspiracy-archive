<p>Since the person didn&#39;t ask any questions at all. They just stated that there is no circumstantial evidence at all, and then acted like it was only about the emails. </p>

<p>Your posts over the pedogate investigation do seem off compared to your post history prior to becoming seemingly passionate about this topic. Your share your own conspiracy theories despite not having &quot;proof&quot; in which you accuse political figures of things like like deliberately killing a bunch of people via 9/11, you just use &quot;rumors&quot; per your own words and circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>What makes you feel so differently, and strongly so, about the suspicions towards Podesta, using the same wikileaks emails that you previously used to as proof of Hillary&#39;s corruption?</p>

<p>All there <em>is</em> is circumstantial evidence.  Knee-jerk reactions are all over the place by any pizzagater.  People rushing to judgement, completely irrational, that&#39;s what people have turned into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So.. You&#39;re making one sweeping judgement against <em>all</em> people who are suspicious about Podesta and others, after making your own thread complaining that anyone who questions pizzagate is called a shill?</p>

<p>And then in this thread</p>

<p>You say, &quot;What I am, is someone really fucking sick of large groups making disgusting accusations without any proof. You&#39;re a shill, and a helpless coward.&quot;</p>

<p>Even though as already mentioned, your own conspiracy theories have been presented by you (and many others who share those views of yours) without any &quot;proof&quot; and your theories accused political figures of murder on a massive scale. </p>

<p>You&#39;re just coming across as.. off, in a way. It might be that you are getting called a shill by some people because of that, not because everyone who questions pizza/pedogate is considered a shill. </p>

<p>Plus it is irritating when people don&#39;t care enough to take 30 minutes to read through the top threads on the voat sub and then discuss the material there, but instead want us to copy/paste a novel over and over every time they want to argue with us here or elsewhere. Just tells us that they don&#39;t actually care and will ignore whatever we say anyway, since they are already ignoring all of the material they could easily be reading just by hopping over to voat. </p>

<p>So yeah, a lot of &#39;debates&#39; are going to be empty bickering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You use &quot;us&quot; and &quot;we&quot; a lot, mouse in your pocket?</p>

<p>I was very interested in PG until this last week, when everyone who thinks it has some validity, lost their collective minds.  I&#39;m used to arguments, but the vile accusations get a bit tiresome, for simply asking a valid question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just trying to talk with you in the same way you seem to think, thought it might help calm you down a bit, but I guess not. </p>

<p>I&#39;m over on Voat, myself, now, just joined recently, username &quot;SheSaidDestroy&quot; and I made a comment explaining why I think the gunman incident may have been baited trap, if it was staged, and I explained why. Didn&#39;t take long at all for someone to aggressively accuse me of shilling. Someone else called them out for it. Might be more comments since them, I don&#39;t know haven&#39;t checked yet.</p>

<p>There are definitely people who are interested in the investigation for the sake of their own ego, and I&#39;m sure those who move against us are counting on that, as well. Corrupt elites don&#39;t successfully stay in power for so long without having some very highly strategic think tanks working for them. </p>

<p>But whatever. If someone rages at me and calls me a shill, I don&#39;t care. I want to be strategic, because I want to raise public awareness of the issue of child trafficking in powerful governments. People who want to stroke their own ego and be the super cool detective who is never wrong about anything, are a waste of my time. </p>

<p>But I was curious if you were also one of those people, i.e. &quot;Some people disagreed with me and were mean, so screw PG, I&#39;m going to try to smear everyone working in it, so there!&quot; or if you had a more respectable reason for changing your standards from one theory to another.</p>

<p>Now I know.</p>

<p>All of you pizzagate people have lost your minds.  You do know that, don&#39;t you? </p>

<p>******** <strong>edit:</strong> What follows <em>was</em> <strong>u/SlumberMachine</strong> bizarrely calling me first <strong>a satanist, a pedophile protector, implied that I myself rape children, and then continued on with absolutely baseless, petty, vindictive, insane things even involving my family.</strong>  You can see that the coward deleted all of their comments before the mods would do anything. u/SlumberMachine also invited me to doxx them in an absolute bizarre fashion.</p>

<p>A couple of comments above, you can see I was accused of duct taping girls to tables.  They forgot to delete a couple.  This person is ill, attacking random people, and I have no idea why they are allowed to keep their account here.  And yes, I did report this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s like calling someone a Nazi or a pedophile to shut them up.  Or calling them a shill.  You attack the person instead of their argument, in an ad hominem attack.  Calling someone a troll just because they disagree with you would fall under the same thing.  I&#39;m guessing you have familiarity with logical fallacies, being the discerning connoisseur of evidence that you are right?  I&#39;m not sure about the fake news thing.

    <div class="md"><p>You edited your previous post, then deleted it, then posted a whole bunch of swear words as a reply to insult me, deleted that, and then came back with a mild reply.  Why?  Why even bother and not just let it go after you deleted your other comments?  </p>

<p>Your post history and what I&#39;ve seen others report about you acting in the same hostile manner towards them makes me think it&#39;s pointless to attempt to converse with you for more than a message or two.  So this is two and I&#39;m done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They seem a bit unhinged, maybe dangerously so.  I didn&#39;t screenshot any of his replies before they were deleted, but it&#39;s possible they are getting angry and flustered anytime someone doesn&#39;t agree with them.  I&#39;m definitely going to be keeping an eye out for them because I feel they might be really close to outright threats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So.. You&#39;re making one sweeping judgement against <em>all</em> people who are suspicious about Podesta and others, after making your own thread complaining that anyone who questions pizzagate is called a shill?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5h38o2/til_anyone_who_ever_raises_a_question_about/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5h38o2/til_anyone_who_ever_raises_a_question_about/</a></p>

<p>And then in this thread</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5h2ren/this_video_enough_evidence_for_cps_to_investigate/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5h2ren/this_video_enough_evidence_for_cps_to_investigate/</a></p>

<p>You say, &quot;What I am, is someone really fucking sick of large groups making disgusting accusations without any proof. You&#39;re a shill, and a helpless coward.&quot;</p>

<p>Even though as already mentioned, your own conspiracy theories have been presented by you (and many others who share those views of yours) without any &quot;proof&quot; and your theories accused political figures of murder on a massive scale. </p>

<p>You&#39;re just coming across as.. off, in a way. It might be that you are getting called a shill by some people because of that, not because everyone who questions pizza/pedogate is considered a shill. </p>

<p>Plus it is irritating when people don&#39;t care enough to take 30 minutes to read through the top threads on the voat sub and then discuss the material there, but instead want us to copy/paste a novel over and over every time they want to argue with us here or elsewhere. Just tells us that they don&#39;t actually care and will ignore whatever we say anyway, since they are already ignoring all of the material they could easily be reading just by hopping over to voat. </p>

<p>So yeah, a lot of &#39;debates&#39; are going to be empty bickering.</p>

<p>I was very interested in PG until this last week, when everyone who thinks it has some validity, lost their collective minds.  I&#39;m used to arguments, but the vile accusations get a bit tiresome, for simply asking a valid question.</p>
