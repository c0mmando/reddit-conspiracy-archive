<p>Did they start out as satan worshippers and somehow the version of Satan-religion they follow told them to commit these acts?</p>

<p>Or were they pedophiles and just decided for shits and giggles to throw satanic imagery over it to give it more of an evil tone? We all acknowledge pedophilia is a sinister act...might as well go all-out and make it blatantly satanic!</p>

<p>What exactly is the role of Satan in all of this? Surely abusing kids without the Satanic images and symbols would have sufficed.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Luciferianism. Many and varied sects therof. It might look like a fine line to you or me (and it really is) but their belief is in a process of &quot;enlightenment&quot; that literally sets its goals in a human being becoming a &quot;god&quot;. There is nothing of what you would recognise as a moral code surrounding the practices that get you to that &quot;enlightenment&quot; but torture, both of the acolyte and the many victims of their rituals, is a key element.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, because those wanting to be one are not only delusional enough to believe that they truly can be one but they also tend to have the power to fool not only themselves but the entire world into believing they do have such power... and they enjoy being malicious and hateful little &quot;deities&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the same delusion, really. The only real difference is that they do have material power, whereas your run of the mill religious worshipper tends not to. I also think that anyone with that power probably doesn&#39;t believe in gods and devils. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For many people the fact that there is ritual abuse in high politics conjoined with pedophilia is old news. Whistleblowers have come out for years. Victims have spoken out and received nothing but silence or ridicule. You can find dozens of cases in a short search. 
Fritz Springmeir might be the most famous of voices on the matter.</p>

<p>For me, there&#39;s no theory. I&#39;m a ritual abuse survivor, and it is absolutely a huge beast that reaches across religious institutions, law enforcement, education, etc., etc. No reason to think twice about it being in the highest government positions as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, look, my lifetime of PTSD and dissociative symptoms aren&#39;t for your entertainment. My abuse was real and severe and i answered here because i feel there is a chance there are people here with real questions, but you&#39;re not one of those. The answers i gave are a succinct idea of the things i can process now since i&#39;ve only been able to understand what happened to me as a child in the last 6 years. That&#39;s what dissociation does. It robs you of years of your life. So, you can talk your opinion of assumptions, i&#39;ve lived through worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Goes back to the cult of Osiris/Isis from what I understand. It is also similar to Ancient Greece where pedantry was &quot;elite privilage&quot;. Then there is ancient Babylon worshiping Moloch, then the Khazars worshiping Moloch. Probably many more civilizations that had similar sex cults and pagan god worship that we never hear about. 
For the people at the top, it is a spiritual matter IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like that to me. If it was purely a pedophilia thing, there would be no point in adding satanism on top of it.</p>

<p>But the thing is, why the fuck is everyone in the democratic party secret Satanists? WTF is the point? Hillary is quoting scripture in her concession speech. But behind close doors they are worshiping this god and that god...and not even &quot;good&quot; gods but literally satan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why the democratic party? - because the satan worshipers deny god. they believe lucifer is their &#39;god&#39;. most of the republican party believe in the bible and jesus. it&#39;s harder to turn those people into satanists.</p>

<p>edit: also this is all prophesied in the bible. in the final days good will become bad. bad will become good. they are using the mainstream media brainwashing people into accepting satan. they are already starting articles on how pedophilia is &#39;normal&#39;. you can deny the bible all you want, but you can see this stuff happening already so</p>
