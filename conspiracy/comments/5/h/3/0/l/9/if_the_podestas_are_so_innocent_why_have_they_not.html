    <div class="md"><p>To answer your first question, they might not have the desire to. So let&#39;s assume they&#39;re innocent. They&#39;ve been in the public light before and may think it comes with the territory. They also could be in meetings with lawyers and talking about lawsuits, I don&#39;t know. To answer your second question, hiding would mean no one knows where they are. Don&#39;t people know where they are? In regards to your third question, it depends on the individual. Personally speaking, it would depend on what mood I&#39;m in. One day I&#39;d want to bring it to a persons porch. The next day I would probably want to file a gazillion dollar lawsuit against the people responsible for the claims and ruin their life and their kids life.</p>

<p>Actually, it&#39;s a good response considering that the source material was illegally gained, which leads to a &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; scenario. Second, look at the context in which I said &quot;assume&quot; and the point being made. They have been in the public eye before so if they are innocent, addressing it probably wouldn&#39;t be worth their time because, as I have said, they have been in the public and have faced all types of allegations.</p>

<p>See that&#39;s the thing, I am not saying that it doesn&#39;t raise red flags or shouldn&#39;t be investigated. And by investigated I mean by credible people who actually know what the fuck they are doing and talking about, not SWEETDIKTROOPAH or ANONURMOM from 4chan.</p>

It&#39;s like a tip line. People are searching and sharing their findings.  Yes,  crazy, illegitimate shit might come up, and is debunked. But the potential of shared information is powerful. An aware, concerned, connected and questioning public is powerful,  and it forces the truth out in the open.  There is no denying that,  and obviously powerful organizations are trying to prevent it.  That makes it even more suspect. Information is information.  It is power.

<p>The elite are scared? LOL. They had planes slammed into buildings and nothing happened. They flooded the streets with drugs and nothing happened. They have been involved with the pedo shit for years and nothing happened. They wage wars in your name and nothing happens. Who exactly are they afraid of again?

<blockquote>

<p>Presenting facts? Present proof of wrongdoing/a crime. And not only that, I&#39;d say majority of people investigating shit have <strong>never</strong> taken a criminal justice course in their life, so I can&#39;t expect for them to understand how all of this works. Fruit of the poisonous tree? The people don&#39;t get it. Case precedent? The people don&#39;t get it. No charging documents due to case precedent and the type of crime? The people don&#39;t get it. No knowledge of a trier of fact and what that even means? The people don&#39;t get it. What exactly do you want people like me to do? Put my faith in a bunch of neck beards that bathe in Mountain Dew and Cheeto dust? I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t do it. and if I were to show you a picture of my library and what I have on my fireplace, you would know why I&#39;m saying the things I&#39;m saying right now. </p>

<p>And aware and concerned, connected and questioning public is powerful? You are honestly saying that people, who believe the global elite allow the common Joe to decide the leadership of the richest and most advanced country in the globe, by filling in bubbles next to names, are powerful? </p>

<p>Yes, there is denying everything you just said. Look at the division of the people. Hell yesterday, on this very forum, a guy told myself and several other people that if Trump was a pedo and rapist, he would give him a pass as long as he brought others to justice. The day before that, someone here told others and myself that pedos weren&#39;t harming anyone but simply jacking off online. You expect me to put my faith in people like that? </p>

<p>EDITED: I&#39;m not coming at you sideways either man. If it comes off that way that&#39;s not how its intended. This is <strong>REAL SHIT</strong> going on and people are taking it for a joke or not looking at it in a way that will really bring shit to light. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want that shut down. If their ultimate goal is a one world system then mass info gathering and sharing is right up their alley. And you can share all the information you want but what is the end game? It can&#39;t simply be &quot;the people being awake is the end game&quot;. No, you&#39;re asking for puppets to arrest, indict and convict their masters...think about that for a bit. </p>

<p>You aren&#39;t listening to what I&#39;m saying man and this is part of the reason why this pizzagate shit will go nowhere fast and why spinning cycles on this is futile. Look at what you just typed, email leak. Now look at what I said about Fruit of the poisonous tree. It&#39;s a term, derived from the exclusionary rule. Please educate yourself on what I&#39;m telling you man, for me. Just google the term and exclusionary rule and then apply that to any &quot;evidence&quot; that is contained within the emails. </p>

<p>Human nature for some is to seek the truth. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s applicable to all people. And who exactly is &quot;the media&quot;? CNN? Fox? MSNBC? Ok, so you no longer believe what they say and? You still have other media outlets they control, online and offline, that are hidden behind shells. So what difference does it make really? If the people aren&#39;t critical thinkers and parrot information, even though it&#39;s 4% (according to you) then what difference does it make? And ultimately, if the people are not <em>applying</em> what they have learned it makes no difference. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only the initial email doesn&#39;t describe it as a pizza related map, those keywords are only used by the person emailing Podesta. The realtor describes it as a black and white checkered handkerchief because that&#39;s exactly what was left. The map that seems pizza related is talking about handkerchief code and how at swinging parties they all use different colored handkerchiefs to project their sexual preferences, kind of like a &#39;map&#39; to their desires. My parents retired to south florida and every golf cart in their retirement community has handkerchief code. The person who emailed Podesta knew he was into this stuff which is why they used pizza related map instead of black and white handkerchief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would be PROVING to others you were innocent as fast as possible. That&#39;s what people do.  This isn&#39;t a political misinformation leak.  This is extensive crowd sourced investigation.  That is what they are so afraid of. The power of many working together to quickly put things together. If that happens people see thru way to much of the narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Podestas have got a army of mainstream media shills on an all out attack denouncing the entire affair as nothing but a fake and a fraud without elaborating about any of the actual details in question except in the most round-a-bout and completely dismissive ways so there&#39;s no need for them to come forward from behind that gigantic smokescreen being blown in everyone&#39;s face.</p>

<p>A day ago Joe Biggs who was hot on the tail of the PG Scandal got summarily dropped from Infowars with no explanation as Alex Jones suddenly backed completely away from the entire story and the very next day after that on Noory&#39;s news round-up on Coast to Coast where curiously enough there&#39;s been no mention of the story at all up till now, he led straight-off with a personal contact that immediately launched into a rant about the growing  dangers of so-called &quot;fake news&quot; most of which he blamed squarely on the alt-right and then declared that the entire PG scandal as being no doubt the worst example of it that has come light while being nothing but a complete fake and an utter fraud with no evidence of any kind to support it and being directly responsible for the lone gunman attack on Comet Ping Pong. Noory didn&#39;t interrupt his spiel, fully agreed with and thanked him for it at the end of it, and then quickly moved on to other things.</p>

<p>Meanwhile  Breitbart&#39;s fearless Milo Yiannopoulos, the terror of the Left who&#39;d brazenly announced his own no-holds-barred, tell-all presentation on the PG Scandal, suddenly got cold feet and completely failed to deliver on that or explain why he so suddenly couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Another curiosity is that a little over three years ago and just before Glen Beck seemed to go completely off the deep end and slide into oblivion, he announced that he&#39;d come across a whistle-blower with a document he believed would take down the entire power structure in Washington, Republicans and Democrats alike and far beyond in a scandal so big and so unbelievably outrageous that it would split and divide the nation as never before. He too, never delivered on thar and claimed that he&#39;d received threats against his own life and those of his family from sources that were so credible and capable of it that he didn&#39;t dare to breathe another word about it. </p>

<p>The same sort of immanent announcement Andrew Breitbart made just before he turned up dead a little over a year before that to which we can add the Podesta tweet that he presumably made right around that very same time that only just recently surfaced.</p>

<p>Now anyone that would do what we&#39;re talking about and that is as high placed as the Podestas and the kind of circles they travel in would have no compunction about having anyone they think is getting too close to the truth killed before they chanced to stumble upon it, or provide enough details to cause someone else to before they can stop them from going public with it.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the unusual story of two Finnish women reporters and a female council woman being gunned down outside a restaurant in a small Finnish town very near the Russian border a mere four days ago. According to Russian sources the reporters had just been in a Russian village on the other side of that border investigating the story of another Finn that had recently been arrested there on charges of attempting to lure a young teen for the purpose of trafficking him through a ring he admitted was based in Finland that was directly connected with the Clintons where the teens would be groomed and shipped to the US as hospitality workers destined for the elites underground sex trade. An arrangement that the council woman that was killed along with them was connected with. It was believed the reporters were there to confront her with what they knew and to find out what exactly she knew about it. The lone assassin made no attempt to escape but calmly waited in his car until the police arrived and was just as calmly and quietly arrested and taken away... like the Aurora shooter, Lennon&#39;s assassin, and others believed to be mind-controlled assassins that are switched off and abandoned once they&#39;ve accomplished their mission.  </p>

<p>On the Finnish side it&#39;s merely a random killing with no motive, political or otherwise according to Finnish authorities while the other details from the other side of their border with Russia seem to point to what would constitute a pretty logical one if they happen to be true.</p>
