    <div class="md"><p>having put a few of them together the basement storage area look very much like a walk in freezer. Not weird for pizza place. I think using that as evidence is a bit misleading. It doesnt have to be in the basement. Could be outdoors even.</p>

<p>again ive been in this since the beginning, I really hate when people propagate bad evidence based on hearsay. It makes the good evidence hold less weight. Show me that it doesn&#39;t have a walk in freezer on the ground level, or shut the fuck up and stop spreading misinfo because you heard it somewhere.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right about the lack of evidence. To me, it LOOKS like there is nowhere near the space inside the building, and it&#39;s easy to see that it&#39;s not outside. I could be wrong. In fact James himself never claimed even in the instagram that this picture was taken by him in one on his establishment. I&#39;ll give you that. If I was him I would straight out tell you where it is. He won&#39;t. You know why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you realize a freezer has both a floor and a ceiling that are insulated. there is no possible way from the instagram photo to tell where the freezer is located. Ive built these in tiny little kitchens/ outdoors/ in basements. Him having to explain where his freezer is located is a bit odd. Literally every restaurant has one of these. Yes the Kill room comment is weird. but as a resturant owner taking a photo of his new walk-in isnt really that odd either. brand new this freezer was upwards of 10gs.</p>

<p>I want it to be a fucking crazy kill room, their are much better peices of evidence that need explanation tho, continuing to pass around a picture of a walk-in freezer at a restaurant is just setting ourselves up to be debunked on partial info. </p>

&quot;Last year, Alefantis estimates, he bought 12 tons of Toigo tomatoes, which Stello turned into sauce and canned before trucking the jars to the basement at Buck&#39;s Fishing &amp; Camping, Alefantis&#39; other restaurant nearby.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s super, <strong>7 month old Reddit account with 1 post karma</strong>.</p>

<p>Not sure what that has to do with the evidence provided showing it&#39;s <strong>underground</strong> and <strong>in the basement</strong>. Especially as i&#39;ve never claimed it wasn&#39;t a freezer, only that it&#39;s not above ground.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It could well be on the ground floor</p>

<p>Whoops. Apart from where we do and it&#39;s not in kitchen (the size of the kitchen in relation to the restaurant has been thoroughly documented) and the video where he showed people around the restaurant and nothing matched the size of that room above ground physically.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you have evidence to debunk this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading along interestedly for days now, and believing that there seem like a lot of shills trying to deny anything pizzagate...</p>

<p>But today I&#39;m getting annoyed with the pizzagate side instead, because you are sounding shrill and you are not listening (reading) and responding with a cool head.</p>

<p>Please calm down and think hard if you want to continue to pique my interest. Maybe I&#39;m a Good example of a &quot;swing&quot; conspiracy-believer, maybe not.</p>

<p>In the interview you posted, the Alefantis quote about storing tomatoes in the basement could <em>totally</em> be consistent with actual storage in a borrowed basement elsewhere (like Buck&#39;s). It&#39;s not an essential part of the his story for the interview... people cut corners/details that are irrelevant in a context like that... <em>you can&#39;t take a quote like that to prove anything.</em></p>

<p>The now-famous instagram foto is proof of nothing (yet) as well. There is not even a strong case for <em>him</em> (jimmycomet) saying it&#39;s his walk-in freezer, or even his foto.</p>

<p>Plus, if you are going to point out other tidbits (video of a CPP walkthrough?) that support your theories, then yes of course you have to effing <em>link</em> them when you bring them in to your case. P(uh)lease.</p>

<p>Finally, I hope more interesting stuff comes to light... And I do appreciate the work of all the non-MSM researchers out there. I know there&#39;s something fishy going on with all this stuff, but I&#39;m not convinced what exactly, yet. But please watch your tone, even when you think someone debating you is a &quot;shill&quot;. You make everyone look bad if you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Antico Pizza Napoletana[Chosen because from the outside it looks about the same size as Comet]:
1093 Hemphill Avenue NW.
Average number of pizzas sold per day: 600 to 1000 as week progresses
Average amount of sauce used in a week: 100-110 gallons [This adds up to 14 ounces of sauce per pizza, which cuts CP&#39;s pizza output to less than 40 a day.  No Fucking Way.]  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its 14 ounces per 7 pizzas not one pizza.</p>

<p>Average number of pizzas sold <strong>per day</strong>: 600 to 1000 as week progresses<br/>
Average amount of sauce used <strong>in a week</strong>: 100-110 gallons   </p>

<p>So it adds up 2 ounces per pizza * 300 pizzas a day * 365 days in a year = 219 000 ounces = 1710 gallons. ( US liquid ounce =  1⁄128 of a US liquid gallon) </p>

<p>1710 gallons * 15 pounds (of tomatoes per gallon) = 25650 pounds  = <strong>12,8 US tons</strong>  </p>

<p>So it turns out that 12,8 US tons of tomatoes yearly for pizzeria that sells 300 pizzas a day might be normal consumption.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to lie, probably best to make sure both linked archives don&#39;t have his direct, specific mentions of &quot;basement&quot; <strong>highlighted</strong> and opening the link takes you <strong>directly</strong> to those highlights.</p>

<p>Especially if you&#39;re a year old Reddit account with 1 post karma.</p>
