       Not to my knowledge. There are so many differing conspiracy videos up, I'm sure there must have been some take downs for various reasons (copyright, etc etc) but this is sweeping.

       Lol, you honestly believe that? Dude, the guy has an IMDB page, and his dad is involved in providing a service and protection to children, he is connected to the Haiti link. The shooting was a false flag staged to make our investigation look wacky.

       Lol, you honestly believe that? I'm pretty sure they don't have to stage something as crazy as this to make "your investigation" look wacky. All this "false flag" does is draw more attention to it, and if what you guys claim is true, I'm sure they wouldn't want to bring national attention to it, but rather keep it confined to conspiracy websites.

       Which is exactly what this will do. It'll draw attention to how "wild, crazy, and insane" the people who believe pizzagate exists, thus making the masses who want to be respected by society either stop talking about it, or stop thinking about it.

       So some "dumbass" from VA was able to have the traffic cams that would have filmed the event relocated 22 hours before?

       And just happens to be an actor on IMDB, just like the Orlando shooter was?

       And goes after a few suspects in a pizza place full of kids with an assault rifle, rather than an easily concealable handgun?   The presence of the rifle alone just

       Traffic cameras turn all the time. And you really think the Clintons gained so much power by making rookie mistakes like hiring an actor with an IMDB page? If they were to do something like this, they would just get a petty criminal that they could easily discredit, assuming that the person who was hired didn't tell the police or anyone that they were hired (which is unlikely).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the fact he had a rifle just screams the guy was a dumbass. I agree, if this guy had any intelligence, he would have had a concealable handgun.

       Tell them to make torrents of all of their videos; upload said torrent files to The Pirate Bay, and then let everyone who is interested download them.  You'll be kept up to date with their stuff, and the fact that there will be multiple redundant copies of it will make it that much harder to get rid of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember; decentralisation is strength, and centralisation is weakness.  Centralisation allows a single point of failure, which is the entire reason why they wanted to train you to start using centralised Web sites instead of the old decentralised protocols in the first place.  If any of you are on ISPs that still allow access to it, use Usenet; and find IRC servers as well.  You might have to learn a little bit more than usual in order to use the client software, but it is not hard.

       A hash is computed from each piece of video to quickly identify copyright infringements.  The repost would be automatically identified immediately.
