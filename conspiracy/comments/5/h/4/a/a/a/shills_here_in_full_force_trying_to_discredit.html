    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed the subreddit doing a quick 180 in the last few days on whether Pizzagate is real or not. Most people seemed in favor of it a week ago, or at the very least were completely fine with people to keep digging for evidence. All of a sudden, the pro-Pizzagate threads that reach the top page all have highly upvoted comments that are all completely denying Pizzagate. There&#39;s been a massive increase in ad hominem attacks and people constantly using the terms &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;debunked&quot; as if they carry any sort of weight. There&#39;s a lot of people commenting on accounts with almost no activity for months, then suddenly posting in threads about Pizzagate, vehemently denouncing the theory.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gy2ih/strong_evidence_of_shilling_occurring_over_at/">CTR is almost definitely here.</a></p>

<p>Edit: I even got <a href="http://i.imgur.com/t4vGYDv.png">attacked via private message</a> yesterday for defending Pizzagate on this subreddit.</p>
</div>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-2" data-depth="2" data-id="daxj8oo">

    <div class="md"><p>Pre-election, the discussion on pizzagate seemed far more constructive than it has recently; the discussions were rooted in mutual support and logical reasoning (for the most part.)  As soon as the election was over and pizzagate hit the msm, it was like someone flipped a switch. </p>

<p>Suddenly the &quot;real truth researchers&quot; are accusing pizzagate of being a psyop, and are mocking those who &quot;cant see past the misdirection.&quot;</p>

<p>If its a psyop, it stands as the greatest of all time, since these &quot;fake&quot; pedo rings have spanned global news for decades, and not to mention the &quot;faked&quot; social and financial connections of numerous elites from every continent to human traffickers and convicted child molesters over the last several years. </p>

<p>They even convinced former child actors to falsely speak out about it... Comparatively, orchestrating 9/11 must have been a walk in the park for tptb.</p>

<p>I equate this entire reaction to pizzagate to video game theory: if you continue to encounter increasing levels of resistance, you&#39;re heading in the right direction.</p>

Either our government intentionally released this to wikileaks and instigated this manhunt online... OR
This is really becoming a possibility and no one wants to believe it. This story wouldn&#39;t have blown up and would&#39;ve faded away if MSM hadn&#39;t had tried to shut it down so hard with the faked news narrative. That alone should raise eyebrows.
-And now all kinds of powerful entities are fighting to have anything that is deemed &quot;incorrect&quot; be removed from the internet.
Well if you can&#39;t see that this is blatant censorship and a dangerous power grab on the free flow of information from the elite, than you&#39;ve got your head so far up your ass that you probably won&#39;t ever be able to pull it out.

<p>Inconsiderate is the polar opposite to the Pizzagate community, we are trying to save potential children&#39;s lives here. You, on the other hand, are willing to turn a blind eye. Tell me who&#39;s inconsiderate again?</p>

<p>Seeing people react exactly the way you are is exactly why I wouldn&#39;t rule out a false flag either. Assuming it actually was a false flag, then it definitely has had it&#39;s intended effects.</p>

<p>One idiot who is an actor who&#39;s been in (albeit shitty) movies, who didn&#39;t even shoot anybody. If the guy was a &quot;real&quot; shooter, he would have been shot before he was arrested because he was waving around a gun. This has a similar vibe to the provocateur that want to DAPL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole event felt pretty staged to me.  Seemed really suspicious that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The traffic camera pointing at the shop was relocated 24 hours prior to the incident</p></li>
<li><p>The traffic camera was moved back 24 hours after the incident</p></li>
<li><p>the guy is an actor </p></li>
<li><p>His dad works for the feds</p></li>
<li><p>The original reports of the incident SPECIFICALLY say it wasn&#39;t linked to pizzagate: <a href="https://archive.is/XU13M">https://archive.is/XU13M</a>  </p></li>
<li><p>lots of inconsistencies in the witness reports</p></li>
<li><p>inconsistencies in whether or not a shot was fired - <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1461897">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1461897</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not to mention, and probably most importantly, is that the event gives the media a perfect reason to run stories about it dismissing it, without addressing a single concern about why people think it might be real.  They get to do this under the guise of &quot;fake news&quot;, which oddly, they started focusing on heavily once wikileaks started having an impact.  Shocking right? The media didn&#39;t seem to give two shits about reporting fake news when theyve been doing it for decades but now it&#39;s a concern?</p>

<p>Of course, if you believe it&#39;s just a theory about clinton and podesta banging kids in the back of a pizza parlor, then yes, it&#39;s a crazy theory.  If you view it for what it really is, and that&#39;s suspicion that there is a globally connected pedophile ring, protected, controlled, and allowed by some of the most powerful people in the world... well, there&#39;s a ton of actual evidence and research done by real investigators and law enforcement that shows it.  </p>

<p>Thats because you haven&#39;t even done the basic research, you don&#39;t have a rudimentary understanding of the basics of pizzagate. The artwork on the wall is suspicious, but nobody who investigates pizzagate ever cites the artwork as some damning, smoking gun. </p>

<p>What exactly did you not find convincing about all of the other evidence? Could you provide any alternative explainations to any of our findings? I&#39;m sorry you re unable to see what the rest of us are here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;ve been reading this sub on the subject, and that&#39;s all the actual physical evidence I&#39;ve seen on here, and you&#39;re part of that problem. </p>

<p>Literally the only things people have shown me on here as proof or articles have linked to, is artwork. And an instagram post where a little girl has boxing tape on her wrists, which is kind of a dark joke, but the tape is obviously loose and not on there to hurt her. And if you were hurting children secretly, why would you post pictures of it for people to become suspicious of that activity? None of it adds up. </p>

<p>If you have some evidence for your claim, provide it to me. So I can read it and learn. I don&#39;t want to believe this happened, but I&#39;m also open to believe it happened provided some pittance of actual concrete evidence. That&#39;s not floating around here, though. Most believers just want to argue with me for not believing. I&#39;ve been called a shill for being a true skeptic and believing in the scientific method, and I&#39;m fucking sick of it. It&#39;s McCarthyism in here. People care about picking sides more than discussing the details and trying to find the goddamn truth. </p>

That would be true.   </p>

<p>Same with Amanda Kleinman, Tony Podesta etc.   These people are obsessed with pedophilia, child abuse, dead children.   If you concede that point, then go on to claim &quot;there&#39;s no hard evidence&quot; you will get less shill accusations.   People who claim &quot;there&#39;s no evidence at all!&quot; are either shills, pedos or haven&#39;t done their research.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering the fact that these are some of the world&#39;s most prominent figures implicated in a pedophilia scandal, I don&#39;t think we should have to provide you some sort of damning critical piece of evidence or smoking gun, just to justify continuing our investigation. We are allowed and obligated to do this, theres nothing wrong with an independent investigation, I don&#39;t understand why anybody would be so vehemently against one, ESPECIALLY somebody who lurks on a conspiracy forum, ya know? </p>

<p>Should the police have stopped investigating serial killer John Wayne Gacy becuase they didn&#39;t have any concrete damning evidence on him in the early stages of their investigation? No, but thats essentially what you&#39;re advocating. It would be stupid to promote that same mentality in regard to pizzagate. Just because you were unable to look at the evidence and see the picture start to form in your head of how this could all be possible, doesn&#39;t mean we should stop and doesn&#39;t mean you HAVE to criticize and badger us.  Why do you guys even bother, whats the motive here?</p>

<p>You weren&#39;t able to make the connections, but, millions of others did. I think you need to consider the fact that we may be onto something and that there is no way all these millions of people are just somehow &quot;bat shit nuts&quot;...</p>

This is really becoming a possibility and no one wants to believe it. This story wouldn&#39;t have blown up and would&#39;ve faded away if MSM hadn&#39;t had tried to shut it down so hard with the faked news narrative. That alone should raise eyebrows.
-And now all kinds of powerful entities are fighting to have anything that is deemed &quot;incorrect&quot; be removed from the internet.
Well if you can&#39;t see that this is blatant censorship and a dangerous power grab on the free flow of information from the elite, than you&#39;ve got your head so far up your ass that you probably won&#39;t ever be able to pull it out.

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen any crazy all caps confirmed smoking guns you&#39;re talking about. You must have been on the Donald before the election. Many people look at it, see 4channers and trumpets and completely disregard anything that they see after. Don&#39;t worry about click bait titles, they&#39;re just for visibility and they&#39;re not hurting anyone as long as they&#39;re not over abundant, which they&#39;re not. There is still plenty of decent discussion. </p>

<p>Just look at the facts, the connections, the relationships, the money. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say everyone should 100% throw their hearts into believing it&#39;s real. I just want everyone to see the real coincidental evidence implicating many government officials without any bullshit turning them away from facts. </p>

<p>There is more to this investigation than any other conspiracy. It is undeniably being silenced by CTR. Shouldn&#39;t that at least tell you that, while maybe not all of he claims made by investigators are true, the accused government officials are hiding something and actively covering it up? </p>

<p>It is very important to be skeptical. However, I think it&#39;s important to not dismiss one of the most popular and largest conspiracy theories in history just because it is not based on hardcore proof. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I appreciate that. Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m going insane for trying to get people to just be open to new information. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I don&#39;t think any media article represents the whole story. <a href="http://www.voat.co/pizzagate">Voat</a> is where the conversation is taking place. Look there. Spend time going through top posts and reading. It can get complicated, but I think it&#39;s important to fully understand every major connection. </p>

<p>Sorry I&#39;m on mobile so I don&#39;t have these links or even some names, but if you really want them, I could find them later this evening. </p>

<p>Some info to get you started: 
the podesta brothers stayed at their convicted pedophile friend&#39;s vacation home in Portugal less than a mile from where Madeline McCann was taken, on the night she was taken. And the brothers look similar to he photos of the suspects. Honestly I wouldn&#39;t think that the brothers would do any dirty work themselves, but it&#39;s pretty strange how perfectly that lines up. 
The street cameras outside comet ping pong were turned around to face a pole the day before the incident with the gunman, and turned back the day after. 
James Alefantis has referred to a basement at cpp in interviews in past years. And public record shows it as two stories. Yet in a recent interview discussing the scandal, he claimed cpp doesn&#39;t have a basement. 
The entire street block that cpp is on was a gift from an influential and rich Saudi man to a man with ties to the Clintons. Almost every business on that block also has FBI recognized pedophilia symbols as their logos. I&#39;m not as familiar with the Saudi man, so I apologize if it is less damning. 
Someone found 30 wifi signals coming from under a concrete pad in hawaii on a property with ties to the Clinton foundation. </p>

<p>And lastly, I know that these things are not hardcore evidence. However, they are highly unusual and deserve an explanation. We are demanding an explanation. We are being told to shut up and fall in line or else. The media&#39;s reaction to this and <em>Hillary Clinton</em> personally addressing the scandal as &quot;fake news&quot;, a term that has suddenly come to light just as pizzagate gained traction, is the most damning thing to address imo. They are actively covering it up. CTR, the ceo of which is ex boyfriends with Alefantis, is still a recognizable presence on Reddit and they have been working overtime trying to push pizzagate out of the public eye. They would not be pushing so hard against it if they didn&#39;t have something to hide, something to lose. Labeling it as crazy and unfounded is exactly their goal. And I hope that more reasonable voices will step up and bring attention to the load of bullshit we&#39;ve been fed because this is it. All or nothing. If they suppress this,they&#39;ll make sure it won&#39;t happen again. They know how close we are to exposure. They&#39;re scared and frantically covering it up and influencing public opinion, by the day. It&#39;s our job to fight back and remind everyone to be open minded and free thinking. </p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://archive.is/gDYMv">http://archive.is/gDYMv</a> This is a vigilant citizen article that apparently has since been removed. But it is one of the most hard hitting articles, so there ya go. This is the most censored topic in a very long time, and there is clearly a reason for that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. And I think that the fact he has been laying low suggests he is hiding something. Everything these people do suggests that they&#39;re hiding something. I mean why would the Pope all of a sudden declare &quot;fake news&quot; a sin? Why would Hillary Clinton personally address it? Podesta has several convicted pedophile friends <em>that we know of.</em> I think something big is coming, though. Our government hasn&#39;t been this unstable in more than a few decades. If they try to deny Trump the presidency, I do not think the American people who voted for him will stand by quietly.</p>

<ul>
<li>people attack you for criticizing the pizzagate evidence.  This sub has always been about critical thought, and opposing views have always been supported and debated.  Just look at 9/11 discussions.  People support and oppose both sides of that in a civil way.</li>
<li>unlike other conspiracies, pizzagate is a partisan issue, probably driven by right wing media organizations similar to CTR and bolstered by useful idiots on pol and the_donald.  This is a conspiracy in itself</li>
<li> <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is flooded with pizzagate stories and the atmosphere is toxic.  No one is telling you to stop investigating.  They are telling you to look at the evidence critically and to not attack people with alternate views.</li>
<li>you almost aren&#39;t allowed to criticize pizzagate at this point.  Its almost like being labeled an anti-semite.  And you know what they say about things you aren&#39;t allowed to talk about.</li>
</ul>

<p>To summarize, its my right and my responsibility to critically look at an issue and decide its truth value and make comments on it how I please.  When people tell me to shutup and scream in all caps with exclamation points that my opinion is not valid then something if fishy as fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets default to science... pizzagate has made a claim, for whatever reason, call them crazy .... pizzagate is now compiling evidence for said claim... scientist and even paid investigators dont stop if their claim isnt instantly proven... they reanalyze and readjust and continue... I wouldnt expexct the MSM or the police in this situation to really dig, as the claim is the people of the system itself (maybe a small minority) is perpetuating this afforementioned claim. Conspiracy is the 2 people conspiring... its more to label those being investigated not those who are investigating.</p>

<p>Holy christ. First of all having 1 acting credit 6 years ago is far from being a professional actor. I have friends with IMDB credits who work in call centers. It&#39;s easy to get extra work, it doesn&#39;t make you a professional actor just because you are on IMDB. </p>

<p>But even if he was, it doesn&#39;t mean he was a hired actor to do this. Do you think carpenters are always building things? No. Nor are actors always acting. Was Phillip Seymore Hoffman acting when he OD&#39;d? Or did he actually die?  Just because you are an actor doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t do things outside the realm of acting. </p>

<p>Furthermore this claim that this no name was hired by the US Government to pretend to come into a building to aim an AK to protect their secretive satanistic child porn ring that they&#39;ve successfully hidden for decades, but couldn&#39;t be bothered to remove an IMDB page is ridiculous. Which is it? Is the government secretive and able to remain hidden from public eye or are they incompetent? </p>

<p>Again these are serious allegation that require serious evidence. Paperwork or documents or emails showing this guy was hired or linked in anyway to a conspiracy is required. Not an IMDB page and a resume for his father. </p>

<p>K. Still not getting how that equals hired actor by the Clinton administration to create a false flag. </p>

<p>You are looking for evidence for something you already believe in and trying to fill in the gaps. It&#39;s not logic. It&#39;s not scientific. It&#39;s fuel for a preconceived notion. </p>

<p>No. I would say that in order for them to be considered that they&#39;re more than coincidences you need to provide evidence that there is some nefarious plan headed by the government. The claim is being made by the pizzagate crowd the burden of proof is on that side. I am open to having my mind changed but it needs to be with actual evidence. Not spooky conjecture.</p>

<p>The Orlando shooter&#39;s father was at a Clinton rally. I haven&#39;t seen any evidence that he &quot;worked closely with HRC&quot;. He owns a nonprofit, said some extremist stuff on his Youtube page and showed up in the crowd at a rally. None of that proves to me he worked closely with the Clinton administration.   </p>

<p>None of this is even slightly proof that he was an actor or hired to perform this way. I never claimed a coincidence or even that it wasn&#39;t happening I simply asked for evidence that he was a plant or an actor. Throwing out other facts  as a smokescreen to my question is a logical fallacy and proves nothing.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a piece of evidence that can be taken by any  person to prove that the shooter was a hired actor by the HRC campaign.  An assertion was made with no evidence and you came up the cameras being pointed in a different direction which isn&#39;t evidence that he is a plant let alone for a grand conspiracy.  </p>

<p>Could there still be one? Absolutely.  In fact it&#39;s not something that is unheard of especially when it comes to pedophilia as those people tend to group together and cover each other up. But that&#39;s really thin evidence. It also isn&#39;t evidence that the conspiracy doesn&#39;t exsist even if this guy is just a loose cannon. Both things could be true. But you really need to get your shit together if you are going to throw around allegations that the US Government is involved in a secret pedophilia ring. </p>

<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. And none of that is in display here. Just circumstantial evidence about domes and spooky language. Which is all well and fine until innocent people&#39;s lives are threatened and it&#39;s not cool to downplay that to keep your little internet game going.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m simply saying it&#39;s not outside the realm of possibility that an irrational person could act irrationally. This isn&#39;t proof of anything. Someone who is truely looking to investigate doesn&#39;t go barging in with a rifle I agree with that. It just means he didn&#39;t have his mind right, it doesn&#39;t equal grand conspiracy. Occam&#39;s razor applies here. </p>

<p>It&#39;s much more likely he has mental health problems than he is a hired actor to create a false flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do they only investigate murders when they find a finger-printed gun on the scene? No, you start with scraps of circumstanial evidence, follow leads, and you slowly put the pieces together. </p>

<p>We <em>know</em> child trafficking is happening, and most seem to think it&#39;s getting worse. Unless these nay-sayers can come up with better evidence than Pizzagate regarding a massive pedo ring, this is <em>the best lead we have</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s funny that they are using legal standard for proving a case at trial, rather than a legal standard for investigating, like probable cause or reasonable suspicion. Even then, those standards exist to protect people&#39;s reasonable expectation of privacy from <em>the government</em> and doesn&#39;t apply to citizens, and it also doesn&#39;t apply to public information, which all of pizzagate has centered around. You do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in pictures shared on public social media (at least not in any jurisdiction I&#39;m familiar with). Furthermore, political and public figures have a diminished expectation of privacy.</p>

<p>TL;DR they&#39;re using legal jargon, but they&#39;re not even using it right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do know that one ex-employee of CPP (allegedly) went on Godlike Productions to do an AMA, and he left a ton of hints. That thread has been deleted.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a big hint that something is going on. Also, if someone does give an affadavit, the investigators can just file it away in the garbage if the trafficking ring has thoroughly gotten into the judicial system. So  to answer the question &quot;Where are the victims?&quot; is tough to do unless you have access to the actual investigation. </p>

<p>And another thing - even judges will dismiss cases on all kinds of logical fallacies about the victims &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell someone, etc&quot;. When someone does come forward, the system is stacked against them. In Canada, for example, 4 judges are being investigated for shitty application of outdated assumptions:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-judges-sex-assault-trials-myths-1.3765959">http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-judges-sex-assault-trials-myths-1.3765959</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The first issue is the use of discredited sexist myths and stereotypes in evaluating the credibility of a sexual assault complainant,&quot; Penney told CBC News.</p>

<p>&quot;And the second issue is the judges&#39; blatant misunderstanding of the law.&quot;</p>

<p>Penney said he doesn&#39;t believe these issues are &quot;pervasive or rampant within the judiciary, but at the same time, it&#39;s clear that they exist to some extent.&quot;</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t more people investigating from the ground up? If you know that these children&#39;s kidnappings aren&#39;t being investigated properly, why don&#39;t some people start from that side? </p>

<p>Police are very good at building a case to &#39;fit a story&#39;. Aka, jealous boyfriend murders his girlfriend when she says she&#39;s leaving, angel of death in the NICU, or old folk&#39;s homes, etc. </p>

<p>Pizzagate feels a little more like you guys are building a story with your sights set on someone than going on the actual evidence from those missing children cases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way we are coming at it, is that many of us believe that people are put in positions of power after they have been compromised for leverage by certain shady government agents or agencies.  Perhaps the military child porn Anderson Copper unveiled at the Pentagon and was suddenly silent about indict that is true also.  Other validations include the Franklin cover up,  The Penn state cover up.  It is often the most vulnerable at risk. It is often victims; people do not want to risk talking about it.  Conspiracy of Silence is a good documentary and so is Spotlight.  Victims usually do not want to speak out.  Bad things happen to them and the people who expose them.  The safety in numbers and crowd sourced investigation,  like a giant tip line, is unprecedented and valid, vital and frightening to the untrusted mainstream media that wants to push a corporate agenda. The levels of control are very small on top,  and they want all chances of exposure to stay that way.  I have to go to work now. Hope that helps.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, the CTR on this sub are demanding a smoking gun..</p>

<p>Chill out skeptics and CTR, do you not know how an investigation is conducted? Like HD3D said, you don&#39;t always start with an incredibly damning piece of evidence like a fucking gun with finger prints on it. And you don&#39;t give up because the person has crafted a trustworthy image for themselves either (as Alefantis has). </p>

<p>John Wayne Gacy was a famous serial killer, but he was also heavily involved in democratic party politics, a well trusted and respected member of his community, and he even performed at birthday parties as a harmless, funny clown.  Should the police havce not investigated him because of his public image or the unlikelyness that he could have commited those murders?  Fuck no, they kept investigating, and it all started with small connections and links just like pizzagate until they eventually found the smoking gun, which was the odor of bodies in his house upon approval of a search warrant.</p>

<p>You skeptics think that because this investigation isn&#39;t being conducted or taken seriously by real law enforcement, that it isn&#39;t  &quot;real&quot; investigation. If the police and FBI did their jobs we wouldn&#39;t have to be picking up the slack by investigating independently, and we&#39;ve been doing a fucking damn good job, some of you guys are fucking brilliant and so courageous. Keep it up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of conflating, I didn&#39;t say a word about Comet. </p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence is used to begin and progress law enforcement investigations all the time. Different pieces of circumstantial evidence can be used in conjunction, built onto one another, to create more solid leads. And, when a judge infers a more concrete fact based on a pile of corroborating circumstantial evidence, he/she can convict and have convicted on such circumstantial inferences. All forensic evidence is, for the most part, circumstantial evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think Comet is the focal point of the investigation, I&#39;d advise reading more about it before posting an opinion. Theorizing, especially on a conspiracy subreddit is fine, but opining on something without knowing the basics is irresponsible.</p>

<p>Libel is written defamation. It&#39;s not a word that courts substitute for defamation, because words have meaning. Rather than &quot;playing semantics,&quot; there are subtle nuances in legal definitions that matter and that you seem to be uncomfortable with.</p>

<p>No one is talking about conviction, yet you tediously bring it up to the point that I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;re deliberately missing my point. Of course, the rule is &quot;innocent until proven guilty.&quot; That&#39;s a determination for a judge and jury to make, not investigators. And, again, cases are won or lost on circumstantial (read &quot;forensic&quot;) evidence all the time. </p>

<p>What&#39;s needed for an investigation to begin or move forward is not necessarily direct evidence of a crime. What&#39;s ultimately needed in that absence of direct evidence is a witness&#39;/victim&#39;s testimony. Do you think all testimony is ineligible for beginning an investigation?</p>

<p>And before you put words in my mouth, I&#39;m not talking about pizzagate specifically, as I&#39;m aware there are no witnesses or victims to point to. I&#39;m talking about the law in general.</p>

If I was asking them anything I <strong>would</strong> ask them not to give slaps on the wrist to close-friends of the elites, like Jeffrey Epstein.

<p>Looking at previous cases and also taking into consideration things like the CP &quot;twittergate&quot; uncovering etc. I can say that I and others don&#39;t have much faith in law enforcement to help with an investigation. Others might think law enforcement will act if the public finds enough evidence, I&#39;m not nearly as optimistic. Someone can literally come forward as a child sex victim, cite cameras being in the home like in the Epstein cases, and the law enforcement will still seek a hush-hush plea deal because the perpetrator is rich and famous. Its happened before. Hell, it even just happened with Denny Hastert.</p>

<p>Photos or video of committing a crime still shows a crime happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but there would still need to be a picture or video <em>of an actual victim/s</em> or of the actual crime being commited. There still needs to be evidence that a victim actually exists, not just imagined innuendo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does not matter if the victim can be found or not, or if it is a victimless crime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said that a victim needs to be found (as in physically found), just that they need to <em>exist</em>. Additionally, this isn&#39;t a victimless crime. This a crime that involves victims in which none have discovered in any way, shape, or form. I&#39;m not arguing that victimless crimes are not real crimes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The act and intent of a crime is chargeable. Standalone evidence can exist that proves beyond a doubt that mens rea and/or actus reus was demonstarted. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get what you&#39;re saying, but you&#39;re just being pedantic/nitpicking. Without a victim, witnesses, or evidence that a victim actually exists, you&#39;d be hard pressed to prove murder/rape beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>Where? Where is the link between these &quot;real victims&quot; and Podesta &amp; co.?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just because no one can hear the child scream from a pedophile does not mean that the crime never existed. That&#39;s not how it works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it doesn&#39;t mean a crime does exist either. If the crime you&#39;re accusing them of was committed, then a victim <em>has</em> to exist. By definition. We&#39;re asking for evidence, <em>any</em> evidence, that links them to an actual real life victim. Not one that exists purely in the imagination of &quot;pizzagate&quot; peddlers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A crime committed always leaves some form of evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right. That&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re asking for here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lack of a suspect/victim diminishes the success of finding justice but that absolutely does not mean a crime did not happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this doesn&#39;t mean it did happen either. Do you even logic? Where&#39;s the evidence of the crime? Where&#39;s the blood? The victims? Their families? <em>Anything</em> that ties them to an actual crime? And, no, police sketches are not reliable (accurate or effective) evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the discovery of truth and there are those who will hide that truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who&#39;s hiding the truth? We&#39;re all asking for the same thing: some kind of <strong>evidence</strong> linking them to an actual crime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you&#39;re arguing on the wrong side here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t about sides. This is about how a proper investigation is conducted.</p>

<p>If you have any evidence linking Podesta &amp; co. to actual victims, then please post it. We beg you. Because, as it stands, the only one &quot;hiding&quot; evidence here are the proponents of &quot;pizzagate&quot;. Unless you can counter with something substantive, I&#39;m checking out of this conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to disagree with the OP&#39;s premise, because it is a fair point. You guys should be looking for the clues and, in the event you find hard evidence, hopefully law enforcement gets involved.</p>

<p>The reason we &quot;shills&quot; are here is that many the people interested in pg have already made their minds up and are making posts, all over the internet, that can ruin the lives of the people you claim to be investigating.  This is one of the things that law enforcement is supposedly trained to do during an investigation, and even they, as professionals, screw that up a lot. </p>

<p>So I would never tell you to not perform your investigation, but I would tell you that you should consider the way in which you perform it.</p>

<p>Smells a lot to me like this whole pizza gate drama has been set up to spiral us into eternal disinformation, no need to infiltrate the moderation of the sub just get a few accounts to post opposing views about who&#39;s shilling who and viola we are no longer calling out the &#39;nwo&#39; but our own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean if more info is uncovered I am all for the truth but as a now there is nothing. No clues, no evidence, nothing. There is direct evidence of 911 being a conspiracy or countless assassinations. I could come to you and literally lay out the evidence in front of you. I believe in an honest court you could convict many people based on the evidence this sub has uncovered and propagated. If you want to investigate pizza gate more power to you. However do not assume that there is some evil cabal or pizza making children rapers. Showing up harassing and or threatening people in regards to this &#39;investigation&#39; is insane and way over the line. If you are in the mood to harass criminals show up to the pentagon not a pizza place. There is evidence to lock people there away for life. Not so much for pizza shops. Again, if new shit comes to light all bets are off but people need to chill on this pizza gate bullshit. </p>

<p>Found this interesting video, and it&#39;s unbiased. He explains how pizzagate is the main focus of MSM when there are tens of thousands of emails containing all sort of illegal activity. Not discrediting the severity of pg but there is a MUCH larger picture, and we need to broaden our view on the situation. Let&#39;s not give them the satisfaction of thinking they&#39;ve distracted us with this isolated case. There is much to unfold, and I believe legal justice will be served to these monsters. May the truth be revealed, and the souls of the victims be blessed in love and light. My heart goes out to these children. </p>

Of course, he didn&#39;t and that guy was wrong. The Pi pizza place flew in and it was heavily documented in the press at the time. </p>

<p>Owner Chris Sommers and partner Ryan Mangiarlardo plan to make 10 deep dish and 10 thin crust pizzas for the Obamas on Friday, said Cory Watkins, a kitchen manager for the restaurant, which opened a year ago.</p>

<p>“Pi’s very pro-Obama,” Watkins said. “Chris had Obama staffers stay at his house. And after the election we served a Broccoli Obama pizza.”</p>

<p>Sommers&#39; restaurant has garnered some attention from other celebrities as well. He said he was busy Wednesday delivering pizzas to actor George Clooney and the cast and crew of &quot;Up in the Air,&quot; which are still filming in St. Louis.</p>

<p>He was also preparing for his trip to Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s been a little surreal,&quot; he said of the presidential invite and media coverage.</p>

<p>Sommers met Obama in 2007 at a fundraiser in St. Louis, where he also met basketball star Reggie Love, who became one of Obama&#39;s aides. When Obama held a rally under the Gateway Arch last fall, Sommers asked Love if Obama wanted to try Pi pizza. Apparently, the president has been talking about it ever since.</p>

<p>Sommers is planning a pie especially for Obama: the Hyde Park, with some presidential favorites, chicken and hot sauce.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2009/04/06/daily40.html">http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2009/04/06/daily40.html</a></p>

<p>Just google for more, there&#39;s like 20 articles about it. Chicago was pissed off he preferred St Louis pie.</p>

<p>But of course, will you accept that and at LEAST remove the silly 65k pizza and hot dogs LIE? Of course not. You&#39;ll keep parroting it. Because clearly the media planted all these articles in 2009 just to THROW YOU OFF THE SCENT!</p>

We know children are being abducted and we know the system is corrupt. Flat out denying that connections are being made in relevant ways just seems unrealistic.

<p>Trump, or his handlers, created this Pizza conspiracy to distract us from the truth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump is proposing limitations on the First Amendment. He plans to curtail Free Speech. Especially Free Speech that exposes him for what he is.</p>

<p>He has already suggested changing the First Amendment, Libel Laws, and has threatened to jail journalists while, at the same time, enforcing de facto censorship by denying journalists access.</p>

<p>I will call this as I see it.</p>

<p>This post, and others like it, is an attempt to keep us preoccupied. To keep us from looking closer at the Trump government and understanding the damage they are prepared to do.</p>

<p>You think this has no connection? Trump wants very badly for any distraction. If he can silence the First Amendment and all dissent, this will all go away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been through quite a few more elections than yourself. That does not imply intelligence, by far. Many people coast through elections and simply vote for the party from top to bottom of the ballot.</p>

<p>I will try to explain this as simply as I can. Not because I doubt your intellect. I am obviously not communicating my thoughts adequately.</p>

<p>Trump came to power with the whirlwind of Pizzagate. He may not have started it. Or even been aware of it. But it helped him.</p>

<p>Now that he is headed to the Oval Office, his people are aware of it. And continue to push it as a way to persecute media in general and enemies in the media and on the web. Since the Fake News Movement is underway, they see an opportunity to fan the flames. Ultimately they can use this to silence dissent among the opposition.</p>

<p>It may have been a False Flag type of story planted by . . . anyone. But now it is a tool to oppress opposition. And can lead toward censorship and limitations of our First Amendment rights.</p>

<p>It is the perfect vehicle. If America gets angry enough over &#39;Fake News&#39; there will be demands to reign it in. And in that process, it will be very tempting to reign in enemies in the media and on the internet.</p>

<p>I hope that clarifies my view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, you are being obtuse or just cannot understand.</p>

<p>I suspect you are a younger person than me. One day you will grow older and the truth will smack you in the head. Then you might get it.</p>

<p>Get away from your &#39;safe&#39; media and read the damn WikiLeaks. It is filled with answers you claim to seek. Get away from CNN and do your own research. Educate yourself.</p>

<p>I do admire your seemingly relentless efforts, in some small way. But your efforts are weak so far.</p>

<p>I am not at all convinced you are sincere.</p>

<p>A large part of me wonders if you are the paid opposition I have heard so much about on this sub. That would make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>But if you ARE paid, they are certainly not getting their money&#39;s worth.</p>

<p>If you really are sincere, then read up on all the valuable information I have shared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Claims need some kind of evidence. Where is the evidence on pizza gate? Like to file a missing person claim, the evidence you need is there has to be a person you know who is usually in one place, and now they&#39;re missing. What is the claim against Comet? What missing person was seen there? I really don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need a conclusion, but you need more than a hunch. Otherwise you&#39;re asking law enforcement to harass an innocent person. We&#39;re already defaming them.</p>

Those along with the fact that these rings do exist. Look at Penn State, they had stronger evidence and witnesses and it took 20 years to get 1 conviction because of a powerful football coach. 
Now imagine the power players that there are in DC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way we are coming at it, is that many of us believe that people are put in positions of power after they have been compromised for leverage by certain shady government agents or agencies.  Perhaps the military child porn Anderson Copper unveiled at the Pentagon and was suddenly silent about indict that is true also.  Other validations include the Franklin cover up,  The Penn state cover up.  It is often the most vulnerable at risk. It is often victims; people do not want to risk talking about it.  Conspiracy of Silence is a good documentary and so is Spotlight.  Victims usually do not want to speak out.  Bad things happen to them and the people who expose them.  The safety in numbers and crowd sourced investigation,  like a giant tip line, is unprecedented and valid, vital and frightening to the untrusted mainstream media that wants to push a corporate agenda. The levels of control are very small on top,  and they want all chances of exposure to stay that way.  I have to go to work now. Hope that helps. Excuse any typos or errors,  I&#39;m in a hurry.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. And I think that the fact he has been laying low suggests he is hiding something. Everything these people do suggests that they&#39;re hiding something. I mean why would the Pope all of a sudden declare &quot;fake news&quot; a sin? Why would Hillary Clinton personally address it? Podesta has several convicted pedophile friends <em>that we know of.</em> I think something big is coming, though. Our government hasn&#39;t been this unstable in more than a few decades. If they try to deny Trump the presidency, I do not think the American people who voted for him will stand by quietly.</p>
