       Some of it stems from the fact that websites and search engines are not the same for everyone, geographically and device-specific more than anything, but also because people dig themselves into filter bubbles. The default Google setting for logged out users is (or was) personalized search, which is a filter bubble. What I'm saying is, between lazy and agenda comes ignorance.

       Yup I just checked acouple myself and the oldest I found was about 3 months ago. Granted I only checked a few subreddits and only the top 10 but  still even so in the past I've filtered by top all before and found threads from many years ago.

       Ya unfortunately I can't prove it either but I have viewers top all on many subreddits over years and I've never seen only recent threads. Then again I literally just spent a minute or so looking so I can't say definitively but it is interesting.

       Not trying to debunk or argue one way or the other,  but I remember in the announcement (a day or two ago) about vote totals being reset to the actual number,  the admin says that it will take awhile for /top posts to reflect the correct number.  I guess we'll wait and see.

       You are absolutely right and I considered that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we will wait and see. But from what I can tell through close observation of "innocent site changes" over the last 8 years or so, every single time they make an adjustment, the site becomes more controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/">
        See "How Reddit Was Destroyed" for more examples.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on what I see as a pattern of dishonesty, I highly doubt that reddit is going to spend the time to update 100's of thousands or even millions of threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       What seems more likely is that they are going to manually "approve" what stays in the history and what doesn't. That theory fits the pattern in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if you look at the original Magnora thread, you have multiple users claiming "If you go to r/"X" right now and search top all time, you will see that you are wrong!" and then multiple users piggybacking on those comments (without even checking that claim) and then bashing the OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a real problem on this subreddit. And that itself needs to also be addressed. People need to start doing their own fact-checking and stop allowing threads to be highjacked by people talking out of their asses.

       It's clear to me,  that there are several people, probably with multiple accounts,  that spend a rediculous amount of time arguing with genuine subscribers in order to laugh down and criticize conspiracies. It's overrun with astroturfers. If I hear "not everyone who disagrees with you is a shill" one more time I'm going to lose it.  Of course these people claim to have come here from
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       , but I mostly look at r/rising and still see it all the time.  In my opinion,  that activity just further validates the conspiracy for me.

       Not really worried, to be honest.  Mainstream media did this shit and is currently dying as a result.  If Reddit does it, it will die too.  Eventually someone will get it into their heads that the public are no longer going to stand for this shit.

       OP, thank you for seeing what I was getting at, doing the extra legwork to verify things, and then making a post about it. You're the real MVP here. Your actions are much appreciated by myself and the community

       Considering the vote change, is it possible that this is because reddit is so much more popular now? So the top posts will naturally be newer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not disagreeing just trying to think of possibilities. Is there any metric for overall popularity of reddit over time?

       Default is total votes now. It used to scale to 1-10k where smaller subreddits went up and bigger ones went down to level the field. So if there was avg 10k upvotes before and 20k now for a similar popularity post, then all the biggest ones would be recent bar a few outliers. Just a possibility.
