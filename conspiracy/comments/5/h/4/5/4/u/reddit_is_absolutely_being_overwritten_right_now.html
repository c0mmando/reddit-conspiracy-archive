    <div class="md"><p>Some of it stems from the fact that websites and search engines are not the same for everyone, geographically and device-specific more than anything, but also because people dig themselves into filter bubbles. The default Google setting for logged out users is (or was) personalized search, which is a filter bubble. What I&#39;m saying is, between lazy and agenda comes ignorance.</p>

<p>Eli Parser did a good Ted Talk on filter bubbles:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right and I considered that.</p>

<p>So we will wait and see. But from what I can tell through close observation of &quot;innocent site changes&quot; over the last 8 years or so, every single time they make an adjustment, the site becomes more controlled.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/">See &quot;How Reddit Was Destroyed&quot; for more examples.</a></p>

<p>Based on what I see as a pattern of dishonesty, I highly doubt that reddit is going to spend the time to update 100&#39;s of thousands or even millions of threads.</p>

<p>What seems more likely is that they are going to manually &quot;approve&quot; what stays in the history and what doesn&#39;t. That theory fits the pattern in my opinion.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you look at the original Magnora thread, you have multiple users claiming &quot;If you go to r/&quot;X&quot; right now and search top all time, you will see that you are wrong!&quot; and then multiple users piggybacking on those comments (without even checking that claim) and then bashing the OP.</p>

<p>This is a real problem on this subreddit. And that itself needs to also be addressed. People need to start doing their own fact-checking and stop allowing threads to be highjacked by people talking out of their asses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s clear to me,  that there are several people, probably with multiple accounts,  that spend a rediculous amount of time arguing with genuine subscribers in order to laugh down and criticize conspiracies. It&#39;s overrun with astroturfers. If I hear &quot;not everyone who disagrees with you is a shill&quot; one more time I&#39;m going to lose it.  Of course these people claim to have come here from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but I mostly look at r/rising and still see it all the time.

<p>Default is total votes now. It used to scale to 1-10k where smaller subreddits went up and bigger ones went down to level the field. So if there was avg 10k upvotes before and 20k now for a similar popularity post, then all the biggest ones would be recent bar a few outliers. Just a possibility. </p>
