       What if I was to tell you that for more than a decade The population of the United States along with many other countries, have all subjected to a 24/7/365 day aerosol assualt consisting of a toxic brew of poisonous heavy metals all in the name of Global Warming. 
​
Some of these might include barium, aluminum, arsenic, lead, mercury, copper, manganese, and uranium. All in which are sprayed at high altitudes only to fall &amp; contaminate our soil, water, trees, and our bodies..
​
One major concern  is that there is substantial evidence that they are spraying tons of nanosized aluminum compounds. It has been demonstrated in Science &amp; literature that nanosized particles are infinitely hundreds of times more reactive and induce intense inflammation in several tissues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of special concern is the effect of these nanoparticles on the brain and spinal cord, as a growing list of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s dementia, Parkinson’s disease and Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS) are strongly related to exposure to environmental aluminum.

       I think there is a special level of cognitive dissonance in our communities, unlike yr general conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have tried and tried for a long time to get people to look up, without success.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mention weather modification and some agree "that" happens, but mention the word chemtrails and the glazed over thousand mile stare just drops in.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many conspiracy theories that are now in the realm of conspiracy but chemtrails have to be the most pervasive, invasive and obvious of them all. Yet that cog dis kicks right in everytime.

       Personally l have given up offering any kind of insight to anyone, unless asked.

       Thank you for sharing the same sentiment. Chemtrails are by far the most glazed over subject in the conspiracy world and one that seems to divide people the most (beside PizzaGate)
      </p>
      <p>
       I have done a lot of research on it and every time I post or talk about it, I get nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's the word. It's been heavily manipulated. I think geo-engineering is a better word when it comes to this.

       Hopefully this gains more traction some day.

       It's probably because chemtrails, like the "flat earth", are one of the dumbest and most easily debunked conspiracy theories out there and people don't want to be associated with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fully loaded passenger jet with all seats and cargo full could not also carry the huge amount of liquid weight required to leave a vapour trail dozens of kilometers long. Yet on days where jets are leaving visible contrails, all planes in that area are also making contrails including the full passenger jets. Contrail physics have been studied and demonstrated for over a century now.

       Welp, I sure don't remember the skies looking like they do now when I was growing up (30 years ago).  These days, the contrails from certain, not all, airplanes dissipates a lot wider and lasts a LOT longer.  Hours if you continue to check.  It spreads and formes an almost haze now.  That is a new thing for contrails (CMV here though, I believe spraying began in 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The weather modification angle is pretty interesting.  Fighting global warming!  That's something the populace can get behind, so why not admit to spraying?  I'm guessing when enough evidence finally comes out, the weather modification angle will be the cover story for whatever the goal actually is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the true intent is actually depopulation or control of populations at some level.  Whether it's material they're spraying (Barium, Strontium, Aluminum it's claimed) to collect in the brain, skins, organs to cause chronic illness or something deeper with nanobots and radio frequency.  Or possibly or something else less believable (research colored fibers and Morgellons Disease).  True conspiracy theorists will dig some of the Harald Kautz Vella videos on youtube on this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The unique part of this conspiracy is chemtrails are the MOST visible conspiracy, truly.  Look up over any major city and at least half the time you'll see them.  But we're lead to believe these are what, jet trails that linger for-EVER now and they never did before 1997.  Come on now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do they seem to cover the entire sky in an organized fashion like they're purposely laying down a blanket of it?  Evenly spaced lines, sometimes grids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are some days completely contrail free?  Planes still make them, but they go away like they always did earlier in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why will a see an interruption of a persistent contrail?  Like the pilot turned whatever they're spraying off and back on a bit later.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could have answers to all of these but it just never made sense to me.  BTW, I have no evidence for my claims, just various things I've read or heard (Or SEEN, directly above me 4 out of 7 days of the week).  Even without evidence, you have to admit: they try so hard to cover it up (
       <a href="http://contrailscience.com/">
        this site comes to mind
       </a>
       .  Of course they had to work "science" into the site name haha), it really makes you think there's

       Hello!  Your canned talking points have not answered the following questions sufficiently:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are simply more flights now in addition to the fact that most commercial airliners now use high-bypass turbofan engines which generate more contrails. Lasting contrails have existed since the beginning of manned flight, to say otherwise is an outright fabrication.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, I've heard this talking point about more flights before, but it doesn't explain the completely different behavior of whatever they're spraying now.  I've seen commercial airliners generating contrails present day, which disappear in under a minute.  I'm talking about the ones that dissipate, cover the sky and last hours.  This phenomenon is completely new and has only been seen starting after 1997.  Your response?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why will a see an interruption of a persistent contrail? Like the pilot turned whatever they're spraying off and back on a bit later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why are there clouds in some places and not in others? The a nswer is exactly the same.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm talking about a long, uninterrupted persistent contrail line across the entire sky, and suddenly, there's a gap.  Like the pilot turned off whatever creates a contrail for 5 to 10 seconds.  Then the contrail continues uninterrupted.  Then the contrail spreads over the course of an hour and dissipates across the entire sky.  A phenomenon that has only started in the last 30 years.  Your explanation?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why do they seem to cover the entire sky in an organized fashion like they're purposely laying down a blanket of it? Evenly spaced lines, sometimes grids.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's almost as if clouds have the ability to move when they're in the air, amazing!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Speak a little bit more to the evenly spaced lines and grid formation that these persistent contrails form.  I haven't heard the talking point to explain this before.

       Are you saying these metals are present due to the fact that they're used in the construction of jet engines, and are released as a natural effect of engine "wear" or are you saying they're actively being dispersed into the environment?

       Have you heard of the theory that there is a glass dome/sky?

       According to concave earth theorist
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLZsJQc-vz4">
        Lord Steven Christ
       </a>
       , chemtrails contain the same chemicals as fire extinguishers.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says that the chemtrails are designed to absorb heat from our factories, and prevent the ice on the glass sky from melting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aaron Dover claims that there are no
       <a href="https://youtu.be/_bTWU3yjZdc?t=1m13s">
        chemtrails
       </a>

       My hypothesis on this? It's a band-aid for the ozone hole and to drop UV counts. The most common metal salt compounds aren't all that different than stuff in sunblock you apply to your skin. Still breathing it in isn't good for you, but trace amounts are probably considered less risk than the UV exposure without something done to block it. Keep in mind it's likely economic and has to do with agricultural production.

       I'd say you are recycling fear porn from clickbait websites like naturalnews. If any of this was real there would some.... evidence. As in, evidence that doesn't just link to another fear porn site in a circlejerk. As with all conspiracy theories, there is a grain of truth at its heart. Yes, scientists are looking at ways of dimming the skies, but nobody is doing more than small experiments in the Stratosphere.

       But they don't. Zero evidence to support the claim. Silver is probably the most common element used in geoengineering... REAL geoengineering that is.... where it's used for cloud seeding. NASA recently sent a kilo of lithium up into the Ionosphere to study dispersal patterns. That's the real level these experiments are at.
