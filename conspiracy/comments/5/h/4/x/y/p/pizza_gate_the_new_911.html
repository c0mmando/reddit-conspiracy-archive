       I knew this was coming next. The pizza=pedophilia scam has absolutely nothing in common with the events of 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole idea is to equate this scam with real evidence-based theories so as to discredit them all at once right along with all pf the alt media that falls for it.

       I said "the" whole idea, not "your" whole idea. I was talking about the idea/goal behind the pizza=pedophilia claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the goal is to get rid of any site that TPTB claim are "fake news" sites. The tool they're using is the pizza=pedopilia claim.

       Edit: I think your title equating the two completely different issues is horrible.

        Hi John, The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yours? They can send it if you want. I know you’re busy, so feel free not to respond if it’s not yours or you don’t want it.

        If the "alleged" code in the emails are fake... why did said code DIRECTLY lead to the discovery (and subsequent termination) of 100's of pedo pornography sites on Twitter ??

       I just simply cannot imagine that Twitter would allow CP for several years and then, all of the sudden, remove it all because somebody claimed "pizza=pedophilia" and then coincidentally "found" CP on Twitter. I've seen no actual evidence that it ever existed on Twitter, only claims made in comments here. If it was there, was it put there before or after the original "pizza=pedophilia" claim on 4chan? If I'm wrong then please do show me real evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stuff in your edit really has no relevance. So what if two people knew each other. So what if a wealthy person owns a pizza shop? They could both be connected to
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">
        Kevin Bacon
       </a>
       too. So what. Hell, we could "connect" them to you or me for that matter. It only means something to those that want it to mean something.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, people are trying to connect dots that aren't really there or are so far apart that it takes every bit of imagination they can muster to connect them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying this kind of behavior doesn't exist or that it's not practiced by some people or that it shouldn't be investigated. I'm just saying that trying to connect it all to pizza is absolutely ridiculous, not to mention dangerous to every person that owns a pizza shop, everyone that buys pizza in a store and everyone that even eats pizza. It's nothing short of a 21st century inquisition or witch hunts/trials.

       I feel you. There are plenty of child predators in our government, many people know this, and anyone with a conscience is going to struggle to turn away when there is fresh suspicious shit staring them in the face, and simultaneously it is all being used to push H.R. 6393.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's like.. the government includes and covers for child predators,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the government gets to use that corruption to push for the death of free speech in the end, as well. It's not one or the other, it's both.

       Everything starts with an idea, you never know how things really play out. Conspiracy theorists talking to each other or average Joe's investigating through emails and social media can't happen. What if the elite got sloppy with the change in technology and this is our last and only chance before the AI runs shit for them.

       To think that something called 'pizza gate' is real is beyond absurd. Not to mention the absolute lack of any shred of credible evidence at all and in fact quite the opposite, facts to prove it. Like the fact the sex acts were supposed to be taking place in the basement of the pizza parlor where the shootings happen.... even though they don't have a basement there. Yeah. Weird, isn't it?

       Not a single shred of credible evidence. Just a crazy circle jerk full of simple minded fools who ignore facts and instead dig for something that doesn't exist, just to have something to dig for so you can feel 'right' about something. Good luck with being crazy.

       Um yeah I pretty much agree with you, though for very different reasons it's clear.

       You didn't even read the post, so quit trying to act all high and mighty.

       Nor did you read the post where the guy said 95% of the people looking into it are doing it because they are pedos themselves. You actually asked that guy if he had any statistical proof. hahaha

        You have any statistical evidence of this at all? Or is this just your own ill-preconceived notion to fit your agenda?
Pizza gate. Do you realize how ridiculous that, and you, sounds?

       Now that's hilarious. Might want to look into that, attacking people who are helping your narrative.
