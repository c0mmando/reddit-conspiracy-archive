<p>I think the goal is to get rid of any site that TPTB claim are &quot;fake news&quot; sites. The tool they&#39;re using is the pizza=pedopilia claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here are some of the emails:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi John, The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yours? They can send it if you want. I know you’re busy, so feel free not to respond if it’s not yours or you don’t want it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>wikileaks source: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795</a></p>

<p><strong>If the &quot;alleged&quot; code in the emails are fake... why did said code DIRECTLY lead to the discovery (and subsequent termination) of 100&#39;s of pedo pornography sites on Twitter ??</strong>  (certainly not by &quot;chance&quot;)</p>

<p>/sadly, you are mistaken mate - the code is legitimate - terrifying ramifications on so many levels.</p>

<p>edit/ps. here is at least one email that ties James Alefantis to John Podesta:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/14395">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/14395</a></p>

<p>...and then ask yourself:  How can a pizzashop owner be the <a href="http://www.gq.com/gallery/50-most-powerful-people-in-washington-dc#49">49th most influential person in Washington</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just simply cannot imagine that Twitter would allow CP for several years and then, all of the sudden, remove it all because somebody claimed &quot;pizza=pedophilia&quot; and then coincidentally &quot;found&quot; CP on Twitter. I&#39;ve seen no actual evidence that it ever existed on Twitter, only claims made in comments here. If it was there, was it put there before or after the original &quot;pizza=pedophilia&quot; claim on 4chan? If I&#39;m wrong then please do show me real evidence.</p>

<p>The stuff in your edit really has no relevance. So what if two people knew each other. So what if a wealthy person owns a pizza shop? They could both be connected to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Kevin Bacon</a> too. So what. Hell, we could &quot;connect&quot; them to you or me for that matter. It only means something to those that want it to mean something.</p>

<p>In my opinion, people are trying to connect dots that aren&#39;t really there or are so far apart that it takes every bit of imagination they can muster to connect them. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;m not saying this kind of behavior doesn&#39;t exist or that it&#39;s not practiced by some people or that it shouldn&#39;t be investigated. I&#39;m just saying that trying to connect it all to pizza is absolutely ridiculous, not to mention dangerous to every person that owns a pizza shop, everyone that buys pizza in a store and everyone that even eats pizza. It&#39;s nothing short of a 21st century inquisition or witch hunts/trials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To think that something called &#39;pizza gate&#39; is real is beyond absurd. Not to mention the absolute lack of any shred of credible evidence at all and in fact quite the opposite, facts to prove it. Like the fact the sex acts were supposed to be taking place in the basement of the pizza parlor where the shootings happen.... even though they don&#39;t have a basement there. Yeah. Weird, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>amp/38156985?client=ms-</p>

<p>hillary-clinton/amp/?client=ms</p>

<p>Not a single shred of credible evidence. Just a crazy circle jerk full of simple minded fools who ignore facts and instead dig for something that doesn&#39;t exist, just to have something to dig for so you can feel &#39;right&#39; about something. Good luck with being crazy. </p>
