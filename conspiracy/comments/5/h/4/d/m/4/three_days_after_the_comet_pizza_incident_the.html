just another:
&quot;<em>snap</em> <em>snap</em> hey look over here! don&#39;t look at that, look at this!&quot;</p>

<p>they are pushing the &quot;fake news&quot; leads to violence / gun violence agenda right now.
basically, while trying to abolish the 1st amendment, they&#39;re taking further steps to slam the 2nd.</p>

<p>they are force feeding that narrative in MSM.</p>

<p>It appears that some conspiracy theorists do not understand that the &quot;delay&quot; stems from convening a grand jury to determine if charges should apply.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wect.com/story/33998388/feds-woman-made-death-threats-to-sandy-hook-victims-parent">http://www.wect.com/story/33998388/feds-woman-made-death-threats-to-sandy-hook-victims-parent</a></p>

<p>By the way, grand juries are a legal concept that have existed for centuries. Also, conspiracy theorists are not exempt from the same laws that apply to everybody else.  If they do not like it, then they should not make death threats.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury#Origins">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury#Origins</a></p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists should be happy that the system took the time to convene a grand jury instead of arbitrarily charging her in January.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The grand jury took a year for six texts. That&#39;s laughable. Your condescending attitude is cute, doesn&#39;t make you right. Never said she shouldn&#39;t be charged, said the timing was for specific effect. Her threatening someone doesn&#39;t take away the validity of the theory. Sandy Hook was a lie one way or another and there was a coverup of some sort. If someone threatened Nixon over Watergate it doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that it happened.</p>
