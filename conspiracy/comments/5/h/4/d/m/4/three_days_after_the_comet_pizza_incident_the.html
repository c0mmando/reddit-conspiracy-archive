       The timing is incredible and this article has been pushed to the top of news with over 7,000 upvotes. It appears they think they have found an effective new tactic against conspiracy theories. Not one person in the comments pointed out the long delay in charges and the shills are there in full force posting their own " fake news" links.

       Don't think it's pg related I have a feeling that it is more related to the fact that we are coming up on the Sandy Hook anniversary, and the msm/tptb look to throw things back at us.  They basically yell" see remember this terrible thing?yeah that's right feel bad all over again"

       The timing suggests something different. It was a year old text and an arrest within days of the Comet incident that is a much closer tie. It also never would have been so effective a story without the Comet incident.

       I think I have to agree with you, this story is on the front page of r/all right now and the amount of people spewing "fake news" rhetoric is out of control, calling conspiracy theorists loonies and accusing them of having mental issues. The timing is way too convenient for my liking.

       they are pushing the "fake news" leads to violence / gun violence agenda right now.
basically, while trying to abolish the 1st amendment, they're taking further steps to slam the 2nd.

       I thought this was incredibly odd also, so if she did kill someone in the last YEAR after she sent those texts, is the government responsible since they've known about her texts since January?

       Actually there's evidence the school shooting in England that precipitated the taking away of guns there, was committed by the caretaker who was covering evidence of a high ranking pedophilia ring run out of the school. I have never seen any evidence to link Sandy Hook to that type of situation. It is an interesting thought though.

       It appears that some conspiracy theorists do not understand that the "delay" stems from convening a grand jury to determine if charges should apply.

      <p>
       By the way, grand juries are a legal concept that have existed for centuries. Also, conspiracy theorists are not exempt from the same laws that apply to everybody else.  If they do not like it, then they should not make death threats.

       The grand jury took a year for six texts. That's laughable. Your condescending attitude is cute, doesn't make you right. Never said she shouldn't be charged, said the timing was for specific effect. Her threatening someone doesn't take away the validity of the theory. Sandy Hook was a lie one way or another and there was a coverup of some sort. If someone threatened Nixon over Watergate it doesn't take away from the fact that it happened.
