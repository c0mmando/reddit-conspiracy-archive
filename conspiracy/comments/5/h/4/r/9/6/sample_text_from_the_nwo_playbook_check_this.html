        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From 25 protocols of Zion that give diabolical instructions for world domination.</p>

<p>In order to put public opinion into our hands we must bring it into a state of bewilderment by giving expression from all sides to so many contradictory opinions and for such length of time as will suffice to make the GOYIM lose their heads in the labyrinth and come to see that the best thing is to have no opinion of any kind in matters political, which it is not given to the public to understand, because they are understood only by him who guides the public. This is the first secret.
The second secret requisite for the success of our government is comprised in the following: To multiply to such an extent national failings, habits, passions, conditions of civil life, that it will be impossible for anyone to know where he is in the resulting chaos, so that the people in consequence will fail to understand one another. This measure will also serve us in another way, namely, to sow discord in all parties, to dislocate all collective forces which are still unwilling to submit to us, and to discourage any kind of personal initiative which might in any degree hinder our affair. There is nothing more dangerous than personal initiative; if it has genius behind it, such initiative can do more than can be done by million, of people among whom we have sown discord. We must so direct the education of the goyim communities that whenever they come upon a matter requiring initiative they may drop their hands in despairing impotence. The strain which results from freedom of action saps the forces when it meets with the freedom of another. From this collision arise grave moral shocks, disenchantments, failures. By all these means we shall so wear down the GOYIM that they will be compelled to offer us international power of a nature that by its position will enable us without any violence gradually to absorb all the State forces of the world and to form a Super-Government. In place of the rulers of to-day we shall set up a bogey which will be called the Super-Government Administration. Its hands will reach out in all directions like nippers and its organization will be of such colossal dimensions that it cannot fail to subdue all the nations of the world.</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>We shall soon begin to establish huge monopolies, reservoirs of colossal riches, upon which even large fortunes of the goyim will depend to such an extent that they will go to the bottom together with the credit of the States on the day after the political smash....
You gentlemen here present who are economists, just strike an estimate of the significance of this combination!
In every possible way we must develop the significance of our Super-Government by representing it as the Protector and Benefactor of all those who voluntarily submit to us.
The aristocracy of the goyim as a political force, is dead - - we need not take it into account; but as landed proprietors they can still be harmful to us from the fact that they are self- sufficing in the resources upon which they live. It is essential therefore for us at whatever cost to deprive them of their land. This object will be best attained by increasing the burdens upon landed property -- in loading lands with debt. These measures will check land-holding and keep it in a state of humble and unconditional submission.
The aristocrats of the goyim, being hereditarily incapable of contenting themselves with little, will rapidly burn up and fizzle out.</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>What we want is that industry should drain off from the land both labour and capital and by means of speculation transfer into our hands all the money of the world, and thereby throw all the goyim into the ranks of the proletariat. Then the goyim will bow down before us, if for no other reason but to get the right to exist.</p>

<p>To complete the ruin of the industry of the goyim we shall bring to the assistance of speculation the luxury which we have developed among the goyim, that greedy demand for luxury which is swallowing up everything. We shall raise the rate of wages which, however, will not bring any advantage to the workers, for at the same time, we shall produce a rise in prices of the first necessaries of life, alleging that it arises from the decline of agriculture and cattle breeding: we shall further undermine artfully and deeply sources of production, by accustoming the workers to anarchy and to drunkenness and side by side therewith taking all measure to extirpate from the fact of the earth all the educated forces of the GOYIM.
In order that the true meaning of things may not strike the GOYIM before the proper time we shall mask it under an alleged ardent desire to serve the working classes and the great principles of political economy about which our economic theories are carrying on an energetic propaganda.</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>The principal factor of success in the political is the secrecy of its undertakings: the word should not agree with the deeds of the diplomat.
We must compel the governments of the goyim to take action in the direction favoured by our widely-conceived plan, already approaching the desired consummation, by what we shall represent as public opinion, secretly prompted by us through the means of that so-called &quot;Great Power&quot; -- the Press, which, with a few exceptions that may be disregarded, is already entirely in our hands.</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>It is from us that the all-engulfing terror proceeds. We have in our service persons of all opinions, of all doctrines, restorating monarchists, demagogues, socialists, communists, and utopian dreamers of every kind. We have harnessed them all to the task: each one of them on his own account is boring away at the last remnants of authority, is striving to overthrow all established form of order. By these acts all States are in torture; they exhort to tranquility, are ready to sacrifice everything for peace: but we will not give them peace until they openly acknowledge our international Super-Government, and with submissiveness.</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>When we have accomplished our coup d&#39;etat we shall say then to the various peoples: &quot;Everything has gone terribly badly, all have been worn out with sufferings. We are destroying the causes of your torment -- nationalities, frontiers, differences of coinages. You are at liberty, of course, to pronounce sentence upon us, but can it possibly be a just one if it is confirmed by you before you make any trial of what we are offering you.&quot; . . . Then will the mob exalt us and bear us up in their hands in a unanimous triumph of hopes and expectations. Voting, which we have made the instrument will set us on the throne of the world by teaching even the very smallest units of members of the human race to vote by means of meetings and agreements by groups, will then have served its purposes and will play its part then for the last time by a unanimity of desire to make close acquaintance with us before condemning us.</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>The goyim are a flock of sheep, and we are their wolves. And you know what happens when the wolves get hold of the flock?...
There is another reason also why they will close their eyes: for we shall keep promising them to give back all the liberties we have taken away as soon as we have quelled the enemies of peace and tamed all parties. . . 
It is not worth while to say anything about how long a time they will be kept waiting for this return of their liberties
For what purpose then have we invented this whole policy and insinuated it into the minds of the goys without giving them any chance to examine its underlying meaning? For what, indeed, if not in order to obtain in a roundabout way what is for our scattered tribe unattainable by the direct road? It is this which has served as the basis for our organization of secret masonry which is not known to, and aims which are not even so much as suspected by, these Goy cattle, attracted by us into the &quot;Show&quot; army of Masonic Lodges in order to throw dust in the eyes of their fellows.</p>

<p>While the Protocols have always been a cornerstone of anti-semitic screeds, it strikes me as strange that there&#39;s no negative test for them. The above clearly has not come to pass, but we can keep pointing to whatever does happen and say, &quot;that&#39;s a step in the process.&quot; Ultimately, it&#39;s a self-fulfilling prediction. Any change that feels related is confirmation, and there is no means of rejecting the claim. Every good Jew isn&#39;t in on it and every Jew who abuses power, is caught in a slur against others or even just makes progress towards any sort of unification of peoples or nations is seen as confirmation.</p>

<p>That kind of conspiracy theory isn&#39;t nearly as interesting as the sort that can be disproven. Theories that can be disproven provide real logical and rhetorical &quot;umph&quot;, and can be used to build further knowledge in a logically sound way, when their negative tests fail to disprove them.</p>

<p>Generally, in this sub there are two sorts of things referred to as &quot;research.&quot; One is actual research, which involves rigorously source-checking and cross-validating everything with a critical eye and the other is doing Google searches of conspiracy sites.</p>

<p>Yes, that is exactly the definition of confirmation bias.</p>

<p>Healthy skepticism regarding power structures is clearly warranted by historical precedent, but crossing the line into credulously adopting some particular narrative without any real evidence... that&#39;s not healthy anything. That&#39;s just deluding yourself, and makes you <em>more</em> easily manipulated, not less.</p>
