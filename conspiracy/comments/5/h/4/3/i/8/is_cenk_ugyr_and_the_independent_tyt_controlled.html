       Lets talk proof and reasoning on this one. From me watching them as a former Bernie supporter gave quite a bit of my trust and respect to the people at TYT. After Bernie was cheated out of the nomination I noticed a complete shift in rhetoric about Clinton. Their coverage of the whole general election focused only on Trump's "scandals" and mean words, while leaving Hillary mostly uncriticized. Now with
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXJdEBag000">
        Cenk's coverage of Pizzagate
       </a>
       I am thinking there is something to this organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that the entire Bernie campaign along with the creation and coverage of TYT was a Soros psyop to convince millennials (who know best not to trust the corporate media) to vote for the Hillary Clinton. There is
       <a href="http://yournewswire.com/wikileaks-bernie-sanders-plant-primaries-rigged/">
        evidence
       </a>
       from Wikileaks that Bernie KNEW he would be cheated out of the primary, but ran and took money anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it really be so staged that Bernie was set as a plant the entire election to convince millennials to get out and vote, and to vote for Hillary?
      </p>
      <p>
       I really think this is an important question to crack. I have multiple "progressive" friends who take TYT as gospel and when talking to them about Pizzagate they seem even more locked into their "official narrative" as MSM consumers. The people sucked into TYT know the MSM lies to them and want to be on the side of truth... but they are too indoctrinated into virtue signaling and "progressive" identity politics. So much that many of the their listeners could justify voting for Hillary Clinton who is antithetical to "progressive" values.  Has anyone else experienced a similar kind of "brainwashing" of TYT listeners?

       i appreciate your personal input. A lot of this is on a hunch after being a long time viewers of theirs.

       What do you think about Kyle Kulinski? I have heard him talk from quite a high pedestal and dismiss and attack conspiracy theorists and many conservative alt media groups.

       I was also a long time viewer (year or so) of TYT, but eventually got tired of them refusing to call the DNC out on issues of pivotal importance and stopped tuning in..
      </p>
      <p>
       And I've ever heard of Kyle Kulinski, so I have no opinion on him.

       Yeah TYT was much too soft on the DNC and did not cover wikileaks nearly at all. It was also telling that Jimmy Door felt the need to break off and focus more on his own channel, where he actually said Hillary was worse than Trump.

       Got a link? That Ben dude is a fucking asshole. When I used to watch TYT, even the times when he was totally right he was still a fucking piece of shit. Honestly, I can't imagine why they even let him on camera. I'd be down to see Jimmy tear him apart.

       God, I detest TYT. When they took the Haim Saban money for the Fusion show, that was beyond the pale. After the primary, they never covered Hillary at all--only endless Trump stories. Totally shielded her from ANY negative coverage, it was completely surreal.
  Cenk is a buffoon. Jon Iadarola is so smarmy, he reminds me of a waiter, and probably wishes he was a VJ instead. Ana just became a flat out monster after the primary, like spitting with contempt nightly. Holy shit, she became a total angry freak. Ben and Michael are Establishment Dems through and through. Jimmy and Jordan (the producer Steven Oh) are the only good ones.

       Sure. He was one of Hillary's top donor/bundlers. As big as they get in Hillary world. Has long reach into US Mideast policy. Most recently, he is leading a smear campaign against Keith Ellison who is running for DNC chair, claiming he is anti-Semitic and anti-Israel. (Saban has one issue--Israel. And I am not a fan of Ellison, fwiw). He is also for increased scrutiny of Muslim immigrants to the US.

       They are an early foray by the TPTB creating an alt-media look-alike. They are the next step after Democracy Now, who are funded by huge foundations seeking to push an agenda. Most of their money doesn't come from views like you - so they are beholden to the wishes of that money.

       TYT are absolute whores, regardless of wether they are aware of it or not. Granted they are so sure of themselves and so obnoxiously condescending, that it looks more like the latter.

       Also I'd like to point out the fact that their name alone is ethically questionable as fuck, and a deliberate attempt to obfuscate in google searches the historical 'young turks' who genocided the armenian population and were funded by and following orders from you know who.

        "Young Turks (Turkish: Jön Türkler, from French: Les Jeunes Turcs) was a political reform movement in the early 20th century that consisted of Ottoman exiles, students, civil servants, and army officers.[1] They favored the replacement of the Ottoman Empire's absolute monarchy with a constitutional government. Later, their leaders led a rebellion against the absolute rule of Sultan Abdul Hamid II in the 1908 Young Turk Revolution.[2] With this revolution, the Young Turks helped to establish the Second Constitutional Era in 1908, ushering in an era of multi-party democracy for the first time in the country’s history.[3]"

       The movement might have been involved in
       <em>
        some other things
       </em>
       , but it started as a movement to replace an absolute monarchy with a constitutional democracy. This is an idea that has resonance in the USA today as our constitutional democracy has turned out to be an unapologetic oligarchy. I wouldn't have named my organization after this movement because of the controversial Armenian genocide, but what they were going for is obviously a lot deeper than "lol lets name our news org after genociders!"

       I don't buy that for one second. They are both ethnic turks, they are trying to obscure a dark chapter in their countries history and have denied the genocide on record in the past. I say this without having looked into it too deeply, sort of as a shot from the hip based on other research, but the (historical) young turks genuinely trying to 'free the people and introduce democracy' is the same kind of propaganda that CNN spouts about the afghan opium trade after the US military was sent in to protect it. And Libya with their gold backed dinar. And Saddam with his abandonment of the petrodollar. And Tsarist Russia with their

       Yeah it wasn't very well put, but hopefully my point comes across. Soros is a bona fide globalist, which I do believe makes him a marxist. However I use marxist in the sense of what it
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       is (based on it's history), not in the sense of what Marx deceivingly (or naively) claimed it to be. And I'm aware of the fact that Zionism is originally about securing a jewish homeland, but I use the term a bit freely to describe the pursuit of Israeli geopolitical supremacy (Oded Yinon plan for instance is very much zionist) which I believe goes hand in hand with the control of the entire world via banking and economical warfare.

       Think then PTB want to control all media regardless. The more someone becomes well known with increased influence the more they want to control that media. It is why they have Assange in the embassy (or worse) so they can take over Wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the media can't be controlled then the persons involved are rubbished and every mistake or crime they made is amplified (aka Assange, Webb, etc..) or stories are just made up to blacken the persons name. This don't work they really do kill the messenger (i.e. Webb).
      </p>
      <p>
       The importance of Bernie Sanders, controlled or not, is that he showed that there are voters out there who are prepared to vote for his ulideas. Hopefully there is a new generation coming through who will build on this movement.

       I don't watch TYT the main channel, but Jimmy Dore and Secular talk are good. I honestly wouldn't be surprised.

       Anytime anything remotely conspiracy is brought up they immediately dismiss it as nonsense without objectively looking at any of the information.

        My theory is that the entire Bernie campaign along with the creation and coverage of TYT was a Soros psyop to convince millennials (who know best not to trust the corporate media) to vote for the Hillary Clinton. There is evidence from Wikileaks that Bernie KNEW he would be cheated out of the primary, but ran and took money anyway.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I agree with the general idea you're getting at there, but I don't think there's any evidence that Soros was involved per se. It's also possible that the effect we're seeing is less about an active conspiracy and more about a confluence of influences. In other words, they didn't have a nefarious plan, it's just a bunch of people independently doing what they think is best for them and it turns out that their actions fit into this larger framework of the rigged primaries. To put it simply, Cenk Uygur wasn't necessarily conspiring with others to get Clinton elected from the beginning, he just started shilling for her when it became clear the alternative was Trump. Acting independently, but still doing what the powers that be would want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think Bernie knew he wouldn't be allowed to win though. That's why he didn't even bother trying to fight the obvious election fraud as it was happening. He never planned on winning and was only doing what he did to push the progressive agenda, so he never actually fought for the win he had earned.

       Even if Bernie knew he'd be rigged against,
he did the right thing.
Millions have woken up.
It was worth it.
I don't know what happened to the REMAINING donated money,
but to accuse Bernie of fraud is a bit much.
If he didn't spill the truth about the establishment,
we'd still be arguing between Trump and Clinton politics
while now, we know there are better alternatives.
If it wasn't for people like Bernie, I wouldn't have researched political science and conspiracies.
Literally, Bernie has won us half the battle.
Him being threatened or whatever to endorse Clinton doesn't taint his legacy at all IMO, it just reminds us that anyone can be compromized morally, contractually or physically and so you have to be careful with info from even honest people.
Security for honest politicians must be improved.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for TYT....I don't think Soros has anything to do with it and I
think for the most part TYT are legit but they went about the Clinton issue all wrong.
It's their mentality of
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         "if we tell Clinton voters to screw off or vote Jill Stein, then we'll lose the cowardly portion of our viewers who are too scared of Trump to risk going third party"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "we have 3million subscribers so if we tell people to vote Jill Stein, and Trump wins, we'll be blamed to hell and risk our channel's reputation and success"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "if we tell people about what we really think about conspiracies like JFK and stuff, our reputation will be tin foil hat level so we have to wait for evidence or just laugh at it like the mainstream media does".
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And of course there's the "will we get death threats if we talk about conspiracies about powerful people?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think TYT are bad for the most part.
I agree with much (not all and not always but much)
of what they say usually.
I think the bigger conspiracy is how the hell do they have
such persistent trolls and shills trying to bring their channel down in the comment
section with copy pasta retards spouting shit like
"libtards" "Cenk yogurt" "Anna sit on my face" "Young Turds" "I'm unsubscribing" (again) etc.
It's just retarded and I can't fathom how anyone would willingly
come to each and every video, not watch them, 
but immediately run to the dislike button and comment stupid shit.
They are also dodgy empty accounts with photoshopped images mocking
the TYT presenters.
They also bring political division.
It's not like I go on Fox News videos to post hate 24/7.
I think someone is funding shills against TYT
and suspected this for months.

       i regularly post/comment about Pizzagate and I linked to a video talking about Cenk's BS coverage of Pizzagate. I take it you didnt follow that link. Also there is evidence that Bernie was a plant, or at least knew he was being used as one. I'm sorry if you are a devout Bernie supporter and I hurt your identity, but I believe exposing people like Cenk and Bernie who Leftists look up to is an important step for taking back control of the narrative.
