    <div class="md"><p>My favorite is when I ask someone what they mean specifically, when they say that &quot;pizzagate&quot; is &quot;fake&quot; - as in what specifically are they calling fake. And most of them don&#39;t even respond, probably because it&#39;s the first time they&#39;ve ever had that thought, and those that do usually say some shit like the most recent person &quot;it&#39;s about children being eaten&quot;.</p>

Kinda like how the majority of people will claim advertising &#39;doesn&#39;t work&#39; on them, yet millions and billions of dollars are spent on marketing each year.  Gotta ask whats more likely, that these stupidly rich corporate execs are dumb and just pissing money away, or if the general populace is dumber than they realize and ads /minor brainwashing is a very real thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  That is why I doubt the accuracy of saying that there&#39;s hard evidence of Russian hacking etc etc.  Just because a server is in Moscow, for example, doesn&#39;t mean that there is someone at that location who is doing whatever <em>hack</em> is in regard.  A similar argument could be made for the coding and language its written in.. all of this is relatively easy to manipulate in a way as to purport an attack by someone else.</p>

<p>Agreed. And as much as I don&#39;t like Trump, it&#39;s important to stick with facts and evidence over personal feelings. I&#39;d rather hit him with something that&#39;s demonstrably valid rather than push a malicious rumor.</p>
