    <div class="md"><p>I think the &quot;Trump for Russia&quot; narrative is propaganda to get Hillary in the White House.</p>

<p>If this happens, then Trump was working with Hillary all along.  I also think that the theater of the election was just to keep us all distracted from the fact that the economy is a sneeze away from collapsing. The more distracted that we are, the more we go about business as usual.  The Christmas shopping is the only thing keeping this whole mess afloat, so they keep us in suspense about something that&#39;s already decided, and we keep the rich rich and the powerful powerful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I don&#39;t believe it would be particularly hard to convince a significant portion of the military to join, they are sworn to the constitution after all, I do not believe it would be required. There are nearly enough civilian held fire arms to arm the entire country. They  might not have heavier hardware, but that would be rectified easily enough once you capture a few military assets. That could be done through stealth and guile I&#39;m sure, especially if some of the military or national guard does join you with the their equipment.</p>

<p>In fact, according to every study done by the government, the government has no hope of winning an ideological civil war against the right. None at all, even if the majority of the military remains loyal to the federal government.</p>

<p>The government would be undermined from without by guerrilla forces and from within by sympathizers. The rebels could destroy infrastructure at will that the government would depend on. Roads, railroads, airports, power and telecommunications. They could not defend it all. Estimates by the government believe that nearly 30% of the population would join the rebellion. That is a 100 million fully armed guerrilla fighters. Most successful rebellions are less than 10%. The military, even of it wasn&#39;t gutted from within, could never stand against that.</p>

<p>No, the government could never win against that. Our forefathers and our culture of independence they gave us in their wisdom has prepared us for precisely this eventuality. This is not our first revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a good point. It&#39;s hard to say one way or another, I don&#39;t know of any examples in history where a country with as large and advanced a military as the us was overgrown by militia rebels. But, if at least some military revolted and foreign fighters came to help, maybe there would be a chance. It would certainly not be over quickly and it would probably mean the end of the us as we know it</p>

It must have all been organic.  Until now of course which is a clear attempt at doing something that definitely was not done before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just Reddit the script of  big lie propaganda from the six corporations that control media and newspapers is dictated to them and relentlessly repeated on every outlet. It&#39;s quite obvious as the same few stories are repeated over and over simultainiously. This is a script right out of the movie Idiocracy. Also, cannot work very long if at all, so duck for cover something else will happen.</p>
