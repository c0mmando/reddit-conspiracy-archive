    <div class="md"><p>A pizza restaurant that is only open for business during dinner and late night is suspicious to you? Lots of restaurants are only open when their particular product is going to sell the best. It&#39;s just a strategic business plan.</p>

<p>Did you ever consider the theory that most of their customers are full time college students? People who are at school all day and studying or partying until way late at night. It makes WAY more sense than your theory. </p>

<p>A pizza place is more likely to be a cover for a marijuana delivery service than a covert child sex and or child organ harvesting operation. </p>

<p>Every good theory should have at least a little bit of common sense and maybe even a few facts that are hard to explain otherwise behind it. </p>

<p>OK, so is there any verifiable evidence for sexual abuse going on in this pizza place?</p>

<p>Is there any verifiable evidence that children are being sold and traded in this pizza place?</p>

<p>Is there any verifiable evidence that children are being used as slave labor in this pizza place?</p>

<p>Is there any verifiable evidence that the Satanists are involved in the sex abuse, child trading, child trafficking, and child slave labor in this pizza place?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for the individuals that are profiting from the murder and exploitation children. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any verifiable evidence that children are being murdered in this pizza place?</p>

<p>Is there any verifiable evidence that this pizza place is profiting off of child sex trafficking murder slave labor organ sales?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When conducting your open-source research, or less than open, keep the information above in mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, it&#39;s curious that all this activity is going on in such a small little pizza place. How do they manage it all and not have anyone notice in such a small and highly public place?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(You can make more money selling the organs of children, than the children.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, but just because you can doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s actually happening in this pizza place.</p>

<p>A Holocaust can happen, but that also doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s happening in my tiny back yard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s time to look at the industries and materials, which would be required in human organ trafficking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, and let&#39;s see if this small pizza place has the capability, the floor space, and the manpower to carry this out AND run a successful pizza shop at the same time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, let&#39;s see if you can connect the players to them... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember, only demonstrable valid evidence is acceptable.</p>

<p>Rumors, here-say, personal blogs, unsubstantiated anecdotal claims, Wikipedia pages, coincidences, personal feelings, and other such nonsense is not valid evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, &quot;The satanic component is only a cover, or another layer; it is a distraction&quot; Like I said, this is simply a distraction, and I do not think this situation is related to the occult. I never said that the abuse could purely be in this particular establishment. Moreover, that is not how traffickers work. Child abuse happens all the time: one in three girls and one in four boys is sexual abused among other things. It can happen anywhere, even in your backyard.<br/>
Child predators are not ill-advised, and they are versatile with grooming the child and the adults around them. However, not all parents are humane, or present and that is when the child is in serious danger. </p>

<p>Then why was Satanism even brought up in the first place?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never said that the abuse could purely be in this particular establishment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said that either, so why are you bringing it up?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Child abuse happens all the time: one in three girls and one in four boys is sexual abused among other things. It can happen anywhere, even in your backyard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because it can happen anywhere tells us absolutely nothing about whether it is actually happening in this pizza place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, you have to admit the hours the establishment keeps 5 p.m. to 9+ is not typical for family restaurants; particularly, the restaurants that cater to parents and their children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When do families eat dinner? Somewhere around 6pm to 9pm&#39;ish, right? And they&#39;re not just strictly for families with young children either. Families with grown children and teenage children are also welcome. And families with no children are also welcome. And individuals are also welcome. </p>

<p>This is completely normal. You should get out more often.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are the inappropriate terms and language about children on Facebook and the random reference from a performer, about a certain individual liking young boys. These are all major red flags.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This whole sentence of yours is just wonky. The way it reads, you&#39;re complaining about random inappropriate terms and language about random children on random Facebook pages that reference random performers. How is any of this relevant to anything?</p>

<p>Or, are you claiming there is inappropriate language about specific young boys made by this specific pizza place itself? If so, please provide the evidence for this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s the thing about theories, especially, conspiracy theories, there is not a large amount of evidence, if any.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s why they&#39;re crap and why people dismiss them. Claims that can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. If you don&#39;t like it, go find some supporting evidence for your claims. Otherwise your claim fails to meet its burden of proof and is not worthy of anyone&#39;s time.</p>

<p>BTW, a theory in the science field is not conjecture or opinion. It&#39;s a framework that explains all the facts and is contradicted by none of them. A theory is the pinnacle of science. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Demanding evidence is kryptonite to conspiracies.&quot;Yeah, because conspiracies are not built on evidence. Red flags are things that people find concerning; I will say, I only see 1-5% of what others posted as a red flag. 
&quot;If you&#39;re one of these chumps, then I have a bridge to sell you.&quot; lol 
&quot;These crazies keep invading and vomiting their nonsense in science and law subreddits.&quot; WOW, we could create a conspiracy on that, all its own; thanks for letting me know, no wonder your angry. When did this start?  </p>

<p>Well I never said all conspiracies are false. Some are true when we can demonstrate they&#39;re true with solid verifiable evidence.</p>

<p>Both. Mods are squashing them as fast as they keep popping up. And arguing with conspiracy nuts who proudly gloat that they don&#39;t care about facts and evidence is frustrating. </p>

<p>What facts and evidence can you provide someone who doesn&#39;t care about facts and evidence? There&#39;s nothing behind this pizzagate nonsense expect angry emotions and personal bias. </p>

<p>I was in a long argument with one guy who kept claiming there&#39;s irrefutable proof, yet when I asked him where this proof is, he claimed it&#39;s all <em>&quot;red flags and hunches which is just as good&quot;</em>. These are the types of people who will believe anything that fits their emotional narrative and personal biases. These types of people assume guilt and no amount of facts and evidence can prove innocence. It just implicates those providing facts and evidence as <em>&quot;in on it too&quot;</em>.</p>

<p>And as a side note, I now have a few new stalkers. Hi stalkers, yo</p>

I will say, I have wrote papers for my Intel class with less suspicions and odd  coincidences than pizza gate. So, political science, Intel, etc... has its theories. However, no law enforcement agency in their right mind, would prosecute on this alone. Like you said, not enough evidence. </p>

<p>Oh I know. It&#39;s one thing if there was actually a pedophile ring discovered. Then I could understand the conspiracy links to Clinton and Podesta, but there&#39;s not even that. No victims, no blood, no children, no confessions, no basement, no tunnels, no witnesses, nothing.</p>

What the hell does pizzagate have to do with circumcision? I feel like everyone is trying to attach their own agenda to this thing. Pizza gate has nothing to do with Jews. The Jews did everything meme is stupid.</p>

<p>I already regret having replied to you. Looking through your post history shows that you believe in magic and that people can survive without eating or drinking.</p>

<p>Just read fiction instead. Don&#39;t try and combine credible stories with your imaginary fantasies</p>
