       The majority are desperate to believe that government are their benevolent parents, and will do virtually anything necessary to maintain that belief.  It is said belief which allows the psychopaths to continue to rule.

       Agreed, a big part of that psyche is the sheeple do not want to know those that hold control over them are lying, quite sick (spiritually speaking) and corrupt - even if there's evidence profiling the truth about their "masters" staring them in the face.
      </p>

       The revelations are only going to get more shocking and disgusting. Better strap in and prepare spiritually. When the masses wake up, it will most likely get violent, short of some miracles.

       I have a feeling the Pizzagate scandal is a big player in the bombardment of this whole "fake news" and "wikileaks podesta emails were leaked by russia" thing...Colbert even said in his little hit-piece on pizzagate
       <em>
        "code words in the John Podesta emails, which were emails hacked by russia"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       They keep trying to push this "russia influenced the election and the Podesta emails" bit, so that pizzagate looks like some kind of wacky fake news the russians thought up or were a part of.

       The average person literally does not care at all if they're verified by Jesus Christ himself. Also, in my experience nobody cares what the emails say and they don't want to read them. It's mind boggling, they're falling over each other to point fingers at the Russians while the evidence of pay for play in their own government is apparently a non-issue.

       The intelligence community released a statement a few months ago, before the election (therefore before pizzagate), that there is information suggesting Russian interference in the election. It had nothing to do with pizzagate. People have been talking about this, it's just now the MSM is reporting on it.

       Why even discuss whether or not it's "legal?" It's purely academic and always has been with the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so useless to mention or consider that I don't. The government didn't get to the state it's in through legal means. Almost every agency and bill of the last 35 years would be deemed illegal via the constitution, especially when they interfere with individual rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, we've gotten so far from constitutional rights that concepts of "the collective" has magically and without any amending been the "ethics" (excuse) through which we now pass laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, as a people, all the checks have been compromised and no longer work for the good of the individual or state rights. They have been carefully chosen to facilitate these measure and what they do not, there's always the good ol' "executive order" or measures to protect "too big to fail" corporations and services; the fed, monsanto, innumerable banks, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       This is no longer a government for, by, or of the people. So debating the legalities (or even ethics) of its actions seems by all means moot.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also moot to discuss the idiots who "lap it up." For they are the people who've allowed this inversion of control to be implemented in the first place, and TPTB are the ones they look to to protect and inform them. That is to say t hey were the opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, where we're left now is preaching to the choir.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, yes. But how do we fix it?

       The portion of the country who voted for Trump will never buy Russia got trump elected...so they will never believe the fake news meme as being currently marketed.  In fact, the only people who will believe Russia hacked the US election are Clinton supporters.  Watching this play out is fascinating, because the propaganda isn't working.  Those who don't spend hours online consuming information are chuckling at this new push to label everything that isn't on CNN fake news.  The corporate media has officially jumped the shark.

       That is certainly a possibility, even probable.  But I'm not going to Ad Hominem because of the subject matter.  I have no doubt the Republicans are just as corrupt, but the reality of it is;  Anyone is corruptible, that is the human condition.  There will be some dark thing that someone is ashamed of.  Someone else finds that out and applies pressure; that is how a person is controlled.  This has been done for centuries.

       If it's true why didn't he just say it outright? It's just like a defense attorney implying that somebody else committed a crime to keep his client from being convicted. It's called reasonable doubt.

       Seems like most articles are provided Russia anti US. So the guy is good friends with assange, and is defending him. He also wasn't an ambassador Russia but Uzbekistan and was fired from that post. Don't forget to read the chilcot report about British involvement in the Gulf War. Not exactly the most reliable article. Don't forget that he even knows and met with the person who did the leaking but refused to say who it was.

       This is the backbone of Wikileaks - that they do not reveal the leakers.  That is their whole reason for existence.  He cannot reveal who it is without damaging Wikileaks.

       What were they going to discover about Trump in the RNC leaks. I mean fucking seriously. They would see how they all wanted Trump out which we already know.

       Whenever I read opinions like this one, I have to remind myself that most of you don't know the real nature of those you are protecting.  If you did, you wouldn't do it.

       I do not condone your downvotes, and I have upvoted your last statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I do not deny that at least some of Wikileaks' information may have come from Russian intelligence.  However, Wikileaks is an example of what I consider to be the Internet's founding ethos; which is to be a neutral
       <strong>
        <em>
         common carrier
        </em>
       </strong>
       of information, regardless of said information's source.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may respond to that by wondering why, then, it seems that the majority of Wikileaks' information has been in relation to the American government; although if you look at their repository
       <a href="https://file.wikileaks.org/file/">
        here
       </a>
       , you will note that some of their information pertains to Europe as well, in addition to information about various cults of different kinds.  I think the main reason why the American government has received so much emphasis, is because it represents one of the most dire current threats to the wellbeing of both humanity and the planet.  Hence, there are more people attempting to leak or expose information in relation to it.

       You don't need any proof lmao. Im glad to see we've brought establishment people into r/conspiracy but you guys need to do a little better than that. You're making "all politicians are lizards from underground" sound more believable.

       The average person literally does not care at all if they're verified by Jesus Christ himself. Also, in my experience nobody cares what the emails say and they don't want to read them. It's mind boggling, they're falling over each other to point fingers at the Russians while the evidence of pay for play in their own government is apparently a non-issue.
