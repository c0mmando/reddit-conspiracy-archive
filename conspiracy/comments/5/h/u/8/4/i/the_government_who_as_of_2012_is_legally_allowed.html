    <div class="md"><p>Why even discuss whether or not it&#39;s &quot;legal?&quot; It&#39;s purely academic and always has been with the government.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so useless to mention or consider that I don&#39;t. The government didn&#39;t get to the state it&#39;s in through legal means. Almost every agency and bill of the last 35 years would be deemed illegal via the constitution, especially when they interfere with individual rights.</p>

<p>In fact, we&#39;ve gotten so far from constitutional rights that concepts of &quot;the collective&quot; has magically and without any amending been the &quot;ethics&quot; (excuse) through which we now pass laws.</p>

<p>And, as a people, all the checks have been compromised and no longer work for the good of the individual or state rights. They have been carefully chosen to facilitate these measure and what they do not, there&#39;s always the good ol&#39; &quot;executive order&quot; or measures to protect &quot;too big to fail&quot; corporations and services; the fed, monsanto, innumerable banks, etc...</p>

<p>This is no longer a government for, by, or of the people. So debating the legalities (or even ethics) of its actions seems by all means moot.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also moot to discuss the idiots who &quot;lap it up.&quot; For they are the people who&#39;ve allowed this inversion of control to be implemented in the first place, and TPTB are the ones they look to to protect and inform them. That is to say t hey were the opposition.</p>

<p>So, where we&#39;re left now is preaching to the choir.</p>

<p>Yes, yes. But how do we fix it?</p>

In fact, the only people who will believe Russia hacked the US election are Clinton supporters.  Watching this play out is fascinating, because the propaganda isn&#39;t working.  Those who don&#39;t spend hours online consuming information are chuckling at this new push to label everything that isn&#39;t on CNN fake news.  The corporate media has officially jumped the shark.</p>

He also wasn&#39;t an ambassador Russia but Uzbekistan and was fired from that post. Don&#39;t forget to read the chilcot report about British involvement in the Gulf War. Not exactly the most reliable article. Don&#39;t forget that he even knows and met with the person who did the leaking but refused to say who it was. </p>

<p>This is the backbone of Wikileaks - that they do not reveal the leakers.  That is their whole reason for existence.  He cannot reveal who it is without damaging Wikileaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not condone your downvotes, and I have upvoted your last statement.</p>

<p>Also, I do not deny that at least some of Wikileaks&#39; information may have come from Russian intelligence.  However, Wikileaks is an example of what I consider to be the Internet&#39;s founding ethos; which is to be a neutral <strong><em>common carrier</em></strong> of information, regardless of said information&#39;s source.</p>

<p>You may respond to that by wondering why, then, it seems that the majority of Wikileaks&#39; information has been in relation to the American government; although if you look at their repository <a href="https://file.wikileaks.org/file/">here</a>, you will note that some of their information pertains to Europe as well, in addition to information about various cults of different kinds.  I think the main reason why the American government has received so much emphasis, is because it represents one of the most dire current threats to the wellbeing of both humanity and the planet.  Hence, there are more people attempting to leak or expose information in relation to it.</p>

Also, in my experience nobody cares what the emails say and they don&#39;t want to read them.
