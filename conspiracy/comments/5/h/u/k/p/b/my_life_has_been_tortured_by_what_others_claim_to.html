       I plan on leaving the nation for Holland if I can get out of the US alive.

       No, I'm not skitzo or any of that, though they have done many things to try to paint me as something like that. I'm just a guy who used to work in tech.

       I'm not completely sure of what their goal is, but one guess is to either lock me up in a nut house, or kill me.

       The reaction is what must happen to keep my wife safe, if I'm in another nation, they won't harass her, and it's all we know how to make them stop.

       Yes, we've been down the road you're suggesting. They don't stop, they just up their game to make themselves more noticeable.

       Sorry this is happening to you, I'm a targeted individual too in Iran (get tortured with DEWs daily, had relationships ruined, gangstalked) I don't think anywhere is safe although anywhere is probably better than US. I really wish you luck in the future, know you're not alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: a lot of people don't know why they're targeted, I imagine it has something to do with them actually wanting professional psychopathy to run a portion of society (pays well, keeps cash flowing, keeps psychos busy  and using prisons, big pharma, mental institutions as assets, creating manchurian candidates) they go after lot of people with artistic, scientific or social talent to control their influence on society and sometimes plagiarize their work. On a more spiritual side I heard it's like creating synchronicities for the dark side, the aim is basically to control. Scary times.

       Sounds like you've already made up your mind, but have you tried going dark?
      </p>
      <p>
       Disconnect, and for the rare times you need Internet, have an OS loaded onto a USB key that formats and reinstalls itself on every boot. Mint [Linux] via live USB is great.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know John McAfee uses multiple smartphones, as in buys a new Samsung every month or so, roots it, uninstalls all bloatware, then deactivates root (for security, user access only), and does this often, "just to fuck with them".
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Get a new job.
       </li>
       <li>
        If in-person harassing continues, then double back often when travelling (find your tail). Read: It's harder for a sniper to hit a randomly zig zagging target than one that moves in a linear constant motion.
       </li>
       <li>
        Definitely rent, and move when you feel like they're tracking you again. You could not own a place if you were a target of intelligence agencies.
       </li>
       <li>
        Not saying you are, but in case you are, you need to stop getting high. That shit will make you more paranoid, and you will sure as shit not be sharp enough to evade unjustified monitoring.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There are ways to "fight back", but if you've already decided to run, then that's that I suppose. The alternative above is, if you really want to stay with your wife, then her just thinking you're paranoid is better than you walking out. I am not a shrink, but if you want to leave her for other reasons, and you're using this as an excuse then you'd need to face that.
      </p>

       Good luck man!

       Thanks. I just want to leave. These people are fucked in the head. I don't want to try to evade them, just leave from their home nation so they can go do their BS on someone else, as horrible as that is... and I'll have to start a new life.

       Nope, she doesn't think I'm paranoid, she knows about what's going on.

       Yeah, I understand that, but when you're trying to focus on work, or speak with your wife, or w/e, and you hear "CLICK" or "CLICK CLACK" as they attempt to "guide" the way you live, it really starts to file you down after a year, after hearing these hundreds of times a day.

       It does sound exhausting, to say the least.  But if your main option is "sneak away to completely foreign country, reset everything I've known in life, abandon loved ones, and hope they don't follow me"...  well...
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like standing up for yourself and not letting them have this form of control over your life is less extreme, and more likely to work, long term.  It's not easy, but does seem easier than the elaborate and expensive escape plan you outlined.

       Tried standing up for myself, does't work. I cannot go against evil so strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not too expensive, and my quality of life will probably increase a huge amount by the end of it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only have one loved one that I must leave. This is why I'm such a good target, no family, no friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad fact is that evil people partially run the US now, they cannot be stopped, and will only grow in power, which will allow them to put forth more torture on US citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly suggest getting out while you can. What happens when they turn their eyes onto you and/or your loved ones?

       Going to a doctor and not telling them what you've been thinking and observing doesn't mean you're OK. They aren't magic, if you act like a normal person near them they will simply say you are.

       There is no such thing as "signs of surveillance equipment". Either there are electronic devices there, or there are not. If they are there, find them, and you have proof. Otherwise, you're lying to me and to yourself... you never saw a doctor about this.

      <p>
       The "clicks" go right with what I'm doing, I mean, it's just everyday life now. My wife hears them, pets hear them. I haven't gone nanners, it's real, sir.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other device I have, a magnetic wave sensor, reads them flowing through the house, in ways that they shouldn't. It's not the TV or normal electrical equipment. It's harassing equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no lying here. It's real. I know, it sounds like some tinfoil hat bullshit, I get it, but it's fucking real. So I must leave the nation.

       You had suggested psychosis, which it is not. I'd rather it be that, then what it is, which is a part of the US government mentally torturing a citizen, because.... why?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it happens in Holland, well, then I'll give up on trying to leave the harassment, and they can click the day away.
      </p>

       It's gone beyond clicks though. Blood records have been doctored, 120mph car chases, guns flashed, lots of bad shit.

       Again, I will state: This is not just in my mind or w/e. It's a sick operation and I am alerting others that if they have the ability to gain influence in the business world, but do not have a strong family backing, to leave the US immediately as what I believe that what I have experienced is a foreshadowing of times to come to other entrepreneurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that I did nothing against the US government. Never. I'm just a guy, honest work too, never scammed a client or anything like that.
      </p>

       I'm sad to see this happening in the US, but it is happening, and it will grow.

       You've created an impressive story in your mind. Stop believing it or it will destroy you. It may have already. If anyone wanted you dead, you'd be dead. It's easier to kill you than to devote time, money, and manpower to trolling some weirdo who thinks he's involved in something bigger than himself. Murder is free and it's easy. Someone has to repair the machine that makes the clicky sounds. That costs money.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're small potatoes dude. There's nothing to gain by making clicky sounds in your head. You have been gripped fully by mental illness... it will drag you straight down into your own personal hell, and all you want to do about it is blame the US Government. Why not aliens?

       I posted comments online asking questions about some US gov. activities... but nothing THAT major, imo. There was also some drug use a while back, but no meth, coke, or heroin, so w/e. I never made any, and never sold.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is beyond monitoring, but they are all over, that's for sure. It sucks big time. I have to escape the nation, escape the United States, how insane is that? I have to leave my wife of 16 years, learn a new language, close down my company... it's pretty horrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that what they are doing to me, is kind of a test, and this "click programming/torture" will be used on a larger scale on Americans in the future.

       Don't give up hope... if you hung in there for 18 months another couple won't be too much... The intelligence agencies are in the middle of a huge coup... FBI 2.0 is cleaning up shop and ousting all the pointless fuckwads all up in the DoD and CIA and NSA...
      </p>

       HR 6393 is coming... and if you can't wait that long... and I'm serious here... go online and apply to the FBI. You get instant protection under the new whistleblower amendment.

       Actually, I probably would like to sell it, though I do not know how to do that, and I'm basically selling debt at this point, though the clients do have good networks.

       Did they use your private communications as blackmail in order to force you to do their will/shilling online? Was it non-cyber activities you were forced to participate in as well?  Did they catch you in an affair to kick it off?

       Not yet, but I don't think I have communications worth blackmailing.
      </p>

       I did find suspicious activity from mail servers I had, they may have been trying to paint me, or the servers, as doing things they shouldn't, email spam to other nations or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been mostly offline harassment, with some online, like they'll join chat rooms on Twitch (I know, fucking dumb), and talk about things going on in my life, or my wife and I love making, stuff like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not cheated. I played with the idea a few times, mainly just a 10 year itch kind of thing, but would never actually do it.

       They have listening devices in my house, they have "clicking" devices in my house, which I've found, and they can watch all of the computer screens.

       They are not happy that I've posted this, judging by the clicks.

       I sometimes notice accounts that have not said anything in months, or weird activity like that, then suddenly spring to life when I comment about this on the web.

       They normally call me "paranoid", or trick me to search things I wish I hadn't searched, like some Russian bullshit or w/e... fuck I just want out of the US at this point.

       It's not much, but please follow me on this:

      <p>
       What they do is put magnetized objects in the wall, and other places.
      </p>
      <p>
       They then have the corners of the walls, the metal that is found in the corners of the construction to "turn on", er their magnetic ability, and this causes these magnetized objects to "click/clack" against the devices they've turned on quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The devices I have found, or the magnetized objects, have been sent to someone else for safe keeping. I have a photo of a rod that was shoved into the wall... but that's not going to prove a lot to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm looking into the wiring of the house to see how it works, this place is wired really strangely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know, I know... magnets and blah blah, it reads like a bunch of BS, but it's real, and slightly clever if the goal is to harm someone psychologically, while also not able to give them proof. I mean, what am I to do, go to the police with a magnetized rod yelling, "SEE!?!?", that's the type of bullshit that they do.

       Why would they do this to you though... if you don't have anything worth using and they aren't asking for anything in return? I don't get what any party would serve to gain from this kind of behavior unless it was just for their own entertainment.

       Answered above, comments on the web questioning some gov. actions in some cases, and possibly drug use... though both were not very... well not to the amount that would warrant all of this bullshit.

       What government actions were you questioning specifically?
      </p>
      <p>
       And the reason why they might not poison you is I hear the people that play these sick kinds of games actually follow a set of rules and that would go against how the "game" is played. Kinda like how people say no one died at Sandy Hook and it looks superfake as a result... when it would be so much easier to have a gunman go apeshit for real. There are rules that must be followed. At least thats what I hear.

       Well, I'm not going ape shit, I just want to leave and be left alone, and live a good life in another nation.

       I questioned some things that happened in Iraq, maybe I was even wrong, and about the heroin epidemic in America.

       I just don't know why you would be targeted... dump the whole fucking Iraq narrative on us and see if they hunt down this whole sub. It can't hurt to share your crazy theory... right or wrong...

       It does sound exhausting, to say the least.  But if your main option is "sneak away to completely foreign country, reset everything I've known in life, abandon loved ones, and hope they don't follow me"...  well...
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like standing up for yourself and not letting them have this form of control over your life is less extreme, and more likely to work, long term.  It's not easy, but does seem easier than the elaborate and expensive escape plan you outlined.
