<p>The reaction is what must happen to keep my wife safe, if I&#39;m in another nation, they won&#39;t harass her, and it&#39;s all we know how to make them stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry this is happening to you, I&#39;m a targeted individual too in Iran (get tortured with DEWs daily, had relationships ruined, gangstalked) I don&#39;t think anywhere is safe although anywhere is probably better than US. I really wish you luck in the future, know you&#39;re not alone.</p>

<p>edit: a lot of people don&#39;t know why they&#39;re targeted, I imagine it has something to do with them actually wanting professional psychopathy to run a portion of society (pays well, keeps cash flowing, keeps psychos busy  and using prisons, big pharma, mental institutions as assets, creating manchurian candidates) they go after lot of people with artistic, scientific or social talent to control their influence on society and sometimes plagiarize their work. On a more spiritual side I heard it&#39;s like creating synchronicities for the dark side, the aim is basically to control. Scary times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you&#39;ve already made up your mind, but have you tried going dark?</p>

<p>Disconnect, and for the rare times you need Internet, have an OS loaded onto a USB key that formats and reinstalls itself on every boot. Mint [Linux] via live USB is great.</p>

<p>I know John McAfee uses multiple smartphones, as in buys a new Samsung every month or so, roots it, uninstalls all bloatware, then deactivates root (for security, user access only), and does this often, &quot;just to fuck with them&quot;.</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a new job. </li>
<li>If in-person harassing continues, then double back often when travelling (find your tail). Read: It&#39;s harder for a sniper to hit a randomly zig zagging target than one that moves in a linear constant motion.</li>
<li>Definitely rent, and move when you feel like they&#39;re tracking you again. You could not own a place if you were a target of intelligence agencies.</li>
<li>Not saying you are, but in case you are, you need to stop getting high. That shit will make you more paranoid, and you will sure as shit not be sharp enough to evade unjustified monitoring.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are ways to &quot;fight back&quot;, but if you&#39;ve already decided to run, then that&#39;s that I suppose. The alternative above is, if you really want to stay with your wife, then her just thinking you&#39;re paranoid is better than you walking out. I am not a shrink, but if you want to leave her for other reasons, and you&#39;re using this as an excuse then you&#39;d need to face that.</p>

<p>Good luck man!</p>

<p>Nope, she doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m paranoid, she knows about what&#39;s going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does sound exhausting, to say the least.  But if your main option is &quot;sneak away to completely foreign country, reset everything I&#39;ve known in life, abandon loved ones, and hope they don&#39;t follow me&quot;...  well...  </p>

<p>It seems like standing up for yourself and not letting them have this form of control over your life is less extreme, and more likely to work, long term.  It&#39;s not easy, but does seem easier than the elaborate and expensive escape plan you outlined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tried standing up for myself, does&#39;t work. I cannot go against evil so strong. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not too expensive, and my quality of life will probably increase a huge amount by the end of it all.</p>

<p>I only have one loved one that I must leave. This is why I&#39;m such a good target, no family, no friends.</p>

<p>The sad fact is that evil people partially run the US now, they cannot be stopped, and will only grow in power, which will allow them to put forth more torture on US citizens.</p>

<p>I highly suggest getting out while you can. What happens when they turn their eyes onto you and/or your loved ones?</p>

<p>Various metal rods in the house, magnetized, home owner has no idea how they got there.... supposedly.... works for the Office of the Interior..</p>

<p>The little shitty &quot;bug finder&quot; tool I purchased goes off all over the house.</p>

<p>The &quot;clicks&quot; go right with what I&#39;m doing, I mean, it&#39;s just everyday life now. My wife hears them, pets hear them. I haven&#39;t gone nanners, it&#39;s real, sir.</p>

<p>The other device I have, a magnetic wave sensor, reads them flowing through the house, in ways that they shouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s not the TV or normal electrical equipment. It&#39;s harassing equipment. </p>

<p>There is no lying here. It&#39;s real. I know, it sounds like some tinfoil hat bullshit, I get it, but it&#39;s fucking real. So I must leave the nation.</p>

<p>If it happens in Holland, well, then I&#39;ll give up on trying to leave the harassment, and they can click the day away.</p>

<p>It&#39;s gone beyond clicks though. Blood records have been doctored, 120mph car chases, guns flashed, lots of bad shit.</p>

<p>Again, I will state: This is not just in my mind or w/e. It&#39;s a sick operation and I am alerting others that if they have the ability to gain influence in the business world, but do not have a strong family backing, to leave the US immediately as what I believe that what I have experienced is a foreshadowing of times to come to other entrepreneurs. </p>

<p>Note that I did nothing against the US government. Never. I&#39;m just a guy, honest work too, never scammed a client or anything like that. </p>

<p>You&#39;re small potatoes dude. There&#39;s nothing to gain by making clicky sounds in your head. You have been gripped fully by mental illness... it will drag you straight down into your own personal hell, and all you want to do about it is blame the US Government. Why not aliens? </p>

<p>I did find suspicious activity from mail servers I had, they may have been trying to paint me, or the servers, as doing things they shouldn&#39;t, email spam to other nations or something.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been mostly offline harassment, with some online, like they&#39;ll join chat rooms on Twitch (I know, fucking dumb), and talk about things going on in my life, or my wife and I love making, stuff like that. </p>

<p>I have not cheated. I played with the idea a few times, mainly just a 10 year itch kind of thing, but would never actually do it.</p>

<p>They have listening devices in my house, they have &quot;clicking&quot; devices in my house, which I&#39;ve found, and they can watch all of the computer screens.</p>

<p>They are not happy that I&#39;ve posted this, judging by the clicks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not much, but please follow me on this:</p>

<p>What they do is put magnetized objects in the wall, and other places. </p>

<p>They then have the corners of the walls, the metal that is found in the corners of the construction to &quot;turn on&quot;, er their magnetic ability, and this causes these magnetized objects to &quot;click/clack&quot; against the devices they&#39;ve turned on quickly.</p>

<p>The devices I have found, or the magnetized objects, have been sent to someone else for safe keeping. I have a photo of a rod that was shoved into the wall... but that&#39;s not going to prove a lot to you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking into the wiring of the house to see how it works, this place is wired really strangely. </p>

<p>I know, I know... magnets and blah blah, it reads like a bunch of BS, but it&#39;s real, and slightly clever if the goal is to harm someone psychologically, while also not able to give them proof. I mean, what am I to do, go to the police with a magnetized rod yelling, &quot;SEE!?!?&quot;, that&#39;s the type of bullshit that they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does sound exhausting, to say the least.  But if your main option is &quot;sneak away to completely foreign country, reset everything I&#39;ve known in life, abandon loved ones, and hope they don&#39;t follow me&quot;...  well...  </p>

<p>It seems like standing up for yourself and not letting them have this form of control over your life is less extreme, and more likely to work, long term.  It&#39;s not easy, but does seem easier than the elaborate and expensive escape plan you outlined.</p>
