<p>A lot has been going on their lately and the reasoning is &quot;climate change&quot;. Here is a lovely theory.</p>

<p>9/11 Which is symbolic through Mohammad.</p>

<p>The Russian orthodox patriarch and the Pope meet for the 1st time in 1000 years.</p>

<p>1 Week after meeting Kirill goes to Antarctica.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/02/18/for-russias-church-leader-a-trip-to-antarctica-is-not-just-a-photo-op/?utm_term=.c26ad7e3f3de">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/02/18/for-russias-church-leader-a-trip-to-antarctica-is-not-just-a-photo-op/?utm_term=.c26ad7e3f3de</a></p>

<p>Right around the election Kerry goes to Antarctica.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/science/antarctica-john-kerry-global-warming.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/science/antarctica-john-kerry-global-warming.html?_r=0</a></p>

<p>John Kerry then goes to New Zealand. Right after he leaves this happens.</p>

<p>Less than a month later New Zealand PM steps down for no apparent reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see, there&#39;s literally proof of alien DNA in humans. 250 or so completely alien base pairs that exist no where else on earth are found in humans. Literally alien DNA. We&#39;ve also got a fused chromasome. Happens nowhere else in nature. And we&#39;ve checked our mitochondrial DNA, basically a string of information that keeps records of your mother&#39;s DNA, and her mother&#39;s DNA and so on, and we&#39;ve found that humans have only been around for 250,000 years. We checked twice actually because that shouldn&#39;t have been the result we got. But we got it twice. The proof is there, but unfortunately you won&#39;t allow yourself to see it. Even reading this now, you&#39;re thinking &quot;that must be wrong, this guy&#39;s full of shit.&quot; That&#39;s what keeps you back. Look it up yourself though.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s the kicker. Everything I just said was common knowledge to the ancient Sumerians. They ended up being correct about a lot of things in our solar system too and had even calculated how many years it takes for a full galactic rotation. They have no business knowing that. They couldn&#39;t have. But they did. And they said &quot;well we didn&#39;t do all this, &quot;those who from the heavens came&quot; told us all of this, and more.&quot; </p>

<p>Read all you can about the Sumerians. Watch Lloyd Pye on YouTube</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rh- blood type people do not share a common ancestor with the rhesus macaque, as you know I&#39;m sure. According to evolution, this means that a split occoured millions of years ago and there are actually two species of humans. When an rh+ man gets an rh- woman pregnant, the woman&#39;s body fights the pregnancy as if it were a parasite. Luckily though, there is a simple injection which fixes this nowadays. Something like 12%-15% of people are rh-. That&#39;s about everything I know about the rh factor! I could only speculate what it might mean from the perspective of aliens creating humans. Perhaps an upgrade? The world&#39;s elite are all rh-, or at least it&#39;s more common among the top 1% of our species than it is among the other 99%. 50% of the 1% are rh-, 15% of the other 99% are rh+. </p>

<p>I have absolutely 0 sources to back this up btw, I may be very wrong! Just what I think. Thanks for asking! What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they took an early hominid, fused it&#39;s DNA so it would be compatible with their own and made a test tube baby. Who knows why. There&#39;s a site in Africa believed to be the birthplace of humans. If you step into this stone circle, whatever GPS device you have goes crazy and gives false readings. There are thousands of other stone circles like this one scattered throughout Africa. Although I think only a few mess up GPS. Would be an interesting place to play pokemon go.

    <div class="md"><p>So I read Antarctica is supposed to be like it would be on mars with colonies. Buzz was pushing mars colonies hard and when he left for Antarctica you can see him and his crew wearing t-shirts saying get your ass to mars. I never understood the quarantine part though. Why quarantine for altitude sickness? Also he had fluid in his lungs. </p>

<p>I never got the planet conspiracy because to some that was already supposed to happen and it keeps getting pushed back date wise. It was also made up if I&#39;m not mistaken by a woman who talks to aliens. </p>

<p>Now pole reversal is a very interesting concept. It has happened before. Pole reversal also kind of goes along with the plaint theory in what will happen. Pole reversal will cause a major shift and huge waves off all of the coastal states. This sounds very possible out of all the conspiracies to me IMO. What&#39;s crazy is someone posted in this sub the other day about water beacons (not sure if this is what they are called lol) have been going off at an alarming rate on the coast of CA which warn of tsunamis. Get even crazier into another post and you&#39;ll see someone keeps posting about weird flights out of CA lately (I don&#39;t think this is truly connected but this is what makes conspiracies fun right?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting seeing mention of an Atlantean civilization here. Graham Hancock hypothesized this in Fingerprints of the Gods, that Atlantis may indeed be beneath the ice in Antarctica, citing the work of Atlantis researchers Rand and Rose Flem-ath. </p>

<p>We now know that our species endured an extinction level event (the Younger Dryas impact and consequent floods, earthquakes, wildfires, etc) roughly 12,800 years ago. And the evidence on the ground that points to a lost, advanced civilization is slowly piling up. </p>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly interesting that the date Plato gives in his Timaeus and Critias texts for the submergence and destruction of Atlantis matches perfectly with the date of the cataclysmic Younger Dryas period, and that the Ancient Egyptian &#39;Edfu building texts&#39; speak of the &#39;Golden age of the Gods&#39; - Gods that weren&#39;t originally Egyptian, but survivors of a sacred island that was destroyed by flood and fire. </p>

<p>&#39;Atlantis&#39; is such a loaded word and any serious discussion of the subject is unfortunately met with ridicule. Years ago I would have shrugged this off as crazy conspiracy theorist shit too but it&#39;s looking more and more plausible as time goes on, and doesn&#39;t require the existence of ancient aliens to explain it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some thing that have been happening in Antarctica which may have been interesting for scientific and political people: Those noctilescent (?) clouds came early, a huge crack opened in a major ice shelf which could apparently calve off an iceberg the size of Delaware, and elderly men are still susceptible to altitude sickness at 8000&#39; or whatever the continent&#39;s average elevation is. </p>

<p>Here are thing which are not happening: Atlantis, Nazis, Stargates, an entrance to the hollow Earth, and &quot;you idiot there is no southern polar continent it&#39;s a huge fuckoff wall of ice like in game of thrones but it encircles the entire flat Earth!&quot;</p>
