Sorry for rambling, my point is when you see someone call someone else a shill, check for yourself because some people just throw around the &quot;I just checked your history and your a shill&quot; to discredit anyone they don&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>Thank you. On that note, I want to point out that u/factbasedorGTFO constantly makes the claim that paid shills are in themselves a conspiracy theory and completely nonexistent, and it is fucking hilarious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can i just say without being labeled whatever:</p>

<p>Everyone, regardless of their opinion on the issue, is allowed to post on this sub. Just because they don&#39;t agree with you does not mean they are a shill. Sometimes people just disagree. Now I can&#39;t speak for whomever it is you&#39;re talking about, I&#39;m just speaking in a general sense.</p>

<p>One thing pizzagate supporters should be doing is welcoming any and all criticism because it allows you to teach others if you&#39;re right about something or learn from others if you&#39;re wrong. If you silence all opposition to your &#39;investigation&#39;, pizzagate has the capability to form a very strong group think and polarization. From that, the movement can begin to cause more harm than it intends to (I hope it&#39;s a genuine movement, not a fabricated one). The movement can end up accusing the wrong people, ruining lives, maybe even cause a real shooting (yes, I can agree that &#39;shooting&#39; is suspicious, we just disagree on why) that ends up taking innocent lives. These things can happen when a massive group of people form such strong beliefs and goals that go unchecked.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it a bunch of times in the past week: I&#39;ve been here for over 4 years, but I&#39;ve never encountered such vitriole like I have during this. Am I a shill? Would a shill want justice and/or to know the truth about 9/11, Boston, Sandy hook, aurora, the Clinton foundation, the wars in the middle east, jfk, MH370 and 13, Ukraine, and lots more? Those are all conspiracy theories in which you can go all the way back in my 4+ years of being a redditor and find that I don&#39;t take a shill&#39;s stance on. Do I push back against flat earth, hollow earth, growing earth, pizzagate, lizard people, and others? Yes I do, because I don&#39;t believe the evidence presented is substantial enough to accept those claims. It is not on me to disprove those claims, it is on the person(s) presenting the claim to prove it.</p>

<p>Idk, I&#39;m ranting at this point. But yeah, I&#39;m pissed off that a sub I was able to come to for discussion and often debate of esoteric topics has become a soapbox for the pizzagate movement. Anyone who does not agree with the theory is being pushed out with much animosity. I mean, we&#39;re told to either stay out of those threads (even thought over 80% of the posts are pizzagate) or told to leave the sub in its entirety. It&#39;s pretty damn frustrating.</p>

<p>Ok I&#39;m done ranting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, people are allowed to be for or against any topic of their choosing. However this statement seems to be the conplete opposite of some of the users I&#39;ve encountered here who are devoting nearly all their posts to nay saying. </p>

<p>It&#39;s those users whom I find suspicious. I&#39;m perfectly ok with people disagreeing with pizzagate, and not believing it is true, but if they don&#39;t believe it&#39;s true, why do they feel the need to spend so much time and energy debating a subject they do not believe in? I speak from human experience, as for a very long time I myself did not believe pizzagate was true. I was highly skeptical for a long while. If it wasn&#39;t for the media continuing to cover it I wouldn&#39;t have had any interest. About a week before the man armed with a gun went to Comet Pizza, I gave in and started looking at what facts were for and against it and I used my own judgement to conclude whether this was just something that got out of hand, or if it was something that someone wanted very much to keep quiet. If it was something that had simply gotten out of hand, the media would have done one, maybe two reports on it, and left it at that. Instead, like the many naysayers with a one track posting history, they constantly threw terms like fake news in our face. The thing is these facts were never displayed as news until the MSM started covering it, it was nothing more than speculation. The other thing is pizzagate has been getting more unbiased coverage in Europe. </p>
