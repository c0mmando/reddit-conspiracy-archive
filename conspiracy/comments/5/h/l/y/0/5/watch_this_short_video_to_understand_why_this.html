<p>The plan to attack Syria was planned over 10 years ago, it has absolutely nothing to do with &quot;Assad is a bad guy&quot; propaganda we&#39;re hearing now. As you can see in the video there were also 6 other countries that were planned to be destroyed as well (which ISIS who we fund has taken care of for us). The plan was going along smoothly with the US arming ISIS to take out Libya and other countries but they ran into a major hurdle with Russia stepping into Syria to stop the US from destroying the entire middle east. That is where this &quot;Red Scare&quot; has come from, remember Obama in 2012 saying &quot;The cold war is over&quot; to Romney? What changed since then?</p>

<p>And to anyone that was against Bush and Iraq but are openly attacking Russia only because they&#39;re stopping us from destroying another country. You are a 100% hypocrite, you should be denouncing the savior Obama and what he&#39;s doing in the middle east.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on, you should know that the Ukraine situation isn&#39;t that cut and dry. Both sides (the West and Russia) are interfering in Ukraine&#39;s internal affairs. The country was already divided into a pro-Russia eastern Ukraine and anti-Russia western Ukraine well before 2014, and foreign powers are trying to capitalize on this division for their own selfish desires. There are no heroes in this conflict as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were planning this for years and years. They&#39;re actually never leaving Afghanistan nor will they leave the middle-east. But its kinda nice to see that it took more than 10(not 5) years for them to even reach Syria. This shows you that they are just people and very much capable of doing mistakes. Technology doesn&#39;t make you immortal. </p>
