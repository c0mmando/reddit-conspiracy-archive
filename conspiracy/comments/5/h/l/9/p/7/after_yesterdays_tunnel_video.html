       I feel pretty strongly about this so let me get right to the point. Please, I'm begging all of you, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DO WHAT THESE GUYS DID. It's dangerous, probably illegal and will more than likely get you killed/detained by law enforcement. This will only add fuel to the fire and it potentially could lead to serious consequences for everyone here. If this sub becomes a hotbed of this kind of activity, the reddit admins will shit this sub down like they did with
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       . This goes a step beyond doxxing and it becomes harassment and trespassing. I cannot in good faith watch this happen here and stay silent about it. For the love of god, please keep yourselves safe and out of trouble. We debated heavily about the merits of removing the post, but we ultimately decided against it because it goes against what we stand for as mods here. But I do not encourage these kinds of videos. I hope that you guys take this a seriously as I feel about it. Our future, all of our futures, depend on what we do right now. Don't mess it up for everyone by breaking the law or harassing/stalking anyone. Stay safe everyone.

       I read your title as "tunnel vision". I think it fits just as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of harassing businesses I'd suggest people start familiarizing themselves with the full history of the global conspiracy pizzagate is part of. It's just a tip of a monstrous iceberg that's been out in the open for centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       With a bit of background information they may be more likely to find the links between Jerry Sandusky, the British Royal family, the Korean human trafficking ring, child welfare organisations, and international aid organisations. I'm sure the Vatican fits in there somewhere as well.

       Those who do so are risking their lifes or are shills who try to discredit us anyway.

       Posts that expose us as a terrorist front should be discouraged and/or deleted on sight.

       We are NOT a terrorist or internet warrior front.

       Posting names of victims IS fighting with fists.

       Plus when the big purge comes your internet records will expose you as whatever you are and you will be caught by the secret police and get purged.

       Yes exactly my point. The other mods were not thrilled with removing the post based on our anti-censorship policy. However I feel that this video violates the rules about stalking/harassment, but instead of here they are doing it IRL! That is even worse in my opinion. Maybe that rule needs a bit of revision to prevent this kind of thing from happening again.

       It is a tricky situation, but at least we're having a discussion about it (which shows the topic itself isn't being censored). It's better for people to go somewhere like VOAT to view the video, rather than risk having this sub shut down over it. Luckily it appears the video was shit anyway, so it's kind of a moot point

       I would rather if people were to do something like this that it should not be posted here. I don't advocate anyone doing this at all, but if you must, don't post it here. Post it on Voat and link that shit. If the admins don't like it we can adjust rather than having the sub endangered.

       You know why that is possible?  Because we don't pick and choose what subjects people are allowed to post.  We moderate solely on the behavior conditions set within our rules.  The moment you break away from that tradition for the sake of the children or the protect the sub from danger, then you immediately alter the utility of the subreddit itself.

       The sub isn't getting shut down because of the tunnel video.  The tunnel video wasn't doxxing anyone or breaking ToS.

       All the pizza gate stuff that is posted on here I saw on 4chan first, there's barely anything new being discovered, the things I've learnt here are about other topics. This sub is getting bogged down with clickbait pizzagate threads and threads titled in a way to purely rev people up about the topic, with no real point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do support pizza gate stuff being posted here, but I think that the mods should perhaps get rid of some of the repeat/nonsense threads to clean the subreddit up a bit, otherwise it'll just become a different version of the_donald, where there were 10+ posts about the same tweet, or same news article, and threads/pictures that didn't mean anything were getting upvoted so much that the important things get lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I had a look at the front page now and it looks a lot better than it has for the last week or so, so hopefully people aren't just upvoting blindly anymore.

       This is a delusional point of self-importance. If and when they kill switch the internet, pretty much everyone will be soon dying of bio - terrorism or some kind of weapon/disaster. They will have to take out the masses, Boston was a staged event to see if and how social media effected a lockdown.

       This Pizzagate shit has gotten outta control. I'm glad a mod said something, but this is just feeding the new subscribers, which in my opinion, has driven down the content and discussion of this sub. I'm not alone in this opinion.

       Pretty obvious even without linking to their channel. The video was them walking about with some snippets of furniture and stuff. No where did it show them going in one end and coming out the other. Honestly if any other videos are posted like that I'd understand if its removed, shills/trolls might make more things like that that could be construed as irl harassment and fuck this sub up.

       I honestly doubt comet would be dumb enough to continue their operation while the spotlight is on them. Schmoozing with the staff is fine and all but I doubt any information can be gained from it, unless a staff member isn't in on it and knows an important detail without realizing it.

       That's hard to do. The babies have tracking bracelets that if cut sound the alarm. If they try and leave the unit it stops the elevators, locks doors and scrambles security. The bands have a unique ID that's scanned when medication or tests are done.
      </p>
      <p>
       No nurse would let a baby leave the unit for any reason. I find this all highly suspect.

       Not attacking anyone. I just think what happened should not have been posted here. I didn't think it was appropriate because of extenuating circumstances.We should not encourage this kind of behavior by posting it here and upvoting in droves without actually watching the whole video.

       I understand that we should never encourage this kind of stuff, and indeed I agree that to do such things as these guys did is unsafe and unwise. But I also agree that if someone's out there doing it and posting videos we should not be trying to remove the videos or make them stop talking about their experiences. This shit is happening one way or the other and it is our role and our job to digest it.

       If you haven't noticed, Reddit has come down with a case of the censorship bug. It's probably better to err on the side of caution so that this sub doesn't get the axe by Spez. At least we can still discuss the existence of the video, and you can go to Voat if you want to actually watch it. It's not ideal, but it's the reality we're faced with

       We should start a post and by posting saying something like we all agree not to go near Comet pizza or any other named businesses involved in conspiracies, or engage in any crimes.  Research and talking about is is NOT a crime.  If they passed legislation to outlaw sppech, it's invalid becasue it's unconstitutional.  Constitution has to be superceded by amendments, last I heard. Oh also and the constitituon is invalid anyway because of the COG being active--so there are no laws.  Keep that in mind.  Still you don't want them to harass you because they have money, technology and the numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something as simple as an 'aye' in the comments, we are consenting to a social contract that no one here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       will go anywhere near comet pizza or any of these places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just so that we have a kind of agreement that it's someone else doing this, and not us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's stupid to go anywhere near there after this--they'd have your face on camera, so they can recognize you.  And if you really believe in this grand conspiracy, then you're putting your whole family, neighbors and community at great risk of stalking and possibly murdering everyone you know.
