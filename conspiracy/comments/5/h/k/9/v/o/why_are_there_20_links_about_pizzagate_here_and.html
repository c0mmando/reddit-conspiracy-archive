    <div class="md"><p>I think the biggest conspiracies of all time should be reserved for killing and pedophillia. Foreign Politics influencing national politics is nothing new. In the1770&#39;s France propagandize revolting against the red coats, USA does it all the time- tried to overthrow Castro many times, Venezurla, practical all of the middle east.</p>

<p>Not a hit on religion (Im spiritual) rather the corruption that lies with in.</p>

<p>Biggest conspiracy out there would be Jesuits. They are 1 head hydra head of the giant illiminati -Responsible for millions of deaths. Catholic church has paid over 100,000,000 in court settlements and losses because thier priests are pedo&#39;s. Jesuits have infiltrated the CIA (George Bush SR was in CIA during JFK assassination era)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason so many people here aren&#39;t talking about it is because the mainstream media has been too quick in painting the Wikileaks emails as some vast Russian conspiracy, completely ignoring the actual content of the emails. </p>

<p>Of course Russia had some influence in the election, and I&#39;m sure China did to a degree as well, why wouldn&#39;t you if you were a major power and the US had been doing the same kind of meddling in your affairs? But aside from speculation that Wikileaks got their emails from Russia, it&#39;s just the mainstream media crying wolf, similar to the whole &quot;fake news&quot; situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typically robberies result in emptied pockets. Rich has both his wallet, and his keys. So let us leave the whole &quot;robbery&quot; term out, because this wasn&#39;t a robbery, or an attempted robbery.</p>

<p>Lots of people walk through that hood, and don&#39;t get randomly murdered. The two shots, from a 9mm, that killed Rich were landed perfectly. Not sure if you shoot a lot, but to draw down and murder a moving target with a 9mm, is quite a feat. The report shows that there was indeed a &quot;struggle,&quot; but there&#39;s not a whole lot of evidence. The precision leads me to believe that this isn&#39;t just another gangbanger shooting. Gangsters don&#39;t frequently qualify, with their weapons; they typically empty entire magazines. The double tap shows training and control. This was an executed mission, not a random game of kill the white boy.</p>

<p>The nearly 50k in reward money turns gangsters into snitches real quick. But not a peep.</p>

<p>It would be negligent to dismiss the DNC leaks and the Seth Rich murder as coincidence. Using your brain doesn&#39;t mean fake news.</p>

Just a couple weeks ago (at 8pm) my neighbor called to let me know not to walk my dog because a guy had been threatened with a gun and the gunman was on the run. So yeah, not that unrealistic that some drunk guy was shot at 4:30 in morning.   </p>

<p>Also, as an interesting side note, there are a bunch of flyers around here offering $125,000 reward for information on the murder.  </p>

You give an example of CIA officials SAYING/CLAIMING stuff with NO PROOF AT ALL.
Against.
Pizzagate where they have documents, emails, photos as evidence of the high ranking officers and gov people pedos involved in it.</p>

<p>So your resoning is you will believe some dudes with a badge appointed to the job by the same people who are guilty.
It&#39;s obvious that they all will cover their asses and media will spread diversion news to fool the masses.</p>

<p>With pizzagate (and don&#39;t focus on the name too much because you&#39;re missing the point) you have hard evidence and you are willing to overlook that because it doesn&#39;t come from official source...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typically robberies result in emptied pockets. Rich has both his wallet, and his keys. So let us leave the whole &quot;robbery&quot; term out, because this wasn&#39;t a robbery, or an attempted robbery.</p>

<p>Lots of people walk through that hood, and don&#39;t get randomly murdered. The two shots, from a 9mm, that killed Rich were landed perfectly. Not sure if you shoot a lot, but to draw down and murder a moving target with a 9mm, is quite a feat. The report shows that there was indeed a &quot;struggle,&quot; but there&#39;s not a whole lot of evidence. The precision leads me to believe that this isn&#39;t just another gangbanger shooting. Gangsters don&#39;t frequently qualify, with their weapons; they typically empty entire magazines. The double tap shows training and control. This was an executed mission, not a random game of kill the white boy.</p>

<p>The nearly 50k in reward money turns gangsters into snitches real quick. But not a peep.</p>

<p>It would be negligent to dismiss the DNC leaks and the Seth Rich murder as coincidence. Using your brain doesn&#39;t mean fake news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live about 4 blocks from where he was shot. Just a couple weeks ago (at 8pm) my neighbor called to let me know not to walk my dog because a guy had been threatened with a gun and the gunman was on the run. So yeah, not that unrealistic that some drunk guy was shot at 4:30 in morning.   </p>

<p>Also, as an interesting side note, there are a bunch of flyers around here offering $125,000 reward for information on the murder.  </p>
