       My Google newsfeed was full of Russia sways the election stories this morning, dozens of articles from all of the MSM sources. Russia seems to be the go-to line to distract from events that do not fit the narrative of the corrupt elite.  Is pizzagate gaining to much traction?

       Whole thing feels bizarre. The 9/11 conspiracy theories are that our own government murdered a ton of people in a terrorist attack against its own citizens to justify war that would kill tons more people, and the MSM didn't/doesn't give two shits about that compared to a conspiracy theory that Podesta might be a child predator / covering for child predators. And there are way more people that believe 9/11 was inside job than there are people who believe there is child trafficking going on in the U.S. government. People suspicious over the wikileaks emails and it's like some fkin red alert, gotta start a multi-nation effort to scream "fake news", call it Russian propaganda, get the Pope to weigh in. Fkin twilight zone.

       I am thankful for this sub, I know I am not the only one feeling like something is going on that no one else can see.  So many people live in their own little bubble and if it doesn't affect them directly then it is quickly dismissed.  Unfortunately, if something is going on with all of this, by the time people realize it is affecting them it will be too late I fear.

       And they're saying Obama administration and the Senate knew about Russia's efforts to sway the election since September, but Obama didn't come out publicly with it for fear of looking "too partisan." Load of fucking bs. If they knew Russian propaganda was going to sway the election would fear of looking partisan stop the DNC and the media by proxy from going apeshit about it at that time? No, instead, they wait til now, more than a month after the election, to make a huge push to stop "Russian Propaganda" through the MSM.

       I agree with you. I'm sure Russia is plenty busy with their own agenda that aren't bullying the US elections. Or were I should say as the election is over. The world is a scary fucking place, but we will not be scared into silence.

       Yeah they very much do. It has been a plan for 26 years basically. Did you guys read the foundation of ISIS thing (someone had summarised all the wikileaks) Here it is, explains more about why they want that Russian war:
      </p>
      <p>
       The EU currently gets over half its Oil &amp; Gas piped from Russia, which is abundant in it. This gives Russia a lot of leverage over the EU. Merkel &amp; the other Globalist European politicians despise this, because they cannot truly threaten let alone go to war with Russia while Putin holds so much power over European energy sources. If direct conflict broke out, Putin could cut off oil &amp; gas supplies to millions of Europeans which would be catastrophic for the EU. In response to this the EU along with its allies in the U.S. &amp; Arab States have been making a lot of plays in an attempt to free the EU from Russian leverage. (remember as the emails have shown this is a global economic &amp; financial network of people colluding with each other) The U.S. Cannot go to war without the support of the EU The EU cannot go to war while Russia has leverage over them. As for The Arabs (specifically the Gulf Cooperation Council) they own the only oil &amp; gas field capable of replacing the Russian supplies, which is situated in the Persian Gulf - AND is part owned by Iran. There are only 2 viable routes to move the material. The original plan was to run a pipeline through Afghanistan, however the Taliban Tribals refused American access - so we invaded. The Taliban put up a tougher fight than expected and we failed to get control of the vital regions. As public support diminished we were forced to pull out. So in early 2011 we approached the 2nd option - a pipeline through Syria. However Assad being allied with Russia, and knowing how Russia values the EU as a customer, Assad refused the deal. Two months later ISIS entered Syria from Jordan and began the civil war to overthrow Assad. (As we know this was funded by the Arabs) The U.S. &amp; E.U used this as an excuse to enter the conflict from a distance, but actively failed to target ISIS assets because doing so would hinder their own plans. Russia - who's biggest fear is Islam (due to the history in the Caucasus) were left with the only strategically logical decision to send troops to support Assad and to enter the Crimea and create a strong foothold in the centre of the region. The U.S. tried to stop this by engineering the Crimean incident into a conflict, but we ultimately failed and Russia took control. The Turkish Government, understanding that either Pipeline would have to run through Turkey have used this for years to push entry into the EU (which has now ultimately fallen through) because they knew they would receive an enormous economic &amp; political leverage if the deal worked. That's why they have been hostile to Russian activities in the area - to prevent Russia from stopping the deal going through. It's also why they have been massacring the Kurds (also partly ethnic reasons) so that ISIS doesn't fall to Russia &amp; allow Assad to retake control thus stopping the deal. The reason this all started is because in 1990, Iraq had the brilliant idea of invading Kuwait. Upon hearing word of the pipeline plans the Saddams decided they wanted control over Kuwaits stake in the oil &amp; gas field, this was the moment they became a problem where previously they had been very friendly with the Bushes and Clinton's. Kuwait being a vital part of the Gulf Cooperation Council this whole deal of replacing European energy dependence couldn't have gone through without them. Perhaps it could have all gone smoothly had Iraq not invaded Kuwait, but it didn't. The U.S had no choice but to launch Operation Desert Storm and retake Kuwait. This was the kindling that lit the bonfire we have been fanning the flames of for the past 26 years. This deal is the key to Europe being able to form a EU wide military &amp; back the U.S. into a war with Russia. Hillary for president was the next chess move in the 'powers that be's strategy to enact this plan. *Some people theorise that part of the deal with the Arab States is allowing free Muslim migration in return for access to the oil fields, the Sheikhs are Muslim and of course want to spread their culture - hence the manufactured flooding of Islamic migrants into Europe &amp; the U.S. * I have no evidence to back this particular migration claim up, so I do not state is as a fact. The rest of this post however is undeniably proven, I emplore you to research if you find yourself sceptical. Also remember Iran owns part of the oil field, that is why the MSM has been ramping up hostilities towards Iran for the past few years. They knew that if their plan goes ahead eventually we will have to invade Iran and secure their part of the oilfield. It's pre-emptive propaganda to ensure Iran is instilled as an enemy in the minds of the populace whenever the time comes to invade. Trump threw a massive cog in the works of this entire arrangement and that's one of the many reasons there has been such an enormous backlash from the establishment against him. But he is also the biggest chance we have of avoiding another Cold War or perhaps even World War 3. This election is about FAR more than Hillary vs Trump or Moral vs Corrupt. The whole network of conspiracy, corruption &amp; collusion that members of this movement have been uncovering is behind all of this. It goes far greater than many of you believe, and than some of you can imagine.

       I think it's more of a ploy to take away personal opinion and homegrown journalism, personally. If it does have anything to do with pizzagate it's probably coincidental. They were screaming "Russians!" Before that theory ever popped up. Check out section 501 of this bill. Creepy stuff.

       Yeah I've seen it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really even know how this whole situation could be resolved at this point. I imagine even ethical-minded people in law enforcement don't want to do an investigation at this point just to calm people down, because that would set a precedent as far as "make a bunch if noise and you can make law enforcement investigate anything" which wouldn't be a good thing. But the government is so fkin corrupt that most don't trust it to hold itself accountable, either. I do wonder how much of just the general public anger and mistrust towards the corrupt government in general is getting funneled into pizzagate. No idea but I wonder. Without freedom of speech, freedom in general will go down the drain real damn fast, but obviously people can hurt businesses with enough hype, like all the full-potatoes who started accusing on social media, business reviews, etc without waiting until they knew for sure based on proof.

       It's just a huge fkin mess. Even trying to figure out who to ultimately blame turns into some philosophical debate, as far as whether it is the fault of the government or the fault of the citizens, when a government goes corrupt.

       I think it's because Russia can't "hack and throw an election".
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, Russia could potentially do many things to try and sway the result. But actually "hacking the election" (the voting machines) seems unrealistic. I think having physical access to the machines is needed for that.

       You are correct. The machines are not connected to the Internet so therefore they can not be hacked into without being physically present.

       And as I recall, they're all on different systems (networks? Idk I'm not smart at computers) from state to state. They would have to hack each state individually, although only a few states would be necessary to throw the election.

       The story isn't and never was that they hacked the election. The story originally was that they intended to influence it, and the story is now that they flat out wanted to help elect Trump. You don't need to hack voting machines to do that, just look at how out-of-control the pizzagate nonsense has gotten. Voter fraud is such a ridiculous assertion when we'll-crafted lies can more easily and effectively sway votes.

       It's simpleton shit.  Like who cares what Russia may or may not be doing when the content of what was in those emails and the ongoing ramifications of the content of those emails is what we are focusing on.  I think you'll find most people don't give a fuck about sources saying Russia did this or Russia did that.  It's all the MSM was talking about during the election and it fell flat then as well.  It's just silly

       The problem is this. It looks like Russia directly wanted Trump elected. Now ask the question, why? Do you think it's in your best interests? And also, engaging in subterfuge to influence our election could be considered an act of war. Should we just roll over and let it go because Hillary bad? That seems like the exact kind of kowtowing to Russian influence that would give Putin a semi.

       I don't think its about distracting from Pizzagate, it's more an attempt to try and re-frame the political discussion. Russia is just their go-to scapegoat for anything, because it still invokes some sort of weird Cold War tension in a lot of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reality is, they lost in part because voters learned about widespread corruption in the DNC and democratic party, and rather than hold their own accountable for that corruption, they're on a witch hunt to try and punish whoever helped reveal that truth. Not because they want "justice", but because they want to make sure it doesn't happen the next time they try to steal an election.

       I honestly think Russian psy ops is at work on Reddit. Always look into the background of people posting. I've seen a couple suspicious posters who only ever seem try to deflect the allegations against Russia in ESL English. This is 100% Russian MO. If you thought the millions used by CTR was bad, imagine the wealth of RUSSIA being used!

       When you see what putin is doing in Syria with this butcher of assad, not even trying to destroy ISIS but instead rebels and civilians, while in the mean time making more friends with Saudi Arabia,  plus all the recent events in Aleppo, etc etc you can only wonder what going on with those crazy people. Personaly, with the leadership they seem to have now in Russia I would not be surprised at all that they tried to compromise to US election or anything worste.
