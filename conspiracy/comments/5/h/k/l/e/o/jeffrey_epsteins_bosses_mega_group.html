        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Jeffrey Epstein was basically a nobody until Victoria&#39;s Secret founder Leslie Wexner gave him tens of millions of dollars, the largest private residence in Manhattan, and all the other luxuries required to seduce politicians and the powerful into ... making stupid decisions.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s take a closer look at Wexner and what he gets up to. </p>

<p>From an article 12 days before 9/11:</p>

<p>&quot;Under the innocent headline, &quot;Titans of Industry Join Forces To Work for Jewish Philanthropy,&quot; Wall Street Journal staff reporter Lisa Miller reported on an April 1998 gathering of some 20 Jewish billionaires, at the Manhattan apartment of hedge-fund manager Michael Steinhardt. That gathering involved some of the most powerful names in the Jewish lobby in America, starting with Edgar Bronfman, the chairman of the World Jewish Congress. Others included: Charles Bronfman, Edgar&#39;s brother and a top executive of the family&#39;s flagship Seagrams Corp.; Leslie Wexner of Limited, Inc.; Charles Schusterman, chairman of Samson Investment Co. of Tulsa, Oklahoma; Harvey &quot;Bud&quot; Meyerhoff, a fabulously wealthy and powerful Baltimore real estate magnate; Laurence Tisch, chairman of Loews Corp.; Max Fisher, the Detroit oil magnate and Republican Party powerhouse; bagel magnate Max Lender; and Leonard Abramson, the founder of U.S. Healthcare.</p>

<p>According to the Journal account, the Mega Group was founded in 1991 by Wexner and Charles Bronfman, to add greater clout to the Israeli lobby, by establishing an informal, but all-powerful policymaking group, able to deploy billions of dollars in &quot;charitable&quot; funds for the maximum effect on U.S. policy toward Israel, the Mideast, and other issues of paramount importance to the Jewish megabillionaires. The Mega Group convenes twice a year, for two-day sessions, where, behind closed doors, the members make life-and-death decisions, affecting U.S. policy. Membership is by invitation only; the meetings are secret (the Wall Street Journal story was the only coverage to ever appear in the U.S. media about the existence of the Mega Group, before the publication of this EIR account); and the members each kick in $30,000 in annual dues, to cover &quot;operating expenses&quot; for the twice-yearly sessions.</p>

<p>Charles Bronfman reflected the Mega Group&#39;s propensity for secrecy, when he told the Journal&#39;s Lisa Miller, &quot;From the beginning we didn&#39;t want to be seen as a threat to anybody. And that still pertains. We don&#39;t want to be seen as the Sanhedrin,&quot; a reference to the highest court of the ancient Jews. &quot;We don&#39;t want to be looked at crooked.&quot; Charles&#39; far more sinister and slick brother, Edgar, tried to dismiss the activities of the Mega Group, telling Miller, &quot;We want to make it cool to be Jewish.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Israeli Spies: &#39;Mega Was Not
an Agent; Mega Was the Boss&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;For a brief period of time in early 1997, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Security Agency engaged in a frantic mole hunt for an Israeli spy, believed to be operating inside the highest levels of the Clinton Administration national security establishment. By the time the mole hunt was made public--in a May 7, 1997 Washington Post leak--the hunt had been abruptly ended, and for all intents and purposes, the story disappeared from the news within a matter of days.</p>

<p>&quot;According to the Post account, in January 1997, the National Security Agency (NSA) had intercepted a phone conversation between an Israeli official at the embassy in Washington, and Danny Yatom, the head of the Mossad, Israel&#39;s foreign intelligence service. The official sought permission from the spy boss to &quot;go to Mega&quot; in order to obtain a copy of a confidential letter that had been sent by then-U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, concerning U.S. assurances about a recently negotiated agreement for an Israeli military withdrawal from the Hebron area in the West Bank. Yatom, according to the NSA intercept, rejected the request, admonishing his agent, &quot;This is not something we use Mega for.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Who&#39;s Who in Mega</p>

<p>&quot;Leslie Wexner: This co-founder of Mega is closely aligned with some of the top British-American-Commonwealth institutions. However, Wexner&#39;s main business is The Limited, Inc.—a holding company for such firms as Intimate Brands, Victoria&#39;s Secret, and Bath &amp; Body Works—which he founded in 1963.</p>

<p>Wexner is a board member of Conrad Black&#39;s Hollinger International, Inc. and of Hollinger International Publishing Inc. Lady Margaret Thatcher is chairman of Hollinger&#39;s International Advisory Board, which also includes Henry Kissinger, William F. Buckley, and Richard Perle. Hollinger owns the leading Israeli English-language daily, the Jerusalem Post, which has become a mouthpiece for Sharon and the radical right.</p>

<p>Wexner is also on the board of the Aspen Institute, an important Anglo-American world federalist think-tank.&quot;

<p>(Recall that the Aspen Institute is where Jeb Bush, Dick Cheney, Scooter Libby, Ash Carter, NY Times &quot;journalist&quot; Judith Miller, Condi Rice, Philip Zelikow, and several other 9/11 suspects gathered before 9/11.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary basically handed Libya over to the Bronfmans/Mega. She appointed the Canadian Sara Bronfman as head of the US-Libya Chamber of Commerce. They even tried to make Sara&#39;s husband into the president of Libya.</p>

<p>&quot;Sara Bronfman, humanitarian and human rights activist (born 1976) is the daughter of the billionaire philanthropist and former Seagram chairman, Edgar Bronfman Sr&quot;</p>

<p>Work in Libya[edit]
Sara Bronfman first became involved in aiding Libya after traveling as a delegate with the The Independent Libya Foundation (ILF) in November 2011, during the Arab Spring and after the death of Muammar Gaddafi. The delegation was headed by ILF president and founder Basit Iglet and consisted of multiple humanitarian experts, including Adam Hock and Joseph Hagin. They toured Post-Gaddafi Libya and presented their &quot;multi-phase re-integration program,&quot; which was accepted by the local authorities of Benghazi, who were appointed by the Libyan National Transitional Council.
She has been involved with the U.S.-Libya Chamber of Commerce since its founding in November 2011 with the purpose of developing viable economic links between American and Libyan enterprises. The USLCC announced that Sara (who was a current member on the board) would be the new president after the conclusion of a vote conducted by the organizations board members on February 20, 2012.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is Sara Bronfman&#39;s husband, front man for the Bronfmans/Mega. Basically Bronfman family coordinated the coup in Libya:</p>

<p>&quot;In March 2011, he hosted General Abdul Fatah Younis, former Interior Minister of Libya (under the Gaddafi government), turned leader of the rebel armed forces in the EU capital.[4] Igtet facilitated dialogue between Younis and NATO during a critical time for the rebel movement which ultimately saw the NATO led 2011 military intervention in Libya to defend the Libyan people from Gaddafi forces.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Currently in his latest projects, Athal Energy which is an independent Libyan oil and gas company established by him in 2011. Basit Iget is the chairman of the company and the company focuses on infrastructure projects and development and exploration of existing oil fields in Libya.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your work on this. Epstein always had too much power, i guess this is why. It&#39;s disturbing to think Israel is as bad as the evils they claim to be fighting, all the while claiming massive persecution. Such a twisting narrative.</p>
