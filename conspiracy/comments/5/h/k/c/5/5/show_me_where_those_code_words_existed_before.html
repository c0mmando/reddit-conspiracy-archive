        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://victuruslibertas.com/2016/11/podestas-child-pedophilia-sauces/">Here is the Podesta-era slang explanations</a>.  There have been many people in this sub and abroad making comments such as &quot;these are common words.  you guys are idiots&quot;.  They don&#39;t understand <em>context</em>, and they don&#39;t believe this slang existed outside of Podesta&#39;s emails.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dominos = Domination / BDSM</li>
<li>Pasta = little boy</li>
<li>Cheese = little girl</li>
<li>Hotdog = young boy</li>
<li>Pizza = young girl</li>
<li>Map = minor attracted person or semen</li>
<li>Walnut = African American or African</li>
</ul>

<p>And quite frankly, it&#39;s easy to prove they are right if you use google the wrong way: a standard search like &#39;pedo language pizza&#39;.  It&#39;s going to give you a pro-pedo / pedonormalizing filter bubble where all it will return you is pizzagate.  It&#39;s easy to get lost.  Espeically if you are like 99.93% of people who aren&#39;t pedophiles and know nothing about this subculture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not even the &quot;Chicken Lover&quot; episode of South Park?  Seems unlikely, as millions of people watched that episode many times.  That was in the early days of South Park, one of the first 3 seasons I believe.</p>

<p>Not implicating Matt and Trey in today&#39;s scandals, but that term was about an adult who had sex with chickens in efforts to help Officer Barbrady develop literacy.  Wonder if they had heard the term before, or if they simply came up with it as a joke.  </p>

The usage was publicized by members of the controversial group NAMBLA in the 1994 documentary film Chicken Hawk: Men Who Love Boys,[6][7] although Time magazine reported it in this sense in 1975.[3]&quot;</p>

<p>People convicted of pedophilia - notably in the Vatican and sports clubs - will call boys of twelve and younger &quot;young men&quot;. The age of maturity is debatable in many cultures. That&#39;s all I&#39;m looking at here. Sorry if that confused you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you caught the sarcasm in the post about my feelings above. </p>

<p>I have googled these terms. The term chickenlover does not appear in association with pedophilia. Chicken certainly does in some contexts, but it refers to a young boy. Notice that in the accompanying instagram post, the father is holding a young girl, not a young boy.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the time, chicken means chicken. If you search instagram, there are hundreds of references to &quot;chicken lover&quot;, all of them referring to literal chickens. You can tell because their profile photos are often of actual chickens and they are discussing chicken care and chicken coops. </p>

<p>The preponderance of evidence in this case indicates that in the instagram post in question, they are very likely talking about literal chickens. The burden of proof lies on the pizzagate accusers to prove otherwise. If you make an extraordinary claim, you must produce sufficient evidence. None has been provided to suggest that the father hugging his young daughter is involved in pedophilia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>both.  The gay community apparently has looser boundaries on where that linguistic distinction is, so they roll them together into &#39;boi&#39; with an &#39;i&#39;; get it?  Change the language, change the game.</p>

<p>that&#39;s what xe said!</p>

<p>The gay community also uses the term &#39;spartacus&#39; as a kind of &#39;ideal&#39;.  I&#39;m still trying to piece this together linguo-historically.  I believe it goes back to ancient greece where the relationship of men to boys was more fluid an pederasty was much more widely accepted in that culture.  Also sparta was a warrior based (militant / military worship) culture that was run by women for women, and they apparently thought it was ok for men to screw kids</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to make a post about this later, I&#39;ve been working on the research for it, because I was looking into the origin of the illuminati&#39;s adam weishaupt signing his name &#39;brother spartacus&#39; and why that came to be and what it was about.  it led me to weird places, namely &quot;spartacus international&quot; which is a pedophile ring that runs resorts where men get to play with young males. Again &#39;young males are anywhere from teens (illegal teens) to 20 somethings</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term &#39;Chicken&#39; is corroborated as existing well before pizzagate. Malcolm MacLaren ex-Sex Pistols manager ran an S&amp;M bondage boutique called Sex where he came up with a T-Shirt design of a nude, young boy smoking a cigarette. The image came from came from a copy of Hans Herbert Hubermahl’s paedophilic underground magazine Boys Express purchased by MacLaren in Brixton, south London. McLaren coerced Sex Pistols Bassist, Glenn Matlock, at the time a student at Central Saint Martin’s art school, to use the college printing facilities to produce the original run.  “We didn’t make very many, 40 or 50 at most, and they were in quite small sizes,” said McLaren. “They were supposed to be sold in the store but at first I gave them away to people who looked cool.”</p>

<p>When the Sex Pistols broke up MacLaren went on to start-up a band called Bow-Wow-Wow with a 13 year-old singer named Annabella Lwin. MacLaren had Lwin pose nude on the band&#39;s album cover when she was 14 years-old and their top song was &quot;I Want Candy&quot;. Their most notorious recording was &quot;Sexy Eiffel Tower,&quot; which consisted of  excitedly sexual heavy breathing and moans. EMI dropped the group after releasing their second single, <strong>&quot;W.O.R.K. (N.O. Nah, No No My Daddy Don&#39;t)&quot;</strong>.  </p>

<p>The members of Bow Wow Wow also promoted clothing designed by McLaren and his partner Vivienne Westwood, and he embroiled the group in such controversies as his plans to publish a paedophilia magazine to be titled <strong>Chicken</strong>, to celebrate sex between under-aged individuals. </p>

<p>So I think it&#39;s safe to conclude that MacLaren was a fucking paedophile besides being a right cunt in every sense of the word.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, <strong>none of the codewords listed in that post have ever been used before Pizzagate.</strong> The chart itself can be traced back to a single 4chan post hypothesizing what the Podesta code could be, someone added to to a JPG and people just ran with it as being the truth.

<p>One of the things that a doubter does that&#39;s a fallacy is take things out of context and look at everything singly, apart from the next thing.

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>This is an unpopular perspective in this sub, but Russia/Putin has been shown to have paid &quot;troll farms&quot; consisting of actual paid shills posting disinformation on the internet. &quot;Trolls&quot; that have been linked to pro-Trump postings. This was long before Russia was implicated in DNC leaks. Putin/Russia also have experience with similar tactics of disinformation being used in the Ukrainian election that helped elect Russian backed Viktor Yanukovych (&quot;fake news&quot;, social media bots, paid shills, &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, etc). Again, this was long before the DNC blamed Russia for their leaks.</p>

<p>The motives would be rather straightforward. Create general distrust among the population. Distrust of the government, news, each other, etc. &quot;A house divided&quot; and whatnot. A lot of people here are pretty averse to this theory, but if you&#39;re actually interested I could put together some links that back up my claims. Maybe not until later/tomorrow, though.</p>

<p>Edit: In case anyone reads this, I detailed my &quot;theory&quot; below in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5hkc55/show_me_where_those_code_words_existed_before/db2rqzi/">my response</a> to <a href="/u/MrsMadHatter04">/u/MrsMadHatter04</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds good.</p>

<p>But first, I&#39;d like to point out that the person I was responding to accused me of pushing &quot;propaganda&quot;. You&#39;ll notice that whenever people bring up legitimate concerns/points about &quot;pizzagate&quot;, they are accused of being some kind of paid shill. It&#39;s why I asked if anyone was <em>actually</em> interested in considering my points before I wasted my energy putting this together. You&#39;ll also notice I will only use a few quality sources, as opposed to a mountain of bullshit.</p>

<p>Anywho...</p>

<p>In June 2015, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Chen">Adrian Chen</a>, a freelance journalist, wrote an excellent article about paid Russian &quot;trolls&quot; titled, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html">The Agency</a>. It goes into great detail into the &quot;what, when, who&quot; of the subject of paid &quot;trolls&quot;. The TL;DR is that the Russian government pays people to go online and post pro-Russian propaganda, disinformation, rumors, etc. There are <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2014/05/11/inside-putins-campaign-of-social-media-trolling-and-faked-ukrainian-crimes/#630fba4c629d">other articles/evidence</a> of Putin&#39;s widespread use of paid &quot;trolls&quot;. You can search for &quot;Russian troll farms&quot; or &quot;Russian troll factories&quot; and find plenty more articles and even document leaks detailing these people/organizations. Much more evidence than you&#39;ll ever find that paid Clinton &quot;shills&quot; were <em>covertly</em> posting on social media accounts (yes, CTR is real, but they AFAIK they never posted covertly) . However, I&#39;m going to focus on Adrian Chen.</p>

<p>But before I continue (sorry for interrupting myself), I&#39;d like to point out that my sources are actual professionals who have reputations, careers, etc on the line. You&#39;ll notice that &quot;pizzagate&quot; proponents are almost entirely anonymous or unsubstantiated sources. Claims about the &quot;code&quot; being known to the FBI are completely unsourced, for example. Which is one of the concerns people are bringing up in this thread.</p>

<p>Additionally, I&#39;d like to point out the irony of &quot;pizzagate&quot; proponents posting on voat.co, a safe haven for <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a> exiles, after <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was banned. You&#39;d think if these people were actually concerned about pedophilia, they&#39;d start looking under their nose. This brings me back to Adrian Chen, who doxxed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violentacrez">&quot;violentacrez&quot;</a>, a moderator for <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a> and <a href="/r/beatingwomen">/r/beatingwomen</a>, among other subreddits. I bring this up because, whether you agree with Chen&#39;s decision to dox or not, there is no doubt that he has journalistic/investigative integrity. And it&#39;s a good example of someone doing a proper investigation into the subject at hand.</p>

<p>Ok, so back to Adrian Chen. In December of 2015, he appeared on a <a href="https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-171-adrian-chen"><em>Longform</em> podcast</a>. He mainly talks about his work. It&#39;s an interesting listen IMO, but what I found relevant was at about 35 minutes in. He states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A very interesting thing happened, I created this list of Russian trolls when I was researching. And I check on it once in a while, still. And a lot of them have turned into conservative accounts, like fake conservatives. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but they&#39;re all tweeting about Donald Trump and stuff...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the host asked him who was paying for it, he responded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know. I feel like it&#39;s some kind of really opaque strategy of electing Donald Trump to undermine the US or something. Like false-flag kind of thing. You know, that&#39;s how I started thinking about all this stuff after being in Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I include this quote to show you that he is not pushing some kind of agenda. In other words, there&#39;s no reason to think he is making this stuff up in order to protect Clinton or something like that. The interview was also long before the Wikileaks DNC email leaks.</p>

<p>Now, he may not have know <em>why</em> Russia would back Trump and he would probably not want to implicate motives, either. This brings me to <a href="http://observer.com/2016/07/wikileaks-dismantling-of-dnc-is-clear-attack-by-putin-on-clinton/">this article</a> written by <a href="http://observer.com/author/john-r-schindler/">John R. Schindler</a>, &quot;a security expert and former National Security Agency analyst and counterintelligence officer&quot;. It goes into great detail into why he believes Julian Assange/Wikileaks is essentially a Russian counter-intelligence &quot;cutout&quot;. It&#39;s not directly tied to Pizzagate, but it&#39;s what helped me look at the subject with a more well-rounded perspective (one that&#39;s pretty unpopular in this sub). If you read his <a href="https://20committee.com/">other articles</a>, however, you will note that he is anything but a Clinton supporter. Again, I bring this up to show you that he is not pushing some kind of pro-Clinton agenda. He criticizes her and believes that what&#39;s in the Wikileaks emails is real. He just understands that <em>both</em> Clinton corruptness <em>and</em> Russian involvement are possible.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to note that <a href="http://politicalbots.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Data-Memo-Third-Presidential-Debate.pdf">this study</a> (warning: pdf) by Oxford University’s Project on Computational Propaganda, estimated that pro-Trump bots out-produced pro-Hillary bots by about 7-to-1 on Twitter.</p>

<p>What&#39;s above is basically to give you some background. I believe this helps us understand Russia&#39;s online propaganda landscape. The reason I believe Russia is involved in &quot;pizzagate&quot;, specifically, is due to a couple things. Firstly, Russia has used &quot;fake news&quot; sites to spread conspiracy theories in the past. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32070184">Here&#39;s</a> an article from early 2015 detailing a growth in pro-Russian websites in the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>Not only that, but according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/pizzagate-from-rumor-to-hashtag-to-gunfire-in-dc/2016/12/06/4c7def50-bbd4-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?hpid=hp_local-news_comet-reconstruct-852pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;amp;utm_term=.99bd934f4216">this article</a> in the Washington Post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An oddly disproportionate share of the tweets about Pizzagate appear to have come from, of all places, the Czech Republic, Cyprus and Vietnam, said Jonathan Albright, an assistant professor of media analytics at Elon University in North Carolina</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/6028853/this-map-shows-how-deeply-loathed-russia-is-around-the-world">this article</a> from 2014:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia is not universally reviled. It has an astounding 75 percent approval rating in Vietnam, which may be in large part due to Russia&#39;s long-standing support for the Vietnamese communist government against the country&#39;s historical enemy, China. Russian support for Vietnam as a balance against China has been rising in recent years as well. China and Greece also report mostly favorable views toward Russia (66 and 61 percent), perhaps because they see Moscow as challenging the West, which is viewed with deep distrust in both countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if you look into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus%E2%80%93Russia_relations">Russia-Cyprus relations</a>, you&#39;ll also note Russian intelligence influence through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)">Foreign Intelligence Service</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I can&#39;t be 100% certain of this, but, basically, my line of reasoning is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Russia stands to gain from US domestic discord. The more focus and distrust we have in our government, journalists, each other etc, the more Russia can do on the international front. This is compounded by the fact that Trump has expressed a foreign policy agenda that would benefit Russia</li>
<li>Russia has a long history of disinformation, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation">&quot;dezinformatsiya&quot;</a>, a word that didn&#39;t even appear in English dictionaries until the 1980&#39;s as a translation of the Russian word &quot;дезинформация&quot;.</li>
<li>Wikileaks, which has never released anything damaging on Russia (wonder why?), is the primary &quot;source&quot; of the &quot;pizzagate&quot; theory.</li>
<li>The strategy of using &quot;fake news&quot; sites has already been employed by Russia in the Ukraine</li>
<li>Pro-Trump twitter bots out-tweet pro-Clinton bots.</li>
<li>&quot;pizzagate&quot; bots are disproportionally from a country that has had pro-Russian propaganda websites, another country that has 75% approval rating of Russia, and another country that has known ties to Russian intelligence.</li>
</ul>

<p>The question of why Russia wouldn&#39;t care to hide where the fake news is coming from is rather simple: disinformation is about creating skepticism/mistrust. Pointing out that Russia is behind these cyber-attacks is seen as deflection or propaganda from &quot;the powers that be&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is pretty much why this whole &quot;pizzagate&quot; thing seems to me it could be a disinfo campaign, likely perpetuated and/or originated by Russian intelligence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I am of the opinion that people have made up pizzagate entirely. There is no actual evidence that any of the allegations are real.

I think people should be focused on the actual, proven to exist crimes that implicate hillary and anyone else involved in the massive fraud and Pay2play. People should be focused on how they just got &quot;Obama&#39;d&quot; for the second time in 8 years, electing a president promising <em>change</em> and turning out to be the exact same thing that we&#39;ve seen the bipartisan POS system churn out for the past maybe 40 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you consider a long period of time? Is there any evidence of cheese pizza being referred to as child porn <em>before</em> HTCAP? A pedo goes on HTCAP, offers the host a pizza in hopes of him letting him go, it becomes a meme and then cheese pizza becomes child porn based on that meme and the incident that occured. So again, is there any evidence of it being used <em>before</em> the HTCAP episode?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The origin matters a lot. Yes, it existed before 2016. Ok, so you have CP. Canadian Pacific? Captain Planet? Construction permit? Cathay Pacific? Communist party? So is it safe to assume these are code words for CP?</p>

<p>The origins of words absolutely matter and so does the application. This is why you have syncretism, myth, etc. It&#39;s also why you have people studying dead languages. Ultimately, my point here is to show that the cheese pizza being used to mean child porn <em>probably</em> isn&#39;t that old but, most certainly, does <strong>not</strong> come from FBI documents outlining different meanings (which some have alleged). In addition, it shows that those involved/acussed would have to know about the slang and what it means as it did <strong>not</strong> originate with them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back around 2000 my girlfriends sister&#39;s boyfriend was arrested for kiddie porn. A few years later the sister is moving and found some disks ( not floppy, I dunno what you call them)  hidden behind a wardrobe. They had the year on them, 1996, 1997, 1998 and one for 1999. She asked me would I look at them to see if she should give them to the police.  Luckily my brother had a reader for this particular type of disk. On it were names and contacts, some had &#39;the best cheezee pizza anywhere &#39; or something along those lines. </p>

<p>There was also an index of ages which made me fuckin sick, as I knew this guy and the sister had young kids in one of the youngest age groups. </p>

<p>I handed them straight to the police at that stage as I didn&#39;t want to be seeing shit like that.  The guy was already sentenced and a few years in into his term. I dunno if he got any extra sentence.  Hope to fuck he did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both correct and incorrect. Clearly, pizza/cheese is NOT girl and you correctly identified that CP = Cheese Pizza = Child Porn. I&#39;ll go ahead and throw away this stupid blog post because it has nothing to it whatsoever. You should have posted the actual source screencap of these terms which I&#39;ll explain are 100% inaccurate. </p>

<p>You claim walnut = black, but then say it say it refers to vag. Wrong again. fake proof.</p>

<p>map and pasta you didn&#39;t even bother.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not seeing a lot of actual proof here, clearly hot dog = weiner = penis. But that&#39;s kid speak, not pedo code language. Everyone knows this, you can&#39;t use it as a fucking codeword because everyone would realize what you were saying.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is how pizzagate posters can&#39;t stay on topic, like how you ended this post with instragram images that have no correlation with pedo terminology whatsoever. It&#39;s almost as if you think posting a field of links means people will believe anything you&#39;re claiming, which is sadly probably true.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the current FACTS. Cheese Pizza = CP = Child Pornography. Hot Dog can mean penis, but <em>cannot be found in that context in the Podesta emails.</em></p>

<p>Everything else is from a completely unsourced post from someone who didn&#39;t even understand the meaning of CP. That one person, who PROVABLY has NO IDEA WHATSOEVER about the meaning of ANY OF THESE TERMS, INCLUDING THE INCREDIBLY POPULAR &quot;CHEESE PIZZA&quot;, is responsible for all of these incorrect term translations. And I&quot;m being serious here, really absorb that this person didn&#39;t even understand the most widespread terminology!</p>

<p>By all means, keep going, but stop promoting blatantly false trash.</p>

<p>I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been
long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape
of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the
square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it
was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the
return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that
we can demolish them.</p>

<p>Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.</p>

<p>I miss you both</p>

<p>Best wishes fro a merry Christmas and Happy New Year.</p>

But a couple things that doesn&#39;t really make sense if &quot;Herb&quot; is really referring to pedophilia is 1) why would he include Mary,  presumably John&#39;s wife,  in this sordid coded email,  and 2) why after talking about pedophilia,  would he suddenly mention his kids and grandchildren and only when they arrive can he &quot;demolish&quot;  the cheese ie commit pedophilia.

<p>Herb talks about getting skunked at dominos in another e-mail, too... although some depraved pizzagaters try to turn <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34860">that one</a> into Herb and his 60-something-year-old female friend Sherry getting whipped <em>by his own fucking grown daughter Susan</em> during a BDSM-fueled child rape session.</p>

<p>I was on the fence, too.  Until I took about 2 hours to study the available (and missing) context, and the <em>complete lack</em> of any sort of reference to the alleged &quot;code words&quot;.</p>

<p>Then I applied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam&#x27;s_razor">Occam&#39;s razor</a>, and it&#39;s pretty easy to deduce that there is nothing nefarious going on in any of the Stratfor or Podesta e-mails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  They&#39;re talking about dominos, cheese and pasta.  You&#39;re the pervert that is turning it into kid fucking.</p>

<p><strong>Dominos on cheese or pasta</strong>: This one seems so blindingly obvious. Keep in mind that the author is the 83-year-old Herb Sandler. His wife Marion of 51 years died about 3 years prior. Podesta had traditionally sent him an Xmas gift of pasta and sauce (Podesta is a known &quot;foodie&quot;), but this time, he got a box of cheeses. He thanks Podesta, and says that when his children (Susan and James) get back from their holiday travels (e-mail is dated 12/24), he&#39;ll enjoy the cheeses with them. Since there are other e-mails talking about how Susan (his grown daughter) <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34860">has beaten him at dominos before</a>, he&#39;s wondering if the cheese will improve his luck. This is a simple thank you for a Christmas gift. And fucking news flash: An 83-year-old man likes to play dominos.</p>

<p>BUT PIZZAGATE SEZ: PODESTA SENT A CHILD FOR 83-YEAR-OLD HERB TO FUCK. HE WAS EXPECTING A BOY, BUT GOT A GIRL. HE WONDERS IF HE&#39;LL BE ABLE TO DOMINATE THE LITTLE GIRL BETTER IN HIS BDSM SEX PLAY, AS HE WAS LIMP-DICKED WITH THE LITTLE BOY LAST TIME.</p>

<p>Either way I find it hard to believe these people would spend their time regularly playing fucking dominoes. Is Podesta reminiscing bout his times spent with a bunch of drunks hanging out in front of the apartment complex in Serbia, where they played dominoes into the night? Board games might be a little more believable but dominoes is just, eh. (Also the world is pretty damn close to domination) Furthermore I don&#39;t see how the performance difference in dominoes after eating cheese or pasta (which there would be absolutely none) is anything worth writing about. </p>

<p>There are way more implications than just the food related emails, so I don&#39;t care too much, but they could still have something to them. Could also just be regular emails we are wasting our time with.</p>

Besides that it&#39;s a joke about blaming food for affecting his domino skills, it isn&#39;t a literal belief that cheese is a performance enhancing drug. I already explained what he probably means by &quot;playing dominoes on x&quot; you are welcome to go reread it.</p>

<p>I have a semi-regular domino and BBQ night with friends. I used to play regularly with my ex&#39;s family, it was a tradition at all family gatherings. I own a set of dominoes I play with extended family on our vacations (in addition to puzzles, board games, etc.)  Omg is that code?!?!  Board = bored = depression = suicide?!</p>

<p>You wanna fuckin bet? I can guarantee that if I had access to every private conversation you&#39;ve ever had, and read them <em>under the assumption that you rape and murder children</em>, I would find a ton of shit that would suffice the very low bar of &quot;evidence&quot; that you are currently using for this conspiracy theory  to support my claim</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re taking out an entire mountain of context and acting as if this is all a misunderstanding from one ambiguous sentence or term.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please explain to me how this &quot;mountain of evidence&quot;, together, through logical connections between them, form something from which someone could logically conclude that he rapes and murders children. </p>

<p>For instance, you willingly admit that podesta&#39;s private conversation taken out of context does not suffice as evidence that he rapes children. And you admit that him owning those paintings does not suffice as evidence that he rapes children. But somehow, together, they do?</p>

<p>How? How can that conversation and those paintings be logically connected, and why do those things, with this logical connection, form something from which you can logically conclude that he rapes children?</p>

<p>Although I used those two things as examples, the questions asked apply to anything in your &quot;mountain of evidence&quot;. How is <em>any of this shit</em> evidence that he rapes and murders children, or evidence that Alefanfis rapes and murders children in the basement of his pizza restaurant in satanic rituals with the political elite?</p>

<p>And if none of this shit is evidence of that, then logically explain how and why all of this shit, with their logical connections to each other, leads to these conclusions.</p>

<p>Build a fucking case. Don&#39;t just throw shit at a wall and then say that the fact that the wall is covered in shit means that it&#39;s proof now. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the fact that you&#39;re completely fine with the Podesta&#39;s taste in art, however legal it may be, speaks volumes about you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that you think accusing someone of some of the most heinous crimes imaginable based upon their taste in perfectly legal art is acceptable speaks volumes about you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So keep shilling if you&#39;d like, for pay or out of ignorance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the fuck does this even mean??? I&#39;m a shill even if I&#39;m not a shill? Do you even know what that word means?</p>

If I said something using uncommon language and inside jokes, people wouldn&#39;t assume I&#39;m pedophile because I don&#39;t also have a brother who collects pedo art, I don&#39;t frequent a pizza place that appears to cater to children (which is weird in itself), I don&#39;t frequent a pizza place that appears to cater children yet decorated with incredibly bizarre artwork and hosts entertainment nights such as &quot;Sex Stains&quot; and advertise it for all ages, I don&#39;t frequent a pizza place whose owner was listed as the 49th most powerful person in Washington D.C. (which I&#39;ll remind you has hundreds of congressmen, generals, media personalities, etc.) despite just running a pizza place who also posts incredibly bizarre things on his Instagram, I don&#39;t host private spirit cooking dinners, I don&#39;t have incredibly creepy taste in art myself, and I&#39;m not a member of the political elite who have long been suspected of satanic involvement and child trafficking. So, it would make no sense to take a one-off joke of mine and suspect I&#39;m a pedophile, but it makes sense to see pedophile code language in John Podesta&#39;s email &quot;joke.&quot;</p>

He is always asking people if they want it, people whom it would make no sense that it is code for fucking child porn or something. </p>

<p>&quot;thinking about your hot dog stand in hawaii&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;we have a pool party, these 3 kids who will for sure be there for your entertainment&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;we are flying pizza and hotdogs into the white house&quot; (not allowed to bring outside food to the white house)</p>

<p>&quot;the owner of comet ping pong is a special guest chef for thier pizza dinner&quot;</p>

<p>like i said im paraphrasing here, so i recommend checking the wikileaks or just finding a YouTube video.  they break it down.</p>

<p>but those uses of the words do not make sense... dreaming of spending an HOUR with a pizza?  who would email that to someone?  a hot dog stanf in hawaii?  go buy a hot dog...who emails things like that?</p>

<p>Just because no user in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has posted whatever you require to see does not mean that the use of these terms does not exist on the dark net. </p>

<p>How can you prove that someone on 4chan invented these terms? You can&#39;t.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to claim that it is on the dark net, because I can&#39;t show proof. My claim is that it doesn&#39;t make sense for it to be found on google, because the sites where this dialect would be used are not indexed by google.</p>

<p>This is a completely different argument, and is irrelevant to our conversation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll copy and paste this from my last comment, because apparently you missed it completely. &quot;I&#39;m not going to claim that it is on the dark net, because I can&#39;t show proof. My claim is that it doesn&#39;t make sense for it to be found on google, because the sites where this dialect would be used are not indexed by google.&quot; I never claimed to have observed it&#39;s use.</p>

<p>You seem really skilled at re-directing the conversation, but I&#39;ll just reiterate that my comments don&#39;t have shit to do with what anyone else in this sub has said. Say one more time that they won&#39;t provide proof, maybe it will be relevant next time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who the fuck sends handkerchiefs and pillows over the mail? In the year 2014 can you not just send a photo of the &quot;map&quot; on the handkerchief if needed and be done with it? Not saying it is guaranteed to be anything out of the ordinary but I&#39;ve never heard of normal people mailing handkerchiefs to each other cause they forgot it during an open house. Nor does anybody normal say stuff like (seems pizza-related) especially given the context of their other &quot;food&quot; related emails. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What!?  </p>

<p>Since when is it out of the ordinary to return something to somebody when they leave it behind?  My buddy just came into town for business, and spent his last night at my our place.  He left a small stack of receipts on the nightstand in the guest room.</p>

<p>I texted him the next day, and asked if he wanted me to drop them in the mail.  He said, no, they weren&#39;t related to his expense report.  I could throw them away.</p>

<p>Why is it any less likely for the realtor to reach out to Susan Sandler, and ask if anybody wanted the handkerchief returned?  More importantly, if it was some nefarious semen and blood-encrusted child rape trophy... <em>why the fuck wouldn&#39;t Podesta want it back</em>, considering it could send him to jail for the rest of his life?</p>

<p>None of the pizzagate theories add up.  They&#39;re all ridiculous stretches to come to the preconceived &quot;ritual child rape&quot; conclusion.  I&#39;m glad that people are <em>finally</em> starting to wake up to this around here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh they are almost certainly all guilty as sin of the worst crimes imaginable, including pedophilia, so I&#39;m not worried about whether this specific email is actually evidence or not tbh. There is plenty of more evidence for the accusations being made apart from this which you are free to investigate. There are also many cases in the past that were blown wide open of high level officials and celebrities being involved in this stuff.</p>

<p>Also I didn&#39;t say its almost certainly CP code, I said almost certainly code for something. Simply playing devil&#39;s advocate in response to your question, no need to attack me for ruining &quot;real lives&quot; of scumbag elites, who by the way, have no problem whatsoever making your life as shit as possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say anything to accuse this woman of participating in a child ring, the only thing she said is do you want me to mail your handkerchief that you forgot, she wasn&#39;t the one mentioning pizza. Nor am I accusing any cashiers or delivery guys working at the pizza place. </p>

<p>Comet Pizza is definitely being used a scapegoat to make anyone investigating this look crazy (see John Oliver&#39;s shill segment) so they can use it as a dismissive &quot;crazy conspiratards think a pizza store is a pedophile headquarters lolololol&quot;. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a shit about any pizza, or any gate, but to deny that there is a high level international child ring is fucking retarded, especially seeing as how just today they discovered 150TB of cp in fucking Norway, a tiny country that has the highest standard of living in the world. Again, there are many instances of extremely high level officials in all areas: politics, sports, media, etc. being involved in this shit. </p>

<p>There is lots of evidence that points to these people having questionable moral and sexual beliefs from these leaks, like their choices in really deranged art, &#39;spirit cooking&#39;, and the people they interact with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a 4 hour period where Susan and the realtor likely had conversations about the pillows, how to pick them up, and what the handkerchief looked like.</p>

<p>Given that it&#39;s widely known that Podesta likes to cook for people, it&#39;s likely that he left some kind of cloth napkin or handkerchief in the kitchen with a printed map on it, like a map of Italy or something.</p>

<p>This context is <em>not</em> included in the email, because Sandler forwarded the original e-mail 4 hours later.  There is the distinct possibility that there were further e-mails between 10:00a and 2:00p that day, and they aren&#39;t included in the thread.  I do shit like this all the time when I don&#39;t want a recipient to be involved in subsequent conversations.  Why the hell would Podesta need to know about the pillows that Sandler bought?</p>

<p>Can you honestly say that it&#39;s more likely that this was a Satanic jizz rag than a common kitchen napkin that Podesta didn&#39;t even care enough about to bother to retrieve?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just pointing out that any of the conversation that Sandler had with the realtor about said handkerchief is not going to be in Podesta&#39;s inbox.  That leaves a whole lot of missing context.</p>

<p>I agree with you that there is definitely pedophilia going on at high levels in all areas.  Where I disagree with you is on whether people&#39;s taste in art, music and sexual orientation is &quot;evidence&quot; of pedophilia ring.  It&#39;s all opinion and conjecture... literally the opposite of &quot;evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>Just because someone likes &quot;edgy&quot; art and goth music doesn&#39;t give you cause to draw them into a public witch hunt. </p>

However, there is a surplus of information out there that refutes your understanding of things. If you are unable to see this thats cool, but you alone are not going to convince the millions of people that are looking into this and trying to spread awareness that we are somehow &quot;dead wrong&quot; or &quot;bullshit&quot;.

<p>we are web sleuths doing an online investigation.  we dont have access to these peoples physical property or even the amount of resources an actual police agency would.</p>

<p>but even with those factors working against us, there is still enough online alone that has gone beyond a reasonable doubt.  no one is saying these people are guilty, we are saying that there is enough information to open an actual investigation into these peoples activities.</p>

<p>thats what it means when people say pizzagate is real.  the evidence is real, the connections are real.  all thats left is for a real agency to come in and start a criminal investigation.</p>

<p>do you need a smoking gun to begin to open an investigation?  no, you do not.</p>

<p>you might need to look up the word yourself.</p>

<p>i also suggest you go to youtube and find a video about it.  they will lay out all the evidence and explain it all in a very simple to understand manner.  i have no doubt you will be able to keep up.  it will be much easier that way as you can educate yourself on your time and at your own pace.</p>

You said <em>hot dog</em> = &quot;young boy&quot; but your evidence cite shows it only referenced as a euphemism for penis (as was pretty easily guessed since people do refer to their junk as a &quot;weiner.&quot; Then you said <em>cheese pizza</em> = &quot;little girl&quot; but some of your evidence says it just means &quot;vaginal intercourse.&quot; And finally, you said <em>walnut</em>= African American or African but then your source says it means &quot;immature clitoris&quot; or something.

<p>So what makes you think it&#39;s deep web slang? What is your source for that?</p>

<p>Mary and John</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been
long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape
of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the
square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it
was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the
return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that
we can demolish them.</p>

<p>Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.</p>

<p>I miss you both</p>

<p>Best wishes fro a merry Christmas and Happy New Year.</p>

<p>Herb</p>

<p>Ps. Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta? </p>

<p>Makes a little more sense when given the context right? &quot;Do you think I&#39;ll d better playing dominos on cheese  (which you just gifted me) than on pasta (which I was expecting to eat).&quot;</p>

<p>Herb talks about getting skunked at dominos in another e-mail, too... although some depraved pizzagaters try to turn <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34860">that one</a> into Herb and his 60-something-year-old female friend Sherry getting whipped <em>by his own fucking grown daughter Susan</em> during a BDSM-fueled child rape session.</p>

<p>I was on the fence, too.  Until I took about 2 hours to study the available (and missing) context, and the <em>complete lack</em> of any sort of reference to the alleged &quot;code words&quot;.</p>

<p>Then I applied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam&#x27;s_razor">Occam&#39;s razor</a>, and it&#39;s pretty easy to deduce that there is nothing nefarious going on in any of the Stratfor or Podesta e-mails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long time ago.  I know what it is.  Everyone there is anonymous and they post all sorts of images.  My point is they get the images from somewhere.  4chan doesn&#39;t autogenerate pictures form the ether.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s mostly hentai and a bunch of teenagers trying to out troll each other like a bunch of wasteoids, contributing very little other than memes and stuff.  There is some merit to it though, because some very smart pppl there have whisleblown novel info there as it&#39;s a safe place to do it compared to here</p>
