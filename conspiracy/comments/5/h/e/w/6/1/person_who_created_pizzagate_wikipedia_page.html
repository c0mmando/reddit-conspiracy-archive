       Yeah someone else just actually debunked one of the alleged codes for me, or at least debunked it in regards to its use in one of the emails. The hotdog stand in Hawaii is just an inside joke dating back as far as 2000.

       So that's somewhat of a relief. Why don't actual fucking journalists go through and do this stuff? Like actually debunk instead of triggering people like me who were abused as kids? Getting triggered by trolls, and then the MSM just points and laughs instead of explaining, just like people who were abused as kids were not believed. This whole thing has been an exhausting shitfest rollercoaster.

       They were quoting his brother, who said it, it wasn't the Washington Post's own words. Not a fan of the Post but still, it wasn't their own words. That nobody I have seen has been mentioning that joke from back in 2000 when using the email as a piece of evidence, though, makes me more suspicious of everything else. I mean what is the story behind all of the other examples, that I might not have stumbled upon yet? I already know the MSM isn't trustworthy at all, but it seems there might be some bullshit afoot with this, as well. Which if so really pisses me off, since child predators in governments is a very real issue, we don't need people drumming up distorted half-truths that could make it harder future victims to be taken seriously.

       That's not the point of my posts. The point of my posts is that the information relevant to the email about a hotdog stand has not been included by anyone I have seen showing that email as evidence for reason to be suspicious. I'm only of average intelligence, you see, and when reading about a topic that is triggering for me, like I actually have PTSD, I become even less intelligent due to the fight/flight response. Hence I did not think to do searches that would have brought up the article for me a long time ago. So I can only conclude that the people doing the investigations are either also not that bright if they did not think to look it up, or they deliberately don't include it so as to deliberately not have any context for the email when they use it as evidence. Those are the only two possibilities and neither of them are good.

       I'm 100% sure it goes on, given everything. I'm just willing to admit that due to my past, I got emotionally riled up and wasn't as objective as I should have been. I'm just willing to admit to that. Is anyone else? Because my bigger fear now is that this is going to wind up being used to invalidate real victims of predators in the future.

       Ugh I wish, I could so use one right now. Weeks freaking out about children being used, and now a mountain of embarrassment and anxiety over the revelation that not only are we not going to be saving any of them, but we're probably making things worse due to our shitty case.

       Remember that ultimately, we're not responsible for the actions of someone else.  If someone chooses (or gets paid to, depending on who you ask) take a gun down to a pizza joint because of some theories swirling online, that's not on you.
      </p>

       As long as we each do a piece of research, make some connections, or dig up some more "coincidences," we can't do much better than that.  We do have other aspects of our lives, after all.

       That's good, I'm so glad a hot dog stand exists in Hawaii. Proof that all the other emails about cheese, pasta, pizza, hotdogs, handkerchiefs, and pool parties that children get Uber'd to, to be the entertainment for the day, none of that is suspect.

       It's a disservice to the victims of P-G, to dismiss the whole thing. I've personally researched this in depth, and I guarantee if real investigation was done, that this would blow up.

       It's not the media's fault that you believed a load of old rubbish, it's not the media's role to address every single piece of crap on the internet, and it's not the job of journalists to provide you with a therapeutic reading experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question you ought to be asking yourself is: "Why on earth did I believe self-evident total nonsense from a completely anonymous stranger with no credentials, and why did I make no effort to check?"
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a victim in this, but not in the way you seem to imagine. You are a victim because you chose to listen to idiots, and unless you learn to be a bit more discriminating, you'll be a victim again.

       I think you have a fair point about me, personally, and yes it is a learning opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the MSM is going to go out of their way to talk about it, then it ought to be because they investigated and are discussing the results of their efforts to debunk/confirm. They went out of their way to spend time on it, but only mock it or call it "fake" without explaining how they know it is fake. So I stand firmly by my criticism of that.

       But what about everyone else who believes some ridiculous crap they read online? Why do you (pizzagaters, not you personally) get preferential treatment? And why do you (personally) get preferential treatment out of all the other pizzagaters who want to see some other item of 'evidence' addressed?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see where this is going. The media's job is to report on things that are actually happening. So far the only 'thing' that has happened as part of pizzagate is that gunman incident. There is literally nothing else to report, unless you want media debased to the level at which twitterstorms are the stuff of headlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps there will be some exhaustive pizzagate debunking documentary in the near future. There's enough interest for a potential audience-winner. But true pizzagaters will dismiss it as part of the cover-up. So it won't accomplish much.

       Personally, my hope has been that pizzagate will increase public awareness / concern over child predator activity and coverups in powerful governments. That there might have been a small surge in that from the MSM, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I imagine you may have seen the recent thread about how even Cooper once acknowledged it:

       And like I said, the media has gone out of their way to talk about pizzagate but only to call it fake in order to support the "fake news is dangerous" narrative that has suddenly surged. Did so many go out of their way to talk about the 9/11 conspiracy theory and mock it back then? Or when they do talk about some other conspiracy theories, don't they usually try to actually debunk it, like the birther people?

       Thats the part where you will stop getting replies mate. He isnt after justice for children. His soul purpose is just to discredit Pizzagate. You gotta ask yourself, what normal unbiased person makes a new reddit account just to log on all day and go find posts relating to finding justice for abused kids and attacking each and every post? Like its a frigging conspiracy sub, and we have frequent, systemated attacks on peoples theories every day....well only if it relates to bringing justice to child rapists

       it took a while for 9/11 conspiracy theories to catch on.  Alex Jones and his crowd was a bit more limited.  Loose Change was probably the first mainstreaming/ popularizing of the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think the media doesn't want to spend time debunking when they can just discredit and talk down. that's what works- it's the same strategy used against skeptics of GMO/ Global Warming Vaccines and all those "anti-science" concepts.  Just lable the people who question or criticize as crazy or stupid or dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       but I agree that this community needs to be debunking their own concepts if they want to create a more coherent framework for their narrative.  There is too much bs in the pizzagate story and it does a disservice to the larger problems.

       And today, 150 Terabytes of kiddy porn was found in Europe. High government officials implicated. But, in the US media are not picking up on the story. Suppression of legitimate stories, and creating and spreading false information, is censorship. The CIA has a lot of expertise in this area.

      <p>
       A fair question, and an interesting area in any case, so I'll unpack some stuff here.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's changed between 9/11 and now is that on 9/11 the US wasn't in the early stages of a superpower confrontation, in which the opponent was making good use of information (be that media material or digital data).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no need to fight a propaganda war against an enemy that has just devastated a city landmark, and what's more since the enemy are basically shepherds equipped with cellphones hiding somewhere in a third world country, there's no effective way of doing it either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet was just getting going properly (OK, the WWW but I don't care for the distinction these days). Al-Qaeda was a very retro terrorist body, as you might expect from such Cold War leftovers, and although they used the internet to propagate material and make announcements, they weren't great adapters to the digital age.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bin Laden put up a video of a defiant speech, the media reported it, and we all moved on. Rinse and repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin's Russia is in a different league, and has the historical 'chess mentality' to make good use of the internet (which is now a decade more advanced than it was on 9/11).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of history here. But the upshot is that the end of the First Cold War was merely the prelude to the encircling of Russia, and this cranked the Second Cold War into motion - and that's where we are now.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is about a bit more than 'Bin Laden: Wanted dead or alive'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not the Kremlin is really percolating 'fake news' into US audiences is neither here nor there, really. The aim is that nothing from Russia will be trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the big thing that has also changed since 9/11 is the strength of the west's media. A decade of cost-cutting and cutbacks had already led commentators to observe how weakened the media's resources and fact-checking had become, even before the 2008 crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       The western media had become vulnerable to Russian propaganda. The western intelligence agencies exploited that same vulnerability to spread the 'fake news' meme, designed to contaminate Russian sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now that meme is backfiring, because it is ironically shining a spotlight on exactly how parlous western news reporting had already become.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'fake news' meme outbreak is still developing, and it's not clear how the situation will stabilise, but it looks at least as though 'the free press' are going to have been catastrophically injured by supping with the Devil.

       I can debunk it pretty easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crux of the Pizzagate argument is the alleged pedophile code in Podesta's emails. I'm speaking specifically of the code table listed
       <a href="https://i.sli.mg/eoWIeB.jpg">
        here
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no source attached to that alleged pedophile code, which the table contends is widely used among pedophiles. However, Googling some of the phrases, like "hotdog" for boy and "ice cream" for male prostitute, returns no results except Pizzagate-related articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon further investigation, I traced the source of this code table to a single random 4chan post. That's it. Some random 4chan user invented that table out of thin air, and now people blindly assume it's true. Remove that code table and all of the suspect emails are rendered innocuous.

       That is correct. You could claim that. And me saying that you are wrong is not debunking proof. Until you can confirm the actual intended meaning of the words, you are simply speculating.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if i have a suspicion that magical fairy dust has nefarious meanings, i am free to investigate. No matter how much it discomforts you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you will take a moment to read what my original posting was, you will see that i am asking for any actual, valid debunking. I did not ask for any proof of the opposite. I am waiting for conclusive evidence. The problem is that people like yourself are offering less evidence to disprove the argument than is being provided by your opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       If no one is guilty of anything, then you should have no problem with people investigating to determine if that is correct or not.

       So i shall reiterate. I asked for debunking. You provided an opinion and called it a debunking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I showed how you are wrong. Now, you are trying to shift the discussion into an argument over what you assumed i have stated. By the way, my original statement is about the article claiming debunking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I havent laid the burden of proof on you. You tried to shoulder it yourself and came up seriously lacking. At this point, i am curious as to why it is so important to you that no one investigates something they consider suspicious.

       Not a fair comparison. Just because some US presidents were crooked doesn't mean they all were (at least not as much). On the other hand, there's lots of solid evidence that systematized pedophilia and child trafficking is rampant among the elite from all over the world. That should at least make one consider Pizzagate to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself am not fully convinced of Pizzagate, but after researching Dutroux and Sevile, it doesn't sound far-fetched at all to me.

       No, I did not browse any. I used to browse 4chan extensively in 2007ish when the site used to get spammed to shit by bots advertising a site called "AnonTalk," which was widely know to be a pedophile chat site.

       I'm sorry. There's a llama named Terrance in Georgia ( the country, not the state) that told me not to talk to you. Therefore you have to help Terrance learn algebra before I can give you any response. My proof that Terrance exists is that the first letter of this sentence is M and that is the same letter that Mexico" starts with.

       I have asked. He told me that your level of intelligence is well below the necessary level to carry on a discussion about the subject matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here the best part about the simplistic point that you are trying to make. You actually agree with my point. Your example cannot be debunked. The implication that you are making is that your example is analogous to pizzagate in that you cannot debunk the story because it is ridiculous.

       I would have to have a vested interest in refuting your claim. Until then, i will allow you to investigate your claim and build evidence to support it.
      </p>

       It does seem that you have a vested interest in ensuring that no investigation is performed on what others consider suspicious. Care to share why you are so adamantly supporting the suppression of information?

       This is my entire point. Do you not see the irony?  There needs to be EVIDENCE for claims. Extreme claims require extreme evidence.

       I am adamant about information, but not disinformation.  Flimsy and circumstantial evidence led to someone with a gun invading a private business and shooting. This wild goose chase is hurting people based on super casual correlation.

       Wow. The dearth of your analytical skills is astounding.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are making the claim that what the people are discussing is disinformation. You have now made a claim. You are obligated to provide evidence for that claim.

       I really like your last bit there. The think about the children statement. Does that one ever work?

       The gunman? You just made the claim that he acted because of flimsy and circumstantial evidence. We are going to need evidence of your claim to his reasoning.

       And no, media sources dont count as legit sources. They have already been proven unreliable.

      <p>
       So, again, please answer the question why you are arguing so hard against performing an investigation. Especially since, if you are correct, the investigation would exonerate everyone involved.

       Circular? Would that be because i keep turning what you say around to show you how you are making claims with the same amount of evidence that you are accusing others of? Or would it be because i keep returning to the question you refuse to answer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do you just not understand circular logic? Because i havent used any of my arguments to define my own arguments yet. Nor have i made any statement that anything is true or false beyond the original claim that this has been debunked.

      <p>
       Ill give you that my phrasing is a bit off on that one. I didnt see the irony in that at first. However, i was referring to your appeal to fear. Its not a valid arguing point. Unless you are making the statement that any investigation shoukd be left alone due to any adverse reactions from the public.

       I think for the public good there should be an investigation. But the irony is there's so much disinformation out there that if any news media would report that the FBI says there was no evidence of any of the claims no one would believe them anyway. This isn't a case built in facts, it's a case built in the gaps of evidence.
      </p>

       I won't get into the circular logic because it's detracting from the important point, but if you look into your statements it is there.

       You also have a nasty habit of trying to discredit anyone who disagrees with you by calling them names or attempting to discredit them (ad hominem), or their reasoning abilities.

       Well they could have been.  No chain of custody and many have no DKIM signature.  That means they are text files a hacker gave you and said they came from a guy's inbox.  They could in fact be altered and yes that's what anyone who actually was caught would claim too.    I guess that means it's all opinion as only NSA/FBI could verify that the emails were altered by having a version of the original saved in collected data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still good to point this out.  There's now a claim that the emails contents were altered.  If you could actually prove that, which as I said MIGHT be possible, then you would have your smoking gun that someone was seeking to manipulate the election with false information.

       All it would take is for Podesta to come out and say they were altered, he could even prove it by releasing a few of the "real" emails. Its been a while since we've heard from Johnny-boy, though.

       This claim could only be validated by NSA/FBI - so if that were the case, he would in fact, probably wait until the investigation was complete to state anything.  Claiming it before-hand with nothing except your word against theirs to back it up, doesn't really seem like it would help from his position.

       Some parts of them are verified.  On the ones I have examined you could alter the time stamps on the emails to whatever you wanted (on the outside headers), but you could not alter the inside part (body) of the email.  Here's the thing though, you could compromise the account, send the emails yourself and then change the date.  Many of the emails being pointed to in the Podesta emails are not DKIM verified which means there is no control over the content at all.  I tend to trust the google.com DKIM more than the one from the earlier Clinton emails.  I believe there was a domain (clintonemail or something like that I forget which one it was) that had DKIM that was working in some of the earlier releases.  We do not know the extent to which the earliest email server was compromised.  If admin access was gained, then they could have just signed the emails themselves.  I'd say I believe that the emails that are signed by google's DKIM were sent using a properly authorized client.  If I were the NSA I'd just go see if they have a record of a single one of these and if I can find one alteration that's pretty good evidence of tampering.

       For those about to engage in an episode to schizophrenia and accountability denial, politicians are dirty and they lie and are flat-out rich, for the most part they are boring old people that like to play golf and suck their own dicks. Stop flattering our government for being so exciting because it's not it's fucking boring. People have been molesting children since we were amoeba. Why does it take Donald Trump becoming your president to make this paranoid Journey two child sex

       Yeah someone else just actually debunked one of the alleged codes for me, or at least debunked it in regards to its use in one of the emails. The hotdog stand in Hawaii is just an inside joke dating back as far as 2000.

       So that's somewhat of a relief. Why don't actual fucking journalists go through and do this stuff? Like actually debunk instead of triggering people like me who were abused as kids? Getting triggered by trolls, and then the MSM just points and laughs instead of explaining, just like people who were abused as kids were not believed. This whole thing has been an exhausting shitfest rollercoaster.

       It's not the media's fault that you believed a load of old rubbish, it's not the media's role to address every single piece of crap on the internet, and it's not the job of journalists to provide you with a therapeutic reading experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question you ought to be asking yourself is: "Why on earth did I believe self-evident total nonsense from a completely anonymous stranger with no credentials, and why did I make no effort to check?"

       You are a victim in this, but not in the way you seem to imagine. You are a victim because you chose to listen to idiots, and unless you learn to be a bit more discriminating, you'll be a victim again.

       That's good, I'm so glad a hot dog stand exists in Hawaii. Proof that all the other emails about cheese, pasta, pizza, hotdogs, handkerchiefs, and pool parties that children get Uber'd to, to be the entertainment for the day, none of that is suspect.
