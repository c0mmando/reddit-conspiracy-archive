    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s not denying that those rings exist or should be uncovered and destroyed, he is stating a logical fact that a connection between TG and PG has not been established, nor has the TG exposed high profile, cult-like activity as far as I am aware right now. Acting overly emotional in all this, though understandable, is not going to help your cause. Don&#39;t reject discourse over such important matters as a high burden of proof exists, and, whether you like it or not, it might make progress slow but it&#39;s also a check against Salemesque, mob tyranny. Also, this is a sub of free thought so don&#39;t be so ironic to squash a little dissent.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I would like to see is the Pizzagate people saying &quot;you know what? We were wrong about Comet Ping Pong. We found no evidence to support our initial allegations that Comet Ping Pong and Hillary Clinton and John Podesta were engaged in childhood sexual slavery. But we did uncover some child pornographers! So good on us!&quot; if the Pizzagate people were honest enough to separate the issues, I would respect and applaud them. But the fact that you are using this to defend Pizzagate as if the two are related other than the fact that one led to other, as of Pizzagate is still a thing, seems super dishonest. NOTHING has been substantiated to link Comet Ping Pong and John Podesta and Hillary Clinton to sexual slavery. Using something else that was found to legitimize the Pizzagate claims is just freaking dishonest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, for real. You guys found some child pornographers. That&#39;s fucking awful. I&#39;m a parent; the idea of child pornography makes me want to go Rob Roy on some people. BUT. Sadly, I already knew that child pornographers exist. Just finding some doesn&#39;t substantiate any claims against anyone except the people that were caught. That&#39;s the part that is missing. If you can show any actual link between Pizzagate and the child pornographers that were found, fine, I&#39;m all ears. But just finding that some people are involved in CP is not enough to show that Pizzagate is real. We already knew that CP exists and some awful fucks engage in it. Show the evidence that it is related to the people accused in PG. If you can&#39;t, then so far it&#39;s not evidence. </p>

Users of r/pizzagate were doxxing and tracing those accounts.

But do you see, you assume I pretend like it didn&#39;t happen when I, actually, was simply unaware. Why must questiojing be viewed as oppressive or adversary? Also, as I understand the TG happened very recently, correct? Well, my only problem is that the cry against PG has been developing for a while as I see it, since fake news became a focus. Could time correlations not be at work here, too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that surprising. PG made itself into a joke, going after the thinnest of out of context evidence when targeting a pizza parlor, ultimately inspiring a man to go there with a gun, which could have turned out very bad for many people, including him.</p>

<p>Reddit doesn&#39;t want links to CP on it&#39;s site, nor does it want to encourage doxxing, even for a good cause, because everyone who doxxes thinks they do it for a good reason. And most people know Pizzagate as &#39;those people who harassed a pizza parlor for no reason&#39;.</p>

<p>The response is not surprising. You can&#39;t act out and suddenly expect the world to take you seriously after that. Doesn&#39;t matter if they did something good, the core of pizzagate is a dangerous kind of conspiracy theory, making big claims with only the thinnest skin of circumstantial evidence. Just some odd emails, no actual victims, no financial records, no actual sightings of oddness, just some pictures that are, again, taken out of context. Regardless of what they might have shown about Twitter, I wouldn&#39;t want to give them any validation either. Just because of what they might do with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay.  Sorry that had to be so rough.  There seems to be a problem of one definition here.</p>

<p>You seem to see pizzagate as a larger entity and would like to focus on a positive thing that it has done.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a problem with your focus.</p>

<p>But to me (and many others), pizzagate is defined by some core assertions:</p>

<ul>
<li>John Podesta&#39;s emails contain coded discussions that are evidence of a pedophile ring.</li>
<li>Comet Ping Pong and associated businesses are the physical location of many of the alleged crimes committed by that ring.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be clear, neither of these has been substantiated.  </p>

<p>As for me, I believe a name should reflect the nature of the thing as closely as possible.  To me, twittergate may have incidental links to pizzagate, but it has nothing to do with the core assertions and claiming it as a success for pizzagate isn&#39;t warranted.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad we could get to the bottom of this together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original person being blasted here was only stating that the videos being buried were child porn. The reason they were buried was because they were child porn. </p>

<p>Is getting child porn off the internet the issue here? No, child porn being taken off the internet is not the issue here. Child porn has absolutely no right to even exist. </p>

<p>The issue is the mainstream media making no mention of it and twitter taking so damn long to police it. </p>

<p>I was simply clarifying what was being said earlier. The people involved in the creation, production, distribution, and consumption of these videos (aside from the young, terrified victims) deserve the harshest of punishments. </p>

<p>In that context your snarky sarcasm makes literally no sense. You are implying that I was implying that there was some nebulous connection, when I was actually refuting that idea. Nebulously connecting me to whatever doesn&#39;t come off as &#39;turnabout&#39; it just displays your agenda along with your poor reading comprehension. Also theoretically, posting to reddit would serve as a weak alibi, wouldn&#39;t it? Unless you want to provide contrary evidence by claiming that you or people you know livetweet rapes and murders as you commit them?

<p>If you create an accusation, which is what has happened here. Saying there is a child abuse cover up with HRC at the helm and held secretly in a Washington family pizza place is an accusation. You need to provide full evidence to back it up. This isn&#39;t an investigation because the solution has already been asserted and everything else is used to confirm the preconcieved belief. It makes this simply a witch hunt.</p>

<p>If you believe something without evidence of it and then push that agenda as if it&#39;s real then you are in fact a conspiracy wacko.</p>

<p>Extraordinary claims (which this is) requires extraordinary evidence. As far as I can tell the only thing these free-thinkers are free from is evidence and verifiable facts that prove their position. That doesn&#39;t mean their wrong by the way. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s be clear.  This could in fact be happening. However the way it&#39;s going about, (without evidence and digging up minor circumstantial facts and pinning them together) makes serious honest inquiry harder, not easier. The truth is being deluded with quackery. </p>

<p>Well he is a comedian. Ridicule is pretty much what he does. I&#39;m not saying you have to like him or think he&#39;s funny. But he ridicules things on a daily basis this topic just happens to hit close to home for you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He clearly doesn&#39;t agree with the theory. His reasoning for that is laid pretty bare and I happen to agree with him since there is not current reason to believe it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel as though saying that something isn&#39;t true when you don&#39;t know is pretty much as bad as saying something is true when you don&#39;t know. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Say for instance that I am hiding a magical invisible fire breathing dragon in my refrigerator. You can&#39;t prove that it exsists and of course I say it doesn&#39;t because I&#39;m keeping it hidden. And of course that&#39;s exactly what someone who is hiding an invisible  fire breathing would say.</p>

<p>Should you believe that it is there ? Of course not. Because before you can believe that you should prove it exists. </p>

<p>Saying that Colbert is part of a grand conspiracy before you&#39;ve even proven that that conspiracy exsists is ridiculous. You don&#39;t believe and buy into things until you are sure they exist and no one should believe it until there is proof. </p>

<p>I took this as you saying he knows what he is doing as in--he&#39;s in on something. If you didn&#39;t mean that I apologize if that&#39;s a false assumption.  What exactly is this tactic you speak of designed for though then?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Worst of all he implied that it&#39;s too far fetched to believe in elite pedophile rings, which is ironic considering he&#39;s a catholic.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall him saying that there aren&#39;t any such thing. If he did and I am misremebering it I will gladly agree that he is dead wrong there.</p>

<p>In this case though with the Catholic ring there was evidence and witnesses and victims coming forward. None of that exists here making this &quot;investigation&quot; worthy of ridicule until someone can come forward with actual evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He is a comedian&quot; is super weak argument by the way.  I am sure he knows what kind of responsibility a man in his position has when it comes to his ability to influence the views of the public. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A comedian ridicules. That&#39;s what they do. I didn&#39;t find anything in the video to be any more mean spirited than anything Colbert has ever done. He&#39;s ridiculing conspiracy theorists who don&#39;t rely on evidence and take things much much too far. And in that I feel like it&#39;s a fair target of ridicule.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t take that as a statement that all conspiracies don&#39;t exist. You just brought up a perfectly good example of one that was true and based on evidence. I take it as simply a statement of: pizzagate is nonsense and dangerous until someone provides actual sustainable evidence and it should be disbelieved.</p>

<p>Why am I pretending  ANY of those things? You can&#39;t just say suppose and yadda yadda your way to a conspiracy. You have to A. Prove that the conspiracy exsists. B. The government knew about it. Then C. Prove that Colbert had anything to do with it. All with verifiable evidence for each part before anyone with a modicum of credibility is going to believe it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s actually inductive reasoning. What needs to be used is deductive reasoning without assuming the end result. Instead you see things that appear to be spooky then pin them all together to prove your presupposed theory. Nothing is being followed to a conclusion. The conclusion was made then the evidence was twisted to support the hypothesis. </p>

<p>Circumstancial evidence of what exactly? The grand conspiracy you already believe to be happening?  Again. It COULD be real. But these presuppositions are doing more damage then good because it just appears to be nonsense to a person following the real evidence.</p>

<p>Source: I went to a Jesuit high school.  Most of the teachers were regular people, but a few were Jesuits.  They tended to be fairly progressive (by catholic priest standards) and were always willing to have respectful and lively discussions/debates about religion or anything else with any high schoolers who were interested.  </p>

I was there as it unfolded. I do believe I recall she specifically stated that these accounts were not specifically linked to Comet but from The branch that her research took, I believe from the initial leaks. I won&#39;t say with 100% certainty because I do not have the information in front of me. Pizza gate and Twitter gate combined were the catalyst for the fake news push.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For something thats totally fake, Mainstream media everywhere is sure doing a lot to discredit this story &quot;pizzagate&quot; without citing any of the claims being made. The reaction is stunning; Instead of going over WHY these claims are ridiculous, they just scoff at a generalized synopsis without exploring any background. They love to tout this new propaganda catchphrase &quot;fake news&quot;.</p>

<p>The really disgusting thing in my eyes is that this is a serious topic. I don&#39;t know how you talk about child rape so lightly, like it doesn&#39;t exist or has never occurred in high levels of power.</p>

<p>So for the sake of argument, lets say pizzagate is totally unfounded and not real. The way to ACTUALLY disprove this would be to highlight each claim and explain why its wrong. Another smart thing to do is give a disclosure, like &quot;child rape is a very serious thing we don&#39;t take lightly; If this was true, it would be very important to investigate&quot;. They don&#39;t even do that; Its this nervous reactionary response: &quot;THIS IS RIDICULOUS, this is the problem with internet free speech, people can just go online and make up &quot;fake news.&quot; Ok, so prove why its fake. If its so ridiculous, explain why. They don&#39;t do any sort of digging, just surface level &quot;PEDOPHILIA CULT OMG, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?? PIZZA LOL&quot; bullshit smear tactics. Yeah of course it sounds ridiculous, why do you think everyone is spooked out? Why is pizzagate the number 1 trending story you&#39;re trying to bury?</p>

<p>The mud slinging days are over. Your hero Edward Bernays couldn&#39;t have predicted how effective the internet would be. I don&#39;t think this story is going away, and to nervously try to pretend like its bullshit and unfounded without ANY context is the biggest mistake they could make. People are going to want to understand what this is, and the reason you can&#39;t go over the claims made are because THEY ARE INCENDIARY! At the VERY LEAST it looks very suspicious and BAD!</p>

I decided to google search PG just to see the MSM headlines, and every single one mentions &quot;crazy conspiracy theorists&quot;. It makes me so fucking angry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you, I&#39;m pretty out of the loop and clearly don&#39;t have all the facts but just how this theory is being dismissed and attacked despite some interesting circumstantial evidence being produced drives me mad.

How this isn&#39;t pissing more people off, regardless of their view on PG, is beyond me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be clear, I&#39;m not a pizza gate believer or supporter at all, the only thing I have seen that has raised questions in my mind was the picture of the little girl with her arms taped to a ping pong table on one of the social media places of one of the pizza places. </p>

<p>What I was trying to say in my post was, why doesn&#39;t the MSM at least do it&#39;s job when reporting this theory and at least mention the picture mentioned above, as it could show that, although largely fabricated, there are some nuggets that could allow a somewhat rational person could believe the theory. Instead they cast every believer as a total nut, and by extension are using it to vilify ALL conspiracy theories as dangerous. Why haven&#39;t they shown that picture at least? At least mention it? Instead they all coordinate and pick out the wildest parts of the theory to pound into people&#39;s head (&quot;these nuts believe Hilary is personally running a pedophile ring in the secret tunnel connecting these pizza places&quot;...which is utter nonsense). Why not just show both sides? The crazy shit that some people believe along with the somewhat more questionable pictures (like the one I keep harping on). </p>

<p>In short, my post waste trying to convince others, or even assert that pizza gate is real. The point was instead venting my frustration with the media in this country for not being balanced and for scripting the narrative so obviously, there never was an opportunity for the masses to impartially make up its mind on this issue (they still deserve the right to make up their own mind, even if it&#39;s a weak theory).</p>

<p>Now with all that said, no I have absolutely no fucking clue how this all got started, (and now I&#39;m kinda interested because it sounds like its going to he hilariously bizarre), I just really want an answer about why that girl was taped to a table and why no one seems to be mentioning it. </p>

<p>That came out about 300% longer than I intended but I just felt like I needed to clarify what I was trying to say. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to see you downvoted for saying this, because it is just the truth. The little girl in the Comet photo is free to pull up her arms at any time--that one was clearly a silly gag like rocktogether describes.</p>

<p>To me there is ZERO doubt that there there IS a major, very sick, high-up pedo thing going on worldwide (we&#39;ve had Savile/Isle of Jersey and Hastert and Epstein/Lolita and Franklin Savings scandal just for starters.) But much of the PG stuff has been people connecting dots that are just not part of it, likely confirmation-bias and lack of understanding of the DC insider culture.</p>

<p>These are the bits that MSM grasps at so desperately so they can discredit the actual sick fuckery that is ongoing and for which everyone remains unaccountable, and for which there is a real conspiracy and cover-up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the most thoughtful argument in these comments I think. I have disagree with you though. Giving time to show the various claims and scant evidence of this child sex ring only validates and emboldens the theorists. If news outlets are expected to go extra lengths to paint every conspiracy theory in a reasonable light they will a) not have time for anything else, and b) encourage people to propagate even less likely theories.</p>

<p>Also I want to point out that pizzagate was only covered because a guy went with a gun to &quot;investigate&quot; it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a haunting thing to realize that people you once thought highly of on the TV are in cahootz with the people in power. Maybe he just chooses not to believe that it&#39;s happening. And I guess at certain points people decide that they must believe lies to hold off the insanity that is the world around them. I remember watching Colbert yell &quot;Fuck ISIS&quot; after the Paris attacks, and the crowd roared. Everyone in the media seems pretty suspect anymore. All of them contribute to the false narrative of our time.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m retracting what I said above. Currently there is no evidence regarding &#39;Moly&#39;s&#39; find on Twitter. There was a go fund me started up by &#39;Moly&#39; to help her but this was shut down. </p>

<p>This could be real, it could be a scam, it could be someone taking out some anger on Twitter, it could be something else. There is no reason to believe one over the other at the moment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty odd that mainstream news, which regularly taps twiiter to fill it&#39;s 24/7 cycle of nonsense, somehow overlooked such a thing. Even if the content was posted purposely to bolster the pizzagate thing, it&#39;s still news. CP was still publicly visible on one of the largest sites on the internet.</p>

<p>MSM doesn&#39;t want involved, because they know once that box is opened, the very people who attempt to direct public thought from the hills of Washington will undoubtedly be implicated. It&#39;s almost a certainty. We have proven examples of pedos in power. Those who were either caught, or thrown to the wolves as convenient sacrifice.</p>

<p>In my mind, the pedo thing is an almost inevitability with those a the top. That&#39;s why they&#39;re into all this weird art and shit. Not because they are devil worshippers (and they may be) but as further means to separate themselves from &#39;common folks&#39;. Once money and power is achieved, what else is there? How does such narcissism remain fed? How do they fill that void when the peak is reached? Well, they become &quot;cultured&quot;. It&#39;s a higher level of understanding, to you and I at least. Of course, that&#39;s what they tell themselves. Us regular people cannot understand the enormity and scale of the things they deal with, right? How stressful it must be to simply look the part of a politician. The pressures of lobbyists throwing money down your gullet. To have 6-7 months off per year, and have lackeys or think-tanks write your proposals for you. So stressful, that this higher level of citizenry comes with a default understanding issued towards those beneath. It sums up everything and is reminiscent of walking through a pretentious NY art gallery where people create meaning from nothing. It&#39;s a bunch of: &quot;You wouldn&#39;t understand..&quot;</p>

<p>I understand quite well. When everything is achieved, the desire for just a little more is just too hard to pass up. They think they are part of history. A new version of the Roman Senate. Being an &#39;aristocrat&#39; comes with other responsibilities and deserved pleasures. This is a higher level of existence, after all.</p>

<p>I have no idea if this has anything to do with pizza places. What I do know is human tendency. One simply has to look around. &quot;Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts, absolutely&quot;. It applies to cops, professors, your boss, your parents; everyone. The very top just take it a bit further. They feel they are entitled to whatever is within their grasps--including the power to prey upon the most innocent among us. You wouldn&#39;t understand..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay.  Sorry that had to be so rough.  There seems to be a problem of one definition here.</p>

<p>You seem to see pizzagate as a larger entity and would like to focus on a positive thing that it has done.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a problem with your focus.</p>

<p>But to me (and many others), pizzagate is defined by some core assertions:</p>

<ul>
<li>John Podesta&#39;s emails contain coded discussions that are evidence of a pedophile ring.</li>
<li>Comet Ping Pong and associated businesses are the physical location of many of the alleged crimes committed by that ring.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be clear, neither of these has been substantiated.  </p>

<p>As for me, I believe a name should reflect the nature of the thing as closely as possible.  To me, twittergate may have incidental links to pizzagate, but it has nothing to do with the core assertions and claiming it as a success for pizzagate isn&#39;t warranted.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad we could get to the bottom of this together.</p>
