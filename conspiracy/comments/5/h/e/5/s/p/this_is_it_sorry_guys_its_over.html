<p>The other day I was talking to my friend (not awake) about Pizza Gate. I presented him with facts and shit and you know what he told me &quot;coincidence&quot; and I almost laughed. I was like &quot;nothing revolving around political figures is a coincidence&quot; and then I brought up 9/11 and how it was a &quot;coincidence&quot; that the anti-air weaponry was down for a simulation and how it was a &quot;coincidence&quot; that a plane crashed into the financial division of the Pentagon. He was like &quot;lol yea that&#39;s all coincidence&quot; I immediately stopped speaking and went home. </p>

<p>This world isn&#39;t gonna change anymore. It&#39;s time to enter the finale of this theater. The media and the establishment have brain washed people to the point of no return. I&#39;m very glad that people like you guys share my views. </p>

<p>Sorry this is a rant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy is that PG is real.  What&#39;s terrifying is the religious nature of this propaganda.  People are literally acting like they have been &quot;saved&quot; and you aren&#39;t if you haven&#39;t &quot;woken up&quot;.  I mean it&#39;s the exact same taxonomy.  Of course damn near every person has a different concept of how much of the rumors they believe, etc.  But the criticisms you will receive range from bullet point lists of other pedophile events, to questions about whether you are working for the evil ones.  All of these are clever but invalid arguments that are designed to catch people that want to believe this.  I personally think someone has been studying the fuck out of psychology and social media and turned a virtual weapon against us.  Also note that this phrasing of you are ignorant (asleep) but can join them (awake) is again, another tactic to get you to want to believe it.</p>

But what actual evidence is there for this that can be traced to a source that can be proven trustworthy? To me, by virtue of Occam&#39;s Razor, it seems that Russian trolls/disinformationialists spread this story in hopes of distracting vast swathes of people from the real issues at hand, the foremost being that Russians successfully got a puppet candidate elected in the U.S.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with want.  The system is working perfectly, because we go to our meaningless jobs to support our families and binge on TV and movies and buy new TV&#39;s and cars and gadgets. </p>

<p>This has been happening for DECADES, and our children are born into a world of dreams and illusions.  We literally are unable to see the truth.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re anywhere near the finale yet, but I think hard times are coming.  The fake news smear is more about keeping the fragile system going for as long as possible to keep the powerful powerful and the rich rich and the destitute destitute.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have found that when someone&#39;s worldview is questioned, they behave in ways like this. so you have to appeal to their ego to want to question their own worldview. or get them to realize being &quot;proven&quot; wrong in a debate means you learn something... which is also not an easy task ... 🤔 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at other power structures that have been exposed for pedophilia, then sure, something like this is possible. But what actual evidence is there for this that can be traced to a source that can be proven trustworthy?
