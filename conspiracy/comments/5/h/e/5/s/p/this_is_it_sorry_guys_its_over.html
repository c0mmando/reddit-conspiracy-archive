       This is it. We can't do anything else. People aren't willing to wake up. This world has gotten to the point where intellectual debates have disappeared and are replace with yelling and insults.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other day I was talking to my friend (not awake) about Pizza Gate. I presented him with facts and shit and you know what he told me "coincidence" and I almost laughed. I was like "nothing revolving around political figures is a coincidence" and then I brought up 9/11 and how it was a "coincidence" that the anti-air weaponry was down for a simulation and how it was a "coincidence" that a plane crashed into the financial division of the Pentagon. He was like "lol yea that's all coincidence" I immediately stopped speaking and went home.
      </p>
      <p>
       This world isn't gonna change anymore. It's time to enter the finale of this theater. The media and the establishment have brain washed people to the point of no return. I'm very glad that people like you guys share my views.

       Pizzagate has 0 actual evidence for it. Of course people are going to be sceptical if you don't present evidence. I assume your friend has been around for more than 1 year on this earth.

       The conspiracy is that PG is real.  What's terrifying is the religious nature of this propaganda.  People are literally acting like they have been "saved" and you aren't if you haven't "woken up".  I mean it's the exact same taxonomy.  Of course damn near every person has a different concept of how much of the rumors they believe, etc.  But the criticisms you will receive range from bullet point lists of other pedophile events, to questions about whether you are working for the evil ones.  All of these are clever but invalid arguments that are designed to catch people that want to believe this.  I personally think someone has been studying the fuck out of psychology and social media and turned a virtual weapon against us.  Also note that this phrasing of you are ignorant (asleep) but can join them (awake) is again, another tactic to get you to want to believe it.

       Yup. These nonstop evidenceless conspiracies creating false equivalence with our actual Manchurian president is the actual brainwashing. It's not mysterious powers-that-be though, you could go on 4chan or 8chan in the past couple years and see this all planned out by ideological fascists sharing desinformitsaya play books and stuff.

       Sadly, you're correct. I was speaking (texting) with a friend of mine who doubts a lot of my research, and I asked him if he heard of peetza geight/komet pin g pon g, and he said no, aside from what I had already told him. So, if we think the general population is waking up, they aren't. Let's not fool ourselves here.

       I agree with this but I think people are thinking more critically than what you would be lead to believe in this sub. It's the same thing that happened to r/politics. It was flooded with disingenuous users but at the end of the day,  it didn't work.  I believe a lot of people are open to the idea of the pedo ring within our government and the more we discuss it, the better

       If you look at other power structures that have been exposed for pedophilia, then sure, something like this is possible. But what actual evidence is there for this that can be traced to a source that can be proven trustworthy? To me, by virtue of Occam's Razor, it seems that Russian trolls/disinformationialists spread this story in hopes of distracting vast swathes of people from the real issues at hand, the foremost being that Russians successfully got a puppet candidate elected in the U.S.

       Look at all the evidence showing Donald Trump is a pedophile. No one cares.
      </p>
      <p>
       He called a 12 year old Paris Hilton hot. He walks into the changing room at Miss Teen USA. His good friend who he cohosted child sex parties with went to prison for child rape. He was accused of child rape stemming from the same parties.

       There's no point in trying to convince someone of specific conspiracies. It's more important that you convince them to learn critical thinking and to be more observant regarding historical fact. I usually start with the Iraq war since most folks don't like the facts surrounding the intelligence reports and little miss incubator babies.

       Have conversations and explain it to people. Relying on emails and memes doesn't work in this case. I've woken up lots of people by just explaining the situation to them. Explain wikileaks, the Podesta emails, the findings, the censorship and explain how it all fits together. This works. Then, send them to explore the situation themselves.

       I've tried. Believe me. It's just that they aren't willing to believe even for a second that what they are told could be lies. And it's beyond the point of no return. Alduous Huxley predicted this bullshit.

       Honestly, there hasn't even been a major tangible defining bomb shell that is indisputable proof to the people that the govt is totally corrupt; but despite that, there are still hordes of people who are woke or waking up.  I think this trend will continue.  And if there is ONE major revelation that leaks out, its honestly just all over with for them.  People are waiting for it

       Here's the thing...  It's not that people aren't willing to wake up, it's that we've been so woefully hypnotized, so lied to, so manipulated, so used and abused, that we
       <strong>
        can't
       </strong>
       wake up.

       It has nothing to do with want.  The system is working perfectly, because we go to our meaningless jobs to support our families and binge on TV and movies and buy new TV's and cars and gadgets.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been happening for DECADES, and our children are born into a world of dreams and illusions.  We literally are unable to see the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how the system works, it's planned this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think we're anywhere near the finale yet, but I think hard times are coming.  The fake news smear is more about keeping the fragile system going for as long as possible to keep the powerful powerful and the rich rich and the destitute destitute.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're completely owned and operated, and we are so blinded by the system, we can't see the truth.

       But don't you see? The truth IS that we are completely owned and operated. Years ago no one would have believed that statement. Everyone will awaken when they're supposed to...with or without intervention. It's happening, and it's happening very quickly from my vantage point. I am amazed at how many more people have awakened in the last 10 years. It's truly breath-taking, and very exciting!

       But by the same token, lots of people in the past felt the way you feel now about everyone waking up.  I think that's the way it feels when you're awake.  But people wake up in waves, and not everyone even wakes up.  There will be new things in the future that many are asleep to as a result of waking up to this moment in time now.  We sleep, we wake, we sleep, we wake... until we don't.

       i have found that when someone's worldview is questioned, they behave in ways like this. so you have to appeal to their ego to want to question their own worldview. or get them to realize being "proven" wrong in a debate means you learn something... which is also not an easy task ... 🤔

       If you look at other power structures that have been exposed for pedophilia, then sure, something like this is possible. But what actual evidence is there for this that can be traced to a source that can be proven trustworthy? To me, by virtue of Occam's Razor, it seems that Russian trolls/disinformationialists spread this story in hopes of distracting vast swathes of people from the real issues at hand, the foremost being that Russians successfully got a puppet candidate elected in the U.S.
