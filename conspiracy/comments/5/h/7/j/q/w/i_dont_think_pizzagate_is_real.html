    <div class="md"><p>What, pray tell, is the point of this?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe it, why stir the pot?  I don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my current assessment:</p>

<p>Is pizzagate itself real?  I don&#39;t know personally.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there illicit images of children online?  Yes.</li>
<li>Do people have to somehow create these images in order to distribute them?  Obviously.</li>
<li>Do lots of children go missing each year?  Yes, ABC News (take it or leave it) has reported that about 800,000 children go missing each year.</li>
<li>Are some of these children used for sex trafficking?  Yes, though I don&#39;t have any numbers handy to say exactly how many... We know it&#39;s a big problem, though.</li>
<li>Are there people out there who abuse children?  Yes.</li>
<li>Are some famous and elite people pedophiles?  Yes.</li>
<li>Is it feasible that some pedophiles get together to do their horrendous activity?  Yes.  Supply and demand, among other things.  Plus, if you have connections, it&#39;s not only easier to get what you want, but easier to get away with what you want.  This is true for drug users, and it logically seems true for child abusers, too.</li>
<li>Is it feasible that some people have a network of children at their disposal?  Well, given the above, I&#39;d have to say yes.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t know, honestly.  This is just basic logic I&#39;m using here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of that has anything to do with Pizzagate. Getting tired of pointing this out over and over. Pizzagate is a specific event with a handful of people, nothing else that happens in the world is proof of Pizzagate. Pizzagate needs it&#39;s own evidence and victims. It has neither, it has reasonable cause to investigate and that is all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then stop pointing it out?</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is that there&#39;s a precedent for this sort of behavior and that there are networks (big and small) that do this stuff.  Therefore, is pizzagate really that big a stretch?  I&#39;m starting to think no.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right, maybe this was a bad decision. I can admit I might have been wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are some of these children used for sex trafficking? Yes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok I have to say you are right about this. I mean child sex trafficking rings are a reality. I know that. Everybody knows that. But what makes this different is that people are claiming it&#39;s somehow a systemic problem in Washington that has been covered up. And frankly I just don&#39;t see how something like that could be covered up. Plus I don&#39;t see how politicians would be specifically predisposed to pedophilia. That&#39;s my whole problem with it. I&#39;m not able to come to terms with the logistics of it and I haven&#39;t seen any explanation of <strong>how</strong> that cover up would be done.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all my problem is with it. Like maybe I&#39;m stupid but I always did believe that there were at least <strong>some</strong> honest people in washington, either politicians, journalists, law enforcement or otherwise, who would be able to find evidence and blow the lid off of something like this.</p>

<p>I mean the gravity of what you people are pointing to would have to be simply <strong>massive</strong> and I don&#39;t think it would be possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because you can&#39;t see it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not real.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not saying pizzagate itself is real, but the sex trafficking is a serious thing that we should pay attention to.  I&#39;m also saying that there are networks of people who do this on the regular.  </p>

<p>Also, the implication that because it&#39;s huge, there would be leaks...  that&#39;s a false assumption.  Did you see the Anderson Cooper video yet?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpFFpfsK4jk&amp;amp;app=desktop">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpFFpfsK4jk&amp;amp;app=desktop</a>  What happened?  Why hasn&#39;t this blown open?  Budgetary reasons?  Come on.  How can we not find money to investigate something of this magnitude?</p>

<p>Again, my focus isn&#39;t on the pizza aspect of pizzagate, but rather the fact that there are people who do this, some of which are going to be elites.  Look at Jerry Sandusky or Dennis Hastert. Both are elite in their own way, both have been busted.  That doesn&#39;t mean the abuse stops, that just means some abusers are gone now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying, there are things that happen regularly that you are  not aware of - some by your own choice, some by others&#39; people&#39;s choices.</p>

<p>To claim that it&#39;s impossible for this sort of thing to happen is outrageous.  <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42108748/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/massive-online-pedophile-ring-busted-cops/">This shit happens.</a></p>

<p>They get away with it until they don&#39;t.  They keep it secret until it is no longer a secret.</p>

<p>Just because it&#39;s awful to imagine another human being acting sick and perverted and such is hard doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to jump in but Im willing to waste time so here is my guess for what it&#39;s worth: I think you, as an individual, could try to get into politics or to be a judge or a chief of police, but when you try to get to the top, at some point they invite you to a meeting to discuss important matters and then they drug you. Then they put child slaves on you and film you raping and eating the kid. At this point you are one of them. You are part of the brotherhood and you will NEVER reveal the truth about your brothers. Those that did were killed or ridiculed into oblivion. That is the world you live in. A massive mafia maintained by blackmail over child rape is in charge of every important political institution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard this before. Yeah. Maybe. I recognize this as a possibility in some circles, frankly.</p>

<p>But the problem with pizzagate is that people are discussing such a widespread systemic problem, that essentially the implication would be that <strong>all</strong> of our world leaders, <strong>all</strong> of our politicians, <strong>all</strong> of our media, <strong>all</strong> of our journalists, <strong>all</strong> of our law enforcement, <strong>all</strong> of our public and private institutions would be complicit in this cover-up of a worldwide child sex-slavery ring.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just seems impossible for a practical point of view and then there&#39;s not much in the way of hard-evidence for it. </p>

<p>Like I admit there are some anomalies that should be investigated further but it would be impossible for that level of organization and open practice to happen because the way it&#39;s being described <strong>it would have to being practiced openly</strong> basically. </p>

<p>Right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People that feel like conspiracies this large could never be kept secret are not understanding that the big secret is not kept by thousands. No secrets are kept by the laypeople, they just serve an agenda unwittingly. Their superiors know they follow rules of people higher than themselves but not all the reasons why and money stops a lot of questions from being asked. The step above them know that there are things their subordinates should never hear about. Their superiors know that there is more to the story yet and by the time you get to those who know the full story, you&#39;re talking about just a relative handful. Those are the only people keeping Big secrets.</p>

<p>In this manner, not only can they cover up a massive pedophilia network, they can cover up literally anything and, if it doesn&#39;t suit their agenda, they do. They can fabricate anything and the common populace will accept it. They control everything that is daily life to that end and by those means so you live in a society where literally nothing is not used to deceive you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so how does it all get covered up then? That&#39;s my biggest thing. I mean the logistics of what it would take to cover up a massive operation like that are staggering.

    <div class="md"><p>Ask yourself one question. How did the other pedophile rings go undetected for so long? It&#39;s not as if it&#39;s impossible to hide it. It&#39;s as simple as blackmail. If you don&#39;t keep your mouth shut you go down in flames with everyone else. That keeps the circle complete and free from outsiders, until eventually someone gets too comfortable and becomes complacent. They start to openly flaunt things that to them seem harmless, but to others begs to be questioned. That&#39;s when people start to notice and begin investigating. </p>

<p>Look at Jimmy Savile he was involved in pedophilia and sexual abuse for SIX DECADES and it wasn&#39;t until after his death that anything was found out about it. Nearly 500 people filed formal complaints against him between 1955 and his death in 2011, not once was he ever investigated. He likely wasn&#39;t alone in it and it&#39;s beyond obvious that BBC was covering for him. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the first time this has happened and sadly it likely won&#39;t be the last. To assume it is false without some critical thinking is naive. To think that the media does not collude with high level celebrities and government officials is naive. To believe anything the MSM tells you without checking direct sources is also incredibly naive.</p>

<p>No one knows what is really going on behind Pizza Gate, there is a lot of pedophilia related  nuances like logos and codewords. No one knows the extent of who is involved. That doesn&#39;t mean we should dismiss it. There are far too many coincidences to dismiss this.</p>

<p>Why is it that your average Joe  pizza shop owner is considered one of the 50 most influential people in DC. A place full of the most influential people in the country?</p>

<p>Why does that same man have close ties to both Podesta, The Clintons and Obama?</p>

<p>Why did that man have pedophile related artwork posted all over his social media accounts?</p>

<p>Why does another near by pizza shop with an owner who yet again has high level government ties have strange pedophile related posts online? Why is one of their most responsive followers a DOJ employee who is assigned to a team that investigates pedophilia? Why was their logo a pedophile symbol?</p>

<p>Why is it that the Clintons and Podesta are close friends of Jeffery Epstein a known pedophile? Why have they been on his plane nearly 30 times? The same plane he was known to traffic underage girls on.</p>

<p>Why is it that immediately after the Clintons  visited Haiti a number of young girls were reported missing?</p>

<p>Why is it that half a dozen young journalists who were investigating the Clintons all have mysteriously died?</p>

<p>This is just a sliver of the strange coincidences that lead people to believe that there is something to Pizza Gate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean in fairness I&#39;ve read a lot about it but I just didn&#39;t see anything that really was damning to me other than that the one guy was sort of perverted on his instagram, but that&#39;s just what I would expect of liberals IMO lol. I mean maybe it&#39;s a possibility, but it&#39;s pretty far fetched with no damning evidence. But I&#39;m open to the fact that I missed something that maybe some person could produce. </p>

<p>I just think it would take a lot of evidence to prove something like that IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I don&#39;t think it&#39;s specifically a &quot;liberal vs conservative&quot; issue but I mean let&#39;s be real, there are numerous personal, ideological, political and policy reasons for pervs or satanists or whatever you guys think these people are to become democrats.</p>

<p>(I&#39;m sorry, I really am a very far-right person and that&#39;s how I think about liberals lol, please don&#39;t hate me)</p>

<p>Actually the point I was trying to get at was that I think it&#39;s pretty normal for liberals to engage in &quot;mock satanism&quot; and &quot;mock sexual debauchery&quot; or &quot;taboo&quot; just for the shock value. It&#39;s just a part of liberal culture IMO. So when I see someone like James Alafantis or whatever his name is doing it, I don&#39;t necessarily take it seriously and jump to the &quot;he&#39;s a fucking pedophile&quot; conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not all just the leaders of these institutions that&#39;s who the elites target for blackmailing . They use pedophilia itself to blackmail or family.  Most the the time they appoint a corrupt person to these institutions to easily control them and everyone below them.

<p>Alrite, but lets presume that podesta really is a massive pedophile (even though that&#39;s not necessarily what I believe). That&#39;s not really what people are talking about tho is it? Aren&#39;t people talking about a more widespread, systemic problem where this sort of thing is just normalized and practiced almost openly? I mean based upon the &quot;evidence&quot; people are throwing around about whats on these peoples instagram pages, this would essentially be something like an open practice in Washington. Which means that everyone would have to know about it. Which would in turn mean that <strong>everyone</strong> was a pedophile. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that one person like john podesta is or is not a pedophile that I&#39;m disputing. We all know that pedophiles are, unfortunately, out there. I mean, I&#39;m not trying to accuse the guy but fuck, maybe he is for all I know. It&#39;s the implications that would suggest the scope of the problem would be <strong>far</strong> beyond anything possible to coverup.</p>

<p>That is quite a jump in logic.  It&#39;s known that there was an investigation quite a while ago, as <a href="https://youtu.be/o6W8H5Z0XAc">noted here</a> that there were 5200 people who were alleged to have purchased child porn in the DOD ALONE.  </p>

<p>Of those, according to Mr. Cooper, only 2/3rds were checked, and 262 of the 3500 were found to have done so.  That assumes that another 130 or so are still out there in the remaining 1/3rd.  That&#39;s 400 people in the DOD ALONE (sorry for repeating that) who are into child porn.  </p>

<p>As for the conspiracy thing, the entire NSA and CIA (and contractors) had hidden the US metadata gathering for quite awhile before Mr. Snowden exposed it.  And the NSA people consider what they are doing totally legal, and still it was silent.  This paedophile thing is blatantly illegal, and the stigma associated with it is horrific.  The Catholic church hid their priests&#39; molestation and covered it up for decades.  Using that same logic, <strong>EVERY CATHOLIC</strong> molests young boys.  You can&#39;t make that jump in logic.</p>

<p>What you can do is what is happening now.  The idea that power players are out there fucking little boys and girls is so outrageous, (sort of like priests fucking little boys), that people just don&#39;t want to believe it, and so ignore the signs right in front of them.  it&#39;s a defense mechanism, and I am not a doctor or psychologist or behaviorist, but I am a fan of history.  And I can see the trends of things occurring in history before all having these same charecteristics - crazy allegations that are proven true after many attempts to expose are shot down through pressure from the powerful, not necessarily to protect the guilty, but top protect those ASSOCIATED with the guilty.  </p>

<p>Podesta may not be a paedophile himself, but he certainly is a facilitator for it, and that keeps him in power, as he knows their secrets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol yeah I saw that and that&#39;s what peaked my interest enough to even make this comment. Before that I didn&#39;t even put the slightest bit of stock in the thing. That plus Alex Jones going on air and telling people not to worry about it. I mean I actually don&#39;t like or trust Jones for one minute but that to me was something totally antithetical to what he does.</p>

<p>There might be something to it. I&#39;m not totally close minded to it. I just don&#39;t think, in practical terms, that it wouldn&#39;t involve &quot;everyone&quot; the way it&#39;s portrayed as (like the idea that these people are practicing openly on their instagram page would mean everyone in washington knows, wouldn&#39;t it?). Or that it would be possible to cover such a thing up if it was really on a big scale. </p>

<p>So what I&#39;m saying is that I know there are pedophiles, and there certainly might be pedophiles in Washington somewhere, but I just don&#39;t think that this is happening in the conspiratorial sense that people are portraying it.</p>
