       Some folks think the PG pushers are being weirdos. But if anyone "lampoons" a PG pusher, they get accused of supporting pedophilia. It's a vicious circle and it's not helping to protect any children.

       let me pose this true story and please comment: my brother was molested by a catholic priest when i was 9, he was 11. Im almost 40 now and my parents have never said one word to me about this. I didnt know until he told me when i was 25. My parents continued bringing their many children to the same church and tithing the same. Many victims reported to the police and diocese for MANY years. Did my parents know about the criminality happening in their parish? in fact MANY people knew, but never raised above a whisper for many years. What would you do if your child was taken by a priest, with his friends to the YMCA, to play b ball, and when you picked him up later, his hair was wet from the shower and he was uncharacteristically withdrawn?

       I too was raised in a Catholic household, I too have strange and unwanted memories from my childhood. That doesn't change a thing. Pizzagate is a fucking meme. It has no connection to the Catholic church so I don't know why you felt the need to share your story. Was your brother molested in a pizza place in Washington DC?

       yeah, you cant answer the last hypothetical. When i say "lampooned" i mean anyone , a-n-y-o-n-e including the 49th most powerful man in DC, MUST PUT UP WITH CRITICISM...whether they deserve it or not. YOU and your apologist peeps want perfectly legal and within-their-rights investigators to "LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!" Should my parents have left the church, or should they have said "leave the priests alone!"

       Part of the reason your thread has zero upvotes is that you aren't using the word "apologist" correctly.  I had to read the entire thread twice to figure out what you think it means and which side you are on.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a difference between an "apologist of Alefantis" and an "apologist of a conspiracy theory called Pizzagate".
      </p>
      <p>
       Those two are on opposite sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word "apologist" can be substituted with "defender".  Your use of the word is unclear in all cases.

       eh heyyy!!!! youre right!!! thats interesting as fudge. my karma is always abysmal so upvotes are not my goal. im like a crappy comic artist that gets a poorly drawn toon with barely legible caption in a local free shopping paper.

       Which question? Be specific. Don't ramble. What question? What would I do if a priest took a shower with my kid? How does answering that question link back to Pizzagate exactly? How did you go from Pizzagate to Catholic priests at the YMCA? Which voice in your head am I supposed to respond to first?

       I don't have any alts. This is my only Reddit username. Could it be that you are such an abrasive and confusing person that you just naturally foster disagreements? Or perhaps, and this is where my money is, you are a paranoid person who believes that you are being gangstalked because you "know things" that you shouldn't know?
