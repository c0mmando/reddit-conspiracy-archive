    <div class="md"><p>let me pose this true story and please comment: my brother was molested by a catholic priest when i was 9, he was 11. Im almost 40 now and my parents have never said one word to me about this. I didnt know until he told me when i was 25. My parents continued bringing their many children to the same church and tithing the same. Many victims reported to the police and diocese for MANY years. Did my parents know about the criminality happening in their parish? in fact MANY people knew, but never raised above a whisper for many years. What would you do if your child was taken by a priest, with his friends to the YMCA, to play b ball, and when you picked him up later, his hair was wet from the shower and he was uncharacteristically withdrawn?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too was raised in a Catholic household, I too have strange and unwanted memories from my childhood. That doesn&#39;t change a thing. Pizzagate is a fucking meme. It has no connection to the Catholic church so I don&#39;t know why you felt the need to share your story. Was your brother molested in a pizza place in Washington DC?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, you cant answer the last hypothetical. When i say &quot;lampooned&quot; i mean anyone , a-n-y-o-n-e including the 49th most powerful man in DC, MUST PUT UP WITH CRITICISM...whether they deserve it or not. YOU and your apologist peeps want perfectly legal and within-their-rights investigators to &quot;LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!&quot; Should my parents have left the church, or should they have said &quot;leave the priests alone!&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the reason your thread has zero upvotes is that you aren&#39;t using the word &quot;apologist&quot; correctly.  I had to read the entire thread twice to figure out what you think it means and which side you are on.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between an &quot;apologist of Alefantis&quot; and an &quot;apologist of a conspiracy theory called Pizzagate&quot;.</p>

<p>Those two are on opposite sides.</p>

<p>The word &quot;apologist&quot; can be substituted with &quot;defender&quot;.  Your use of the word is unclear in all cases.</p>
