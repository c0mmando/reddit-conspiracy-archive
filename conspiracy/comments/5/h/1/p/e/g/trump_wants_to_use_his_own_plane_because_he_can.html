    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question. One would think that knocking off the U.S. Chief Executive on the last round of 8 would be a largely wasted effort. On the other hand, context. That said, this is why I&#39;ll never understand why anyone would actually want that job because on any given day it can be assumed there&#39;s at least 1 pissed-off customer who has nothing else to live for, and that job title, President of the USA, comes with a universal BullsEye on it, 24/7, for the rest of their days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually a smart move by Trump (or some genius in his hire) to defer on the new AirForce1 fleet, planes which are still in the design stage. The technology for a jumbo liner to &quot;steer itself into the ground&quot; definitely exists, and has been available since well before 9/11. </p>
