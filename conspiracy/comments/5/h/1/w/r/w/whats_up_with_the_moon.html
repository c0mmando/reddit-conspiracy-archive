       I think he means to say that the trajectory of the moon is significantly different from day to day.  when looking at the moon at the same time of day, everyday, it is in a drastically different spot.

       The moon isn't on a 24 hour cycle like the sun is. If you look at it at the same time every day it will be in a slightly different place each time, following a 28 day cycle.

       Thank you for that information. If you hadn't responded like a douche in your other comments I'd be more than happy to discuss some possibilities of what you may be observing. But since you're a "you don't believe what I believe so fuck you" kinda guy, I'm not gonna entertain a discussion with you

        You think there weren't people saying "Sunil Tripathi is not the Boston Bomber" when that happened? Of course there were. But just like with pizzagate, everyone was so damn sure they were right and so invested in it because "OMG we did it Internet!" that they wouldn't listen to reason. How'd that work out? Oh yeah the Internet was fucking wrong. Maybe it was Djokhar and Tamerlan. Maybe it was Academia/blackwater. Maybe it was DHS. Maybe it was the FBI. But it sure as shit wasn't Sunil Tripathi.

        Just an example to show you that, yes, the hive mind can be wrong as fuck sometimes.
       </p>
       <p>
        And I will continue to ask for evidence as any rational person should. There isn't one piece of evidence that implicates anyone to a specific crime. Only conjecture.
        <strong>
         I've said it before and I'll say it again, when I'm presented evidence that implicates someone, I'll be right there with you guys. Until then, I will keep asking for evidence and informing people that they don't have a damn thing other than a collection of wild rabbit holes.

Pizzagate is absolutely the dumbest thing ever.
Are you going to tell me that the escargot collection is hypnosis?
Do you buy into this shit too?
Want me to really enlighten you as to what happened, or are you going to figure it out yourself?
There is no pizzagate. It's make believe. Nothing has been happening. You've been lied to."

       "the burden of proof is on you."
      </p>
      <p>
       it's funny how often that is repeated by pizzagate deniers when one can easily say the same, the burden of disproving is on you. So far, No one has been able to disprove it, only conjecture and what 'They feel' is real or not "Oh they're just pizza symbols it's nothing!" but when it was called out they changed their symbol, as if there was something there.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what happens when you get pulled over and you smell like alcohol? You have to prove you're sober enough to be driving or get a nice little DUI. Here is the exact same thing, a lot of sketchy shit no one has been able to explain other then 'it's just their circle and harmless fun of what they're in to, it's their lifestyle man!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now the internet thinks some of these people are 'drunk as a skunk' so to speak, and then all of a sudden theres a grip of people saying "NAH You Need to PROVE they've been drinking, do you have pictures do you have video what do you have to Show that they're drunk?!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's their burden to prove they're "sober" not the other way around, it's the way it is, we're not going to start playing favorites for these fucks.

       "the burden of proof is on you."
      </p>
      <p>
       it's funny how often that is repeated by pizzagate deniers when one can easily say the same, the burden of disproving is on you. So far, No one has been able to disprove it, only conjecture and what 'They feel' is real or not "Oh they're just pizza symbols it's nothing!" but when it was called out they changed their symbol, as if there was something there.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what happens when you get pulled over and you smell like alcohol? You have to prove you're sober enough to be driving or get a nice little DUI. Here is the exact same thing, a lot of sketchy shit no one has been able to explain other then 'it's just their circle and harmless fun of what they're in to, it's their lifestyle man!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now the internet thinks some of these people are 'drunk as a skunk' so to speak, and then all of a sudden theres a grip of people saying "NAH You Need to PROVE they've been drinking, do you have pictures do you have video what do you have to Show that they're drunk?!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's their burden to prove they're "sober" not the other way around, it's the way it is, we're not going to start playing favorites for these fucks.
