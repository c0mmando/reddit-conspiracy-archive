<p>Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to <em>inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets</em>; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The people skeptical of the pizzagate theory are not the ones &#39;injecting false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets&#39;. They are the ones suggesting that the pizzagate theory <em>is the false material</em>. If anything, it&#39;s a JTRIG type tactic to push the pizzagate &quot;theory&quot;. The skeptics are... well, skeptical of it.</p>

<p>In my opinion, in the case of pizzagate JTRIG has been <em>very</em> successful so far. </p>

<p>So was the rampant Catholic Church&#39;s pedophilia not happening until there was PROOF? Was it likr Schroedinger&#39;s pedo&#39;s? It wasn&#39;t happening until there was definitive proof?</p>

<p>Listen, if you are not a reputation management agent, which I&#39;m gonna say I don&#39;t think you are, what do you think you are accomplishing by not allowing an investigation to occur in spite of all the evidence you are denying? </p>

<p>It&#39;s only &quot;known&quot; because one person posted on a forum what they claimed was an (unverified) FBI document showing such alleged &quot;code&quot;.</p>

<p>All the rest of what you say I agree with. I&#39;m not denying any of that and it should continue to be investigated whenever it rears it&#39;s ugly head. But the pizza = pedophilia hoax has nothing to do with any of that. It&#39;s sole purpose is to discredit alt news sources through the use of highly emotional subject matter. </p>

<p>That is my own personal opinion and should not be interpreted to mean the entire mod team agrees with it. Some are beginning to though.</p>

<p>It is basically impossible to have less evidence of a crime. You have not one shred of anything. You have infographics and youtube videos with no content that is illegal, even in the slightest.

    <div class="md"><p>There is plenty of evidence of which none you will come close to acknowledging. Also, you are just rail roading through the point of the post: you are asking for evidence but demanding proof. In a typical murder case, muddy foot prints are by no means proof of a crime, but it certainly is evidence. You are saying &quot;HAH, PEOPLE GET MUDDY FEET ALL THE TIME. YOU HAVE NO PROOF SOMEONE WAS MURDERED&quot; - even though there&#39;s a missing person AND blood stains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh I saw that comment before. You replied to me, blaming me for the catholic church&#39;s pedophilia as well. But you said it yourself, there&#39;s a missing person and bloodstains in a murder case - that&#39;s actual evidence.</p>

<p>Since you&#39;re such a big fan of semantics. Fine, Pizzagate has a lot of nonsensical evidence that would not allow any police officer to get a warrant. What most people want is some evidence that doesn&#39;t amount to weird tastes in art, stupid logos or massively out of context quotes</p>

<p>There is a talk/documentary about child prostitution as far back as the 1980s, focused partly around the Houston area.</p>

<p>Part of what they talk about is that the very partakers of this venture are not necessarily criminals but the pillars of society. They are often not investigated because, essentially, too many rammifications are possible that go as far as resuming normal operation of local, state, or even Federal government.</p>

<p>So the answer to your inquiry, why people who <strong>are</strong> pushing it haven&#39;t asked, is that they have and that&#39;s why.</p>

<p>Is it so strange to think that powerful people might get together and have a plan? </p>

It is the wild west out there, and until Trump stands down the continuity of government state of emergency, nothing will happen to them.  As it is, the constitution has been superceded, and that&#39;s why the DOJ and FBI haven&#39;t done anything. They are waiting.  The moment the state of emergency ends, obama and clinton will go to jail along with comey and then all these pedo people will be running scared.  Make no mistake, clinton and obama committed high treason, and if they didn&#39;t, then there should be an international tribunal to consider if the US president can have the authority to participate in international espionage himself, including psychological abuse of 350M people, edit (and wholesale murdered many million innocents), because that&#39;s what he did.
