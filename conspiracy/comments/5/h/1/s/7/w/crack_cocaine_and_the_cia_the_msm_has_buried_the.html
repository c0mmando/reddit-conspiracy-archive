        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many of you may not be familiar or aware of the crack cocaine epidemic that hit the inner cities of the US in the 80s (because a lot of you weren&#39;t even born yet jfc). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb">Gary Webb</a> investigated the conspiracy theory that the CIA had introduced crack to the inner cities, an idea prevalent in African-American communities at the time. When Webb&#39;s &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; stories came out proving this conspiracy theory as conspiracy fact, his career was destroyed by the same purveyors of &quot;truth&quot; in the current Pizzagate case. </p>

<p>Eventually</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Webb was found dead in his Carmichael home on December 10, 2004 with two gunshot wounds to the head. His death was ruled suicide by the Sacramento County coroner&#39;s office.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His work was vindicated by investigations by Congress and the contemporary CIA. But Webb paid the ultimate price for exposing the truth (which is a lesson that many of today&#39;s reporters understand). </p>

<p>The media is filled with cowards and bought shills who would rather have lies spoonfed to them as the truth. Not every journalist is like that, but most of them are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was sent to the Principal&#39;s office in 5th grade (~1984) for pointing out to my teacher that Coca-Cola in its original formula contained cocaine in the base form...</p>

<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QVrszTTSqasC&amp;amp;pg=PA61&amp;amp;dq=coca-cola+trace+cocaine&amp;amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=coca-cola%20trace%20cocaine&amp;amp;f=false">The Cocaine War: In Context</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given the economic and political power of the multinational corporation and all the historcal evidence, and despite the company&#39;s secrecy, you could say that Coca-Cola has a monopoly on coca. Stepan Chemical in New Jersey has exclusive DEA permits to import coca leaf and extract cocaine from it in the US. (Although the original Coca-Cola did have a trace of cocaine, it should be noted that by 1929 the amount was reduced from something under 1/400 of a grain (per ounce of syrup) to just a memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_formula">Coca~Cola WIKI</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coca-Cola was originally one of hundreds of coca-based drinks that claimed medicinal properties and benefits to health; early marketing claimed that Coca-Cola alleviated headaches and acted as a &quot;brain and nerve tonic&quot;. Coca leaves were used in Coca-Cola&#39;s preparation and the small amount of cocaine present in the product gave the drinker a &quot;buzz&quot;. In 1903 Coca-Cola removed cocaine from the formula, substituting caffeine as the stimulating ingredient, while dropping all the product&#39;s medicinal claims. The coca plant remains part of the formula; it is believed that coca leaves are imported from Peru, then treated by US chemical company Stepan, which then sells the de-cocainized residue to Coca-Cola. The Coca-Cola Company declines to comment upon whether or not Coca-Cola contains spent coca leaves, deferring to the secret nature of the formula. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepan_Company">Stepan Company WIKI</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coca-Cola includes as an ingredient a coca leaf extract prepared by a Stepan Company plant in Maywood, New Jersey. The facility, which had been known as the Maywood Chemical Works, was purchased by Stepan in 1959. The plant is the only commercial entity in the United States authorized by the Drug Enforcement Administration to import coca leaves, which come primarily from Peru. Approximately 100 metric tons of dried coca leaf are imported each year. The cocaine-free leaves are sold to The Coca Cola Company for use in soft drinks, while the cocaine is sold to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallinckrodt">Mallinckrodt</a>, a pharmaceutical firm, for medicinal purposes.</p>
