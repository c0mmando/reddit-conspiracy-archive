       UPDATE: Mother of Monica Petersen says she does NOT believe her daughter committed suicide. Washington Post is covering this up:

      <hr/>
      <p>
       Yesterday's WaPo hit piece (
       <a href="http://archive.is/SWJ1y">
        http://archive.is/SWJ1y
       </a>
       ) conveniently failed to mention what Monica discovered in January 2016:
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4og64Y4.png">
        http://i.imgur.com/4og64Y4.png
       </a>
       and this:
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/f2j3QME.png">
        http://i.imgur.com/f2j3QME.png
       </a>
       and tried to make it seem like she was in Haiti advocating for sex-worker rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Background on Monica's death:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ecwad/the_complete_guide_to_monica_petersens_mysterious/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ecwad/the_complete_guide_to_monica_petersens_mysterious/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Washington Post quoted her professor/boss Claude d'Estree (who previously worked for Dyncorp) saying Monica committed suicide. They also have quotes from a friend of Monica, Domina Elle.
       <strong>
        Well, the same Domina Elle was saying 2 weeks ago that Monica was murdered, possibly by her local boyfriend
       </strong>
       . Here is my conversation with her:

      </p>
      <p>
       Some highlights:
      </p>
      <p>
       me: Even if you think something along the lines of a local boyfriend who killed her or something like that - it's very possible that boyfriend connected with Monica just to see what she knows
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Domina: Likely story trust me
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       me: why did she go back [to Haiti]?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Domina: Love
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       me: Why would the boyfriend want to kill her?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Domina: I have nothing upon which to base such an assertion but it's another direction to consider. It's usually the first consideration that cops make isn't it?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       me: Also how will you trust the official cause of death by Haitian autorities?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Domina: It's very sad. Pisses me off. Haiti is a shit show. Would be easy to murder someone there especially a US national.

       The suicided part? It's a word we have just kind of made up. It's when someone's death is ruled a suicide yet they are shot in the back of the head twice, set on fire all while being stuffed inside a gym bag. i.e. a hit by TPTB that is framed as a suicide even though all evidence says otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were suicided. Hope that helps. I think OP just doesn't want to see that happen to you thats all 👍

       Domina alludes to Monica's death being a homicide and contacted me originally because I mentioned on Reddit that I spoke to a person who identified himself as a friend of Monica's boyfriend. She wanted to know if he should be considered a suspect.

       Nothing whatsoever. But I also know that the narrative that she committed suicide is misleading and wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The only reason the boyfriend is in that conversation with Domina Elle is because Domina wanted to find out who killed her and wanted to know if it's possible the boyfriend did it. I actually tried to help and connect you and her but she said she didn't want to speak with you. See in the chat screenshots.

       You yourself told me that, and I'm quoting your private message to me a few weeks ago
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         "She was definitely passionate about researching sex trafficking. I think worst case she could have pissed off a Haitian who was making money off of it (there are a bunch of brothels in port au prince that are full of Dominican hookers) but it didn't seem to me that she was deep enough in to be on anyone's radar. For all I know she could have been killed during a robbery gone wrong. Haiti is really sketchy so it's tough to rule anything out. The only reason why I'm even letting my mind entertain these scenarios is that I just don't think she would have killed herself. She was always really fucking optimistic and passionate about her beliefs."

       I was speculating in the immediate aftermath of a tragedy. I then said I didn't think she would have killed herself. Now all the sudden you're convinced that she was murdered and are bringing her boyfriend into it? I'm still waiting for answers but I haven't seen or heard anything out of pap that would have me believe she was murdered.

       Well, Domina Ella 2 weeks after Monica's death was convinced already that foul play was involved.

       Again, only reason the boyfriend is brought into this is because Domina Elle wanted to explore that angle and asked me if I knew anything about that.

       I guess I'd like to know how it happened and what the note said (I think I remember someone claiming that there was a note left). We really don't know anything other than the fact that she's no longer with us. All that said, I still don't get the leap to conclusions that this somehow is tied to the Clintons. I know people are looking for more answers and closure but this "cover up" stuff seems ridiculous.

       And it doesn't bother you that the Washington Post said conclusively that Monica committed suicide? How is it that me, a random dude on the internet, want to prove and find out how she died more than her friends and family? Do you see what's wrong with this picture?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand it seems ridiculous that Monica was killed as part of some grand conspiracy - but crazier things have happened. And based on her findings from Haiti that she shared with Bella in January 2016 - this should be the NUMBER ONE LEAD.

       The WaPo piece seems to be echoing what Radio Kiskeya released when they announced her passing. I'm not involved in State Dept. conversations with her family so I don't know whether or not the proof provided was sufficient and whether they still have unanswered questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course her friends and family want the truth but until we get any sign from her family that what they've received thus far isn't satisfactory, who are we to speculate about foul play or conspiracies? I've been on this sub for awhile so I'd never fault someone for trying to dig for truth no matter how uncomfortable it might be. I'm just saying in this case, and until any new evidence actually comes to light, it seems pretty unlikely that her passing is tied to something bigger.

       Hi! Sorry about your loss. I'm guessing the content of the note might be shared later and it's too soon now. Or maybe the family prefers to keep this last message from her to themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the leap of Clinton/Murder, it's a lie that was built from a single Facebook post and amplified using confirmation bias and suggestive narratives. If you remove the narrative (explanations and speculations from the person who first posted this) you will realize there's absolutely no reason to believe the conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, it's fair to call it propaganda since there's pretty much zero content to it besides the will to inspire doubts in the mind of the friends of Monica and her family. Propaganda is usually composed of 95% lie and 5% truth. The only truth in this conspiracy are the screenshot of the chatlogs. The rest is pure speculations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who promoted this propaganda seem to want to prove Clinton will murder anyone willing to publish stuff about her. It is also used to make Reddit ban or delete some posts, and imply that Reddit is also accomplice of murdering people by proxy or protecting pedophiles. So the self-interest of the creator of the conspiracy theory is not to expose the truth but to bend it in order to add weight to the Pizzagate conspiracy theory since that conspiracy theory too is based on very weak evidences.

       Blatant lies. She keeps telling you're making shit up and should leave that family alone. She's opened to cover-up but more in the sense of a race-based or gender-based crime that could be covered-up so it doesn't cause a scandal. Pretty high crime rate in Haiti btw, she's aware of this and I am too. And probably a few billions of other people too know about it.

       Nope, you are again spreading misinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason she even asked me to get in touch with her was because I mentioned in a comment that YouthInRevolt (without revealing his username) PM'd me and said he was friends with the boyfriend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the beginning of my chat with Domina. Right away she wanted to know more about him and how the boyfriend fits into all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since she was so interested in the boyfriend angle, of course that piqued my curiosity so I asked her some follow up questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's too bad that like the media, you too are more interested in burying this story than exploring all possible leads, with the Clinton connection being one of them.

       EDIT: here is where I mentioned it -
