    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll disagree. I&#39;ve had what I would consider to be reasonable <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> comments downvoted during this weekend. I obviously have no evidence backing the notion that CTR or some other brigade is the source of these downvotes, but they curiously only seem to happen when I&#39;m casting doubt at the PGate deniers. </p>

<p>These comments also follow a familiar pattern of being upvoted initially (by what ill hypothesize are &quot;real conspiracy sub readers&quot;) before being heavily downvoted until my score hovers close to zero. These posts never enter negative territory, which would seem very suspicious unless I was spouting something deeply offensive, but they always drop in their vote count to a level where they can easily fade in visibility. </p>

<p>I could also just be writing shit comments or completely missing the mark on this situation, which is entirely possible, but it&#39;s odd that this only seems to happen on this one particular topic when writing the same sort of position on another topic yields consistent upvote ratios and patterns. </p>

<p>Edit: As another commenter has posted, this could also just be the natural influx of more outsiders to this sub than we had, say 12 months before the election, but, again, the narrowly defined topics where this voting pattern happens makes it highly suspicious. </p>

<p>Not that I give a shit - this isn&#39;t /politics where a high vote count matters. Most of us just disregard the obvious shill posts and proudly accept downvotes as a sign that we&#39;ve said something significant enough to piss someone off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the notion that it&#39;s becoming commonplace for vested interested to employee teams of &#39;shills&#39; is very plausible. In fact, I&#39;d say it&#39;s so plausible that there is an entire industry that does just that. Reputation Management, or Online Reputation Management (ORM) in the modern age, is a service provided by most all modern marketing firms. After all, after perfecting sheer amounts of force, any government&#39;s next act of business is the marketing of information. Who is the enemy, who is the hero, etc... I&#39;d say there is an army of ORM services being implemented on a daily basis by political interests with deep pockets. Hell, even small business owners use the same practices in their marketing practices, albeit on a much smaller scale. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll add to this and speculate that a paid service may already exist within Reddit to notify companies of posts/comments that concern their brand or interests - allowing them to essentially brigade posts via an internal notification system. </p>

<p>That, combined with a team (even a single individual) tasked with very strategically placing their votes/comments can influence a great deal of people. </p>

<p>I have zero evidence of this of course, but it seems to me that this would be a natural product development path for Reddit to follow. </p>

<p>They could rely on tools like Google Alerts, but those are notoriously slow and of questionable accuracy in a PR game that requires surgical precision. </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>Reddit is inherently difficult for many brand new visitors to really understand on a deep, practical level... moreso for companies that operate at the top speed that their own internal bureaucracy will allow. But it&#39;s proven to be an immensely powerful platform that can launch stories at extreme velocities, rivaling Twitter and Facebook if not topping them in terms of overall efficacy and &quot;blast radius&quot;. </p>

<p>But In terms of the potential velocity, the &quot;highest velocity&quot; posts/comments are often determined as such within the first couple minutes of being posted... meaning that <em>without a rapid response team</em>, a post attacking a particular brand can &quot;take off&quot; and reach &quot;escape velocity&quot; (aka front page velocity) fairly quickly... and once it gets going, it becomes exponentially more difficult to stop with every passing hour. </p>

<p>That essentially means that whoever can get to a potentially toxic post first will determine whether or not it gathers enough traction to have any sort of impact. The inverse is also true, but to a lesser extent. Posts that ultimately rise to the top require a great deal more &quot;synthetic&quot; force to make an impact if they don&#39;t also have widespread &quot;organic&quot; votes... but being able to nudge a post in the first couple of minutes can often give it the opportunity it needs to find eyeballs &gt; upvotes &gt; exposure. </p>

<p>But I&#39;ll be clear, trashing posts/comments negatively is much easier and requires a lot less force, which is likely why we see quite a few strategies attempting to discredit conspiracy theories attacking Clinton during the election, but relatively few posts attacking Trump, who IMO has plenty of material that was attackworthy. Put simply, CTR could influence this sub by trying to control negative posts, but they never succeeded in launching a true set of posts to attack her competition like they were able to do on /politics where the &quot;organic&quot; support existed to supplement their &quot;synthetic&quot; push strategies. </p>

<p>Anyways, to get back to my main point and wrap up - Reddit has cultivated a massive community, but as we&#39;ve seen on both Twitter and Facebook and Google, their ultimately goal as a corporate is figuring out how to monetize this community. </p>

<p>So, it&#39;s reasonable to assume that Reddit would produce a tool that would allow companies and other groups to address this massive community in a way that is effective and monetizable. God knows they aren&#39;t going to make their billions off of selling Reddit Gold... so selling a tool to assist rapid response PR teams has gotta be something that they&#39;ve already developed or something that they are deeply interested in figuring out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a few examples of the types of services that revolve around &#39;reputation management&#39; a.k.a. &#39;shilling&#39;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trackur.com/">http://www.trackur.com/</a>
<a href="https://www.placesscout.com/reputation-management">https://www.placesscout.com/reputation-management</a>
<a href="https://www.buzzbundle.com/">https://www.buzzbundle.com/</a></p>

<p>Those are just a few of the near-stand-alone types of consumer products that are available for such purposes. Online reputation management services are usually offered as parts of larger marketing contracts from enterprise level firms. Building a web-crawler to constantly monitor popular social sites really isn&#39;t that difficult; the magic IMO is in the responses to posts/comments/articles.  Like you said, you see a <em>lot</em> more &#39;trashing&#39; posts and comments. In my very novice acquaintance with Natural Language Processing (NLP), I can say that forming a negative comment towards a potentially threatening statement is much more feasible than a positive rebuttal. </p>

<p>Let me break that down a bit; let&#39;s say there&#39;s a post alleging that Hillary Clinton forwarded classified documents to a foreign leader. That post/article/comment would have the potential to cause her cause great harm, and would likely show up on the radar of anyone monitoring her online reputation. Now, think in terms of automation; think in terms of handling the <em>entire</em> internet. Imagine a piece of software that could identify this type of post—which is easy to accomplish—and how to best stem the flow of information. To properly counter this accusation, you&#39;d need a language processing bot that would have to dynamically identify and counter specific points of information (accusations), find relevant data to back up the counter-claims, and combine them all into a syntactic manner that seems naturally constructed. As far as publicly-declared tech goes—that&#39;s impossible still. A good article on how this approach can fail is here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist">http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist</a></p>

<p>Now, imagine the approach of simply trolling such threads; adding broad, non-specific comments that not allege falseness, but also derail the conversation. A reply as such might be; &quot;More bs from the crazy right that hate women. When will people just grow the f<em>ck up?&quot;. That says &quot;this article is false,&quot; and also opens up a sh</em>tstorm of people defending each side of the argument until most people forget the topic and are simply concerned about winning an argument. </p>

<p>I used to help run a small website that covered alternative news. We&#39;d post 20 something articles to Google+, and maybe get a collective 100 comments across all of them. Now, if we posted a single article with the #israel hashtag; it&#39;d hit the 500 comment max in a matter of hours. Israel is well know to employ an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Internet_Defense_Force">Internet Defense Force (JIDF)</a>. I link to that, because I thought it was a running joke for the longest time, and didn&#39;t realize there was actually such a publicly acknowledged group. The comments on those posts were scarcely-related to the actual articles, and we say very little web traffic to the actual articles. That means, the battle was in the comments, and no one on either side gave a shit about the actual article. Such is the internet now; the facts and truth have little consequence with the majority of people simply take away an impression of the topic. You&#39;re completely right I think about the power of the rapid-responses to content. I&#39;ll even catch my self dismissing an article sometimes if I scroll down and the first three comments say that it&#39;s wrong, the site sucks, and that this is just more &#39;fake news.&#39; It&#39;s powerful because it works, even when you&#39;re  looking out for it.</p>

<p>Interests, be them political or business, are <em>terrified</em> of large numbers of organized people as the have the power to destroy at the drop of a hat. Dividing groups makes it easier to manage reputation, as well as dissent from whatever information is being marketed. I think that it unprecedented if a group from a community such as r/conspiracy were to conspire to stem the bleeding caused by the war on information being brought by the MSM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is a great post and exactly the type of deconstructive logic i like to see here.</p>

<p>you&#39;ve pointed out HOW reddit posts can be gamed from concerted voting early in their lives, and how comments can be pushed the same way to legitimize or marginalize perspectives conveyed by posts.</p>

<p>we know part of reddit&#39;s monetization strategy is to consult with marketing and PR groups to help them better use reddit as a business tool.  this is a professional service and an &quot;analysis tool&quot; like the one you&#39;ve described would be an integral part of the model.  </p>

<p>Much of reddit is open source, other than their proprietary voting algorithm.  There are clearly many people and groups who use scripts to set up listeners on reddit.  you find the same accounts posting early in threads on certain subjects.  specific brands (mcdonalds and coca cola being two obvious ones) have likely been using reddit voting for years for brand management.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll cut to the meat: there&#39;s no need for Reddit to offer a service like that, because individuals and organizations are currently able to do just that through glorified scripting.  It&#39;s how its worked for ages.  Google alerts is a consumer product.  The &quot;big boys&quot; with a bit of tech knowledge have been able to do this already on their own.</p>

<p>Healthy skepticism is important. And informed discourse and discrediting of false facts or leads is imperative. I respect informed dissenting contributions that have actual important points to make. We all need to keep our minds open.</p>

<p>What shills do, paid or not, is sit there trolling any and all PG- related post or comment just for the sake of trolling. They don&#39;t go beyond &quot;fake/insane/you people/zero evidence/russian&quot;. The narrative changes every few days.

<p>The only reason you get so riled up about people yelling &quot;where&#39;s the evidence!&quot; is because you have no real evidence.  You&#39;ve got some really normal looking emails about a gift basket of cheeses, kids coming over to swim, and pizza. And you&#39;ve found out a liberal gay guy living in DC has some NSFW content on his instagram. There&#39;s nothing substantial at all, yet you&#39;re getting pissed at SKEPTICS. </p>

<p>The worse part is when you guys get backed into a corner, because then you pull the &quot;well yeah, there&#39;s no smoking gun but you gotta admit it&#39;s kinda suspicious.&quot;  and then go right back believing everything 1000% when all the skeptics are gone. Someone will completely disprove a piece of &quot;evidence&quot; and you&#39;ll be like &quot;Okay, that evidence is bad but what about THIS EVIDENCE!&quot;. And then guess what you&#39;ll do after that arguments over? YOU&#39;LL GO BACK TO USING THAT DISPROVEN PIECE OF EVIDENCE IN FUTURE GISH GALLOP COPY+PASTE SPAM. And why will you do this? Because you don&#39;t actually care what the truth is.  You just very desperately want it to be true for whatever reason. You want so bad for there to be a pedo ring that caters to all the liberal elite you hate so much so that you can demonize them in your head.</p>

We&#39;re looking for that evidence as well. That&#39;s all this sub is about. Leave us be to our work on finding it. If you have some shred of human decency you will understand what we&#39;re trying to do. If not then i fear greatly for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well thats just completely wrong, The largest sub here The_Donald has been absolutely ripped to pieces by more and more backend manipulations and rules by the admins, they are essentially forcing T_D to leave sooner or later.</p>

<p>And as for &quot;breaking rules&quot;, that could be true with PG, I really never followed it at all - but I have followed and participated in 3 or 4 subs here that are wikileaks/julian assange centric, and every single one of them has been systematically had their narrative controlled 1 at a time, its pathetic and pretty obvious, unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; doesn&#39;t MAKE it true, I agree with that. But once the evidence is there - it doesn&#39;t stop being a conspiracy. Friend, you should reevaluate all the times in your life that you yourself may have been part of a conspiracy. Remember - it&#39;s just a group of people planning something harmful in secret. These happen time and time again in the workplace, and with your family and friends. Yes, even high level government officials are guilty of it. What do you call it when people conspire to overthrow a government in secret? Why does it stops being a conspiracy because there&#39;s evidence for it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK I&#39;ll give you this one then I&#39;m out--won&#39;t do the back and forth with you since that&#39;s your game, not mine. Back when there was a PG Reddit, someone came on and said they hacked into We the Pizza&#39;s password protected back end and found MBs of videos and pics of CP. They posted videos and pics to prove authenticity--people on 4Chan and Reddit who looked to see if it was legit saw: A toddler with pins shoved in her clit; a child being anally raped in a cage; a live amputation without anesthetic. Now--either this was a real hack, and WTP, who they found connections into the rest of PG is guilty of OUTRAGEOUS crimes against children; OR whoever is covering up PG posted these to justify closing down the PG Reddit, which happened shortly thereafter. Whichever the case, all agreed the videos were unquestionably real, and if it was to frame the Reddit, whoever did it went to alarming, sinister lengths to do so. I don&#39;t care which is true, or even if it is some third option, so argue as you will. These videos demonstrate that WHETHER OR NOT these people MIGHT be innocent, investigation must happen, as children must be saved--and if authorities won&#39;t do it, people must. Any anyone on here spending all day trying to shut it down are morally, ethically corrupt as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Passed through the traditional political subs Friday night sharing my thoughts, with expectation of downvote into oblivion for not supporting the narrative. Imagine my surprise when many of those thoughts received upvote traction and lead to actual conversation. </p>

<p>This observation with be in line with a 9am-5pm M-F operation. May be some outside core hours staffing in place, but not the same numbers capable of drowning out all unapproved thought profiles. </p>

<p>To assess activity I think we should be exploring comment trends rather than submission activity. As next step it would be interesting to analyze comments per hour across a sub then explore the distribution. </p>

<p>Anyone aware of tools available to further collect and explore data regarding comment behavior in a sub?</p>

<p>It would be cool to play with this more. Hell just exploring daily word-frequency would be interesting to filter out the message of the week being pushed, and possible set of associated accounts. </p>
