       It's time to step back from all this crazy propaganda that we are bombarded with.  We need to see what's happening here.   What the real conspiracy is. It's not one sided.  There is no party to vote for that is going to change things and they are both equally corrupt.  While we fight over who is the corrupt one, they continue to fuck us.  We're manipulated through single issues or lifestyle.  So fractured and compartmentalized with media to defend any side.  To confuse us.

       Which is exactly why I've given up on Republican social issues I don't agree with... Have all the guns you want, I don't care anymore. I'm sick of squabbling over the shit no one will ever change (abortion, gun rights, etc) so we all won't start having conversations that matter.

       They used the abortion issue as long as they could, then gay marriage, guns, etc. All the complete b.s. issues that you should not decide a leader on at the national level. I was surprised to se abortion pop back up this time.
I am super pro 2nd, pro choice, pro marriage equality (or govt out of marriage whichever).

       I try to stay logical at all times and I am mindfucked. They did a good job. Is Trump legit anti establishment, possibly. News today though leads me to believe something is going to happen, like he wasn't supposed to win (the news being CIA "confirming" Russia interferred, while simultaneously Trump chooses an Exxon CEO a company who allegedly had a multi hundred billion dollar deal stalled by sanctions on Russia after the invasion of Crimea). Before Trump I believed elections were rigged (even thought he was a fake candidate up until he really started bringing out the dirty stuff) and maybe they are, but Hillary could have easily taken it if the elections are rigged. Of course it's possible Trump was supposed to do this.

       It's all got me thinking this has nothing to do with Russia and everything to do with dividing America. They already have the two political sides hating each other enough to commit physical violence, and honestly, some would kill each other over it no doubt. Then again the wikileaks and fake news and new propaganda bill make me think things happened that were legit anti establishment.
I am just completely unsure, but I do think if it's a put on, it's about dividing us in a severe way.

       If you actually just take a step back you will realize nothing happened that was anti-establishment. Nothing. And here's why: because nothing
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       happened yet and nothing will. As in, it's all just talk. Remember, Trump stated, even before he was elected, that he will expand the NSA, renew the Patriot Act, not abolish the Fed, infringe on the second amendment without trial, and loves Israel. That is as establishment as it gets. That's Obama 2.0/Bush 3.0.

       Yeah, well I knew his platform was b.s. I was just solely anti Clinton. Not an actual Trump supporter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really think Clinton wanted to go down in history as the first female president. Before this election I fully believed the elected officials were chosen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows though maybe she was told from high on up that it just couldn't be and that we needed to divide the people more than she needed to be the first female pres.

       However, some of his moves have been pretty anti establishment in regard to Russia. At least the conflict of interest of this appointment. It could be seen as a middle finger to the fact that the US and EU fomented revolution in the Ukraine and the Russian sanctions would be lifted. I mean, the dude might not, but Obama admins sanctions allegedly stopped a 500 billion dollar deal with Russia with his corp.. if that's a true story and not just a news story to make him seem like a conflict of interest appointment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly the news is so full of b.s. how do I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       We really need to break it down and get all new officials and media laws and funding laws regarding campaigns and lobbyists.
It's too much of a mess, makes my head spin.

       I like how when you see that what you'd expect if some type of cabal of elites were choosing the president DOESN'T happen, the first thing you come up with is that cabal of elites suddenly had some massive change of heart and chose Trump. Instead of, you know, around a hundred thousand voters in the rust belt voting for some empty promise of jobs coming back in droves.

       Picking CEOs from major companies is not necessarily  a bad plan. He needs people who know the industry and most importantly know the underbelly. It does not mean he'll serve their interests, if anything I think he'll throw them out (with their water tight any anti-lobbying paperwork intact) if he feels they're feeding him bad/deceptive information. This is a best case scenario.

       Legitimate question, is this sub so pro russia just because we're usually anti-american government? I feel like because russia is the antithesis of america, people here naturally gravitate towards their side and are less skeptical. The whole "enemy of my enemy is my friend" sort of deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like the idea of defaulting towards russia being the "good guys" (a relative term here) just because our government officials are the bad guys. It doesn't have to be either or.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or am I just missing something here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: So is it that we're just more critical of the U.S. because it makes sense to focus on where you live? That makes sense.

       Lots of pro-Russian sources, lots of ESLers in comments.  I would go so far as to say that communities like this are actively being steered to trust Russia sources and reflexively disregard American/Western sources.

       I don't must of us are anti-American government at all. We're against corruption in government, many of us even consider ourselves patriotic. If anything, some of us have hope that we can turn this country around. 
No one is calling Russia "the good guys". That's a vast oversimplification.

       Yeah no one blatantly calls russia the "good guys", but I've never seen a post critical of russia gain any traction here, and most of the time russia's side is taken for truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's a reason why I didn't say anti-american, I used anti-government in this context to denote how we don't like the current state of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       My post on it was simplified because I wasn't looking to write an essay, but that isn't to say my take on it is simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way I've come to the conclusion that we're just harder on the U.S. government because most of us here are American, and it makes sense to have your own house in order first before worrying about others.

       Because even if they aren't in actuality the cold war put that idea into most peoples heads. America vs Russia is one of the most played out narratives in politics today.

       In our grandparent's heads I guess, but my mom is like almost 60 and she holds no grudge against commies. It's a joke at this point. They've moved on, we've moved on, we're better now. Fuck all the agitators, man. Nothing nearly as compelling as the tamest wikileaks has came out to suggest that Russia did anything, and it's scary to see this hate being manufactured.

       Strangely enough, Obama has been reluctant to pursue the matter, IMO. Also, never forget the fact that his administration firmly denied the allegations of Russian interference in the first place (they denied seeing any indication of said interference).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Obama's hand has been forced, in a way. Now that so many politicians and news outlets are raising hell about this non-issue, he has to make some effort to investigate if only to help preserve his legacy.

       It's simple. If you don't like Trump you're a libtard. Libtard is a species that are only dragging muh Murcia down with their human rights, environmental protection, and lax immigration standards. Don't you know we need MORE military? We need creationism in schools and we need to dismantle the EPA so we can compete with China. It's all facts. Jesus, guns, and money. That's what America needs

       You've got to be kidding me. Have you even seen the congressional hearings where she's getting grilled about lying and causing the deaths of american citizens?  All that shit was brushed under the table cuz the cunt was considered "too big to jail". Theres a clear double standard when it comes to law in this country. If that talking point started in Russia (it didnt), you know what? I dont fucking care, as long as its true.

       dude, I can understand that maybe what you're saying makes sense according to your present worldview, but I promise you that is not how things actually are. There is leaked email after leaked email that demonstrates beyond any doubt that Hillary has done not just one or two things that would ordinarily lead to a prison sentence, but many, many things that would ordinarily lead to a prison sentence. Beyond that, you really don't even have to comb through any emails at all, because even the use of her private server and her mishandling of classified documents is itself sufficient reason for a prison sentence, and would most definitely result in prison if a civilian were to do it. (it's the same charge as Snowden's and Chelsea Manning's, it's pretty black and white.) My point being, looking at this stuff as though the absence of criminal charges and prison time is positive evidence in favor of innocence is a completely insufficient viewpoint, and it can be shown to be so very easily by very simple evaluation. Please consider these things as you continue forming your own beliefs. Cheers
      </p>

       Man, some people really do wear those tin-foil hats... The Russians really aren't the big baddies they were in 20th century. Get a hold of yourself. Clinton was taking us to war, toe-to-toe with the Rooskies, we might have averted Armageddon.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then, i'm sure it was the Russians who motivated Trump to campaign his ass off and actually converse with the people in rural America.

       That's just a bullshit talking point. Here are her own words, and they don't jive with that belief that she was taking us to WW3 with Russia.

       “We need to be putting together a coalition to support a no-fly zone,” Clinton said at a campaign event in Davenport. “I think it’s complicated and the Russians would have to be part of it, or it wouldn’t work.”

       You actually make a little bit of sense until you claim Trump is their tool. There is no reason to be so antagonistic towards Russia. Obama has already placed sanctions on them that end up fucking with economies in neighboring countries.

       Taiwan called him, by the way, and he decided to have an actual conversation. Oh the nerve of the man!! He's somehow more of a traitor than Hillary, who has actually been proven to be in league with foreign nationals!

       The reaction to Romney is 2012 in regards to Russia vs the left's revival of McCarthyism today is absurd.  Seriously, it needs to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of the left embracing Capitalism is also laughable...I mean. The Whole red-scare tactic from the left is too much.
