       Do you understand what is going on in the photo? If you do, then do you understand that where this region of the world is that this is big time reality happening en masse now. Look at the man and think of a super wealthy country near him that also does the same thing.

       The people that condone this also have conquered you. Pizza gate is incredibly censored because it is the crumb that leads to the horrible, horrible truth. Know that many people are dead that uncovered this, and more will be silenced to cover the fake news.

       Thank you for the kind words sir! If you do not have the capacity to cry for these children then you wouldn't be a good human. IF this country knew what exactly was happening there would be no more desire for money or material - only swift and righteous justice.

       The very sad thing is that when we buy oil from saudi, or when products invented in USA because of the freedoms we have are then taken to china and sold back to us for profit. We realize our money is supporting conditions that are not liberty or freedom. Its supporting factories that have nets around them to keep people from easy suicide. It supports throwing people to their death for being different. It supports journalists being thrown into black vans never to be seen again because they wrote about how the Chinese authority is doing something bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       The products invented here that come from brilliant minds, minds that are brilliant because they can exist in freedom and liberty. These products we buy everyday ensure that our money only furthers the tyrannical beliefs that liberty and freedom die in. IT was executed that way by laws and regulations. There is evil, yes there are those who are extremely fulfilled to dominate innocence.

       I too would like to see demonstrable verifiable evidence for the claim. So far, not a single person has been able to provide a shred of evidence for this claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       We skeptics are not convinced by personal feelings, unverifiable anecdotal claims, Wikipedia citations, personal blogs, coincidences, anonymous "reports", and speculations.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this were true, we would expect to see bodies, DNA evidence, forensics, blood spatter patterns, money trails, actual child organs, children who attest to the rapes, video recordings, pictures, witnesses
       <em>
        (including employees, customers, bystanders, etc.)

       , evidence that trails back to the parents who have one or more children missing, etc. But we have none of this.

       Yeah did you see that explosion? He just slipped up and missed a tree. He knew too much. See you say there's evidence that the car got in a wreck and as long as you use the word evidence and its in the paper than we can accept all is fine. Except your wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are dead people that tried to bring this evidence, one of those was in that car. The other had the last name of a news site that now is fake russian news, hes dead .. he was onto the sick podesta but its not Hillary running this. Another guy died on his couch recently in the UK, he was onto this. Hillary runs nothing. She is part of a big club, almost a secret one.

       You wanna know whats hilarious? Snowden taught us the NSA is capable of doing things with your devices and one of these is putting files on your computer at any moment. If you are a big threat to the establishment, one day you might be going to jail forever because you were raided and they found child porn on your HD. Only sick pedophiles go to jail and Jared Fogel on the news headlines. But this wikileaks emails from podesta linking up to places and pedophilia connections? Censored - banned - fake news - ridiculous. Snuggle up baby everything is just fine.

       Unnecessary as it was no challenge at all. Slapping down conspiracy nuts is a piece of cake. Any skeptic can do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All it takes is some critical thinking skills, an understanding of logical fallacies and the burden of proof, and to demand valid evidence.

       It sure beats being a gullible chump who falls for anything.

       Nope, the world cant be out to get me cause they are in the cage suffering with me - the enemy is tiny and weak, belief makes them powerful. 50k a year puts you richer by income than 98% of the world. Collectively the worlds 290 some trillion in debt so off to work we go. Paranoia comes with being afraid, fear isn't my choice of drug but its served 24/7 365. When you see the whole picture you'll see as pink floyd said: that this world is one we must all share and its not enough just to stand and stare.

       I like how you use the names conspiracy nuts and gullible chumps, and here you are in the conspiracy sub. Is this how you get your kicks? Come in to the "nut house" and point and laugh and feel superior. Do you feel wise? Easy to defend the group in control. Like the chinese man who says Americans freedom doesn't work China does it right - as his brothers are executed for speaking out. I can't even describe to you who your defending because eating an entire cake it one bite would choke you. So ignorance is the steak to a child - evidence is when someone tells the child the steak comes from a cow and the child is horrified.

       You want evidence it's in history, it's reading the laws, it's reading who these people were that we name streets after and hear how great they were but always shot dead oh well just crazies out there. Things are better now though cause since JFK no presidents been shot.

       As far as being in this fantasy world where every thing is fine and the people who have control aren't pedos. America is already great right? Big brother will tuck you in and give ya a kiss right as the monster comes out from the bed.

       I do not have evidence other than what PG is unfolding with and honestly it doesn't matter if they are or not if you knew the truth you would know that they are part of a plan that has done makes pedophilia look like a misdemeanor. If thats the key to exposing the group or waking people up then whatever but PG doesn't surprise me - when you lust to dominate human life and scar humanity and shatter innocence why would it surprise me their pedo's. Do you think Bill Gates is really the richest person on Earth? The ones up above dont go home and watch tv and plan vacation - they plot wickedness and domination over mankind. America is the last stop and damn if Trump isn't right when we needed it because Hillary would of brought us right into where we were headed. Working for Samsung.

       The child is horrified when he learns what the steak really is and its actually a pretty animal he seen in the field that is slaughtered to eat. The end of the rabbit hole is this.

       Do you have any evidence Hastings was doing anything related to PG?
      </p>
      <p>
       Afaik, all he did was send an email saying he was onto something big and the FBI was investigating him,
       <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/why-was-the-fbi-investigating-michael-hastings-reporting-on-bowe-bergdahl">
        which turned out to be true.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He also wrote several hit pieces- Gen. McChrystal had to retire because of a piece on him. He destroyed the Obama administration, comparing them to Bush when the NSA leaks came out.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.infowars.com/friend-michael-hastings-marked-for-death/">
        Reports of McChrystal threatening Hastings followed his death as well
       </a>
       it's info wars so I'll leave it up to you whether you believe it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hastings had lots of enemies, so unless you have a source for "it was because of PG" I think it's safe to say it was one of those people or groups that did him in.

       SOURCE? I have no source that will instill belief of anything in your head cause I am not your NEWS, GOVERNMENT, HOLLYWOOD, OR POPE. They are in control of the avenues of public influence and belief of normality. Pizza gate is them. They all fuck kids. Its not some sick fetish reserved for someone who s just twisted and mental. Its what they do, they aren't like regular folks who have no capacity to relate or imagine where these people are in their heads because these people are demons. Demonically possessed. Vessels of evil. Masters of Illusion. Merchants of doubt. Pretenders.. preaching good.. promising hope... praising God... worshiping death

      <p>
       You don't have to believe it unless you have a source or a proof or picture or something. Most people don't want to know. Some people just can't handle the truth. Ignorance is bliss.

       Again, if you think he got killed because of pizzagate, post the source. Otherwise stop BSing with 0 evidence while there are solid motives for people that actually did want him dead sans pizzagate. Don't drag everything into pizzagate if it doesn't belong there.

       By this same goofy thinking, I can point to the failed search for WMDs in Iraq as justification for a made up conspiracy about your pedophilia murder ring investigation. What is it you're hiding?

       Well then, lets use your own insane reasoning against you. Since you have officially been accused of pedophilia, we need to investigate who you've been associating with. We need to see your browser history, your spending habits, the names of the people you associate with, the places you go, your place of work, your bank information, and so on.

       Sure there's no actual evidence that hints you're a  pedophile, you clearly don't give a damn about truth which means you're now a pedophile. What are you hiding?

       But it says "#chickenlovers" so are they both adult male homosexuals sexually attracted to underage males? One is a girl so is this a sign of the trans agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       That seems very, very odd indeed.

      <p>
       "Chicken lovers" seems to give me almost entirely food related results, and it's a common name for a chicken-centric pizza.

       "Chicken"

       be gay slang, but it's not necessarily someone underage. It can refer to someone young, young looking, or an age gap.

       Jesus Christ, read the links. The figure is absolute bullshit (plus it's from a 2002 on 1999 data when more recent numbers are much lower). There are not 800,000 missing children a year. That was 797,500 reports concerning people &lt;18. Completely different to actually being missing.

       I can find an email saying that he kept in touch before this came to light, not more than that unless you count decades and decades ago? Doesn't make Podesta a paedophile or any of this true.

       Just about anything is possible, but there's nothing that remotely suggests any sort of crime here. You got fooled by 4chan shitposters saying Podesta was a paedophile based on a fictional code, and now there's desperation to try and prove this; without any specific crime, victims, etc.

       I see that you are an expert statistician. I am sorry for trying to confuse you with the difference between children being missing and missing children reports. Did you know that some of those children are missing many times over? I guess that whoever they were trafficked to reported them missing.

        Do you mean that 5,200 people in total were subscribed to CP sites. And that because some had .mil addresses the DCIS checked for DOD connections (employees or contractors), 264 of the 3,500 checked had these and some were charged.
       </a>
       But how on earth is that relevant, to accusing Podesta et al of paedophiles and murderers with no evidence of anything let alone specific crimes?

       I don't think you have any idea what he means there, if it's even typed correctly, nor do I. Why would you describe human trafficking as warm and weird?

       Are you referring to the handkerchief that's so important he didn't bother to get it back? From the short email with three typos including the author's name (pizza related mark perhaps)?

       Nope, you're looking at a fake image. It's taken from a wikipedia page on handkerchief code and a pizzagate e-vestigator has added white for sex with children. You can lookup handkerchief code on wikipedia, or dozens of other places and you won't find that.

       Source? If you're talking about AP stories it's because they never keep

        any

       of those, not sure if it's licensing or what.

        Why did the current head of the NYT defend known pedo Jimmy Sevile before he died and now comet pizza?

       "Sevile" lol. As I understand it Mark Thompson didn't defend Saville, but he may have tried to hush things up during the investigation following his death. What does that have to do with this though? It's not just the NYT pointing out that pizzagate is shitposting.

       Jesus Christ, read the links. The figure is absolute bullshit (plus it's from a 2002 on 1999 data when more recent numbers are much lower). There are not 800,000 missing children a year. That was 797,500 reports concerning people &lt;18. Completely different to actually being missing.

       I can find an email saying that he kept in touch before this came to light, not more than that unless you count decades and decades ago? Doesn't make Podesta a paedophile or any of this true. Look into any convicted paedophile and see how little-nothing close friends and family knew, let alone acquaintances.

       No, I've seen what you're talking about but I can't seem to dig it up at the moment. From my recollection it's not actually what you're saying, and may be graffiti that looks like cum. There's certainly other graffiti, something written about fucking?

       Just about anything is possible, but there's nothing that remotely suggests any sort of crime here. You got fooled by 4chan shitposters saying Podesta was a paedophile based on a fictional code, and now there's desperation to try and prove this; without any specific crime, victims, etc.

       Nope, the world cant be out to get me cause they are in the cage suffering with me - the enemy is tiny and weak, belief makes them powerful. 50k a year puts you richer by income than 98% of the world. Collectively the worlds 290 some trillion in debt so off to work we go. Paranoia comes with being afraid, fear isn't my choice of drug but its served 24/7 365. When you see the whole picture you'll see as pink floyd said: that this world is one we must all share and its not enough just to stand and stare.

       I like how you use the names conspiracy nuts and gullible chumps, and here you are in the conspiracy sub. Is this how you get your kicks? Come in to the "nut house" and point and laugh and feel superior. Do you feel wise? Easy to defend the group in control. Like the chinese man who says Americans freedom doesn't work China does it right - as his brothers are executed for speaking out. I can't even describe to you who your defending because eating an entire cake it one bite would choke you. So ignorance is the steak to a child - evidence is when someone tells the child the steak comes from a cow and the child is horrified.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want evidence it's in history, it's reading the laws, it's reading who these people were that we name streets after and hear how great they were but always shot dead oh well just crazies out there. Things are better now though cause since JFK no presidents been shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as being in this fantasy world where every thing is fine and the people who have control aren't pedos. America is already great right? Big brother will tuck you in and give ya a kiss right as the monster comes out from the bed.

       It was only ever one person with the girl at a time. Nobody ever said it couldn't be two different people though. As for the travel docs look around. The facts are out there. I can't immediately get it for you but I'm 90% confident it's there.

       If you're gonna bitch about me not being able to immediately find it and prove it to you first bitch at the motherfuckers deleting news stories and getting all the subreddits banned.
