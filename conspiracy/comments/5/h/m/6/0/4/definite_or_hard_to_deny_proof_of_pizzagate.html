    <div class="md"><p>The very sad thing is that when we buy oil from saudi, or when products invented in USA because of the freedoms we have are then taken to china and sold back to us for profit. We realize our money is supporting conditions that are not liberty or freedom. Its supporting factories that have nets around them to keep people from easy suicide. It supports throwing people to their death for being different. It supports journalists being thrown into black vans never to be seen again because they wrote about how the Chinese authority is doing something bad.</p>

<p>The products invented here that come from brilliant minds, minds that are brilliant because they can exist in freedom and liberty. These products we buy everyday ensure that our money only furthers the tyrannical beliefs that liberty and freedom die in. IT was executed that way by laws and regulations. There is evil, yes there are those who are extremely fulfilled to dominate innocence. </p>

<p>I too would like to see demonstrable verifiable evidence for the claim. So far, not a single person has been able to provide a shred of evidence for this claim.</p>

<p>If this were true, we would expect to see bodies, DNA evidence, forensics, blood spatter patterns, money trails, actual child organs, children who attest to the rapes, video recordings, pictures, witnesses <em>(including employees, customers, bystanders, etc.)</em>, evidence that trails back to the parents who have one or more children missing, etc. But we have none of this.</p>

<p>Unnecessary as it was no challenge at all. Slapping down conspiracy nuts is a piece of cake. Any skeptic can do it.</p>

<p>All it takes is some critical thinking skills, an understanding of logical fallacies and the burden of proof, and to demand valid evidence.</p>

<p>I do not have evidence other than what PG is unfolding with and honestly it doesn&#39;t matter if they are or not if you knew the truth you would know that they are part of a plan that has done makes pedophilia look like a misdemeanor. If thats the key to exposing the group or waking people up then whatever but PG doesn&#39;t surprise me - when you lust to dominate human life and scar humanity and shatter innocence why would it surprise me their pedo&#39;s. Do you think Bill Gates is really the richest person on Earth? The ones up above dont go home and watch tv and plan vacation - they plot wickedness and domination over mankind. America is the last stop and damn if Trump isn&#39;t right when we needed it because Hillary would of brought us right into where we were headed. Working for Samsung.</p>

<p>The child is horrified when he learns what the steak really is and its actually a pretty animal he seen in the field that is slaughtered to eat. The end of the rabbit hole is this. The world is run by a small group of persons who have livestock, but the way they treat the cows even a Texan red blooded mans man would go vegetarian.</p>

<p>SOURCE? I have no source that will instill belief of anything in your head cause I am not your NEWS, GOVERNMENT, HOLLYWOOD, OR POPE. They are in control of the avenues of public influence and belief of normality. Pizza gate is them. They all fuck kids. Its not some sick fetish reserved for someone who s just twisted and mental. Its what they do, they aren&#39;t like regular folks who have no capacity to relate or imagine where these people are in their heads because these people are demons. Demonically possessed. Vessels of evil. Masters of Illusion. Merchants of doubt. Pretenders.. preaching good.. promising hope... praising God... worshiping death</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to believe it unless you have a source or a proof or picture or something. Most people don&#39;t want to know. Some people just can&#39;t handle the truth. Ignorance is bliss.</p>

<p>He said one thing, and the video deliberately misrepresents what he said into something he clearly did not say. This is about as dishonest as it gets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I don&#39;t know how you can so easily dismiss the Pentagon investigation.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s a <a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/150/Red-Herring">red herring fallacy</a> that has absolutely nothing to do with the supposed Clinton pizza pedophilia sex ring.</p>

<p>Did you read what you wrote? Take a minute and reread this. Take a few more minutes if you&#39;re still not getting it.</p>

<p>You just contradicted yourself in the same sentence. You claim you understand and don&#39;t need clarification that it doesn&#39;t tie into the supposed Clinton Podesta stuff, then you go on and attempt to find a tie where you just admitted doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Red herring fallacy and speculation without all the fact. Taa daa! That was easy.</p>

<p>lol, no it doesn&#39;t. You already admitted twice now that they&#39;re not related at all. How does one thing warrant more interest in another thing that are in no way linked at all? Come on man, logic.</p>

<p>By this same goofy thinking, I can point to the failed search for WMDs in Iraq as justification for a made up conspiracy about your pedophilia murder ring investigation. What is it you&#39;re hiding?</p>

<p>1st What I meant by multiple videos is that there are multiple videos on YouTube of the same interaction between Biden and the thirteen year old girl</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? Truth is not dependent on the number of times someone reposts the same thing over and over. Either it has merit or it does not. The number of times you repost it has no bearing. That&#39;s just ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you can slow down the audio in each video and make out what he says he&#39;s horny.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what he&#39;s saying. That&#39;s ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t believe me find each video of that interaction on YouTube(like I did)</p>

<p>Once again, reposting the same thing over and over lends absolutely no credibility to whether it&#39;s true or not. That&#39;s ridiculous.</p>

<p>Fake. Prove it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>most people&#39;s thoughts are hmmm I wonder if there&#39;s controversy about pedophilia surrounding any other people in higher places</p>

<p>No they&#39;re not. You have no evidence to prove this nonsense, nobody with any sense is wondering if there&#39;s more to this nonsense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last even though there isn&#39;t solid damning incriminating evidence of Clinton Podesta scandal the fact that that&#39;s even a subject matter gets the metaphorical ball rolling towards the introduction that there might be an issue with pedophilia in high places</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit piled upon more bullshit wrapped in a bullshit burrito. You have no evidence at all and you don&#39;t care about what&#39;s true. At least have the balls to admit you don&#39;t care about truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we have enough small minute weird unsettling stuff</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Irrelevant, unrelated, and nonsense. You got nothing and the fact that you&#39;re desperately reaching this hard confirms it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also when it comes to kids there is no being to sure so keeping one eye open for any possibilities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am officially accusing you of pedophilia based on your suspicious accusal of others based on no evidence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s what this thread is about taking something small dissecting it and seeing if it lead&#39;s to a bigger trail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well then, lets use your own insane reasoning against you. Since you have officially been accused of pedophilia, we need to investigate who you&#39;ve been associating with. We need to see your browser history, your spending habits, the names of the people you associate with, the places you go, your place of work, your bank information, and so on. </p>

<p>Sure there&#39;s no actual evidence that hints you&#39;re a  pedophile, you clearly don&#39;t give a damn about truth which means you&#39;re now a pedophile. What are you hiding?</p>

<p>&quot;Chicken lovers&quot; seems to give me almost entirely food related results, and it&#39;s a common name for a chicken-centric pizza.</p>

<p>&quot;Chicken&quot; <em>can</em> be gay slang, but it&#39;s not necessarily someone underage. It can refer to someone young, young looking, or an age gap.</p>

<p>Source? If you&#39;re talking about AP stories it&#39;s because they never keep <strong>any</strong> of those, not sure if it&#39;s licensing or what.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Sevile&quot; lol. As I understand it Mark Thompson didn&#39;t defend Saville, but he may have tried to hush things up during the investigation following his death. What does that have to do with this though? It&#39;s not just the NYT pointing out that pizzagate is shitposting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see that you are an expert statistician. I am sorry for trying to confuse you with the difference between children being missing and missing children reports. Did you know that some of those children are missing many times over? I guess that whoever they were trafficked to reported them missing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/upshot/pentagon-declined-investigate-hundreds-purchases-child-pornography.html">Do you mean that 5,200 people in total were subscribed to CP sites. And that because some had .mil addresses the DCIS checked for DOD connections (employees or contractors), 264 of the 3,500 checked had these and some were charged.</a> But how on earth is that relevant, to accusing Podesta et al of paedophiles and murderers with no evidence of anything let alone specific crimes?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you have any idea what he means there, if it&#39;s even typed correctly, nor do I. Why would you describe human trafficking as warm and weird? Why would you use traffic as code for human trafficking? Why warm and weird which sounds strange as code? It&#39;s called making crazy assumptions.</p>

<p>John Podesta&#39;s brother Tony Podesta was on the same &quot;teaching&quot; trip as Hastert. The trip that Hastert admitted to molesting children during.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_to_People_Student_Ambassador_Program">Not a teaching trip</a> and I cannot find anything saying he molested children on that trip fifty years ago, got a source?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tony Podesta writes &quot;I have stayed in touch with Denny Hastert...all these years.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe I all ready said that he had stayed in touch, which doesn&#39;t necessarily mean good friends. You keep forgetting to read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>handkerchief pizza map</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you referring to the handkerchief that&#39;s so important he didn&#39;t bother to get it back? From the short email with three typos including the author&#39;s name (pizza related mark perhaps)? If you&#39;ve done your research you&#39;ll find that there are actually pizza related maps and pizza related handkerchiefs, you can find that in many comments on here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>White/black means bdsm child sex</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, you&#39;re looking at a fake image. It&#39;s taken from a wikipedia page on handkerchief code and a pizzagate e-vestigator has added white for sex with children. You can lookup handkerchief code on wikipedia, or dozens of other places and you won&#39;t find that.</p>

<p>ps.</p>

<p>Am I to take it that when you fail to respond to my follow-ups to your claims you&#39;re going to retire those now? Otherwise I can&#39;t see why you cannot come up with a counterpoint, let alone provide a source when I ask for one. You keep doing the gish gallop.</p>

Come in to the &quot;nut house&quot; and point and laugh and feel superior. Do you feel wise? Easy to defend the group in control. Like the chinese man who says Americans freedom doesn&#39;t work China does it right - as his brothers are executed for speaking out. I can&#39;t even describe to you who your defending because eating an entire cake it one bite would choke you.

<p>You want evidence it&#39;s in history, it&#39;s reading the laws, it&#39;s reading who these people were that we name streets after and hear how great they were but always shot dead oh well just crazies out there. Things are better now though cause since JFK no presidents been shot.</p>
