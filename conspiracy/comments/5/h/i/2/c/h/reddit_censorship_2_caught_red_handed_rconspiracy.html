       . This post was trending under the default 'Hot' tab at
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com">
        www.reddit.com
       </a>
       . Now it has been manually removed. Go to top, sort by past 24 hours. Find it's place in line with other posts with 9-10K upvotes. It's legitimately been censored out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is still listed under
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       . So it's only been censored off the front page. The majority of reddit users filter 'Top' by the front page though, or they just read the default trending front page, not the

       Reddit is compromised. It's not a platform for open discussion and democratic ideas. It is threatening democracy, open discussion and free speach ideals.

       pizzagate on voat is literally the pizzagate sub that was banned off reddit - in general I assume that most subs on here, especially the unscrupulous types like r/conspiracy, exist on voat in some capacity. The problem arrives if shitty mods own the sub tho

       So long as there is open lines of communication during the transition, opening an alternative sub with the trusted mods from here on whatever replaces reddit will be feasable. See theredpill subs contingency plans for an example of being prepared.

       I hate to point out, but reddit is a private company. Freedom of speech means as much on here as it would in a school. If they don't like what you have to say, they can and will remove it.

       If it's causing too many fights or is promoting views that they don't share or think are right they can manipulate the post.

       Reddit is a privately-owned social media platform where users have the opportunity to share ideas, and through a democratic process the most popular ideas gain the most exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The organization is performing underhanded censorship of these ideas to push a political agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's really put that in perspective. The media, as well as social media and all over Reddit, endlessly and verociously attacks media outlets, including Fox News and alternative media, for being biased. I have never once, in all the criticism of pushing political agendas, heard one user or journalist put forth this argument that you are putting forth in defense of Fox News or alternative media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is to a degree based on trust, the same way other media outlets are based on trust, such as newspapers or radio broadcasts. That trust is even more important with Reddit, because it purportedly has a democratic process in providing exposure to certain discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit does not publish that, "we are actively removing posts that fit our political agenda." When you post in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       , you are not met with a rule that says "posts which do not fit our political agenda will be removed." That's because this trust is important, and without it reddit would not be what it is today.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any private company is peddling shady goods or shady agendas, everyone would agree people should have a right to know about it. I think people have a right to know reddit has become an untrustworthy media outlet. It does not respect a democratic, open discussion of ideas.

       This is why people have moved to voat. I think the appropriate course of action here is to 'vote with your wallet' so to speak. If you disagree with reddit's practices you can democratically do your part by boycotting it. By not using it, you reduce their ad revenue. The more people that stop using the site, the more revenue they lose. If enough people participate and they lose enough revenue, it compels them to yield to their request.

       The thing is, I'm a PMC and a wood worker on the side. When it comes to my wood working, I refuse to work with certain types of wood that I find ugly. People buy my product regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
       All news is just that, a business. Eventually it became more profitable to sell stories that have a made up twist or that are clickbait. The thing is, most people get their news from the internet now adays and revenue from that is generated via traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
       News sources may be morally obligated to tell you the "truth" but are not legally obligated. Anything outside of slander or libel laws is up to their own discretion just like with you or me. That's why it's crucial that you as a consumer pick where you get your news. If you don't like NBC then don't watch it. If you don't like Reddit, don't use it  . It's very black and white honestly. The problem is the common man doesn't know how to differentiate between trustworthy and non trustworthy sources. But the same could be said when it comes to finding a good mechanic.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, we can't control how Reddit does business. We can piss and moan and rally and leave but in the end 95% of people on here are here for funny gifs and pictures and Reddit will continue to profit.

       I actually don't disagree with you too much, with the main exception being with the 'pissing and moaning' characterization. I'm operating under the premise that people have a right to know what they're buying as a consumer, and that's always the case with every private business because without trust business can't operate. If a doctor lies to your or misleads you, he or she is actually legally accountable. If a car salesman misleads you, they could also be legally accountable, depending on the circumstances. If a media outlet misleads you, we should have protection against that. I at least just want people to know that reddit is actively pushing its political agenda through censorship because I think it's important. And yes, I agree, reddit probably won't change, it's better to go somewhere else.

       Honestly,  I'm a firm advocate in sharing awareness amongst your community. One of the biggest things this world lacks now is intimacy. We don't have communities anymore.  Educate the people you know, be ready to defend your argument.

       This was a really good comment and it should have a lot more upvotes. I like the way you laid out how reddit and the news both work.

       One of the best tricks TPTB have at their disposal is the ability to get people to
       <em>

       what they see/hear on the news.

       E: If you're talking about
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       front page, reddut updates the list of subreddits you see after a specific length of time (forget if it's 30 minutes or an hour). But if you're subscribed to more than 50 subs, it rotates.
