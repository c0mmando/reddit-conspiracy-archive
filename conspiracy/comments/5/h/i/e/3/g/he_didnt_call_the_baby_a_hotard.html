       They are talking about the baby as though it were a handbag, that is by definition objectification. You can read into it what you want, it doesn't necessarily imply pedophilia but it certainly isn't a healthy attitude towards infants

       Eh nah I'd give a shit, just in a different way. I would definitely judge her for it - that's not a good attitude to have about children. I've met the type, mothers who basically use their kid as a conversation starter/just like the attention more than they care about the kid

       I'm not calling for a lynch mob and that was honestly one of the things that made me stay on this whole thing. When the first articles came out and said "ALT RIGHT RACIST HOMOPHOBES PUSH NUTJOB CONSPIRACY AGAINST INNOCENT PIZZA SHOP OWNER"
      </p>
      <p>
       Like no - If you wanna put me on the political spectrum I definitely lean far left, I have had several interracial relationships and several close gay friends. And I still think this shit is weird. I showed all the podesta art to a friend of mine who is bisexual and does some pretty racy art, and he was like yeahh whoever painted those was abused, and idk why that would be the theme of your collection
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact I got a phone call from a blocked number in the middle of the night for commenting on an article about this on face book. I deduced who had placed it (I got into a debate w/someone on the thread, they then went back and deleted their comments and blocked me, but I still had the window up)
      </p>
      <p>
       I got their number, called them back during the day from my actual #, they admitted to it, and I was just like "don't you see the irony? I was posting facts on a public forum, and you're harassing me for it! Like what?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I then proceeded to sign her up for wake up calls at 430 am for a week

       Honestly that was one of the most disturbing parts. I am 100% certain it was set to private, my guess is she figured out my real name and used a service to get it? Idk hella sketchy tho.
      </p>
      <p>
       I triggered her pretty hard to honestly it was super satisfying. Shes like 50 something and I was just like "Why are you acting like a kid?"

      <p>
       Her:"I'm not"

       Also at some point she was like oh all my friends know james none of this is true blah blah blha and i was just like do you know who jimmy saville is?
      </p>
      <p>
       And she did of course and her response was "well everyone knew" - yes everyone knew and no one did anything, exactly what is happening now
      </p>
      <p>
       IDK I put her on blast, I got a lot of conspiracy friends on facebook and she has a business page with her name attached so she really just came out of it looking like an ass

       Everyone knowing James gives her the motive to be a crazy person. Not saying this is ok, but watching an innocent person YOU KNOW get accused and being treated like a pedophile can make you go over the deep end.

       Hell, i don't even know the guy and im super pissed. But im more pissed at conspriacy theorists in general. Ever since the Dorner posts.

      <p>
       Dude he has NYT articles saying he's not a pedophile.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I was on a public forum. She basically doxxed me and harassed me, the behavior they are saying is not right. All I was posting was images from his own instagram and asking "why aren't any of these images mentioned or shown"
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you pissed? You were just telling me to think rationally and now youre saying you allow emotion to influence your judgment?
      </p>
      <p>
       And james instagram gives me a motive to ask questions, especially when the NYT report read like a fucking press release. And if she wanted to harass me she could have done it via FB
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I have her name, phone number, address, names of her family, place of business etc etc and despite my strong desire to stoop to her level, the worst thing I did was sign her up for wakeup call services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom Line: Dont buy the media outrage story - like where is the outrage about someone driving into trump tower?  Shouldn't that be just as much of a topic?   Also if your whole platform is "people shouldn't harass innocent people" then you turn around and harass someone who is innocent (I just posted jame's own images and words on articles about the subject, so I'm no more guilty than he is) it undermines all credibility you have and shows you're not interested in the truth you're just interested in being right which this woman obviously was
      </p>
      <p>
       And this attitude is precisely why pizzagate is still going on and people are still suspicious. Rather than address things like the emails, like the photos, like the strange videos, they just resort to ad hominems and lies. If they had responded rationally to the allegations rather than insulting the people making them, I know I would have dropped it by now. But its too late for that at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a case of me thinks thou doth protest too much
      </p>
      <p>
       And bottom line, if you want to make me believe your friend is innocent, making threatening calls in the middle of the night isn't the way to do it. All that did was make me way more suspicious. Censorship and threats are not the behavior of the innocent

      <p>
       An article not showing the instagram photos isn't censorship. Because as we have just gone through, the photos aren't evidence and don't have even the slightest inklink of pedophilia. non-sequitur

       And thats the whole crux of the issue - if these images aren't suspicious, wouldn't showing them help debunk pizzagate?
      </p>
      <p>
       But the bottom line is these images are legitimately suspicious. I'm not saying there isn't an innocent explanation, but the fact that none was offered is what made me suspicious in the first place. He didn't address any of the legitimate concerns and just acted like all these people were on him for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I have friends who don't own pizza places and they have more pics of pizza and food in general on their instagram than james.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also baby with money in mouth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Same money next to xanax bottle?
      </p>
      <p>
       The optics are highly suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The images are the reason CPP is taking so much heat, so why are they so loathe to discuss them?

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       OK so show them! It would help debunk this whole thing!
      </p>
      <p>
       But I suspect the reason they aren't showing them is when taken as a whole, it is pretty suspicious. I looked all over instagram at various pizza shops etc and didn't find anything that set off alarm bells the way Alefantis's did

       They don't debunk anything because they werent evidence in the first place. The photos don't prove he isn't a pedophile.

       Go ahead. Right now. Prove to me YOU aren't a pedophile.

       There is literally nothing he can do because no one will believe him anyways. Police could investigate today and not find the non existant basement and people would just say "it's a good secret entrance, he had time to seal it up, or the police are in on the pedo ring"

       What I'm saying is if these images are so innocent why don't want want people to see them. The fact that they glossed over them was bad journalism and highly suspicious. If they really wanted to quash they would have said what you're saying. But everyone I showed these images to agreed they are inappropriate at best. No one is saying we have proof - we have suspicions and podestas close relationship w hastert makes the suspicions perfectly valid

       Showing the pictures wouldn't HELP, it literally would do nothing more than make things worse. They will only serve to turn irrational people to the conspiracy where crazy nutjobs freak out over the baby taped to the table like it was some kind of baby bdsm allegory. The baby is smiling ffs, you dumb cunts gasp like it's literally child rape.

       Its 2 am and im angry as ragey fuck at your fucking WANT for conspiracy. Your fucking god damn need for this real life True Detective. To the point where you can somehow in your insane psyche you look at the instagram photos and somehow come to the conclusion that James Alfanteis has a secret basement to transport and fuck children. Like wtf. What level of udder fucking straw grasping. How the fuck do you get that from that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its baffling. Its utterly fucking baffling that people are not only coming up with this SHIT. But from the INSTAGRAM PHOTOS ALONE believing it.

       I certainly didn't say the phrase could only be interpreted in one way... but it is somewhat unusual. While many people do want babies and love them, that is NOT the usual comment when
       <em>
        seeing other peoples
       </em>
       -- that is usually more of an "OMG so cuuuuuute!!!!"... You see the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again: this
       <em>
        hints
       </em>
       at a possibility. Investigation is always holistic, so it is just another data point.

       <em>
        Evidence
       </em>
       is anything that supports a given conclusion. I encourage you to look up the word, and remember to use it properly in the future. Therefore, it is certainly wrong to say the pics are not evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you realize that legal standards are NOT
       <em>
        epistemological rules
       </em>
       . If a court doesn't allow a piece of evidence, that means that the court settled on certain rules-- it does NOT mean that the evidence
       <em>
        isn't evidence
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigation is holistic. Individual pieces of evidence support
       <em>
        countless
       </em>
       hypotheses-- the attempt at PROOF involves selecting a hypothesis and accounting for the evidence within it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given what evidence actually is, the pictures are certainly and undeniably evidence of the pedo ring hypothesis. They are also evidence for countless other hypotheses.

       To me, the most eyebrow - raising (though certainly still circumstantial) pieces of evidence are 1) the emails describing a pool party with 3 underage girls as "entertainment" who will be "in that pool for sure" and 2) the instagram pic of the kid taped to the table. I agree the "hotard" comments (along with a lot of others) are not real "evidence".

       The kid taped to the table is nothing! My dad used to tape me and my brother by the hands and ankles as kids and it was just stupid fun.

       But go ahead and send me a copy of the pool party one.

       If Alefantis was a parent and that was his kid, I wouldn't find the tape thing as odd. Here's the email thread with the pool party invite, which I'm sure some will write off as poor word choice, but it strikes me as really weird:

       It might all be nothing, but at the very least I feel the "debunkers" (NYT, WP, BBC, periodicals I normally consider reputable) did an insufficient job of debunking this one for me.

       Its weird, but not evidence of pedophilia at all. Not even the slightest hint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the email you just showed me, you might have something. But that's a very slim might. And it certainly doesn't point to this massive pedo ring of kid snatchers and linked pizza places.

       I agree, no one piece of it is really evidence of anything at all, period. Its just all taken together, one can't help but wonder.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am left-leaning and tend to trust the MSM most of the time but have made an effort to remove those biases from the equation on this. I recommend going further down the reddit/voat rabbit hole on PG, realizing ahead of time you will encounter a great deal of conflicting/obviously inaccurate information along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it goes way deeper than the pool party emails. Just an example, I found the "spirit cooking" ones strange too (search wikileaks for the emails then look up what spirit cooking is).
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at everything together, try to filter out the noise, and realize that on the off chance there is a crime being commited, it would be in the perp's best interest to create as much noise as possible.

       This is something I have to say. The main stream media isn't a "thing". It's a bunch of individual companies trying hard as fuck to out do eachother and be the first to break the breaking news.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that "fun" is part of the problem with conspiracy theorists. They want that excitement so hard that they will look for it in places that it doesn't exist.

       Hmmm like every media outlet on television is owned by one of five parent companies so yeah the mainstream media is a thing. It doesn't encompass all of media, just a big chunk. As someone who, again, typically subscribes to the mainstream media, it is
       <em>
        obviously
       </em>
       a thing.

       Also, the word "media" is plural, so the phrase "mainstream media" in no way suggests they are a single entity or all working in cahoots on every story or that they are dishonest. Define it how you want but there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       definitely a few media entities which wield outsize power over others, for better or worse. If you wanna deny that, that's cool brah, I won't continue to argue about it, anymore. But when I say MSM, I am referring to the 6 big media congloms, and I think most people understand that, so QED, it's "a thing".
