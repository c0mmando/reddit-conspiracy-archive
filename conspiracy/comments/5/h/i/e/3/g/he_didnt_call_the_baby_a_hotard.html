    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not calling for a lynch mob and that was honestly one of the things that made me stay on this whole thing. When the first articles came out and said &quot;ALT RIGHT RACIST HOMOPHOBES PUSH NUTJOB CONSPIRACY AGAINST INNOCENT PIZZA SHOP OWNER&quot; </p>

<p>Like no - If you wanna put me on the political spectrum I definitely lean far left, I have had several interracial relationships and several close gay friends. And I still think this shit is weird. I showed all the podesta art to a friend of mine who is bisexual and does some pretty racy art, and he was like yeahh whoever painted those was abused, and idk why that would be the theme of your collection </p>

<p>In fact I got a phone call from a blocked number in the middle of the night for commenting on an article about this on face book. I deduced who had placed it (I got into a debate w/someone on the thread, they then went back and deleted their comments and blocked me, but I still had the window up)</p>

<p>I got their number, called them back during the day from my actual #, they admitted to it, and I was just like &quot;don&#39;t you see the irony? I was posting facts on a public forum, and you&#39;re harassing me for it! Like what?&quot;</p>

<p>I then proceeded to sign her up for wake up calls at 430 am for a week </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly that was one of the most disturbing parts. I am 100% certain it was set to private, my guess is she figured out my real name and used a service to get it? Idk hella sketchy tho. </p>

<p>I triggered her pretty hard to honestly it was super satisfying. Shes like 50 something and I was just like &quot;Why are you acting like a kid?&quot; </p>

<p>Her:&quot;I&#39;m not&quot;</p>

<p>Me:&quot;Oh yeah, prank calls at 2am from a blocked number, super mature&quot;</p>

<p>Also at some point she was like oh all my friends know james none of this is true blah blah blha and i was just like do you know who jimmy saville is?</p>

<p>And she did of course and her response was &quot;well everyone knew&quot; - yes everyone knew and no one did anything, exactly what is happening now</p>

<p>IDK I put her on blast, I got a lot of conspiracy friends on facebook and she has a business page with her name attached so she really just came out of it looking like an ass </p>

<p>Dude he has NYT articles saying he&#39;s not a pedophile. </p>

<p>And I was on a public forum. She basically doxxed me and harassed me, the behavior they are saying is not right. All I was posting was images from his own instagram and asking &quot;why aren&#39;t any of these images mentioned or shown&quot; </p>

<p>Why are you pissed? You were just telling me to think rationally and now youre saying you allow emotion to influence your judgment? </p>

<p>And james instagram gives me a motive to ask questions, especially when the NYT report read like a fucking press release. And if she wanted to harass me she could have done it via FB</p>

<p>Honestly I have her name, phone number, address, names of her family, place of business etc etc and despite my strong desire to stoop to her level, the worst thing I did was sign her up for wakeup call services. </p>

<p>Bottom Line: Dont buy the media outrage story - like where is the outrage about someone driving into trump tower?  Shouldn&#39;t that be just as much of a topic?   Also if your whole platform is &quot;people shouldn&#39;t harass innocent people&quot; then you turn around and harass someone who is innocent (I just posted jame&#39;s own images and words on articles about the subject, so I&#39;m no more guilty than he is) it undermines all credibility you have and shows you&#39;re not interested in the truth you&#39;re just interested in being right which this woman obviously was</p>

<p>And this attitude is precisely why pizzagate is still going on and people are still suspicious. Rather than address things like the emails, like the photos, like the strange videos, they just resort to ad hominems and lies. If they had responded rationally to the allegations rather than insulting the people making them, I know I would have dropped it by now. But its too late for that at this point. </p>

<p>Its a case of me thinks thou doth protest too much</p>

<p>And bottom line, if you want to make me believe your friend is innocent, making threatening calls in the middle of the night isn&#39;t the way to do it. All that did was make me way more suspicious. Censorship and threats are not the behavior of the innocent </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And thats the whole crux of the issue - if these images aren&#39;t suspicious, wouldn&#39;t showing them help debunk pizzagate?</p>

<p>But the bottom line is these images are legitimately suspicious. I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t an innocent explanation, but the fact that none was offered is what made me suspicious in the first place. He didn&#39;t address any of the legitimate concerns and just acted like all these people were on him for no reason. </p>

<p>Like I have friends who don&#39;t own pizza places and they have more pics of pizza and food in general on their instagram than james.</p>

<p>Also baby with money in mouth?</p>

<p>Same money next to xanax bottle?</p>

<p>The optics are highly suspicious. </p>

<p>The images are the reason CPP is taking so much heat, so why are they so loathe to discuss them? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>OK so show them! It would help debunk this whole thing! </p>

<p>But I suspect the reason they aren&#39;t showing them is when taken as a whole, it is pretty suspicious. I looked all over instagram at various pizza shops etc and didn&#39;t find anything that set off alarm bells the way Alefantis&#39;s did</p>

<p>There is literally nothing he can do because no one will believe him anyways. Police could investigate today and not find the non existant basement and people would just say &quot;it&#39;s a good secret entrance, he had time to seal it up, or the police are in on the pedo ring&quot;</p>

<p>Money next to drugs? Thug life hommie g dawg. Nothing there. </p>

<p>I am left-leaning and tend to trust the MSM most of the time but have made an effort to remove those biases from the equation on this. I recommend going further down the reddit/voat rabbit hole on PG, realizing ahead of time you will encounter a great deal of conflicting/obviously inaccurate information along the way. </p>

<p>But it goes way deeper than the pool party emails. Just an example, I found the &quot;spirit cooking&quot; ones strange too (search wikileaks for the emails then look up what spirit cooking is). </p>

<p>Look at everything together, try to filter out the noise, and realize that on the off chance there is a crime being commited, it would be in the perp&#39;s best interest to create as much noise as possible. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a detective, but it&#39;s fun to pretend sometimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is something I have to say. The main stream media isn&#39;t a &quot;thing&quot;. It&#39;s a bunch of individual companies trying hard as fuck to out do eachother and be the first to break the breaking news. </p>

<p>And that &quot;fun&quot; is part of the problem with conspiracy theorists. They want that excitement so hard that they will look for it in places that it doesn&#39;t exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm like every media outlet on television is owned by one of five parent companies so yeah the mainstream media is a thing. It doesn&#39;t encompass all of media, just a big chunk. As someone who, again, typically subscribes to the mainstream media, it is <em>obviously</em> a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, the word &quot;media&quot; is plural, so the phrase &quot;mainstream media&quot; in no way suggests they are a single entity or all working in cahoots on every story or that they are dishonest. Define it how you want but there <em>are</em> definitely a few media entities which wield outsize power over others, for better or worse. If you wanna deny that, that&#39;s cool brah, I won&#39;t continue to argue about it, anymore. But when I say MSM, I am referring to the 6 big media congloms, and I think most people understand that, so QED, it&#39;s &quot;a thing&quot;. </p>
