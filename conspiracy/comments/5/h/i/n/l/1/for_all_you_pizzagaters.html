       There is no doubt that there are global pedophile rings and child trafficking that involve some of the richest and most powerful people on the planet, on this I am sympathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Y'all are about to get a fuckton more publicity in the next few days and I think we all know it's not going to be positive. On the other hand, as the saying goes, there's no such thing as bad publicity...
      </p>
      <p>
       There is about to be a barrage of people looking up #pizzagate and they already thanks to the armed suspect at CPP, and these people have already made up their minds about PG.
      </p>
      <p>
       There needs to be clear distinctions between facts, leads and misinformation, maybe a single purpose website that consolidates all this information. Even for me, who has poured over the documents and kept up with PG happenings, I can't point to a place where newcomers can see the pertinent details without having to wade through the noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a piece of advice from a spectator cheering on this citizen investigation...

       Aye, that user is pure gold and always posting good info. Much respect, I have for him. PizzaGate (for the majority of us), goes far beyond this election cycle and wikileaks, but all the way back to ancient times, and into modern times (one example would be Boy's town - Bush/Reagan call boys). This goes across party lines, and a pizza shack. It's far deeper, and this PG is nothing but, another lead.. I hope people realize this. Shills wont, but passerby's read these words. It's far deeper, and fuck all political parties. Sick fucks are on all sides, and far too ingrained in the establishment elite..

       You both know better than to ignore all the signs that this thing is being used as a set-up even if it's all 100% true. You both know how these things work and yet you're both right on board with the "Keep digging! Ignore everything else!" hype train. I expect better from the both of you.

       Unfortunately, I didn't say I was surprised. People like Putin and Bodysnatchers are precisely the targets this campaign is aimed at. If it weren't for the Pizzagate hype, these two would be putting the majority of their efforts into examining the Clinton Foundation and/or the very real possibility that Huma Abedin was an agent of a foreign government sending State Dept emails to a yahoo.com account.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll say it again:
       <strong>
        Even if Pizzagate is 100% true, it is being used as a distraction from something bigger and is positioned to be the trigger for the destruction of the First Amendment.
       </strong>

       I direct inquiring friends to read up on the leaked emails by podesta and hillary, followed by a primer video of pizza gate, check out the art work of the Podesta's, research pedophilia slang and dymbols, research what spirit cooking is and how hillary and podesta were talking about it. Check out MSM lies then watch video where a fellow redditor walks into the back of betsa pizza and shows basement stairs and doors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I focus on turning my skeptic friends into thinkers. They don't have to agree, I just want them to view it from Non MSM info.

       Good luck... pretty much everything directly related to Comet Ping Pong has turned out to be bullshit.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         all but 2 words on the code word list aren't confirmed anywhere. Several people have requested verification of the list words and instead of a link, they just got downvoted.

         <a href="https://i.sli.mg/A4uHcl.png">
          this "I love children" t-shirt?
         </a>
         It refers to
         <a href="http://www.lenfantcafe.com/">
          L'Enfant Cafe &amp; Bar
         </a>
         as it says right on the top of the Instagram picture. So, the shirt is really saying "I love the restaurant." It doesn't translate to "I love children" anyway, it translates to "I love the child." So, hardly a pedo shirt. It says "I love the child" because "the child" is the name of the place (L'Enfant).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Comet Ping Pong doesn't have a basement.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The pizza = sex references are all quite separate from anything to do with children.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The band flyers are typical punk rock flyers, nothing out of the ordinary at all.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The casual joke from the singer of that one band about pedophilia is also totally typical of a punk band. As are the ski masks.
         <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3GPwabLuOc">
          Underground bands can be creepy
         </a>
         , if you didn't know. That doesn't mean it has anything to do with pedophilia; creepiness is an aesthetic that a lot of people like in music. Especially when you're high on LSD or pot. People also like horror movies. It means nothing.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       What else?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing left I can think of is the Instagram profile picture they chose is a statue of Hadrian's younger lover, but he is clearly close to 18 in that statue if not well over 18. This could mean anything and is more likely to be a joke than anything else, imo. Perhaps it's some joke referring to the fact James dates older guys or perhaps it's some joke about the fact that James "likes 'em young" but not actually underage. The same kind of joke that punk singer threw out there. It doesn't mean anything at all without actual corroborating evidence. There is none out there on the Instagram or anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, pedophilia in government is real and yes it is connected to the Clintons in at least a couple ways. But, it is not connected to Comet Ping Pong. Focusing all this attention on Comet Ping Pong was a nice little distraction from the rest of the information in the Podesta email leaks, so congratulations. They're wagging the dog and you're it.

       Definitely likely to be a nickname.  Far more likely Alefantis calling his  (alleged) goddaughter a "retarded slut" in Urban Dictionary speak.

        You can clearly see

       from the discussion that they're all commenting on the cuteness of the baby.  User @joewills laughs at Alefantis's hashtag ("themostexpensiveaccessory"), and tags him back with "hotard".  Alefantis says "hotard" back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagaters, in their demented, sick world... turned it into "these guys are calling the baby a retarded whore!"  Then, one of these einstens with MS paint skillz captioned the photo with the Urban Dictionary URL in white text.

         They didn't read the whole FBI reports that clearly states those are official activists logos, they're not hiding much. The coins that were found with the symbol also had stamped on them "kids love pedo"! The full PDF also shows the source of that information on the bottom... Those information don't come from secret investigations but simple basic online search and maybe the computer history of some pedo. That too is written with the source (computer forensic team.) On Wikileaks, it's also written how to get another version of that report if someone cared to search ---&gt;

       Feel free to say something of substance, particularly if you have any actual evidence regarding any of the bullet points. You can start from the top and work your way down. Or, you can post irrelevant articles about pedophiles from around the world as most do, but that doesn't tie anything to Comet Ping Pong.

       The problem that has now arisen from pizzagate is that in terms of investigation it is now like gum that has been chewed until the flavour has gone. Meaning that it needs to evolve, and new evidence discovered by diversifying the investigation into critical and associated areas. That means vetting and paying for a professional private investigator to perform a proper documented investigation. You see, what this will do is show the world that the global citizen investigators are serious about this, because a P.I.'s primary job is to ferret out, uncover and document information that is admissible in court. This would in turn virtually shut up the media and the paid discreditors, especially if new evidence were to be found to advance the case. Eventually what you'll want is witness testimonies, and scared perps talking and turning on one another like a domino fall, to begin a perpetual momentum that will produce more evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other problem here and I'm just going to say it, is that people don't want to pursue this option because they'll have to stick their necks out. the P.I. will have to be paid by someone or a group and report their findings to that group. There exists no protection or punishment mechanism in place to safeguard people earnestly looking into these matters. For you are dealing with monied, politically connected and powerful criminals who have no human compunctions or legal obedience to the law. Laws which they have established institutionalised protection and fully insulated themselves and their accomplices from being called account to. They have zero issues with contracting professional murderers, fit-up men, or employing any other illegality to secure their freedom and lives from prosecution or justice.

       You could communicate with the PI anonymously online and pay with Bitcoin. Of course, these PIs could always be bought by the very people they're investigating, but I still think they could definitely help.

       I'm a huge fan of bitcoin and crypto currencies in general as I think they are the most effective tool to undermine control of the people. Bitcoin would be a good idea but an even better one would be to use Ethereum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ethereum is a crypto currency similar to bitcoin except that the platform was designed to be able to develop contracts that can be executed autonomously and anonymously using  blockchain tech.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could basically all pitch in and the contract would state something like "the party that is able to provide evidence that leads to the arrest of James Alefantis is entitled to the sum total of all deposits in this contract."
      </p>
      <p>
       The best part is that you could write a contract that could only have the funds released if 10, 25 or whatever percent of contributing addresses sign off to release the funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, I don't program so I personally couldn't do it but the technology exists to do something like this safely and free from censorship

       It's definitely not that high.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I will admit that the pizza language in the Podesta emails can not be conclusively proved to be about children, it's obvious that they are not discussing food and I think that that is where the problem lies.....There are no journalists that will ask Podesta what that means, and pushing him to explain why Obama would ship in tens of thousands of dollars worth of "pizza" from Chicago on the tax payers dime.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any pizzagater was being honest with themselves, they would have to admit that there is only circumstantial evidence to proof their case.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, given my (and others') knowledge of other cases where politicians and other influential people have been implicated in investigations involving child sex trafficking, I think it is totally reasonable to question what the pizza language in the emails means, especially when it is widely known, particularly to 4chan users, that cheese pizza has been colloquially used as code for child pornography for at least a decade.

       So because 4chan child porn enthusiasts (big overlap with Pizzagate investigators, no surprise) use "cheese pizza" as a code word ... that means when a pizza place uses "cheese pizza" they're really referring to porn?

       <strong>
        "How thin to slice it?"
       </strong>
       Jesus Christ, this is so clearly an in-joke between the Stratfor staff. The e-mail is addressed to the
       <em>
        entire Austin staff
       </em>
       , men and women alike.  Like
       <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/2b/0e/96/2b0e96d8cd8d7bc362fc72b72903a9e9.jpg">
        this woman
       </a>
       .  Damn, there's a guilty looking pedo if I've ever seen one!
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you
       <em>
        honestly
       </em>
       think 100% of this office just happens to be child rapists?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if they didn't order enough pizza last time or what, but all the jokes about filling out forms in triplicate, double-sided, color-coded, etc. is typical office humor. Plus, there's another e-mail thread about an office pizza party which shows the off-site employees bumming out since they won't be there for pizza, and the final guy insinuates that it's a bribe from management, and somebody else should eat his slice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't know how young you are, but let me let you in on a little secret:  Those of us who work in offices eat a
       <em>
        metric fuck-ton
       </em>
       of pizza.  It's the easiest meal to bring in when you're busy.  And I think you can safely assume that Stratfor Austin is pretty fucking busy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at it honestly, and without rage or bias getting in your way, you quickly understand how fucking
       <em>
        ridiculous
       </em>
       is to think that their entire Austin office is planning to fuck a kid
       <strong>
        over an office-wide e-mail thread
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       PIZZAGATE SEZ: THE ENTIRE STRATFOR AUSTIN OFFICE IS DIVVYING UP A CHILD TO FUCK. THEY'RE TRYING TO GET A COUNT OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT "IN".
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Dominos on cheese or pasta
       </strong>
       : This one seems so blindingly obvious. Keep in mind that the author is the 83-year-old Herb Sandler. His wife Marion of 51 years died about 3 years prior. Podesta had traditionally sent him an Xmas gift of pasta and sauce (Podesta is a known "foodie"), but this time, he got a box of cheeses. He thanks Podesta, and says that when his children (Susan and James) get back from their holiday travels (e-mail is dated 12/24), he'll enjoy the cheeses with them. Since there are other e-mails talking about how Susan (his grown daughter)
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34860">
        has beaten him at dominos before
       </a>
       , he's wondering if the cheese will improve his luck. This is a simple thank you for a Christmas gift. And fucking news flash: An 83-year-old man likes to play dominos.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT PIZZAGATE SEZ: PODESTA SENT A CHILD FOR 83-YEAR-OLD HERB TO FUCK. HE WAS EXPECTING A BOY, BUT GOT A GIRL. HE WONDERS IF HE'LL BE ABLE TO DOMINATE THE LITTLE GIRL BETTER IN HIS BDSM SEX PLAY, AS HE WAS LIMP-DICKED WITH THE LITTLE BOY LAST TIME.

       To add to this, I also think the old dude could simply have Crohn disease or some wheat intolerance... so maybe he does play better when eating cheese. As boring as it may be.

       I wonder who has the most twisted mind to come to the pizzahate conclusions sometimes! Yet 80% of those guys being "horrified" at the child porn jokes (eg. from the pizza hipsters) are the ones who set the trend 2-3 years ago by saying horrible little girl rape jokes and pedobear crap.

       You guys don't understand what "circumstantial" evidence is.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Circumstantial" would be if you found the bookbag of a missing child in the Comet ping-pong room.  "Direct evidence" would be if you found the child stuffed into a tunnel underneath the Comet ping-pong room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having an e-mail, ripped out of the context of previous conversations, and deciding that
       <em>
        something is off
       </em>
       is not "circumstantial evidence" by any stretch.  It's a tenuous connection drawn in your own mind, and wouldn't be admissible into court, and wouldn't be grounds to start an official investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you factor in that literally
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of the pizzagate "evidence" meets the same criteria, you can quickly see how fucked it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for christ sakes, how do you bring "Cheese Pizza" into this?  Cheese Pizza is longhand for CP, which is an abbreviation for child porn.  You do realize that the phrase "cheese pizza" occurs exactly
       <em>
        ZERO
       </em>
       times in the Podesta e-mails, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have is a whole lot of "this means girl" and "this means semen", and
       <em>
        none
       </em>
       of these have ANY corroborating evidence or source, other than the venerable "some dude on 4chan".
      </p>
      <p>
       Wake up.  You guys are having your good intentions weaponized against you.  You are being trolled by epic proportions.

       They truly are being trolled.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it is obviously done to discredit the little peak of good reputation some alternative media got in the last months. And wikileaks by proxy since they put all this in the same basket.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mainstream could not expect better than these raging SPW (Social Pizza Warriors) to 'prove' how alt news are "baaaaaad" and even dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think none of these geniuses realized the published mainstream lost so much money in the last months that some added subscription systems, pay walls, and even asked for donations lol!
       <strong>
        They were losing a good amount of advertising money to alt-news.
       </strong>
       The published media were already in trouble because of the drops in sales of the printed editions, and the fact that competitors offer their news online for free. So all they had left was the advertising money and that goes with the traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here comes pizzagate and some idiots being happily dragged into the "anti-censorship" war to make it even worse... all this to only bring more censorship, get discredited even more and destroy alt-media newly acquired traffic/reputation... Turning decent people to think they should go back to "real news" instead of "fake news."
      </p>
      <p>
       Dunno, seems obvious to me too they're being used.

       Unfortunately, since the MSM will never discuss wikileaks unless it supports their bias (contingent on the network reporting), the drive for the investigation is fueled mostly by speculation by the public.

       Instead of ridiculing the tens of thousands of people all over the world who have done their own (arguably insufficient) research on the topic, why doesn't the media just put this to bed by asking Podesta what the emails meant straight up? Why not discredit the accusations from the source?

       Be reasonable.  If I showed up at your door, demanding that you provide an explanation of why you are fucking your cat, and everybody KNOWS that you are fucking your cat, and we're going to be sure to let all of your friends and family
       <em>
        know

       that you're fucking your cat....

      </p>
      <p>
       Of course not.  And if you did, you'd be stupid... because the only response from

       shit-stains would be,

      </p>
      <p>
       Shit allegations don't require a response, and it's the cool thing about this country.  You're innocent until proven guilty...  Unless you happen to be one of the dozens of poor souls caught up in pizzagate nonsense.

       I have not seen any convincing evidence. People keep linking me to things that are totally nothing at all so you certainly have a problem with misinformation or irrelevant things out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Encouraging people to 'keep digging' and creating more of that I'm not convinced will help... when you accept everything as evidence for something you end up drowning out any valid evidence in a sea of total BS to the extent that whenever I try and look at it with an open mind all I see is what look to be crazy ramblings... I suspect that is what puts other people off it too.

       Voat is a forum. Good for discussion, but again, not a Wikipedia. I can get behind what
       <a href="/u/lookmaimonthereddit">

       I mean for the purpose of having a pizzagate "database" of sorts where people can look up specific things that are referenced, particular groups and people involved and having pages about them and how they're implicated and such and such. Don't let that confuse that I still want to use reddit and voat as forums for digging and discussion, but yeah different websites for different purposes.

       Keep up the good work......  The important thing is noticing the patterns and letting it point you, to the most rational conclusion. I would suggest everyone on this sub know the Moda Operandi of child molesters and pedophiles. It's important to be familiar with their grooming techniques and fallacies. This will help you find greater information/ open source intelligence, which you may have overlooked in your original research. I would also recommend examining criminal intelligence applications, or open source crime reports; the best college class I ever had.

       There was a dedicated website, and the owner took it down out of fear. Voat has an excellent summary thread, much like reddit did before that community was banned. The truth is the people investigating PG do have their shit together, it's just mixed in with all of the smear tactics and shill shit posts. It's likely that no one will be able to undeniably prove this outside of circumstantial evidence, which is why it's important for people to take a few hours and do their own research instead of waiting for someone to spoon feed it to them. When you want to be spoon-fed, you wind up eating a lot of shit.

       Hey everyone, I think that I just found another puzzle piece in one of the Podesta emails that has been widely distributed.  Basically in the email where Podesta talks about a hot dog stand in Hawaii, he also says " Between 7th and 1600, no fun."
I believe that he is complaining about being overworked in his official capacity at the White House (1600 Pennsylvania Avenue) and here's the kicker, I think that "7th" is referring to his role in the Shadow Government aka the 7th Floor Group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an article about the 7th Floor Group aka Shadow Government:
       <a href="https://www.intellihub.com/state-department-h-q-houses-secretive-shadow-governments-7th-floor-group/">
        https://www.intellihub.com/state-department-h-q-houses-secretive-shadow-governments-7th-floor-group/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And here's the Wikileaks email that I'm referring to:
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30231
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I made a post about this on Voat.co if anyone would like to help upvote it there for more exposure.

       Before pizzagate was pizzagate, when it was just breaking and the word emerged, some wise anons cautioned against letting this become the name. I thought at the time they had a point and in retrospect they were right on the money.

       I just watched a bit on TV. They were talking about what legal repercussions can be taken against pizza-gaters. They are putting up the works to not censor this conspiracy or others outright - rather they are setting it up to make it illegal to discuss these "conspiracy theories". The shooter at CPP is part of this. A supposed threat born from a conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       So rather than outright remove it from the internet, I think they're going to make it illegal to discuss topics such at these under the grounds that people will get hurt, and if a theory gets too close, they hit it with a shooting or something and then we can all be arrested.

       If you have a great theory that your local pizza joint owner is a pedo, then you better have your fucking ducks in a row before you put it up on your blog... because if it turns out to be false, there is a good chance you're going to get sued into financial oblivion.

Multi-million dollar payouts from Google, because they allow some pizzagate pinheads to circle-jerk each other into a frenzy on YouTube, and somebody ended up getting shot, or had their business burned, or family harrassed, or any number of potential outcomes of this witch hunt.

       Just look at the trends vs pizzagate or related keywords searches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lot of talk, lot of reposting, pretty much no research besides what was reposted..... A real circle of validation so far, that's why you don't see yet solid connections out of the comet ping pong area! Even comet ping pong is more researched than Alester Crowley. You look at how much people talk about pedophilia vs research it... almost a flat line. Same for child abuse, satanism, orphans, Haiti, etc. It's pretty sad.

       Instead of all banging away furiously on you keyboards, phones and tablets why don't you organise some sort of demonstration in front of this place if you think it is so painfully real? Get a banner, tell the media thousands of "PizzaGate" believes are going to converge on this place and demand authorities listen! Protest! At least the "black lives matter" # got into the street. I mean you would think saving the children from the evil inside would be far more important. Fuck me you all talk a good game but at the end of the day you do fuck all.

       Besides the fact that the alleged  culprits in this crime are networked with other extremely well connected people and the would be, theoretically, putting their well being on the line,  there hasn't been a thorough, procedural investigation yet and any amateurish attempt at bringing these concerns to the public will be met with ire and denigration from the media who is also (again) allegedly involved as well.

       I grabbed one of the Stratfor employee's e-mail address and threw it into Google earlier in the week.  The first 5 hits after the Wikileaks dump were Pizzagate blogs, run by the borderline retarded, accusing her
       <em>
        via her real name
       </em>
       of being complicit in a pedophilia ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit doesn't just magically disappear when you fucks grow up and move out of mommy's basement.  Forever, when somebody googles her real name, they're going to see allegations of pedophilia.  Employers, neighbors, friends, enemies, potential dates... you name it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is some
       <em>
        fucked up shit
       </em>
       right there.  And you should all be ashamed that you're taking part in it.
