    <div class="md"><p>Trump is a scoundrel, and we&#39;re no further away from another disastrous war because of his election. The machinery that has elevated both he and Clinton has not changed its dangerous trajectory. He is filling his cabinet with millionaires, billionaires and military brass, many of whom had been vetted for similar posts by the Clinton campaign. This is not a recipe for peace and prosperity, but one that will have tragic social consequences, in the United States and around the world. The reactionary right wing is gaining momentum across the world, and the only thing that will prevent another global catastrophe is the uniting of the international working class and poor on an informed anti-war basis, one rooted in an objective understanding of world history. No solution to the crises confronting us will be found in any section of the bourgeois capitalist establishment.</p>

<p>The only war is class war, and it has been waged against us since long before our grandparents were born. The only hope is a coordinated offensive against the war mongers and political charlatans who see in the world and its inhabitants as nothing more than the opportunity for more profit. They&#39;ve long ago proved that they have no intention of letting our petty concerns about peace and harmony stand in the way of their own sick and selfish desires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spoken like a true communist. You might say Socialist, but Marx himself said that socialism is only an easement to communism. Capitalism is the worst, except for all of the rest. As a rationalist, I have taken Sociology, Psychology, economics and finance classes, and once you separate the idealism of socialism from the rationalism you will come to the same conclusion. Capitalism is horrible, but unfortunately socialism is based on idealism, and humans are not yet biologically evolved to the point where the ideologies of socialism are viable alternatives.</p>

<p>At the tender age of 35, I&#39;ve had to accept the harsh reality that socialism is a failed idealist ideology and despite the numerous flaws, capitalism&gt;socialism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you replace &quot;socialism&quot; in your post with &quot;libertarianism&quot; it would still make complete sense. Every country on earth is a split between capitalism and socialism, and going too far either way doesn&#39;t work.   In the US you&#39;ve got roads, fire departments, volunteer military, radio spectrum management, social security, public education, etc all which are socialist programs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Socialism/communism: those words are basically interchangeable. Marx referred to the &quot;first phase of communism,&quot; but it was Lenin who called this first phase &quot;socialism.&quot;</p>

<p>As for idealism, the key aspect of Marx and Engels&#39;s work is precisely their fight <em>against</em> idealism. Marxist philosophy is based on Marx&#39;s conception of historical materialism, the opposite of subjective idealism. This isn&#39;t some pie-in-the-sky Utopian pipe dream. See: Engels, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/">Socialism, Utopian and Scientific</a>. I recommend at least reading the first two introductions--<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/int-mat.htm">General Introduction and the History of Materialism</a>, and <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/int-hist.htm">The History of the English Middle-Class</a></p>

<p>The history of mankind, as they say, is the history of class struggle--slaves against slave owners; bourgeois against feudal monarchy; and in the present epoch, the proletarians against the bourgeois capitalist order. Capitalism has provided mankind the basis for previously unforeseen levels of progress. But, at the same time, capitalism is incapable of solving its inherent contradictions. The class struggle is ongoing, and it is not simply a matter of Marxists taking power. Largely, that will not happen. Objective necessity will dictate the course of action for the lower classes, and it is up to the lower classes to wage this struggle for their emancipation from the rule of capital. With or without Marxism, the oppressed will be compelled to fight for their survival. The poor and abused don&#39;t need me to point out their degradation at the hands of capitalism-- they can surely see that for themselves. However, what is missing from popular consciousness is a clear conception of history, and the history of class struggle--its successes, and its failures. The history of opportunist betrayals against workers and poor is a central pillar of the work we do. Why did Stalin rise to power and sabotage the gains of the Russian Revolution? What did Mao represent and why has China become a massive slave labor camp? Are Cuba, Venezuela, or North Korea socialist states? These questions can all begin to be answered by asking further-- where was the working class? Why in every case mentioned above were the workers betrayed by political opportunists and charlatans?</p>

<p>This history does not invalidate the struggle for socialism. Indeed, much of this history has been effectively suppressed precisely because the established order seeks to obscure the truth of the matter and thus keep the lower classes confused and complacent in their misery. There&#39;s no profit motive in the worldwide expropriation of the capitalist, imperialist landlords. The owners are terrified by this fact, but the fact of the matter is, whether it&#39;s a Coca-Cola, Apple, or General Motors, the piles of wealth the owners and shareholders hoard away were created on the backs of us. We&#39;re simply demanding, through force, if necessary, what rightfully belongs to us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>humans are not yet biologically evolved to the point where the ideologies of socialism are viable alternatives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness.&quot; Again, it is not simply some subjective or idealistic desire that communism be brought about, but the objective necessity of a degraded and oppressed working class pitted historically against the capitalists who enslave them. The task, therefore, is to educate the masses of people of their social interests so that when the day for revolution comes <em>they</em> are prepared to carry on the struggle in order to build a society in their own interests, not in the interests of the exploiters.</p>

<p>If you frequent this sub, I typically post articles from the <a href="http://www.wsws.org">World Socialist Web Site</a>, the most widely read socialist site in the internet. I would urge you to check it out. The party that runs the website has a very serious commitment to history, and this shows in their analysis of world events. Socialist or not, this is a highly valuable resource for world news. But don&#39;t just take my word on it. Their work speaks for itself.</p>

<p>This is the only way forward against war and austerity.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m only 34, so maybe I&#39;ll learn something new over the course of the next year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not aware of any FBI investigation that has been released except the one from Benghazi emails after which Comey absolved HC. Is that what you mean?  Did not review that closely. </p>

<p>As far as Trump being establishment, it &#39;appears&#39; he has threatened the establishment status quo by beating HC.  Many suspect (and Wikileaks DNC leaks reveal) he was set up to be unelectable against HC. Hard to judge how much is real and contrived. Those Soros protests were ready to go day after election. (Craig&#39;s list ads/ busses-impossible that fast, on that scale.  Very suspicious.) I agree that Trump is establishment to a great degree, but I also think HC was a more evil candidate. We really had *no choice. Election was a badly executed illusion -when I remember the openly dirty primary &amp; rise of cartoonish Nazi opponent candidate... sooo bad. Trump has not drained any swamp and he has antagonized every hope after reaching out to Minorities, middle class  &amp; Bernie supporters during campaign.  Are we watching seduction of Trump by swamp creatures?  Or is this continuation of Establishment repair to damage from Wikileaks exposure of corruption &amp; much worse?  Maybe you are right. </p>

<p>We need to try to find ways to reconcile between ultra left and right, and the middle.  Being divided and infighting wont get anything done.

<p>These are insiders, both of them. They deserve only contempt.</p>

<p>Surely we can do better than this.</p>

<p>Trump didnt win because of this. He won because everyone switched their votes because Hillary was a worse canidate. And why don&#39;t you let him actually become president before you make assumptions about him. Maybe he truely is anti-establishment? You don&#39;t know his plans. Maybe he needs these people on his side before he can go about &quot;draining the swamp&quot;. You never know. Stop judging before any actions have been done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay look at like this, do you think trump would have won if there wasn&#39;t a huge Hillary scandal at the end of the election? Im going to say no, Hillary had alot more support. The DECIDING FACTOR of him winning isn&#39;t because of his views. Its because people didn&#39;t want to deal with corrupt ass Hillary. </p>

<p>Meaning its retarded of people to judge Trump before he actually does anything. So many people trash talking Trump. He hasn&#39;t done anything yet. Plus we had no other options, unless you honestly believe Hillary is a better choice? Trash talk our government and the way our system is run. Trash talk our 2 party voting system. Not this man who became president on a fluke. 2cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all goes back to the original covenant God made with Israel,  God&#39;s chosen people. The significance of that is he chose this bloodline in which he would send Jesus to redeem all of man&#39;s sins. But through all God used them for they turned away to worldly idols so when Jesus was on earth he set up the church to take Israel&#39;s place in carrying the gospel throughout the rest of the time up until the tribulation period. The rapture is the gathering of the born again Christians or collectively called the church. This event will take place leading up to the 7 years tribulation which the Bible describes as the worst time the world has ever seen. God will remove his presence and allow Satan his full reign of evil to take place on the human race. Now I wish this were a fairy tale,  but many of the prophecies from thousands of years ago are setting up as we speak, so to say it&#39;s not real is to choose blindness as most of the world will do. The Bible is the first to speak of the new world order,  a cashless society,  and many more things that we see in the news daily. Most of the population will die during this time. It is truly horrible. The only way to be saved from this is to repent and believe that Jesus payed for all of your sins. Because the only way to God is through Jesus and what he did on the cross. What I tell you freely here many have died for,  there is power in the name of Jesus</p>

<p>Establishment is politicians making a living off us for years running our country into the ground. Your opinion is based off fear and hate. This is the one thing about reddit I get into a a discussion and look back at what you wrote and realize that maybe your a child.</p>

<p>From the guy that lives in a fantasy universe where when Donald Trump settles a lawsuit for 24 million it means he is guilty. That is not truth bud, that is speculation. Granted, yes it does bring about suspicion BUT you cannot come tell me he is guilty of fraud in that case because that is not TRUTH but you sell it as such then ridicule me for my comprehending information - how ironic that the all knowing is always better. He could of settled because maybe he had to focus and get untied from any unimportant battles because the biggest one was right now. Is that the case? Maybe not because you have decided in your mind the truth of reality is he is guilty but we know the word guilty and I don&#39;t think that word means what you think it means.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didnt defraud any of you, but here&#39;s $25M to go away and keep your mouths shut.  The amount of time and energy it would take to prove my innocence is more than $25M, so the cheaper option is to just pay out a settlement.  I borrowed it from an overseas bank because my credit is dogshit and US banks wont loan me any money. </p>

<p>I bet you cant wait until this guy is throwing around taxpayer money to make his problems go away instead of his own money. Youre probably confident he will be WAY more responsible with other people&#39;s money.  </p>

<p>He wants to keep living in Trump Tower and force the secret service to rent two floors, spending $3 million per year of tax payer money back to Trump. Hahahahahaha</p>

<p>Its not about Trump being a hero because he isn&#39;t and he isn&#39;t the enemy or part of them either. A hero won&#39;t save us because many hero&#39;s are dead who have tried, its a battle for belief. The belief is Trump is a bad guy and the fooled will spend time trying to prove to the people of this nation who elected him that he is a bad guy and fascist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody has to prove that he&#39;s a bad guy. Its in right in front of our faces black and white.  Some people who care about fellow Americans have spent time trying to educate others about Trump, but its futile especially with those, like yourself, who do not want to be convinced of anything, rational or not.  Its a much more cozy place to live in Trump&#39;s distortion field where all problems are caused by an outside group (this is called scapegoating), where he and he &quot;alone&quot; can fix all of your problems with a few simple steps (this is called gross oversimplification and promising the impossible), where all news media is a false made up conspiracy to hide the truth from you (this is called attacking the media that draws attention to his broken promises). As with you, you are blind to actual information and are willing to &quot;explain away&quot; everything bad about Trump. You are under his spell and he keeps you there because you are uneducated and easy to manipulate, you fail to review or consider the facts eight in front of you, and have allowed him to convince you that anything negative at all is simply a lie.   I have no interest in convincing you, because I now feel that someone like you deserves to suffer the actual consequences of a Trump presidency.  At this point I&#39;m just trolling.  But honestly, Trump U documents are everywhere and whether or not the case went to trial, its very clear that he was conning the &quot;students&quot; and having all of his employees work to scam customers.  Whether people want to accept reality about Donald Trump is one thing, facts are another, and $25M is a fact.  A 6&#39; tall painting of himself paid for with &quot;foundation&quot; money is another fact. Bankruptcies are fact. Conflict of interest is fact.  Broken campaign promises are fact (Lock her up!).  No one has proof that he will continue to be a giant con-artist, but educated people have made informed assumptions about the behavior of a 70 year old demagogue with a massive financial stake in manipulating Americans and abusing his post to influence foreign investment into his own businesses, is probably NOT going put Americans first. </p>

<p>LMAO you know what. When Trump talks about ISIS, building a wall, bad trade deals, etc etc etc. I know he is really just reaching the people who are still fooled to think these are enemies or problems. He cannot say what he has come to do but its easy to see if you listen........... this is a suicide mission. I know what he is gonna do and you damn near have to be in love or insane to attempt this for us. Especially if you already have money. There is only one way to make america great again only one way - none of it is what Trump has said what hes going to do because honestly you can&#39;t say it. Like Trump says you can&#39;t let the enemy know your plan. Yea sure some people think all the things Trump said he would fix if he fixed them we would be great! No. There is only one thing. Even if he does fix everything he said but doesn&#39;t solve the real problem America will never be great again. SO its the things he doesn&#39;t say which is good cause even Trump supporters would be afraid, so for those who have ears let them hear.</p>
