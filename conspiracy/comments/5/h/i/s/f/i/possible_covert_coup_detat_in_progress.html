       Think of what's been happening this last week.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire MSM starts talking about Fake News and the Russian propaganda connection. The Senate then passes a bill that establishes an agency for "counter-propaganda". The house will soon vote on it and Obama will sign it.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) today announced that their Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act – legislation designed to help American allies counter foreign government propaganda from Russia, China, and other nations – has passed the Senate as part of the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Conference Report. The bipartisan bill, which was introduced by Senators Portman and Murphy in March, will improve the ability of the United States to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation
        <strong>
         by establishing an interagency center housed at the State Department to coordinate and synchronize counter-propaganda efforts throughout the U.S. government. To support these efforts, the bill also creates a grant program for NGOs, think tanks, civil society and other experts outside government who are engaged in counter-propaganda related work.
        </strong>
        This will better leverage existing expertise and empower local communities to defend themselves from foreign manipulation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Obama then orders a review of any "election-related" hacking done by Russia.
       <a href="https://archive.fo/daV8o">

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Washington (CNN) — President Barack Obama has ordered a full review into hacking by the Russians designed to influence the 2016 election, White House Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Adviser Lisa Monaco said Friday.
       </p>
       <p>
        "The President has directed the Intelligence Community to conduct a full review of what happened during the 2016 election process. It is to capture lessons learned from that and to report to a range of stakeholders," she said at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast with reporters. "This is consistent with the work that we did over the summer to engage Congress on the threats that we were seeing."
       </p>
       <p>
        Monaco said the administration would be
        <strong>
         mindful of the consequences of revealing the results of their review publicly.
        </strong>
        All of the Democratic senators on the Senate Intelligence Committee have called on Obama to declassify intelligence on Russia's actions during the election.
       </p>
       <p>
        "You want to do so
        <strong>
         very attentive to not disclosing sources
        </strong>
        and methods that would impede our ability to identify and attribute malicious actors in the future," Monaco said of disclosure.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then a source starts claiming Russia helped Trump purposely.
       <a href="http://archive.is/Y2445">
        http://archive.is/Y2445
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Intelligence agencies have
        <strong>
         identified individuals
        </strong>
        with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton’s chances.
       </p>
       <p>
        “It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia’s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected,” said a senior U.S. official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to U.S. senators. “That’s the consensus view.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Finally, keep in mind the DHS was
       <strong>
        CAUGHT
       </strong>
       probing the Georgia State network.
       <a href="http://archive.is/vKUOw">
        http://archive.is/vKUOw
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp has asked federal officials to explain what appears to be an attempt by the U.S. Homeland Security Department to breach the state’s voter registration database a week after the November election.
       </p>
       <p>
        The claim comes after an IP address associated with the federal agency attempted to penetrate the state’s firewall Nov. 15. The attempt was unsuccessful, but in a letter Thursday to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, Kemp said he wanted to know whether the department had permission to conduct what he called an “unauthorized” scan of Georgia’s system.
       </p>
       <p>
        “At no time has my office agreed to or permitted DHS to conduct penetration testing or security scans of our network,” Kemp said. “Moreover, your department has not contacted my office since this unsuccessful incident to alert us of any security event that would require testing or scanning of our network.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The way the narrative is flowing, I think Russia could be framed in some sort of hacking attempt on the voting machines to help Trump. Afterwards, the electors would be pushed to choose an alternative Republican such as Kaisich because of an "on going investigation". Finally, when Congress meets the damning report would be released so they would choose that alternative Republican candidate because of "Trump's ties to Russia". Remember, Obama wants the investigation done prior to January 20th.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Look carefully at Trump's response. "These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. " What do we know about this in hindsight. Well the CIA concluded that there were no WMD's, however the bureaucracy at the top used select CIA findings to establish a narrative that wasn't true to justify regime change. Does this sound familiar? Remember all the concern trolling about Trump going back on his promises before he is even inaugurated? What if that's just to make it more acceptable to us when the covert coup happens?

       I think OP is right about this theory.  They've shown a willingness to try to recount (cast doubt on trumps win) with the idea that in 9 days they will again try to use bribed, threatened or blackmailed electors into 'faithless' electors to "re"-win Hillary's presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if that fails, their backup plan will be to trump-up charges on Trump and Putin, saying that all the "alt-right" who were inculcated into "russian propaganda"  (ie: Corbett report and Alex JOnes...rofl!) and managed to sway the whole populace into voting for trump (well, voting AGAINST hillary).  Yeah...this fifth column had NOTHING to do with all that propaganda about like...Hillary dying and having parkinsons and such...That Russia pressed a button and hillary's robot chip glerched and she did the head fast blinky eye thing that totally wasn't just a seizure...and said, 'gleeerrrrrk did you try the COLD CHAI"..  Damn you russia and your illegal hillarybot remote control

       Nevermind that we
       <strong>
        <em>
         all know about her crimes
        </em>
       </strong>
       , we
       <em>
        all know she's a treasonous traitor
       </em>
       , and many of us know Obama is too; and now we're proving they have tight social and financial and political relationships with convicted pedophile murderer cannabals who kidnap children into a post MKULTRA type program to create manchurians and monarchs and probably the victims become abuser/handlers also in this massive multiplayer international crime ring going back decades.

       They know that all of their work for years will be set back to zero, and possibly lose everything if they lose the US.

       If they can't prevent Trump from being elected, they will scuttle the ship in a massive way. "Terrorism", destruction, collapse of economy. In other words, if you live in the US, it's time to sell your home &amp; move overseas

       Lol where? To the bastion of freedom that is the UK? Or maybe to central Europe while it gets flooded with extremists posing a refugees? Or should I go to Australia or Japan, which are under US control. Maybe I should go to China were my online actions are monitored and compiled into a personal score? Or should I go to Africa (do I really need to say anything there?)? Or should I go to South America, where drug cartels behead people daily and economies are crashing so hard that their money is worthless? Or maybe India, where they just made a shitload of currency worthless?

       Most European politicians are deep in the US pocket, but the public would never accept this. We mostly like the American people, but we don't like the American politics.

       Another interesting phenomenon are these "look who I met" selfies with Hillary. They seem obviously staged and the people who ran into her "by chance" have been later found to have had meetings with her in the past. They remind me of the stories where Jesus popped up to chat with his followers after he rose from the dead. If you were scripting a constitutional crisis to engineer a subversion of Trump's ascension to the white house, this would be a nice little way of keeping your protagonist in the public mind until you're ready to make your move.
Just a thought.

       Yep, and sporting that natural makeup look too in all of those photo ops, I mean chance encounter selfies. No highly polished politician with a team of stylists in charge of her image. Just a normal, ordinary grandmother going about her business...hiking, grocery shopping. I am sure the presidency is the last thing on her mind. /s

       This was planned awhile ago.

      <p>
       Russia was already accused of massive hacking, controlling the media, controlling the far right, the far left, and conspiracy theorists. Yes, really.

       If they did something like "hack an election" it would be a great opportunity for someone who wanted to take even more control of the media, the internet, gag freedom of speech, and crack down on opposition.

       Nations are always interested in leaders that will be better for their relations, agendas, whatever. The U.S.A. does the same thing.  It shouldn't surprise anyone that Russia would want Trump in office.  Not for Russia to take control of America or anything malicious but the fact that Hillary wanted to worsen relations with Russia and Trump wanted to improve them.  I just don't get that because Russia favors one option over the other that we should be "up in arms" worried about it.

       The US economy is about to implode, 0 interest rates for years have created MASSIVE bubbles in every sector of the economy that's about to burst. The debt is considered impossible to pay off. TPTB don't want to be blamed for the economic collapse under way so they're using other events as distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US Gov has mobilised the greatest fighting force since WW2 and parked it in the Pacific to counter Chinese power (John Pilger has written about this) and has greatly increased its military presence in the Baltics. It has attempted to overthrow Russias only Middle Eastern ally Syria, attempted a Soros/CIA coup in Ukraine and is attempting to build a missile defence shield (which is extremely dangerous) in Central Europe directed against Russia but using Iran as an excuse. This is dangerous because it removes Mutually Assured Destruction as a way to ensure peace. Once that sheild is in place the West can nuke Russia at will and suffer minimal (for a nuclear war) casualties and the Russians definitely know about it. The Americans are doing the same in South Korea, using North Korea as an excuse to implement a missile defence shield targeted against China.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all of these things you notice it is the US that is the aggressor and yet if you were to take Western media at face value you'd wrongly believe that it was Russia and China that are the aggressors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like using a thunderstorm to cover the sound of a gunshot, the powers that be are attempting to engage Russia and China in a war to fully utilise their populace control mechanisms and cover up their corruption that has led to the biggest financial collapse in human history. They do this because if the masses knew the reality they'd revolt and start lynching former elites. That is why they are pushing for war with Russia, better to plunge the world into nuclear war than have your hidden power structure exposed.

       My guess is that the tptb, (NYC/London bankers seem to be main outward incarnation to peer at), do not have control over Putin. And they want Russia because it is a major focus of power with all it's resources. They hardly can/could stand Cuba, Venezuela, NK, Iran, Libya standing up to them and giving them the finger... So Russia, far more potentially a threat, if it can continue to be independent of their control will bother them to no end.

       Seems they strive for complete, 100% control over everything for themselves.

       Well didn't he say that he wasn't going to do anything as far as prosecuting Clinton, after he said during the debate that she would be in jail if her were president. I'm pretty sure that was important to a lot of voters, since the Clintons have gotten away with so much shit. Then look at his cabinet choices. So I don't think it was really "concern trolling" exactly. Concern trolling is when a person just pretends to be concerned. I think a lot of people have been genuinely concerned about his 180 over prosecuting Clinton.

       I've read a lot of theories trying to explain away Trump's cabinet picks and 180 on Clinton, all as some sort of master plan. I'm pretty cynical about that, to be honest. He maneuvers like a psychopath, and pro-social psychopaths are extremely rare. I guess it's possible that he is an extremely rare specimen among humanity, but again I am just rather cynical.

       He's a Narcissist... certainly not a psychopath.  and the 180 on Clinton was because when he was saying that stuff he didn't know he couldn't actually get a special prosecutor... thats not the president's decision.

       You're being more than sensible by being skeptical, since the minute Trump was elected he has done nothing to appear like the "outsider" he was touted to be. The same people are in power, and all of his "wild" claims about walls, prosecutions, corruption, etc. are all just lies in line with Obama's "Change" rhetoric. Maybe once he's in power things will be different, but so far he's looking more like Ronald Reagan every day.

       Incumbency is getting harder and harder to beat. Not counting H.W. (who lost because Perot split the base, not because he was really beat by Clinton) you have Carter, Ford, and Truman who lost Incumbency races since term limits were put in place. All he needs to skate by is a disaster free first term; hell he can even get by blaming Democrats for stifling some of the promises he made, and pull through as long as the Democrats put up a weak opponent (think John Kerry).

       I don't know.  I think he picked the right move with Clinton.  Do you really want a President that singles out his opponents for prosecution?  I think that is much worse than remaining neutral on something that actually has nothing to do with Presidential roles.  Just let the agencies run like they are supposed to and if they actually do Clinton will be taken down for what she is guilty of naturally.

       I think this is the most important bit of information. Here we are talking about Russians hacking when our own government agency was caught. It's more likely that we are dealing with a cover up in regards to DHS or NSA activity during the elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it's just as likely that those in power are trying to link election shenanigans to Russia in order to lay the groundwork for retaliation in Syria since the rebels have been losing ground at an exponential pace since mid November. I'd imagine the establishment doesn't want Russia to succeed over there no matter what it takes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Trump using the example of the Iraq war wasn't a mistake. His advisers know full well that the US is intent on trying to fix the quagmire in Syria and need ammunition to bring to the table in order to rationalize a full assault in Syria.

Bill Clinton's Federal Assault Weapons ban had a good leash on the number of Rifles(far superior to pistols) in American hands, but once that expired and the subsequent numerous blocked efforts of Obama to enact similar bans resulted in Record high numbers of Ar-15's being sold, combined with the rise of 80% receivers(potentially untraceable) they lost a major advantage. If the US government cannot quietly contain this and it becomes a Civil War, foreign intervention will present too large of a danger to risk any US government operation at a grand level.
The endgame for the Left is Communism, and they have been using Cultural Marxism as a foot into the door to Socialism, which is designed to transition into communism(Marx wrote about this) At some point they want a "revolution" and the globalist desire world communism to protect their power/wealth and prevent anyone ever being able to compete with them in the future.

       My opinion is that the establishment that is currently in power really needed that pipeline through Syria. Their "freedom fighters" lost the war though. Russia, and Assad won. My theory is that Trump doesn't care to pursue any further hostilities which is going to screw them over massively. They want the war to continue. And are desperate to maintain power so they can do that.

       Yeah but way, way more than that. They are Globalists--by definition, all countries must unite under a single order, a single religion. No outliers. Trump, Russia, now the UK are outliers and Nationalists. This isn't just about a pipeline, it's about maintaining control toward that NWO vision.

       Don't sweat it... the intelligence agency coup has made it through the woods pretty well... just hold on till inauguration... I think the New FBI and their ilk has mostly wrest control from the old guard.
