<p>(ill be fair and just post things even the MSM couldn&#39;t deny, so no conspiracy theories in this list)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start, continue, and expand continuous and many times covert wars over the last 50 years. I thought congress had to agree to all that?</p></li>
<li><p>Do things like Project Phoenix, Paperclip, MKULTRA, Mockingbird, torture countless people, install dictators around the world. Tuskeege experiments, the MOVE bombing where they dropped fucking bombs on an American town. </p></li>
<li><p>Initiate mass surveillance on nearly everything we use everyday. Building new data centers all the time just to store all of the fucking data. Why even do that? Good discussion here: <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/fahrplan/events/920.en.html">We Lost the War (2005)</a> </p></li>
<li><p>Aggressively prosecute and torture whistle-blowers or anyone trying to expose the abuse of #3</p></li>
<li><p>He did not pass or sign a law<a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/president-obama-signs-indefinite-detention-bill-law"> allowing the indefinite detention of American citizens</a> even allowing them to be sent to Guantanamo Bay (that&#39;s just a scary term. like we need to be in Cuba or something). And he didn&#39;t pass this current law destroying freedom of the press. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, there will be no civil war, period. Also &quot;Civil war 2&quot;, be more creative, really apply yourself. </p>

<p>Second, &quot;alarmism&quot; suggests that the reaction to Trump&#39;s actions are out of proportion. Well judging by his cabinet picks I am very alarmed. The man he appointed to lead the EPA wants to dismantle it and he appointed a Goldman sachs banker as Treasury Secretary. Not to mention that Ben Carson, someone with no qualification (no not even that bullshit excuse about him living in a public urban housing, that was false) is going to be HUD Secretary.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s surrounding himself with people that range from questionable to outright unqualified and now it&#39;s revealed that the Russian government might have been Meddling with the election? Hell yeah I&#39;m kinda worried.</p>

My other comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5hki9m/cia_says_saddam_has_weapons_er_sorry_i_mean_cia/">here</a> fared pretty well (Sort by upvoted). I think there is a steep divide in this sub with r/The_Donald users on one hand and long time r/Conspiracy users on the other. Then there are of course the faceless masses in between that mostly dictate what gets upvoted or not and they mostly agree with whatever they see the most, right now there are hundreds of posts of Pizzagate a day on this sub so they think whomever speaks out against such things must be shills.</p>

<p>If true, it really is a shame that spamming can so easily sway public opinion in a sub dedicated in rational and free thinking.</p>
