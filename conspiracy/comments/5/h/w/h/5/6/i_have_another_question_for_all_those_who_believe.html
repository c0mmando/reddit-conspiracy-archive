<p>Flat earthers believe that gravity does not exist. One explanation I&#39;ve seen is that the earth is constantly moving &quot;up&quot;, so things aren&#39;t falling down, the earth is moving up to meet them.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really matter, as flat earthers are all either:</p>

<p>A) Trolls, or
B) Unable to understand basic science</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a flat earther but I know the answer to this. There are actually two prevailing theories among them. The more popular and strange is that the flat earth disc is constantly moving straight upwards, pinning us to the ground. However, when I looked into this all out of curiosity to see what they claim, I saw many saying this is only being presented by Flat Earth Society to further discredit the theory. Among the more &quot;rational&quot; crowd (if that can be said) is that it&#39;s all a matter of air density and bouyancy. Things lighter than air float, things heavier sink. Like I said I don&#39;t really buy into all of it although there are some definite interesting points like the obvious doctoring of certain space-related photographs</p>

The first one is just laughable. How should balloons work with such a model? And the second one is very questionable in my eyes as well. How do things heavier than air even know in which direction to fall? What is down? What is even weigth?</p>

<p>EDIT: Would those downvoters please enlighten me? Is my statement flawed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying the earth is accelerating upward certainly has a lot of problems, but balloons floating isn&#39;t one of them.  The force that is normally supplied by gravity can also be supplied by inertia.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re on a rocket ship in deep space, and I fire up the engine, you will try to remain stationary while the space shipâ€™s rear wall moves to meet you.  Inside the ship, it will look like youâ€™re accelerating downward toward the rear of the ship.  Everything in the ship will accelerate toward the back at the same rate, regardless of mass.  In fact, if the ship didnâ€™t have windows, youâ€™d have no way to tell if you were in an accelerating space ship, or resting inside a gravitational field.</p>

<p>The reason the balloon is propelled upward is because of the air.  The air is trying to remain stationary, so it piles up in the back of the ship.  The air toward the front is only pushing backward with its inertia, while the air just below it is pushing toward the back with not only its inertia but the inertia of the air above it.  This pattern keeps on going until you reach the back of the spaceship, when you have an entire column of airâ€™s worth of inertia pressing down.  This means that, for anything immersed in the air, the air pressure of its rearmost point is greater than the air pressure of its forward most point.  Weâ€™ll come back to that idea in a moment.</p>

<p>Buoyancy works because anything immersed in a fluid (air, water, etc.) pushes the fluid to make room for itself.  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, so the air is pushing back as well.  But, since thereâ€™s a difference in pressure between on side and the other (because the rocket is accelerating), there will be a net force pushing the balloon toward the nose of the space ship.  This means that the balloon will actually move faster than the rocket, until it either reaches the nose of the rocket, or the difference in air pressure becomes too small to move it.</p>

<p>Now replace rocket with dome covered earth, and the argument still remains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.</p>

<p>Gravity may only be a theory, but we are able to observe it&#39;s effects, and it appears to work for 99% of the observable universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well actually, I&#39;m gonna have to disagree there. Gravity doesn&#39;t work for 99% of the observable universe. It actually works for far smaller % of the observable universe. (Maybe even less than 1%?)</p>

<p>That&#39;s why when Hubble Deep Space telescope discovered the rate at which galaxies were moving apart was far greater than expected (by our formulas and understanding of gravity), they assume there must be another &quot;invisible&quot; and &quot;undetectable&quot; force at work, dark energy. Which essentially means: there is a force that we can&#39;t measure, we can&#39;t observe, yet clearly it must be there because the observations don&#39;t match the formulas, so we&#39;ll have to take it on faith that these forces exist. (As by definition of &quot;dark&quot;, they can&#39;t be measured or interacted with)</p>

<p>So to say that gravity has been proven &quot;correct&quot; by science, especially on the largest and smallest scales, is simply wrong, as experiments aswell as observations contradict our understanding of the universe at these scales. It&#39;s why science has been looking for so long for a way to &quot;unite&quot; all forces into a single theory, because our current model (of gravity) just doesn&#39;t cut it. </p>

<p>I mean, say what you will about Flat Earth and it being completely bogus, but the truth is that our current understanding of gravity would disprove very &quot;little&quot; regarding the Flat Earth model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t dark energy and gravity two different things? At least our local group is a gravitational pocket where dark energy doesn&#39;t matter because gravity is the stronger force. If we just assume that dark energy is another force besides gravity in our universe it would still make sense to just say &quot;<em>If the universal expansion&#39;s dark energy does not exceed gravity we have a gravitational pocket</em>&quot;. Our model of gravity would still work, you just have to take another force into the calculations as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made a lengthy post trying to reply, but then I realize I simply don&#39;t know enough about dark matter/energy to make solid claims about it.</p>

<p>Yet, that might be my strongest point, because neither do the scientists claiming it exists. The strongest, and only, evidence for it&#39;s existence is the flawed prediction by our previous model.</p>

<p>So this means that either dark matter/energy do exist, or it means that we simply don&#39;t understand gravity yet, and how it behaves on various scales.</p>

<p>Concidering the questions we still have about gravity to this day (as an example: <a href="http://phys.org/news/2016-12-birds-laser-reveal-faults-flight.html">http://phys.org/news/2016-12-birds-laser-reveal-faults-flight.html</a>), it&#39;s pretty obvious we haven&#39;t figured out gravity. </p>

<p>That leads me to believe that before we should start inventing strange and exotic matter purely on speculation, regardless of scientifically well versed you are, we should figure gravity out first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my, well thank you :D But yeah, I still haven&#39;t figured out why people are so adamant about taking a position in the Flat Earth debate.</p>

<p>The people who are buying into it for all the wrong reasons, as mentioned there are plenty of ridiculous claims in these Flat Earth videos. Yet at the same time, non-believers, resort to namecalling almost every other post, is it really necessary? People who believe in flat earth aren&#39;t stupid, by default. They&#39;re people who don&#39;t believe the official narrative (which is what conspiracy is all about), and unlike what many people here would like to believe, there still hasn&#39;t been conclusive evidence the earth is round.</p>

<p>And by conclusive, I mean emperical, a picture from space showing earth in it&#39;s full round glory. Something which NASA, aswell as several other space agencies (Wasn&#39;t India planning on going to mars aswell?) could easily do with all the means they have available.</p>

<p>Instead, all they do is feed into the conspiracy by releasing questionable after questionable material. They released a &quot;photo&quot; of the Earth, only to find out it&#39;s a composite with photoshopped clouds. (As admitted by NASA themselves)</p>

<p>I&#39;m still a globy, but I&#39;m going to wait untill the Mars missions are in full effect untill I cement my &quot;beliefs&quot;. I expect around 2025, all these flat earth talk will be resolved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have watched hours of the ISS feed, and I enjoy doing so. I have also watched the ISS fly overhead numerous times during my lifetime so far, so no it&#39;s not &quot;fake&quot;. As a matter of fact, I&#39;ll do you one further:</p>

<p>I have personally met an ISS astronaut (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_De_Winne">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_De_Winne</a>) because I was a close friend with his daughter in high school. He&#39;s an amazing guy, smart and friendly, and I do not for a second doubt him actually having gone to the space station.</p>

<p>However, the ISS feed, for me, doesn&#39;t prove the earth is round, and neither does the fact that I know someone who was on the ISS. I don&#39;t know if the round appearance is caused by lensing or by the actual round nature of earth, the ISS isn&#39;t high enough to come to such a conlusion.</p>

<p>This gif would be something along the lines I would concider empirical evidence, if it werent for the fact it looks so fake. As I said, as these Mars missions (and stellar travel) evolve, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get more and more &quot;non-NASA&quot; material proving the earth is round, and in due time I&#39;ll definitely cement my beliefs the earth is round, but for now the lack of evidence, or tampering with it (cough NASA), is apparent.</p>

<p>But that seems rather like denial at any cost than actual based critiscism to me. You can see the curvature in the stream, don&#39;t you? Your friend has most likely told you that he has seen it. If you&#39;ve watched hours of the ISS stream, you most likely know, that the ISS only flies in one direction. How could the ISS end up over the same place over and over again, without changing it&#39;s direction completely, without orbiting a globe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I was fortunate enough to witness this in person. My friend&#39;s son tore his Aunt&#39;s flat-earth argument apart, it was hilarious. </p>

<p>Here is just a small part of the conversation, he also accidentally disproved her belief that gravity doesn&#39;t exist, that space travel is impossible, and that the Antarctic surrounds the rest of the earth.</p>

<p>Aunt: The earth is not spinning, when you jump, you land back in the same place. If it was spinning you would land west of where you jumped.</p>

<p>Child: When I jump on a plane, I don&#39;t land at the back.</p>

<p>Aunt: That&#39;s because it&#39;s sealed, and all the air is moving at the same speed as the plane, you are jumping inside the plane and the air is carrying you along with it.</p>

<p>Child: So the air outside is carrying me with the earth when I jump, because it&#39;s spinning with the Earth?</p>

<p>Aunt: Errrr..... You&#39;re too young to understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve actually really tried to understand this myself, The concept of flat earth is fascinating I mean who can resist (As a conspiracy theorist) the fact that we have all been lied to and then the question remains... why? </p>

<p>But the more and more I look into it the more logic gets in the way of all of this, its just one of those theories that fall under the &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be cool if....&quot; category. </p>

<p>To answer your question, 2 theories, </p>

<p>1: buoyancy, everything falls downwards in the universe, The sun, moon and stars are all projections formed to trick us to thinking the world is round.</p>

<p>2: we are spinning upward really fast and that the Geforce holds us in place.</p>

<p>If I had to choose I&#39;d be inclined to believe the first theory more, it makes more sense even if its still on the level of batshit crazy, it would coincide with the hollow moon theory (space ship of super beings who monitor human evolution), and the whole shadow government reptilian race bent on changing our history and enslaving all of man... one lie at a time.</p>

<p>Unfortunatley, with todays modern technology, with all the apps that track planes, boats, weather patterns globally its hard to imagine that everyone is in on it, there is just too many people involved at very low levels (programmers, designers, analysts) for nothing to slip. </p>

<p>Good luck to the flat earthers though, and don&#39;t ever stop smoking that green stuff, coz its an interesting subject and I enjoy reading about it.</p>

<p>I know, right? It&#39;s pretty fun to start with models and try to bend reality around them. Sadly it doesn&#39;t really check out with flat earth.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But how does everything know the direction of &quot;down&quot;? And buoyancy needs the concept of weight at least.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But why do balloons work then? They should not be able to accelerate faster than the earth, should they? And even if we forget about that, doesn&#39;t a constant 9,81m/s<sup>2</sup> acceleration since the existance of earth mean, that we&#39;re already moving faster than light?</p>

<p>Well, I&#39;d imagine the concept of gravity still has to exist in some way to flat earthers, just not in the way we understand it, instead of their being a molten core of iron at the center of earth dense enough to have a gravitational pull on everything that gets close enough to the planet I&#39;d imagine that there would be some form of gravitational pull from underneath flat earth which affects the whole universe and buoyancy does the rest. in fact I might have read a few things to that effect which gives me this idea but again, I&#39;m no flat earth expert so forgive me if I don&#39;t know the exact details of this theory.</p>

<p>Everything in the universe is affected by the same gravitational pull and in the same direction.</p>

<p>I have seen these statements from flat earthers saying &quot;gravity doesn&#39;t exist&quot; but I think these statements are misinterpreted in many cases by the logicals who want to make flat earth sound more stupid than it already does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, light can not be bent by a magnet. Photons can be affected by a changing magnetic field, creating electromagnetic waves, but only through an indirect quatum effect. And that effect is so minimal, that it wouldn&#39;t work in your model, even if the earth created electomagnetic waves. What we can see in this video is either an electron beam or the medium in which the light passes through is affected by the magnet, but not the light. Please believe me, it&#39;s not that simple.</p>

<p>EDIT: Yeah, even the uploader of that video stated in the comments that the medium was bent: &quot;<em>It&#39;s the nano-sized ferro particles inside the cell that are responsible for creating this effect.</em> He just called the video like that because he &quot;<em>just thought it was a &#39;catchy&#39; phrase...ï»¿</em>&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What needs to be explained in regards to gravity?  There&#39;s up and there&#39;s down and things fall down.  That&#39;s really all there is to it.</p>

<p>In flat earth, the cosmology is completely different.  Stars aren&#39;t enormous balls of gas that are generating fusion due to their size.  They&#39;re just lights in the sky.  The &quot;disk&quot; of the earth could very well be an infinite plane, though it&#39;s thought our known world is a circle enclosed by Antarctica.  Some people believe there&#39;s a firmament or dome that you encounter if you try to reach &quot;the edge&quot;, but there&#39;s no reason to think there is an edge where the earth just ends.  It could be infinitely expansive.</p>

<p>So gravity could simply be a natural 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup> force that pulls things downward.  What further explanation is necessary?  Flat earth generally doesn&#39;t hold that this has any affect on the sun, moon, and stars because those are luminaries that exist within or beyond the firmament.  So then it&#39;s just up and down, things will rise or fall based upon their density relative to their medium and that natural downward force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does downwards have to equal center of mass?  Aren&#39;t they still looking for the graviton particle?  They can&#39;t prove what causes gravity, it&#39;s just theorized that gravity is a property of mass.  The idea that it&#39;s dictated by center of mass is only necessary to explain how people stand upside down on the ball earth but still stick to it, or how celestial objects interact with each other.  There aren&#39;t people upside down on the bottom of the flat earth model, so everything is just naturally drawn downward on the earth-plane.  Celestial bodies are just luminaries, so their interaction isn&#39;t really any gauge as to how the downward force on earth functions.  Down is down and up is up.  It isn&#39;t relative or caused by anything per se other than a natural law.</p>

<p>Well, if you don&#39;t consider celestial bodies as fakes, you&#39;ll quickly see that more mass means stronger gravity. Also, the deeper you dig into the earth. I don&#39;t know the explanation for the magnetosphere on a flat earth, but on a globe it&#39;s generated by the spinning hot iron core in earth&#39;s center. To make it spin, the earths mantle needs to be fluid. And that&#39;s because gravity causes such a high pressure from every direction that the energy is enough to melt it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Celestial bodies are just luminaries</p>

<p>I can see for example Jupiter and Saturn through my telescope very well. I don&#39;t think that they&#39;re just luminaries. Also the moon is definitely no luminary. Or how would you explain moon phases?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have never even drilled into the mantle to confirm its existence.  8 miles down is the deepest they&#39;ve gotten.  I don&#39;t pretend to know what exists beyond that.  Maybe it just gets naturally hotter as you go down until all the rock melts to magma.  Certainly the pressure from the rock above would be greater regardless whether or not earth is a ball.  Likewise, I don&#39;t claim that earth&#39;s magnetism is caused by an unproven theory (spinning liquid iron core). I simply say I don&#39;t know.  It&#39;s more honest than the alternative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or how would you explain moon phases?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It generates them itself? Makes about as much sense as the phases being caused by its angle relative to the sun.  Some flat eathers believe that angle relative to the sun is still the cause of the phases and the sun and moon are spheres within the firmament.  Could be, but who knows what the moon really is?  I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s another world that you can travel to and stand on, but I don&#39;t claim to know exactly what it is.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, it&#39;s a light in the sky.  Anything other than that is religion in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you gotta admit that globe theory accounts for the celestial bodies much better. Luminaries means nothing. It makes more sense that stuff out in the cosmos is similar to down here; more matter that condensed into spheres. Do you think if there is a firmament then someone built it, or is it the firmament of nature, or what?</p>

<p>The truth is better than anything.  You can create a great explanation for something with a lot of math equations to show how it would work if your assumptions are correct, but if it isn&#39;t true then what good is it?  You can make up a creation story with all kinds of interesting gods and it&#39;s worth about just as much.   I don&#39;t believe the earth is <em>known</em> to be a sphere by experiment and observation.  I don&#39;t believe people can conclude with certainty what the celestial bodies are either.  Saying that matter condensed into spheres may be very palatable or &quot;elegant&quot; but I&#39;m only interested in actual knowledge.</p>

<p>The Bible says that there was a firmament created by God, some people say there&#39;s a dome built by aliens, maybe there exists a natural strata of planes that extends upward like the strata of rocks below.  Who really knows?  I can&#39;t verify a firmament myself.  I don&#39;t think the flat earth is 100% proven either.  I just don&#39;t really concern myself with it anymore.  People that preach one way or the other are just talking about something they don&#39;t/can&#39;t fully understand in my opinion.</p>
