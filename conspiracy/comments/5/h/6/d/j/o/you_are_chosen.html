        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Reddit works on a very simple biological manner. It caters to our visual nature as human beings. As a human being, we are constantly seeking validation and a sense of belonging. That is what CTR has weaponized. Looking at the pattern in which they upvote certain comments, it is quite apparent what their strategy is: make it seem like the mass majority is against us, that to join us would be to join the losing side.  Who wants to be with a bunch of losers? They accomplish this by showering upvotes in contradiction to our messages to make it appear that we are a small group of people with no direction. </p>

<p>Many people have already developed a negative connotation of who we are. They assume we are time wasting fools who have nothing better going on in our lives so we resort to creating ruckus and drama to give ourselves purpose. They could not be any more wrong. </p>

<p>I live a productive life. By day, I am a graphic designer and an active participant in my artist community. I curate art shows and fairs that bring joy and culture to the people around me. By night, I meet with friends and occassionally go out. By late night I am investigating and putting in my due diligence to persuade friends that there is something invisibly sinister afoot in the authorities that dictate our lives. </p>

<p>I freely do this because I understand the importance of what we are trying to do. We aren&#39;t getting paid for any of this. We are actually placing ourselves in actual danger as I assume what we say is being watched and recorded to a database where one day, if our group was ever to become completely marginalized, we would soon face complete persecution and possibly imprisonment. It sounds like a stretch but the pope even announced that we are committing a sin. </p>

<p>It is only a matter of time before they come for us.</p>

<p>But there is hope. Many lurkers understand that they cannot be visible participants in this sub because of the danger of association so they continue to lurk. This is reflected in the upvotes of our posts. We have over 400,000 subscribers, more than most, yet see such little activity. </p>

<p>I implore to the lurkers to spread the truth. We are the last ones standing. If they succeed in silencing us, it is pretty much game over. I know this sounds like a stretch but this is how seriously we must take the hard work we are doing here. I have been a lurker for quite a long time but realized I need to throw my voice in here. </p>

<p>I repeat, we are the last ones standing. Milo is compromised and reports to his &quot;daddy.&quot; Trump has used us to gain the presidency. Kanye is now portrayed as a loser like one of us. </p>

<p>You have been blessed with a rare gift. A resilient mind that remained open to all perspectives despite the massive bombardment of expert brainwashing techniques that have seduced the world. You have been chosen. Whether it is from God, 4th dimensional beings, our genes, it does not matter. You have been entrusted with a great responsibility. I beg you not to be lazy or jaded or give up because true evil never rests and rejoices in our apathy especially. Because we are the last bastion to save humankind. Yes it has come to that. This knowledge that we share and spread has been floating around the internet for some time now. It is this very moment that the pieces are now in our favor. </p>

<p>Brothers, sisters, this is the moment where we cannot rest. Let this be the reason we wake up in the morning. Let this be our guiding force. </p>

<p>Do not ignore the call. If you do, you are now an accessory to the evil that wishes to consume this world since you have been entrusted with this burden. </p>

<p>There will be those that laugh at you, that jeer at you, that curse you, that slander you. But there are beautiful young children at stake. There are lives at stake. You are it. Do your part. Spread the truth. Help people bring forth what has been on the back of everyone&#39;s mind. There is something afoot. They can sense it. Help them bring it to light. </p>

<p>I wish everyone Godspeed in the dark journey that lies ahead. Let truth fucking prevail. Lets cast the fucking evil out. If they silence us, we prove to them they can get away with anything.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: The highest upvoted thread has been deleted here mysteriously with the highest upvoted comment with over a hundred upvotes. I am certain it has to do with links within the thread that cited a &quot;high level anon&quot; from 4chan. Unfortunately I do not remember the username but if you do return here, please post them again. Reddit is now deleting threads in its entirety. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s because the more of an open mind you have the more likely you are to listen to what people have to say than to try and drown out the stuff you don&#39;t want to hear. So you end up listening to/reading lots of different arguments and then go off and try and find other sources and compare everything to come to your own conclusions.</p>

<p>This while #pizzagate thing has had me intrigued from the start. I hope none of it&#39;s true, but with every day and every single thing I read/watch, it just feels like it gets harder and harder to dismiss. And as other posts have stated, never have I seen such a concentrated and synchronized push to dismiss something.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong> <em>puts tinfoil hat on</em>. Something else that I found interesting, recently Reddit changed its upvote algorithm, thus leading to lots of posts from the past few years suddenly being buried and only posts from the past few hours/days being seen on page after page. But that is just a coincidence right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reddit changed it&#39;s vote algorithm dismissal comments of pizzagate shot way up to the top in comment threads here. I think it smells fishy. Not long after admins ban pizzagate, citizen_investigators, and operation_Berenstain, here and T_D are some of the very few places on reddit that pizzagate is being actively talked about and not shut down. Not to mention the leaked admin chat that proved they wanted to ban T_D even after spez was caught shadow-editing comments there. (did he ever apologise?)<br/>
I don&#39;t like it at all. I only lurk over on voat.co, but participate here, but I can see the sheer amount of active suppression against us and it worries me. I&#39;m very ready to leave reddit for a more secure site to pursue pizzagate on, but I know most people here still haven&#39;t migrated to voat so I&#39;ll stick around keeping an eye on things until it just gets too much, then see what people are saying on where to move. Whether it be voat or something else someone creates just for this.<br/>
I&#39;d like to see an original, open-source, vote based website with balanced discussion boards on posts purely made for this, but alas I&#39;m no IT genius so I&#39;ll just keep floating that idea about until someone better equipped than I, and with the available time, will put in the effort to create that. </p>

They&#39;ve been planning this for hundreds, if not thousands, of years and you think they don&#39;t have plans for controlled revolutions and counter revolutions. You&#39;ll beg for the antichrist to save you from the crumbling system of reality you&#39;ve been sold your whole life. Ordo ab Chao is the name of the game, and the father of lies is at the helm.

<p>I respect your right to believe in religion, but telling people that the only chance they have to be &quot;saved&quot; (what does that even mean) is to read the bible is outright dangerous.</p>

<p>Biblical texts are not roadmaps to some sort of salvation, and jesus is not going to &quot;return&quot; because he was just a normal human being. </p>

<p>There will never be a biblical apocalypse. Never. I know that might sadden you, but its true. People from every single generation for the entirety of humankind has spouted off that they &quot;know&quot; that biblical apocalypse will happen in their lifetime. </p>

<p>Guess what? It never has and never will because its absolute rubbish.</p>

This is human evil. And the only good that can be the savior of ourselves and our nations is human good and perseverance. I am not going to ask why a god hasn&#39;t stopped all of this from happening, because as an other-dimensional being it would be impossible, and is impossible, to understand it. We must rely on ourselves and the good in people to bring this to light and to defeat these corrupted &quot;officials&quot; in our government and media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe God gave us free will to see if we would be smart enough to reject him.</p>

<p>Do you have free will? If God told you to do something, would you? Would you kill your son on the top of a mountain because you heard God?</p>

<p>What kind of benevolent God would kill your family and afflict you with unbearable pain, because he made a bet with satan? Cause that&#39;s exactly what he did to Job.</p>

<p>Remember, God made Lucifer, knowing that he would betray him. Knowing that because of this, all the evil and terrible things that happen. But he still chose to create Satan, and then said if we don&#39;t use our free will during our short lives to choose him, God, he would condemn us to an <em>enternity</em> of torture.</p>

<p>He sent his only son to die a terrible death at the hands of his creation... Because why? God failed? He felt bad? He realized he fucked up? He&#39;s supposed to be omnipotent... Why did he do everything he did, all while knowing the outcome?</p>

<p>If you ask me, God is no better than Lucifer. Who knows? Maybe God created Lucifer to be a scapegoat? I mean, one of his creations, the lion, will eat animals alive. Actually all of creation is basically premised on killing to survive. Sounds so perfect and amazing.</p>

<p>Ahh but I forgot. It was <strong><em>us</em></strong>, his flawed creation, that caused all this in the first place! We choose this thru Eve, whom I&#39;ve never met, yet still I suffer for her &quot;sin.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the bible. God limits hinself according to his own revelation of Himself. He created Lucifer and &quot;found&quot; iniquity in Him. God had a plan. That doe not mean he knows what everyone&#39;s decision is going to be. He did not create someone already knowing what choice they were going to make. All throughout the bible he is observing his own creation. God only knows sin as he has seen it in rebels. </p>

<p>God even says about the people who were buring babies to Moloch the old testament that what they were doing &quot;never even came into my mind&quot;. </p>

<p>You also do not understand thr book of Job. It is the oldest book in the bible, Job didn&#39;t even know there was a satan and he made 70 something accusations against God. And later repented to God. Then God gave him twice has much as he had before. The entire boom of Job and his suffering lasted maybe a couple months at the most. In the very beginning of the book Job was makijg sacrifices to God out of fear that his evil sons were going to cause all these bad things to happen to him and later afyer every thing he feared came true he said &quot;the very thing I feared came upon me&quot; the point was is that Job opened the door to Satan through fear. He was putting faith in fear and when you put faith in something like that it has power. </p>

<p>There are a lot of things to learn from Job but the point of the book is not &quot;why do bad things happen to good people?&quot; But more &quot;what do you do when you don&#39;t know why?&quot; Are you going to curse God and die like Satan was betting on or trust that you don&#39;t have all the answers and that having faith in God no matter what happens. This is what Job learned when God came to down and told challenged him after he was blaming God for these things (ignorantly) and God said &quot;where were you when I created all this? Gird up your loins like a man! Tell me, if you understand&quot; I am parephrasing here but seriously god re read the book. Job even prophesied the need for someone like Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Here is what he says...</p>

<p>“My life passes more swiftly than a runner.
    It flees away without a glimpse of happiness.
26 It disappears like a swift papyrus boat,
    like an eagle swooping down on its prey.
27 If I decided to forget my complaints,
    to put away my sad face and be cheerful,
28 I would still dread all the pain,
    for I know you will not find me innocent, O God.
29 Whatever happens, I will be found guilty.
    So what’s the use of trying?
30 Even if I were to wash myself with soap
    and clean my hands with lye,
31 you would plunge me into a muddy ditch,
    and my own filthy clothing would hate me.
32 “God is not a mortal like me,
    so I cannot argue with him or take him to trial.
33 If only there were a mediator between us,
    someone who could bring us together.
34 The mediator could make God stop beating me,
    and I would no longer live in terror of his punishment.
35 Then I could speak to him without fear,
    but I cannot do that in my own strength.&quot;</p>

<p>This is why God sent Jesus to empty Himself from is God like nature and live as a mere human being and give His life. Niw no one can blame God for not understanding humans and not know what it is like being in there shoes. God found a way to separate Himself from Himself in order to re establish our relationship with Him through Jesus Christ. This was the only way possible for this to work. Now Jesus Christ is the mediator between God the Father and man.</p>

<p>God has probably created beings for who knows how long and they all ended up rebeling against him. So he came up with the ultimate plan before he created living beings with free will in His own image and after his own likeness. And is using all the rebels to his own game. </p>

<p>I can tell you have never read the bible to try and understand it. Keep reading. God bless, I hope you find Christ.</p>

<p>This life is the shortest thing you will ever do. We are but a vapor, we come and go like airplanes arriving and departing. Our life is as quick as a flower blooming and dying. 1 day to God is as a 1000 years and 1000 years as 1 day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I think you see things that way because your belief demands it. I see it happen all the time. Someone finds God and <em>boom</em> mind is closed to any open thought.</p>

<p>Your reasoning does not account for the simple fact that God gives us a choice: worship Him and be spared edamnation, or deny him and suffer for <em>eternity</em>.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t sound like a very just God to me. Love us but won&#39;t forgive us, however weak and frail we may be.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame really. I&#39;ve seen such great open minded thinkers become obsessed fools after thinking they found God. They are shadows of their former selves. Can&#39;t have any rational conversation with them, everything is somehow &quot;because God&quot;.</p>

<p>We are biological robots, we do as the chemicals in our brains dictate.</p>

Whichever one a person serves out of there own free will is the kingdom they choose. God never created hell for humans he created for the devil and his angels who are kingdom of darkess. God is not sending anyone anywhere. People simply choose where they want to go themselves. People love darkness rather than light. Just look at what everyone on tv is obsseded with. Violence.

    <div class="md"><p>I too, am a graphic designer by day and investigative searcher by night. My posts on the traditional social media falls on deaf ears, from posting news about a censorship agenda, gun removal agenda, free speech agenda, false flags, various crisis facts etc. NOTHING. I have woke up one or two people (half way) they are at least open to my thoughts. But as soon as I post dumb shit about my house or a family photo, my feed blows up with activity. It can be very disheartening to say the least. I had more faith in the people I know, but they take everything at face value or arent interested at all. And they laugh at me for my rants or predictions (most of which have come true or are true) and call me weirdo.</p>

<p>But i take a certain satisfaction knowing I am one step ahead of them. I&#39;ve since refocused my fight to make sure nobody loses their amendment rights. And to make sure they know they can still use them, that it&#39;s okay to be proud of who you are and your country. That it&#39;s okay to be non-traditional but just as okay to be traditional. If they can see me doing well, and see my words ring true, perhaps they will ask me more questions or maybe even wake up.</p>

<p>There is so much happening around us. &quot;Cognitive dissonance&quot; doesn&#39;t even begin to describe the state of reality we&#39;ve found ourselves in. It takes a lot of bravery and intent to willingly remain in this state and spread our message, by whatever means possible. In ways that can be heard and felt, not just read.</p>

<p>ps - hey fellow musician!! (makes sense doesn&#39;t it?)</p>

<p>I wrote music for Masquerada, a video game that recently came out, and I absolutely embedded my emotion in to that music. (the first two track titles speak for themselves)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s see, musician and composer here as well with a total of 16 years of audio engineering (actually more if I consider when I worked under a head engineer.) </p>

<p>I own a company called PROJECT MONARK (what a name), our company logo is a monarch butterfly and we produce transmedia projects. Transmedia is the telling of cohesive stories across multiple platforms so think of TWD as its a prime example. Our first IP, GOD&#39;S CALAMITY was started four years ago and the core experience was just completed some months ago. We have the concept album and the comic book series that takes place after the comic. Now I&#39;m mentioning this because I want to outline some of the things we had, that made it to the comic, before it was in the news. </p>

<p>A female politician with ties to a secret society and occult? Check. Human traficking and weapons being done out of an eatery? Check. A soccor team from Argentina dyng in a plane crash? Check. A whistle blower being killed because he got too close? Check. A person, who was part of a conspiracy, breaking ranks and doing it from jail? Check. An Internet revolution? Check. And all of this was done <em>before</em> it even happened or came to light. Trigger words? Check. School shootings? Check. Substance abuse? Check. Physical, sexual and mental abuse? Check. Unemployment? Check. Suicide? Check. And all of this is the tip of the ice berg.</p>

<p>The point is, I had a vision and people knew I wasn&#39;t the crazy one because of how I get, process and use information. I don&#39;t surround myself with sycophants but with people who see shit for what it is. And you know what? All of us are stress free when it comes to the madness because we take an &quot;in the world but not of the world&quot; approach. </p>

<p><strong>What can you do to help the revolution??</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>TALK ABOUT IT!</strong>
From all the money they&#39;re pouring into shilling, they REALLY don&#39;t want us to talk about it. Its important to spread the message online but don&#39;t forget about talking about it to friends and family irl! I&#39;m a college student so many of my friends are college educated,  and I have yet explain pizzagate to someone who straight up refuses to believe there&#39;s anything suspicious. The CTR wants you to believe your silly conspiracy theories will be mocked and laughed at, BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE! </p></li>
<li><p><strong>JOIN THE FIGHT!</strong>
It has been very clear now that conspiracy has been fighting against an onslaught of shills from the elites. Simply calling someone a shill does not help our case. <strong>FIGHT THEM</strong> argue with them until your blue in the face! Don&#39;t let even a single post  trying to discredit our investigation left unrefuted. Lurkers will read every comment and see our truth everytime these shills try to cover this shit up. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Be <strong>RELENTLESS!!</strong></p>

<p>Its really a struggle. People think I&#39;m crazy for some of things I&#39;ve said trying to question certain major events. Just the mention of 911 being an inside job has people getting angry at me. I don&#39;t care though, I will continue searching for the truth. It&#39;s people like us, who just want a happy, productive, and progressive world who should be in charge. Not these sick, demented, greedy people who are trying to dominate the planet. They are pure evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s because the more of an open mind you have the more likely you are to listen to what people have to say than to try and drown out the stuff you don&#39;t want to hear. So you end up listening to/reading lots of different arguments and then go off and try and find other sources and compare everything to come to your own conclusions.</p>

<p>This while #pizzagate thing has had me intrigued from the start. I hope none of it&#39;s true, but with every day and every single thing I read/watch, it just feels like it gets harder and harder to dismiss. And as other posts have stated, never have I seen such a concentrated and synchronized push to dismiss something.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong> <em>puts tinfoil hat on</em>. Something else that I found interesting, recently Reddit changed its upvote algorithm, thus leading to lots of posts from the past few years suddenly being buried and only posts from the past few hours/days being seen on page after page. But that is just a coincidence right?</p>
