       This (obvious) false flag was done in 2012.  CNN has been using bluescreen/greenscreen sets for 'fake news' since the first gulf war.  The fake news probably goes back further than that too

       that covers all of the horrible shit Sandy Hoaxers put the father of one of the slain children through. It also contains an interview with one of the primary hoaxers behind this conspiracy. You should do yourself a favor and read it.

       Just curious - do you think it's possible for an ordinary citizen to have psychological issues/extremist motivations and commit a mass shooting? Or are they only conspiracies by the government?

       Bullshit. Have you ever been to a school with no security cameras? I sure haven't. If this was indeed a real shooting, there would be video evidence similar to that of the shooting at Columbine High. 
Give me a single link that
       <em>
        proves
       </em>
       that the Sandy Hook shooting actually happened and I might consider it. Otherwise, there is no reason to believe it was anything more than a hoax.

       My high school that I graduated from had no security cameras. Shit, several halls in my college didn't have cameras. Are you American? It's not like the UK or the rest of Europe where everything is on CCTV. Particularly when you move outside of major cities. You'd be amazed how many places don't have video cameras. The lack of video is really not a surprise and by no means evidence of a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of links, nothing I send to you will convince you. I honestly don't even think that photos of dead children in pools of their own blood would make most SH hoaxers believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I admit, I don't know your stance on PG but I find it ironic that there is so much concern for children being abused but a refusal to believe that scores of children were brutally murdered by a psycho. All sorts of fucked, awful, terrible shit happens in this world every day. Would you not believe they are real events either, unless ISIS style HD videos were available for every one of them?

       Sure, there are some schools that have fewer cameras than others, but that doesn't mean that these schools have ZERO cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the contrary, I'd accept any video evidence with open arms, and so would the others that frequent this sub. If you can provide a single conclusive video, then your job is done.

       In regards to PG, there are all kinds of factors that point towards a conspiracy. With only a couple of keyword searches you'll find numerous
       <em>

       posts that provide pretty solid evidence that suggests Ping Pong Pizza is involved in some pretty fucked up stuff.

       You don't have to know the motive for a crime to know a crime has been committed. Motives are only useful for finding the culprit. Sandy Hook was one of a long string of fake terror attacks during Obama's presidency designed to instill fear in a specific portion of the population - in this case, parents. It was not just gun control at play, but laws concerning mental health. The end game is to get more children on prescription drugs and give doctors the ability to prevent people from purchasing guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of Obama's false flags seemed to backfire, yes. Gun ownership has skyrocketed. But look at the evidence of the actual event at Sandy Hook and it's easy to see it was a ridiculous fraud.

       Obama made it legal to carry your gun into national parks.

        He is not interested in taking guns away.
       </a>

      <p>
       Since the republican base has no agenda to take away guns we should see fewer staged shootings under Trump, or at least see more shootings that are stopped by a responsible gun owner.

       That's horseshit. There are people who know Obama personally (Mark Levin) that have heard him say he doesn't believe private citizens should be allowed to own guns. Anything like this is just red meat to throw at the public to calm them down.

       I mean the guy gets up after every one of these staged attacks and immediately starts talking about gun control and says "this doesn't happen in other countries" so it's obvious what he's trying to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, he's right, it doesn't happen in other countries because they don't have a CIA/DHS with nothing better to do than facilitate hoax shootings to erode its citizens rights.

       sources? (because you said people) I am interested in knowing where you got this info from. I would definitely be willing to entertain this perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I meet his claims with a bit of skepticism as Mark Levin is a well known conservative, often blaming big government for most of the nation's problems. Also he frequently appears on Hannity and friends perpetuating the right's narratives. So i think there is a bit of bias in his position.

       Yeah but Mark was a Reagan admin and he knows what he talks abot whether or not you agree with him. He's not a journalist or someone pushing narrative. He's just an old conservative with a very conservative listening audience. If he says he met Obama, I don't see him as the type to lie about that.

       This sub is for evidence based accusations not your personal feelings. His gripe is that we LEGALLY CANNOT study gun related deaths. But owning guns make us safer! So then let the CDC study gun violence and they'll publish the data for all to see. But you wont accept those results since the CDC is conveniently owned by the left (somehow) and has an anti-gun agenda. Just like they have an anti-obese agenda and an anti-Zika virus agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can tell the difference between the KKK and white people, or muslims and ISIS then you can tell the difference between a public health situation and the government taking guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me know when the government finally does take those guns.

       You of all people should know Obama likes to keep himself clean. Of course he would never say something like that. That's why you watch his actions. One pro gun move out of a thousand is clearly just compromise strategy.

       From what I understood there was a bill introduced but It failed to pass. Obama had the parents of the kids who were killed help write the bill. When it didn't pass he had them walk out to the Whitehouse lawn, where he made a speech about how sad it was that they couldn't pass the bill. A few months later Obama then used an executive order to mandate some changes. That executive order is now on the chopping block for president elect trump.

       While efforts to pass gun control laws at the Federal level have largely stalled, states have done most of the legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just this past election here in California, a new law was passed banning high capacity magazines and requiring gun owners to register to buy ammo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an article from HuffPo from Nov.  2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the wake of Sandy Hook, lawmakers in New York and Connecticut banned the possession of semi-automatic weapons and large-capacity magazines, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, over the past three years, 39 states have passed at least 117 new pieces of legislation that make gun laws more strict, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonpartisan group that tracks legislation across the country."
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill have to look for more sources on legislation passed since 2014 but it may be, that "they" decided to act on the state and even city and county level to pass anti 2nd amendment laws to take the heat off Obama and accusations of gun grabbing.

       Here's things directly from the Wikipedia page. Took me two minutes to gather this information.
"On January 16, 2013, Obama signed 23 executive orders and proposed 12 congressional actions regarding gun control.[182] His proposals included universal background checks on firearms purchases, an assault weapons ban, and limiting magazine capacity to 10 cartridges.[183][184]"
-My understanding is that an EO is immediately enacted regardless of Congress' approval
      </p>
      <p>
       "On January 16, 2013, New York became the first U.S. state to act after the shooting when it enacted the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act.[188] On April 4, 2013, Connecticut and Maryland both enacted new restrictions to their existing gun laws.[189][190] Ten other states had passed laws that relaxed gun restrictions.[191]"
-Atleast two states responded to the event with increased gun restrictions
      </p>
      <p>
       "Legislation introduced in the first session of 113th Congress included the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013[192][193] and the Manchin-Toomey Amendment to expand background checks on gun purchases.[194][195] Both were defeated in the Senate on April 17, 2013.[196]"
-While it failed, there was a clear attempt following this event to pass gun control laws
      </p>
      <p>
       "On June 5, both houses (Senate and House of Representatives) of the Connecticut state legislature passed a bill modifying the state's Freedom of Information Act in order to "prevent the release of crime-scene photos and video evidence from the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre and other Connecticut homicides, concerned such records would be spread on the Internet." The bill then went on to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's desk for his signature. The bill creates a new exemption to the state's Freedom of Information Act. The release of photographs, film, video, digital or other visual images depicting a homicide victim is prevented if such records "could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the victim or the victim's surviving family members."[217]
-Not gun control, but feeds into people's belief that it served as a platform for online censorship

       But they have to see that if you take guns away from innocent people, the only people who will have guns are going to be criminals or people with an intense desire to maintain their second amendment rights (who would likely still be criminals, if guns are outlawed). Not just people who want to protect themselves or go hunting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like the war on drugs or prohibition. Taking something away from people in a official capacity only makes it easier for them to obtain that something through unofficial means, creating a bigger problem than you had before.

       Australia has had a ban on firearms and they haven't had a shooting death in over 20 years. Guns that you can buy in the US for $500 run for like $27000 there. The black market may be easy but it Damn sure isn't affordable. If you have that kind of money to blow on a gun I think you would spend it better.

       The only problem is criminals don't obey the law. Any loss of life is tragic, so don't get me wrong. Using the same logic used by law enforcement, "You shouldn't condemn all because of a few bad apples" should apply to all lawful gun owners. In the end criminals will find a way regardless of any law or ban made by government.

       I don't think it's about gun control at all. Evil people do evil things and evil people live off the fear they create. What's more terrifying than the idea that elementary school kids will be slaughtered?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can go even further and consider the satanic aspects of pizza gate. Those same people are the ones responsible for the fake killings (Sandy Hook) and the real ones (911). It's all about the benefits of fear.

       Reaching a conclusion first and then cherrypicking evidence for it is a pretty bad way of going about things. By asking why someone would want to fake a mass shooting, it's pretty clear that you're already convinced that it was faked, and it's just a matter of what the motive was.

       There's this guy named Leonard P. Ozner who is behind protecting this fraudulent event. He runs the "honr" network which is a group of paid shills to try and keep the fraudulence covered up. I imagine he is in a garage full of computers. Whenever Sandy hook comes up, he and his shill buds will try to make it look like the event really occurred. I hope to meet him on the street one day.

       Sandy Hook wasn't a hoax but if you had any ounce of self awareness you would know that. Have you spoken to anyone from Sandy Hook personally? Wait I forgot, they're all in on it. I forgot the false flag achieved what they supposedly set out to do... Oh wait.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could kind of tell Sandy Hook is a little personal for me, I'll let you put two and two together while you're in front of your desktop combing through blurry photos and videos.

       I'm not 99.9% sure Sandy Hook was a complete sham, I'm 100% sure, but I'd like to see your best evidence for thinking it was real since you persist in looking past the mountain of evidence it was a hoax.

       That video is so grainy and in such a low resolution I'm shocked his entire face wasn't rendered indistinguishable. Which is obviously intentional because if you were to view the 1080p version of that clip the nose wouldn't vanish.

       My high school that I graduated from had no security cameras. Shit, several halls in my college didn't have cameras. Are you American? It's not like the UK or the rest of Europe where everything is on CCTV. Particularly when you move outside of major cities. You'd be amazed how many places don't have video cameras. The lack of video is really not a surprise and by no means evidence of a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of links, nothing I send to you will convince you. I honestly don't even think that photos of dead children in pools of their own blood would make most SH hoaxers believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I admit, I don't know your stance on PG but I find it ironic that there is so much concern for children being abused but a refusal to believe that scores of children were brutally murdered by a psycho. All sorts of fucked, awful, terrible shit happens in this world every day. Would you not believe they are real events either, unless ISIS style HD videos were available for every one of them?
