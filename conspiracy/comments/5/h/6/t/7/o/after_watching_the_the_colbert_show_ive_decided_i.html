    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit. Colbert gave so much misinformation in that segment.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Flynn tweet wasn&#39;t even about pizzagate</li>
<li>Built a strawman of pizzagate claiming it was only too many mentions of the word &quot;pizza&quot; rather than the context of code words</li>
<li>claimed people think Clinton is running a sex ring out of CPP, rather than Alefantis</li>
<li>Claiming Wikileaks got the emails from Russian hacking when there is no evidence.</li>
</ul>

<p>BTW, I have thought from the get go that it is highly unlikely that CPP is actually location for child trafficking (at least in the sense that children would be directly on the premises). However, that fact alone doesn&#39;t mean the whole thing is bullshit. That&#39;s just one facet of it, and it happens to be the weakest link so people are trying to make it seem like CPP is all that pizzagate is about.</p>

What worries me is that everyone  jumped on the pedophile bandwagon so quickly other avenues of discussion evaporated. Something is/was happening - There just isn&#39;t enough factual evidence to pinpoint the cause. This will take time and as everyone points out...critical thinking.</p>

<p>That does not imply that the handkerchief has a drawing of a map on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those look like Italian pizza place-related maps. Not &quot;pizza-related maps.&quot;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say it was an insignificant, expendable handkerchief - why did she even bother mentioning it to him and include that &quot;they can send it to you if you want.&quot; If it&#39;s just a regular ole handkerchief I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t imperative for him to retrieve it. That&#39;s a lot of effort for a piece of replaceable cloth. </p>

<p>Conversely, if it WAS a very important handkerchief, why did she add &quot;I know you&#39;re busy, so feel free not to respond if it&#39;s not yours or you don&#39;t want it.&quot; That last part throws everything off, too. I&#39;ve never had anyone hit me up about discovering a lost possession of mind and suggesting they can throw it out for me. That only happens when the newly-discovered possession is of sketchy nature. </p>

<p>I see that a piece of cloth with pizza on it isn&#39;t far-fetched, but think rationally and deeper about these people: they aren&#39;t hipsters or college chicks obsessing over pizza. Homeboy was heavily involved  with politics in Bill&#39;s time in office, plus is out here being associated with spirit cooking and a bunch of other weird stuff; therefore, him owning a handkerchief with a map about pizza seems unlikely to me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not mentioned. One says black and white handkerchief the other says she &quot;thinks it has a map that seems pizza related&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>she casually sees a handkerchief that is black and white, why is that hard to explain? You are looking so hard for strange things you are ignoring the obvious interpretation. What would you call a black and white map printed handkerchief if you quickly looked at it, not examining what is on it? That is why the person who knows Podesta clarified after looking closer at it. </p>

<p>This is not complex stuff to figure out, not sure why people need it explained. The complex stuff comes in trying to find some nefarious meaning to simple innocent throw-away emails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is 2 different people. So, your only problem is with the word &quot;think&quot;? Other than that it is not suspicious? I made my point, you want to keep chasing dragons go ahead. Or, how about you provide some evidence there is any other way to interpret this. I laid it out, with explanations and images. You tell me how it makes sense that Susaner (who, in your interpretation must be in on the whole thing) thinks it is not that important, and Podesta might not care about what happens to it. I brought that up initially, but you failed to respond to this obvious point which makes the PG theory make no sense. Why would Susaner think Podesta would not want a semen stained handkerchief that proves he committed a terrible crime back or destroyed immediately?</p>

<p>Two different people, two different (but not incompatible) descriptions. The first description is &quot;white w/ black&quot;, the second is &quot;has a map that seems pizza-related.&quot; The handkerchief can be both of these things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m with you. I&#39;m definitely a big skeptic with conspiracies. I take things with a grain of salt too (hence the name). The emails are the heart of this thing. Connections like &quot;X knows Y&quot; or &quot;Y and X were at the same place at the same time&quot; don&#39;t really convince me of much. I&#39;m skeptical about the Madeleine McCann connection as well. I&#39;m also not convinced Alefantis is a pedophile (although I&#39;ve yet to see a reasonable explanation for his instagram hashtags so I also think he is highly suspicious.).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I believe strongly: (1) Podesta was using code words (2) The most likely explanation for those code words is that they were related to pedophilia, because they are similar to existing code words of that nature and because the context would make sense, (3) Tony Podesta and John Podesta have a disturbing taste in art, some of which is borderline child pornography as it is.</p>

<p>These are the facts that I have not seen any MSM source even attempt to debunk. These are the facts that have me convinced there is a conspiracy involving the people in the emails at the very least. These are also the facts that make it more likely than not that the conspiracy involves CP. Unfortunately, no one will hear these facts and they have been conditioned to stop listening as soon as they hear &quot;pizzagate&quot; &quot;wikileaks&quot; or &quot;podesta&quot; because it&#39;s all &quot;fake news.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one would brush aside out-of-the-ordinary messages from Trump because we know he is great/tremendous/only the best at speaking English, so that would make the discovery of Trump speaking in strange code to be even more intriguing and suspicious.
Besides, he already posts everything that&#39;s on his mind for the public to see on Twitter. </p>

<p>Yeah I speak to my girlfriend in a weird way sometimes but it&#39;s out of affection using inside jokes. 
They aren&#39;t just weird messages, these people are speaking in code (pizza-related map ???), especially conveying very irrational reactions, like to the unexpected arrival of &quot;an assortment of cheeses,&quot; in one email for example, and another weird email to the Georgetown alumni group email about selling a shitload of Beanie Babies because that alum&#39;s parents will be in town (he also mentions that the Beanie Babies are like cats and dogs - some get along and some don&#39;t ???? Wtf, those are inanimate objects)</p>
