       Holy shit. Colbert gave so much misinformation in that segment.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The Flynn tweet wasn't even about pizzagate
       </li>
       <li>
        Built a strawman of pizzagate claiming it was only too many mentions of the word "pizza" rather than the context of code words
       </li>
       <li>
        claimed people think Clinton is running a sex ring out of CPP, rather than Alefantis
       </li>
       <li>
        Claiming Wikileaks got the emails from Russian hacking when there is no evidence.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       BTW, I have thought from the get go that it is highly unlikely that CPP is actually location for child trafficking (at least in the sense that children would be directly on the premises). However, that fact alone doesn't mean the whole thing is bullshit. That's just one facet of it, and it happens to be the weakest link so people are trying to make it seem like CPP is all that pizzagate is about.

       I would agree with you, there is definitely a subtext going on here. 
What worries me is that everyone  jumped on the pedophile bandwagon so quickly other avenues of discussion evaporated. Something is/was happening - There just isn't enough factual evidence to pinpoint the cause. This will take time and as everyone points out...critical thinking.

       because it literally says those words? Why would you think it is anything else? How do you rationalize the fact someone asks him if he cares about getting it back if it is what your alternate explanation for it is? It is not like this is some wacky impossible thing, there is an obvious, literal interpretation of the email.

       It says "the realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related."
      </p>
      <p>
       That does not imply that the handkerchief has a drawing of a map on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pizza-related map part severs any rationality in that statement; so no, it's not obvious or literal because what the fuck is a pizza-related map on a handkerchief?

       a map with pizza places on it, such as can be seen on image searches, like of Italy, and over Napoli it shows a pizza pie? Just from a random 2 second google -

       Those look like Italian pizza place-related maps. Not "pizza-related maps."
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say it was an insignificant, expendable handkerchief - why did she even bother mentioning it to him and include that "they can send it to you if you want." If it's just a regular ole handkerchief I'm sure it wasn't imperative for him to retrieve it. That's a lot of effort for a piece of replaceable cloth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely, if it WAS a very important handkerchief, why did she add "I know you're busy, so feel free not to respond if it's not yours or you don't want it." That last part throws everything off, too. I've never had anyone hit me up about discovering a lost possession of mind and suggesting they can throw it out for me. That only happens when the newly-discovered possession is of sketchy nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see that a piece of cloth with pizza on it isn't far-fetched, but think rationally and deeper about these people: they aren't hipsters or college chicks obsessing over pizza. Homeboy was heavily involved  with politics in Bill's time in office, plus is out here being associated with spirit cooking and a bunch of other weird stuff; therefore, him owning a handkerchief with a map about pizza seems unlikely to me

       It's not mentioned. One says black and white handkerchief the other says she "thinks it has a map that seems pizza related". The whole basis for this debunk is that these two women are blabbering idiots that can't give an accurate description. One of which is a real estate agent who essentially makes her living describing homes to potential buyers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply linking something that you feel fits the description of what these women are taking about does not debunk this exchange.

       The realtor literally does not. She describes it as a black and white handkerchief, how do you get map out of that? Do you regally think that if it had a map on it she would describe it only as black and white?

       she casually sees a handkerchief that is black and white, why is that hard to explain? You are looking so hard for strange things you are ignoring the obvious interpretation. What would you call a black and white map printed handkerchief if you quickly looked at it, not examining what is on it? That is why the person who knows Podesta clarified after looking closer at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not complex stuff to figure out, not sure why people need it explained. The complex stuff comes in trying to find some nefarious meaning to simple innocent throw-away emails.

       The only thing less believable than the evidence is the leaps of faith, like that one you just made, relied on by the "debunkers". You seem to be pretty interested in taking the emails literally, except when it doesn't fit your narrative.

       You are applying your interpretation to the black and white handkerchief! It's simple, she calls it black and white then it changes. Then Susan Sandler says she "thinks" it has a map? If it was printed on it as plainly as you say why does nobody make a definitive statement except you?

       it is 2 different people. So, your only problem is with the word "think"? Other than that it is not suspicious? I made my point, you want to keep chasing dragons go ahead. Or, how about you provide some evidence there is any other way to interpret this. I laid it out, with explanations and images. You tell me how it makes sense that Susaner (who, in your interpretation must be in on the whole thing) thinks it is not that important, and Podesta might not care about what happens to it. I brought that up initially, but you failed to respond to this obvious point which makes the PG theory make no sense. Why would Susaner think Podesta would not want a semen stained handkerchief that proves he committed a terrible crime back or destroyed immediately?

       Your bringing up a whole bunch of stuff that I'm not talking about, I'm only addressing the handkerchief and the fact that there are two different descriptions of it. You said it had a map, that is speculation.

       My point is that everyone has this "debunked" but they can't even answer the simplest questions about the whole thing without speculating. Exactly the thing they hate about the evidence itself, the speculative nature of it.

       Two different people, two different (but not incompatible) descriptions. The first description is "white w/ black", the second is "has a map that seems pizza-related." The handkerchief can be both of these things.

       Yeah, I'm with you. I'm definitely a big skeptic with conspiracies. I take things with a grain of salt too (hence the name). The emails are the heart of this thing. Connections like "X knows Y" or "Y and X were at the same place at the same time" don't really convince me of much. I'm skeptical about the Madeleine McCann connection as well. I'm also not convinced Alefantis is a pedophile (although I've yet to see a reasonable explanation for his instagram hashtags so I also think he is highly suspicious.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what I believe strongly: (1) Podesta was using code words (2) The most likely explanation for those code words is that they were related to pedophilia, because they are similar to existing code words of that nature and because the context would make sense, (3) Tony Podesta and John Podesta have a disturbing taste in art, some of which is borderline child pornography as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the facts that I have not seen any MSM source even attempt to debunk. These are the facts that have me convinced there is a conspiracy involving the people in the emails at the very least. These are also the facts that make it more likely than not that the conspiracy involves CP. Unfortunately, no one will hear these facts and they have been conditioned to stop listening as soon as they hear "pizzagate" "wikileaks" or "podesta" because it's all "fake news."

       People just freak out because it's Clinton. I'm not saying Clinton is 100% innocent, but if there were leaked Trump emails with "strange" emails that are hard to decipher, the Trump fans in here would just casually brush it off as "normal."

       No one would brush aside out-of-the-ordinary messages from Trump because we know he is great/tremendous/only the best at speaking English, so that would make the discovery of Trump speaking in strange code to be even more intriguing and suspicious.
Besides, he already posts everything that's on his mind for the public to see on Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah I speak to my girlfriend in a weird way sometimes but it's out of affection using inside jokes. 
They aren't just weird messages, these people are speaking in code (pizza-related map ???), especially conveying very irrational reactions, like to the unexpected arrival of "an assortment of cheeses," in one email for example, and another weird email to the Georgetown alumni group email about selling a shitload of Beanie Babies because that alum's parents will be in town (he also mentions that the Beanie Babies are like cats and dogs - some get along and some don't ???? Wtf, those are inanimate objects)

       Yesterday you posted in here asking for proof of Donald Trump's lies. Are you joking? Did you really believe every word that man said and not question it? That's probably the easiest thing to research in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice: don't be so gullible to believe the statements of other people, whether it's Trump or Colbert.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do your own research and come up with your own opinion because those guys are big names on TV with a lot of followers to influence and a script/narrative/agenda to follow

       WTF is with all the Vice readers and stupid people in this sub??? You watch Colbert? so why the fuck are you here in a conspiracy sub? we don't exactly give a fuck what you heard on a shitty MSM comedy skit by some actor or MSM  rag like Washington Post! Because you think the Comedy Troll Stephen Colbert, who is trolling his viewers is somehow the bastion of truth in a very delicate matter like a covert child abuse ring by powerful elite? Do you have any idea how many leads and countless victims accused Jimmy Saville but nothing was done? We don't give zero shit what you think here!!! . Beware, the sub has many posts your weak mind can't handle, and frankly we don't care whether you or anyone else on Reddit agrees with our content. This isn't a fucking Safe space for weak pussy minds!!
