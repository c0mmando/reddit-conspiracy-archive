       That, and the fact that they're trying to lump in a lot of non-corporate media sites, some sorta questionable- breitbart, infowars... along with wikileaks, which, according to all sources, has no affiliation with those sites.

       Plus wikileaks isn't even news. It's sources. All 100% accurate and straight from the horse's mouth. You can report wikileaks dishonestly, but the site itself is just a resource.

       You don't know what they have. They are not omnipotent gods. They release what they've been given. During Bush's administration they handed out a ton of dirt on the republicans, and Obama came in promising hope and change, but delivered more of the same, solidifying the idea that they are ALL dirty.

       That's exactly my point, no one knows what they have. It only behooves propaganda becaus3 wiki leaks won't question their sources, they just release it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it is a distinct possibility that they selectively release info, or that since they are wiki leaks they receive a large amount of propaganda ammo since they are a prominent news source that doesn't fact check anything.

       This is just so wrong you are spewing nonsense. Everything wikileaks release IS fact-checked extensively and 100 DKMS verified. Just because they don't release what you want to see does NOT mean they have it. I guess fact-checking means releasing what I want to see to you huh?

       Well, the Podesta Email have DKIM indicators, so that shit is airtight.  Would it really have been prudent of them to release some stuff about Trump's taxes or something when
       <em>
        Clinton
       </em>
       was running for President?  The MSM would have pumped all anti-Trump stuff for the entire election, and buried all evidence against Clinton.  I know it's important to have all the facts, but there comes a point where you're just needlessly giving the opposition free ammunition.

       Because naturally, for every thing wrong the DNC does their opposition has to have done something equally as bad or worst and Wikileaks somehow is responsible for finding that... yea makes a lot of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC scumbags directly went after the credibility of Wikileaks with lies over more lies, was Wikileaks supposed to bend over and take it?

       To quote earlier in this thread wiki leaks isn't writing these or finding anything, they are given documents from any source that they don't verify their motives and release it.

       I bet they will, but no one, including Trump is going to put hillary Clinton in a cell. He's said it no longer interests him, straight from the horses mouth. Meanwhile, Petraeus is being considered for the cabinet and has actually been convicted of the same thing hillary has done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, my point wasn't anything with hillary Clinton, it was just how such a disproportionate amount of supposed dirt on one person is the only thing happening. Like there aren't other things that are also as interesting or available to release.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainly, all this Russia love coming about while simultaneously being implicated in more hacks beyond the dnc. Wikileaks feels like grade a propaganda at this point when people don't want to investigate Russia hacks but do want hillary emails.

       If you go by actual concrete evidence, Clinton is likely to have more ties to Russia. You just seem to have bought hard the idea that Trump is somehow a pawn of Russia when its all smoke and mirrors. At some point in the last months Russia started showing public support for Trump but that was after Hillary public threated direct war with them while trying to pin her own mistakes on Russia. Hillary tried to pull the "Russians" out of her ass and its making her look like a fool to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm from a country where the exact same tactics were used by a former president (foundations, high speaking fees, selling internal influence to foreigner agents, etc), the whole Clinton charade doesn't fool me for a second.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the election Trump had the advantage of not being a career politic whose whole life was about abusing power in his favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm surprised that no one was able to come up with something solid on the guy given that he was in construction and how much his opposition despised him. The best they came up with was that he was crass and said "pussy" many years ago (makes him look like a saint). As a Trump supporter I was apprehensive that at some point they would show up with some damming evidence that would turn the tide of the election but it never came. Meanwhile MSM coverage of Hillary scandals spared her the worst parts and they reluctantly covered only what they couldn't hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you realize how much your take would have to change if the hacking charges by the DNC (and Obama administration) where false? The thing is that they are false.

      </p>

       And besides who needs an alternative source like wikileaks releasing shit when we have mainstream media literally sitting on grab the pussy for weeks, months just waiting for the right time to release it.

       They thought if they could release it right before the debates Trump would be fucked.  WRONG.  And that's a mainstream media outlet you're talking about.

       We don't know who Trump owes money to or where all of his business interests lie. Why isn't wikileaks leaking tax returns? Or finding more information on the hillary hack and not just releasing the emails?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not think Russian actors interfering with elections and some people in our government knowing and not saying? It's happened on both sides. Wikileaks motives are so blatant with what they release and sites like brietbart (who is basically in the cabinet of the United States goverment) spread this baited information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump isn't even going after hillary anymore he said it doesn't interest him. It's such a dumb game to distract from real shit.

       I was working at a Los Angeles movie theater when Farenheit 9/11 was released and I remember being surprised at how well it did for a documentary. It was before I had run in to 9/11 truth, but it always struck me that Moore pointed out the Bushes ties to the Saudis but then completely decried the 9/11 truth movement.

       His recent strong support of Hillary, even after the Podesta emails publicly revealed that Podesta was involved in a pedophile ring, was highly suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet if he was asked about it, he would be one of the people strongly insisting it was not possible. A lot of media people are doing that. It is like all of the pedophiles are rushing to support each other.

       Taking the emails in the context of public Instagram and youtube videos (posted by the suspects themselves), as well as the MSM articles about these individuals and their favorite "art" is pretty convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you think that people who know PG is real are a minority, it only looks that way because they have been censored, suspended, and banned here.  It's a
       <em>
        HUGE
       </em>
       phenomenon, and the admin reaction only adds fuel to the fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny and TIL, 9/11 actually had much  better "debunking" efforts than PG. This is because for 9/11, they reviewed the same information as the truthers and made "plausible" arguments against. With, PG, they can and will do no such thing, because if you look at enough of the evidence, it becomes plain that there is creepy stuff going on... Of course, that is also fueling the fire.

       No, it is not convincing at all, even to those within the conspiracy subdomain. You guys are in an information bubble. I correspond with many conspiracy people, am on many forums, and outside of reddit almost no one thinks it is real. I know this is a nearly impossible pill to swallow after you went all-in, but it is the truth. I will be called a shill and downvoted, but someone has to say it. PG people are being used to usher in online censorship, that is why it is promoted on the mainstream. The MSM knows it is safe because it is all bullcrap. Not only that but the links are so tenuous, so weak that anyone coming into it without being surrounded by the internal buzz we created here will immediately dismiss it as being ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in this sub I think the majority think PG is false. They just hate being downvoted and arguing with people, and they don't dig below the front page. Look at the comments on any of the very popular PG posts on the front page and you will see the top comment is almost always critical, and more than half the comments are critical, despite the fact there is a rabid group here who upvotes and comments positively on anything PG related.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public does not believe this, the majority of conspiracy people don't believe it. You are in a small minority and that is why it is the perfect poster child for fake news, and will be used as ammo against all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       911 was carefully debunked because there was real evidence it was a conspiracy. With PG all they have to do is laugh at it.

       Trust this guy, he's got the creds. Between you, New York Times and Stephen Colbert you've almost made a combined 1% of an actual case against Pizzagate. "It's crazy cause it sounds like hurdur" and appealing to (what you state to be) majority opinion is not going to get you far.

       There is so much circumstantial evidence involving Pizza Gate that any nitwit who looks at a handful of pictures and comprehends their implicit meaning would realize there is something incredibly nefarious going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you'd like to talk about the thousands of "coincidences," usage of code words, lack of response to the allegations from the accused other than Alefantis, the fact Anthony Weiner who knew lots of the people involved got caught texting an underage girl with a child in his bed (not a conspiracy or anywhere close), the handkerchief, etc. then we can look at each piece of evidence one by one, to develop this crazy thing called CONTEXT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you can move beyond the evidence compiled and realize that throughout history what people are saying is happening in Pizza Gate HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ALL OF HUMANITY.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many priests do you need to see caught for molesting children before you believe that people in positions of power are prone to this kind of behavior?
      </p>
      <p>
       How much scientific mathematical analytical data do you need to prove to your idiot self that there is clearly something going on, and that uninformed poorly compiled opinions do nothing but serve the plausible deniability of rapists?
      </p>
      <p>
       No seriously. Do you know how many children go missing every year? How about how many go missing in DC? Care to explain it? Let's use our deductive reasoning to figure out what happened to those missing kids all over the world.

       I know you guys believe it, that is obvious. Just no one else does, and the fact you can't see this shows exactly how blinded you are. I feel bad for all the good people who got sucked in. I'm not trying to shut you up, go ahead and keep screaming about it. Don't believe me, couldn't care less. I just wish more real people who don't have their heads up the asses of 4chan would speak up and try to set you guys straight. Have fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: you try to combine PG with international pedophilia. That is all in your mind, that is not pizzagate. That is a whole other concept and you can't tie the two together. One has victimes and evidence, PG does not. All you do is discredit the actual real researchers working on stopping child exploitation. You should consider this carefully. I have a feeling this is exactly the point though, and I do believe most of PG is promoted by psyop people.

       Feel free to decode what was said in those emails. It's not researchers that went on an outlandish goose chase over pizza, they literally used the word in contexts that made no sense, thus creating evidence of code word usage.
      </p>
      <p>
       CP (cheese pizza) is a pretty apparent acronym for something else, it's really not that far-fetched of an idea at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is literally how you hide things in plain sight because no matter how much evidence there is of your code language being used, people incapable of reading things implicitly will never understand it. Those same types of people like news and movies with explicit meaning devoid of substance like Fast &amp; Furious 8 or blaming Russian hackers.

       lol. See, this is what I mean. You say literally used the words in context. That doesn't even mean what you want it to mean. You mean they FIGURATIVELY used the words. The literal interpretation is about FOOD. smh
      </p>
      <p>
       It all makes sense in the emails in context, you just choose to interpret them differently. However, I don't care to debunk PG because, as I said, it doesn't need it. It is obvious this is a wild goose chase. You have literally nothing. Nothing. That is why you are being laughed at, and still you don't understand. Everything has been debunked, there is no evidence, no witnesses, no victims, and no criminal complaint. That is the status of pizzagate. Still, people are asking others who point this out "what about pizza related map? Huh?! Debunk that!!" as if it is evidence of anything at all except you misunderstanding simple english. Again, I don't give a shit what you believe, but someone needs to point out that you are delusional, and this is going fucking nowhere. It is a joke to everyone but you. You'll see eventually of course, but it is disheartening there are so many gullible people on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know something? The words cheese pizza do not even appear in the podesta emails except in mass-emailed aggregators sent out to tons of people. Podesta also didn't even write most of the so-called codeword emails. This is how out of touch you are, you don't even know what non-evidence you have.

       Your assertion that everyone thinks a specific way about pizza gate is patently false, as exemplified by the responses to one singular tweet by John Podesta, his only one in over a month.

       He's right. Cheese pizza was never used on the e-mails. And that picture of the dissapearance of Madelaine is even worse because they try to say that both Podesta brothers look like the kidnappers when in reality the drawings of the kidnappers are just two different drawings of the same guy, not two different persons.

       They say pizza and you are already linking it with child porn even though the only acronym for child porn in the internet is cheese pizza which is never actually said in any of the e-mails.

       Not sure if you are on Twitter, but the suspensions, shadowbans, and trend suppression speak for themselves. I would be interested to learn what you saw that convinced you there is nothing going on, but I see the 16 day old account.

       You say that the top votes are the critical statements, but that you hate getting downvoted for saying otherwise... I'll let you see if you can figure out the contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence is all circumstantial (as far as I know), but so abundant that it boggles the mind. The super active censorship across many platforms is even more "coincidental", as is the "fakenews" push.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever your vested interests in this mess (political, economic, leisure), it would behoove you to stay out of the way until the smoke clears in January. The psychopaths will try to start a civil war before they relinquish power and face prosecution. Remember this and pick your sides carefully.

       The difference between Pizzagate and 9/11 Truth is that the media can't deny the events of September 11. Because there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       an official story, fewer people see the holes in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Pizzagate, the media has the opportunity to control the narrative. They can insist that nothing happened and that we've always been at war with Eastasia, and the nation as a whole will believe them.

       Story Time!
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2006, Rosie O'Donnell represented the leftist/ anti-bush administration side on The View, generally balancing out the neoconservative, pro-authoritarian views of Elizabeth Hasselbeck.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In December 2006, O'Donnell criticized Donald Trump for holding a press conference to reinstate Miss USA Tara Conner, who had violated pageant guidelines, accusing him of using her scandal to "generate publicity for the Miss USA Pageant" (to which he owns the rights) by announcing he was giving her a second chance.[46][47] O'Donnell commented that due to Trump's multiple marital affairs and questionable business bankruptcies, he was not a moral authority for young people in America. She stated, "Left the first wife, had an affair. Left the second wife, had an affair – but he's the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America."[47] In response, Trump began a "vicious" mass media blitz in which he appeared on various television shows, either in person or by phone, threatening to sue O'Donnell (he never did).[48] He called her names, threatened to take away her partner Kelli, and claimed that Barbara Walters regretted hiring her.[48][49][50][51] Walters was stuck in the middle as a social acquaintance of Trump's, and said O'Donnell didn't feel like Walters defended her enough, which led to what both women agreed was an unfortunate confrontation in one of the dressing rooms.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, remember that Trump's relationship with Barbara Walters (Executive producer of The View) extends from their mutual relationship with McCarthy Lawyer Roy Cohn.  Cohn was Trump's lawyer and mentor of sorts.  And Walters was Cohn's "beard" of sorts... (Sidenote:  people involved in the current pizza-themed "investigation" should be looking into Cohn's role in these things).
      </p>
      <p>
       Soon after her conflict with Walters and perhaps due to her apparent waning tenure with the show, Rosie O' began to openly promote questions relating to 9/11 and the investigation into it.  She scheduled her resignation from the program, but only upon securing a final-hour interview with the directors of Loose Change, and frequent contributors to the Alex Jones Show- Korey Rowe and Jason Bermas who were promoting Loose Change Final Cut for a potential theater release (which i believe Charlie Sheen and Mark Cuban had shown interest in producing).  They were to appear on the show for the final segment of the program on May 24th, 2007, days after O'donnell had announced that she was planning to step down from The View.
      </p>
      <p>
       at 4:30 in this Infowars show, they discuss the planning for the segment which was originally scheduled for Thursday 3/24/07, but they indicate had inexplicably been "pushed back" until the next week for a "longer segment".
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/audio/180507loosechange.mp3">
        http://www.prisonplanet.com/audio/180507loosechange.mp3
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, what aired during the final segment of "The View" was a presidential press conference in the rose garden, issued by Bush, to discuss "breaking revelations" regarding the Al Quaeda connection in Iraq.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The 2-year-old information, declassified by the White House a day earlier, provided new information about what Bush described as orders from Osama bin Laden to a key ally in Iraq, Abu Musab Zarqawi, to develop plans for terrorist strikes in other countries, including the United States.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/24/nation/na-alqaeda24">
        http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/24/nation/na-alqaeda24
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       O'donnell was subsequently pushed out of her position and the 9/11 truthers were never given the slot they had been offered.  Jones was subsequently given time on The View in 2011 to discuss the Charlie Sheen melt-down and further trivialize the 9/11 truth movement by associating it with Sheen and Jones' bombastic personality.

       It did, but at the time, the media and PR whores were not clever enough to refresh the conceptual label of Conspiracy Theory. They just reused it. Now it's called
       <em>
        fake news
       </em>
       and every ignoramus is parroting it without digging deeper.

       It really bugs me that so few people seem to actually understand what fake news is. It is an objectively real phenomenon and distinct from satirical news, conspiracy news, sensational dog whistling news, click bait news and regular old crap news. Its not Brietbart, the daily mail, the onion, fox, cnn, BBC, info wars, yahoo news, or the daily mash. Fake news is known mistruths deliberately presented to look like real news. Articles that appear on click bait sites and Facebook feeds, normally in some kind of "sponsored article" section, with irrelevant pictures and sensational headlines that aren't just misleading, far fetched, unfairly or negatively spun, sarcastic, or satirical, but completely made up out of thin air. Clicking on them leads through to some unrelated click bait hell scape, with no sign of the original article and crawling with more fake news articles leading to more fake news sites. It's the news equivalent of those porn video galleries where you never actually get to see a video, just more galleries.

       I know someone will think they're clever and want to point out that parts or all of my description can be applied with greater or lesser degrees of imagination to most of the things I listed as not being fake news, but its a disingenuous point to make. I'm not defending those things, and recognising the phenomenon of fake news doesn't prevent us from talking about problems with other types of news, nor does it mean the term "fake news" has been is taken now refers solely to that phenomenon in every single context and nothing else. All I'm saying is that the thing that people have started talking about recently and referring to as fake news, even if they don't understand it themselves, is the thing I described.

       You're probably coming at this from a truther perspective - giving too much credit to PR SHILLS, paid off MSM agents AND the white house, to name a few. THEY are using the concept of fake news to erode your right to free speech. They will be using this concept to invade your right to privacy. (Oh you posted this comment two years ago that speaks ill of our true and righteous leader, so you must delete your account/unencrypted your phone/provide us all your user IDs on all social media sites etc.) They will use
       <em>
        fake news
       </em>
       as a tool to obtain their goals, i.e. status quo, to keep all the horrible truths as hidden as possible for as long as possible, so they can continue playing their sick games and profit from their corrupt transnational criminal enterprise.

       You realize you're asserting that there's a conspiracy to push the narrative of a fake conspiracy in all the usual conspiracy-minded corners of the Internet to distract these same conspiracy-obsessed people and/or to discredit conspiracy-obsessed people that most people ALREADY label as crazy?
      </p>
      <p>
       And you can't even figure out that I'm not ACTUALLY calling you a shill, I'm simultaneously mocking the typical response of anyone disagreeing being called a shill (case in point: you) while also mocking you for your "conspiracy within a conspiracy" theory that only serves to show you're so deep in these rabbit holes the bedrock is liquefying down there.

       I dare anyone to look at the Podesta emails and tell me there's nothing going on. Also take a look at what Breitbart said "How prog-guru John Podesta isn't household name as world class underage sex slave op cover-upperer defending unspeakable dregs escapes me."

       Have you not payed attention to the truther movement over the past decade? There have been government investigations, independent investigations, documentaries, books, every last aspect of the 9/11 has been argued about, and is still argued about. Years back, one fourth of ALL AMERICANS did not believe in the official story, that being that terrorist were behind it.
      </p>

       Pizzagate is just a weaksauce excuse for a conspiracy that's being fueled by Trumpsters because it involves the Clintons. Pizzagate is not taken seriously ANYWHERE outside of r/t_d or this sub, oh and 4chan but nothing is serious over there so it doesn't count.
      </p>
      <p>
       All over this sub and r/t_d I see posts claiming that "Fake news" is a giant problem yet stories like Pizzagate is being discussed like it's fact. "Fake news" is not what's keeping this "story" from gaining traction, it's the
       <strong>
        fact
       </strong>
       that it's so detached from reality that I'm surprised that human minds can still ponder it without creating some sort of solipsistic paradox resulting in their own existence ceasing to be.

       Pizza gate is global, if 911 happened in the USA and also on other countries at the same time, it would have gone viral.
Human trafficking organizations have been busted around the world this year alone, the south Korean president was just impeached because of her involvement on a human trafficking satanic cult, USA is next not first this time.

       Human trafficking is real and because a large ring was exposed in South Korea, it must therefore mean that there exists one in the US and at the center is Comet ping-pong and the Clintons. Is that the train of thought here?

       Yo, believe me I know the effect 911 had around the world, I am from Costa Rica and everybody collectively shat themselves here, can't Imagine how it could have been on ground 0, When I say viral I mean the skeptic side gaining powerful momentum, you condescending arse. 
If a "terrorist" attack were to be debunked right before 911 happened, just like is the case with pizzagate and korea, it would have gotten to the point we are today with this thing.
I shouldn't have to tell you, that the pizza is not the center, obviously a huge network, that is just one venue, that caters to a taste in particular, maybe just boys in one, and girls in the other, the other restaurant a few meters away had the girl symbol comet had the male on male one.

       It's a curious story because the Pizzagate conspiracy theory is incredibly weird. 9/11 is a serious subject that involves thousands of dead people, so it's less acceptable to write strange things about it, but a satanic pedophile ring run by the Clinton campaign in a pizzeria basement? It looks weird even for a daily mail article.

       I'm not going to go into a lot of details because I'm on mobile and there's giant articles and research papers and investigations about everything online.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main conspiracy theory with building 7 was it was demolished to destroy documents from various government agencies or companies that they wanted gone for a number of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with the theories that people snuck past all the firefighters and set controlled demolition charges and destroyed the building is that there would have been no point.
      </p>
      <p>
       A chunk of skyscraper the size of a football field destroyed an entire load bearing corner of the building and fire ran rampant through the place for like 9 hours before it fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it hadn't fell on its own there wouldn't have been a chance in hell anything made of paper survived and it would have been written off as a total loss by insurance and demolished anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up WTC building 7 damage. Half the building was fucking gone, it's amazing it didn't collapse immediately when it was hit.

       I've heard some other compelling theories regarding the reason to control demolition the building(s). Other than the false flag and the power grab, with building 7 there was a profit-motive for silverstein. From my research there's a money trail. Also, a simple juxtaposition of a controlled demolition with building 7 is in every sense of the word identical. Buildings that fall due to structural damage never come down at free-fall speeds, so symmetrically, cleanly,  or efficiently. The contrast is stark. There's definitely more to that day and that building than the original story, the original story has way more holes than the overall truther theories. The evidence and science behind the truther movement is much more credible and difficult to refute. I feel like the other things you considered idiotic also have some pretty sturdy science and investigative work done on them. I'm sure someone could give more insight than me, I'm pretty rusty. I just think writing those ideas off so harshly is unfair, I've seen some very compelling things.

       Well I understand how people can believe there's something strange about the collapse because it was strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it was assessed early in the day that the building would collapse. The firefighters in the building reported creaking and popping that caused the evacuation of the building and let the fire run rampant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it really more likely that the building was a giant conspiracy and was a controlled demolition or that it was just a strange collapse and people took advantage of it after the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the time Occam's Razor is correct and there's no decent explanation that the building
       <em>
        couldn't
       </em>
       have collapsed with the damage it took.

       There was this russian guy who gave a really good explanation on how it only could of been a nuclear charge. New York building code makes you sumbit the demolition plans before you build a giant sky scrapper. And nuclear charge was the only safe way to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also explains why the metal was hot and still burning. You can't explain that away. It's a dead show of nuclear explosions. Tower 7 housed the underground tunnels that would lead to put the nuclear charges in place 77m underground. Then had to blow up tower 7 to hide that fact.

       Who exactly was talking out their ass?  It's a matter of scientific fact that no building will come down at freefall speed without explosives being used to destroy the obstructing mass of the building below it, and the top one fifth of the building that "collapsed through the superstructure" could never obliterate an entire building of concrete and steel into dust with just a gravitational collapse.  It's flat out impossible and would violate the law of conservation of momentum, yet that's exactly what NIST and Popular Mechanics said happened, three times in one day and NEVER before or again since.  Tracing the money and the people that benefited from the attacks brings up the same exact people, typically Zionist Israeli dual citizens or people in both Bush and Reagan Administrations with direct ties to the Mossad, CIA, think tanks and defense contractors.  Really doesn't get any simpler than that.

       This is flat out incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's only true if you treat both sections of the structure as solid blocks. One solid block cannot fall through 4 other solid blocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're ignoring is that the intact structure being impacted was much more like a skeletal system than a solid block, made up of millions of interconnected pieces, each with their own failure points. The volume of the bottom portion of the structure was also mostly air, nearly 90% of it was just empty space. When you drop the top portion of the structure, that weight in motion overwhelms the structure below by failing the weakest portions of it first.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       want to know why towers 1 and 2 collapsed all the way to the ground, figure out which parts of the structure were the weakest, and what would happen if and when they failed.

       Dancing around the point that no building would come down at free-fall speed.  For what you claim to happen every single support structure would have had to have snapped simultaneously and remove all resistance.  The only way that can be done is with explosives like shaped charges or thermite, the oxidized residue of which can be found in the molecular structure of the metals recovered from the WTC.  Again we already know this is a fact and it has been conclusively proven.  The official story breaks the laws of physics in many different ways, not least of which is the assertion that commercial jet aircraft were flying at speeds of 500-600 miles an hour as they descended and hit the buildings, something that has been flat-out refuted by experienced aircraft pilots that are fully aware that a commercial airliner would have had its wings sheared off from the g-forces so close to the ground long before reaching those speeds.  The real problem is that every single angle of the official story falls apart under even the most basic levels of scrutiny, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The inordinary response times and protocol being ignored by the Air Force, FAA and NORAD; the testimony of FAA director Norman Mineta confirming that the order to "Stand down" was given by Dick Cheney;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bush's completely bizarre, unorthodox and inexplicable behavior following his briefing of the attack; his own admission that he saw the first plane hit on his limo ride towards the school (how would he have seen this already?) in what was an obvious Freudian slip;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The patently bogus story of Flight 96, the crash site at Shanksville and ensuing propagandizing of the story to sell it to the public;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The obvious missile attack on the Pentagon that was blamed on an aircraft, over 80 different camera point of views were instantly confiscated by the FBI before the fires were even out.  The missile hit the Pentagon's accounting offices, where the staff and evidence concerning the 2.3 trillion dollars of missing Federal money and the day before was housed;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The fact that stock put-options were placed on certain companies prior to 9/11 with foreknowledge of the attacks to profit from them;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The stonewalling and sabotage of any official or independent investigation into the attack by the government; the admission from the 9/11 Commission itself that it the final report was "a pack of lies"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Building 7's collapse is the smoking gun.  NIST didn't even acknowledge it in its report.
        </p>
       </li>

       Rubble from the top of the tower outpaced the collapse to the ground by more than a few seconds. The standing structure put up resistance to the falling section, but it couldn't hope to stop it, and moreover it wasn't designed to.

      <p>
       The editor in chief of the journal resigned in disgust when the Active Thermitic Materials paper was published and indicated that she never saw it before publication, which indicates that the peer review process was circumvented. None of the authors ever disputed her version of events, which speaks volumes about how shady it was.

      <p>
       No independent lab
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       saw the samples that the Active Thermitic Materials paper used in order to verify their findings. It's been over 8 years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The authors of the Active Thermitic Materials paper refused multiple requests to examine their samples from multiple investigators. One of the authors volunteered to submit the sample to an independent lab in September of 2012, collected $5000 in donor funds and has not provided a single update since.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the labs used in the paper as a citation (Lawrence Livermore Labs) has since come out and said the authors of the Active Thermitic Materials paper ran their critical DSC test completely incorrectly.

       Exactly.  And it didn't even occur to these people,  to ask a demolition expert,  let alone one whose entire career it was to do such things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus,  don't forget that steel-framed buildings fall down due to fire all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean,  that building had 40,000 tons of steel...barely!   You don't have to be an expert to see that there's a pretty significant probability that every single column could have failed at the same instant.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's a pretty big stretch to even label that collapse as suspicious,   especially given the perfectly natural collapse symmetry.

       There's NO WAY that's a smoking gun or anything.

       Actually demolitions experts have weighed in and they find the CD hypothesis positively laughable. One of their trade publications did an entire article on it a few years back. The Loizeau brothers have appeared in multiple documentaries over the years calling the CD explanation positively "Looney Tunes". A bunch of CD experts are quoted by name in the Popular Mechanics 9/11 book, exactly none of them find any merit in the CD explanation.

       I'm perfectly OK with deferring to the 3 collapse studies that have been done for Building 7. Sure it was a strange collapse, but it was also a strange design, had several elements that were a direct violation of NYC building codes, and had fireproofing in some areas that was so substandard it might as well have not even been there.

       If a building collapses and you want to know why, you seek out experts in the field and have them investigate. That's what was done,
       <em>
        3 separate times
       </em>
       . Each of the 3 investigations came to very similar conclusions, a few minor disagreements aside regarding whether the diesel tanks in the building played a roll in feeding the fires. If you want to know why the collapse had the appearance of "all the columns failing at the same moment", you might want to try
       <strong>
        reading the investigations that have already been done
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>

       They didn't all fail at the same time. They failed over 18 seconds. That's how long the seismic signal was when building 7 came down. The visible sinking of the East Penthouse into the structure happened 6 full seconds before the building dropped. The 18 second seismic signal and the sinking of the East Penthouse are both clear visual indicators that columns were rapidly failing inside the building well before the shell came down.
      </p>

       This is all well documented within the investigations I've linked. You really should read them.

       Unsurprisingly your reply doesn't address the seismic evidence, nor does it address the visible East Penthouse collapse. Both of those factors prove that the columns did not all fail at the same time. They failed progressively throughout the structure until there was not enough redundancy left to support the outer shell, which fell last.

       You've made up your mind that the visible collapse was

      <p>
       The collapse wasn't symmetrical. That's a fallacy.

       It looked symmetrical from
       <em>
        one angle
       </em>
       . From another angle the building was leaning pretty severely as it fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The debris pile was anything but symmetrical. The entirety of the north face was laid overtop of the rubble pile, an indication that building 7 was toppling over as it fell.

       It looked symmetrical from
       <em>
        one angle

       for the 15 or so stories that are visible in the clip.

       "September 11 - The New Pearl Harbor" is a 5 hour documentary that summarizes 12 years of public debate on 9/11. While aimed primarily at a general, uninformed audience, the film also contains some new findings that may be of interest to advanced researchers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is probably the best and most informative documentary on 9/11 so far and goes into great detail and analysis of both sides of the arguments. It is neatly indexed.

       You don't know what they have. They are not omnipotent gods. They release what they've been given. During Bush's administration they handed out a ton of dirt on the republicans, and Obama came in promising hope and change, but delivered more of the same, solidifying the idea that they are ALL dirty.

       Because naturally, for every thing wrong the DNC does their opposition has to have done something equally as bad or worst and Wikileaks somehow is responsible for finding that... yea makes a lot of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC scumbags directly went after the credibility of Wikileaks with lies over more lies, was Wikileaks supposed to bend over and take it?

       Lol. if you don't know yet that there is a basement at CPP then we cant even have a conversation bc you arent on my level. he said in one interview that he had thousands of tons of tomato sauce or w.e. in a basement than he was saying that they dont have a basement. you pick one, it can't be that you both have and don't have a basement. get it?

       You could have 1000 facts about Trump, pussy grabbing etc etc and none of it holds a candle to Hillary doing worse shit in the context of holding public office while doing said shit.

       Rubble from the top of the tower outpaced the collapse to the ground by more than a few seconds. The standing structure put up resistance to the falling section, but it couldn't hope to stop it, and moreover it wasn't designed to.

        The only way that can be done is with explosives like shaped charges or thermite, the oxidized residue of which can be found in the molecular structure of the metals recovered from the WTC. Again we already know this is a fact and it has been conclusively proven.
       </p>

      <p>
       Complete nonsense. No evidence of explosives has ever been found, and the thermite stuff has been proven nonsense.

       I'll ignore the rest of your attempted Gish Gallop and stick to the collapses.
