       Yes, of course. They staged all the Yelp reviews and pics. All the restaurant awards. Guy Fieri is a satanist who helped give them credence.

       I saw that video already. You are mistaken. If you look carefully, 2 parents are walking a child in front of the restaurant. The kid is pulling his father because he/she wanted to play ping pong. They just kept walking pulling the crying kid along.

       Pretty sure this is the same person that claimed the government is killing us all with Lyme disease silently. First red flag, if you wanna use biological warfare, don't choose a disease that literally puts a fuckin bullseye on your victims. Oh and make sure antibiotics don't take care of it

       Don't get me started on Lyme disease. as a lifetime sufferer of it I know WAY more about it than you ever will, trust me. The whole point is that some people DO get better with abx, but a large percantage of people (like me) do not and it becomes chronic with symptoms similar to MS, but worse because it does not go into remission. Its not exactly about biological warfare, do not put words into my mouth, its about the government refusing to acknowledge the existence of chronic Lyme and supressing the development of a cure and restricting use of homeopathic &amp; natural remedies that do help with the symptoms. if you go on the CDC or IDSA website they will tell you that there is no such thing and that chronic Lyme sufferers are just crazy. But there are millions of us and we are standing up for our rights. You know nothing about Lyme disease so don't pretend. Do NOT get me started on Lyme Disease.

       Didn't you yourself state you are not being treated with antibiotics but instead are taking herbals and experiencing extreme symptoms with no improvement? I've also struggled with more than 6 years of Lyme/coinfections and before beginning the last year of antibiotic treatment I was bedridden. Now, I am 85% better. I'm telling you this because based on your post history I'm very concerned about you. Please think about finding a new doctor who will treat you with the antibiotics you so desperately need. I really hope you begin to feel better soon.

       Thats not true at all. Just watch the video, the screaming starts before the kid and his parents come into the picture. it is clearly coming from in the restaurant. I can understand why you mistakenly think that but i have watched the video literally dozens of times and at different speeds so i know what i am talking about.

       I know what you are taking about. Yes, the first noise you hear when the parents and kids are out of the frame but that doesn't mean you wouldn't hear that brat. They are outside just like the camera. The kid's screams, which sounds like wait, are when the kid starts reaching out towards the ping pong table.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite reach to think you would hear that clarity from across the street and having the person be inside the building. Occam's razor.

       Maybe the only solution to this in your mind is for it to be a pedophile satanist conspiracy..
      </p>
      <p>
       What amount of evidence would it take for you to dismiss it as crazy bullshit propagated by conspiracy theorists?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in a scary, frustrating period of time, and people want a simple reason as to why things are the way they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of a series of difficult and compounding scenarios leading us to this point of inequality and desperation, it would be simpler if there was a satanist conspiracy that we could bring down and then everyone would be happy again
      </p>
      <p>
       When in reality, our problem is that our uneducated voters don't vote in local or state elections or in the primaries, and we have to choose between two bad candidates that we don't want, and we want answers afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is that we are coddled, rich, pedantic, lazy, undisciplined, and uneducated. You want the easy answer and you want nothing else. Well in the end time will tell that people like you were our downfall
      </p>
      <p>
       Tldr; maybe elitist satanist pedophiles conspire to run the country, or dumb lazy fuckers are too dumb to construct a policy based argument im not sure

       Idk dude I can't reconcile those two. It's a very normal pizza place. Used to walk by it basically weekly as well when I was headed over to politics and prose and I have friends who went their regularly as well. Nothing out of the ordinary ever. Its near a very active area of Northwest DC. It would be impressive if there were anything odd going on there.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I've heard a lot of claims but haven't seen any direct evidence that any of it is verifiable. To the contrary, it seems the opposite that all evidence weighs against it being true.

       Definitely been there. Lived like 4 blocks away for 2 years. The fact that you think there is CERTAINLY something sketch there means youre seeking for confirmation bias. There is nothing weird about the place. At all.

       And I'm saying that because I've looked at the evidence and seen only circumstantial stuff combined with what I've personally seen, I have far more direct proof of it not being true than it actually being true

       you cannot have it both ways. you pizzagate deniers always say 'omg you cant prove somethings not true!!' but here you are saying you have 'direct proof of it not being true'. pick one! That doesn't make sense   ,

       I don't like being called a pizzagate denier. If I were presented with direct evidence, verified of its veracity I would support it wholeheartedly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I said I have direct evidence. Evidence =/= Proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       My statement is that I have direct evidence that nothing unusual appears to be going on there. That evidence CAN be refuted. I CANNOT prove that pizzagate is untrue with perfect certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a showing of direct evidence has to be made to break even the lower bar of preponderance of the evidence. This has not happened. Only circumstantial evidence has been presented.

       This is amazing. Even if someone that really actually WENT there talks to you you still think you know better because you saw some carefully edited video's and paintshops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of weighing evidence and thinking critically you just reject the whole notion that your obsession might be just that, and you have the gal to insinuate they have not even been there? It's just a regular pizza place, without a basement or secret bathrooms. Magic and Santa aren't real, and neither are Satanic rings of Pedo Pizza places. Get a life girl.

       OP never heard of google or yelp.  Over ....10+ years of reviews and hundreds of reviews &amp; pictures.  A community based website written by visitors everywhere.  Asks if this an actual real restaurant? Incredibly stupid question, makes me wanna face palm 3 times.  Learn how to research properly.  We can all tell you're not the brightest crayon in the box.  Fronts still serve a purpose and does it's main thing.

       Just because there are "Over.....10+" years of reviews doesnt mean that CPP didnt buy those reviews. I am open to the idea that it is a real restaurant but so many of the reviews are just so over the top and obviously purchased by Alifante that it i am not buying it. And please do not address me in the third person hun.

       So ten years of Yelp reviews do nothing for you. But you are requesting  verification by some stranger here, one person, to post 'yeah went there it's totally real'. And then you're satisfied. How does that make any sense?

       A highly skilled investigator has already been sent. He was able to locate what appeared to be the same restaurant from available pictures. He did confirm the location but there was no activity at the time of the scan. Pressed for time, he discharged his pistol after which he was able to debrief the responding police. I believe he was deputized and may be on loan for a while.

       The purpose of a front is to appear like a legitimate business while doing the real, illegitimate business in the background. A flower shop that also sells pot, for example. You can use it's business status to launder money as well. It would make sense for a purported pedophile business to be a pizza parlor "in front".

      <p>
       Secondly, why would a pedophile business NOT have pizza? That would be going too far.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly but most importantly, why are you so certain that pedophilia is at play?
