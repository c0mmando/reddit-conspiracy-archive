<p>because you&#39;ve done no fucking research.    </p>

<p>because you&#39;re making the extremely disingenuous suggestion that cpp is a front based on... fuckall.   </p>

<p>because according to this thread your sole evidence is that you personally think that people in videos eating pizza at cpp are all actors</p>

<p>because you are just making shit up now because its easier than actually doing any real investigation yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me started on Lyme disease. as a lifetime sufferer of it I know WAY more about it than you ever will, trust me. The whole point is that some people DO get better with abx, but a large percantage of people (like me) do not and it becomes chronic with symptoms similar to MS, but worse because it does not go into remission. Its not exactly about biological warfare, do not put words into my mouth, its about the government refusing to acknowledge the existence of chronic Lyme and supressing the development of a cure and restricting use of homeopathic &amp; natural remedies that do help with the symptoms. if you go on the CDC or IDSA website they will tell you that there is no such thing and that chronic Lyme sufferers are just crazy. But there are millions of us and we are standing up for our rights. You know nothing about Lyme disease so don&#39;t pretend. Do NOT get me started on Lyme Disease. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the only solution to this in your mind is for it to be a pedophile satanist conspiracy..</p>

<p>What amount of evidence would it take for you to dismiss it as crazy bullshit propagated by conspiracy theorists? </p>

<p>We are in a scary, frustrating period of time, and people want a simple reason as to why things are the way they are. </p>

<p>Instead of a series of difficult and compounding scenarios leading us to this point of inequality and desperation, it would be simpler if there was a satanist conspiracy that we could bring down and then everyone would be happy again </p>

<p>When in reality, our problem is that our uneducated voters don&#39;t vote in local or state elections or in the primaries, and we have to choose between two bad candidates that we don&#39;t want, and we want answers afterwards. </p>

<p>The answer is that we are coddled, rich, pedantic, lazy, undisciplined, and uneducated. You want the easy answer and you want nothing else. Well in the end time will tell that people like you were our downfall </p>

<p>Tldr; maybe elitist satanist pedophiles conspire to run the country, or dumb lazy fuckers are too dumb to construct a policy based argument im not sure </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk dude I can&#39;t reconcile those two. It&#39;s a very normal pizza place. Used to walk by it basically weekly as well when I was headed over to politics and prose and I have friends who went their regularly as well. Nothing out of the ordinary ever. Its near a very active area of Northwest DC. It would be impressive if there were anything odd going on there.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;ve heard a lot of claims but haven&#39;t seen any direct evidence that any of it is verifiable. To the contrary, it seems the opposite that all evidence weighs against it being true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like being called a pizzagate denier. If I were presented with direct evidence, verified of its veracity I would support it wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>Also I said I have direct evidence. Evidence =/= Proof.</p>

<p>My statement is that I have direct evidence that nothing unusual appears to be going on there. That evidence CAN be refuted. I CANNOT prove that pizzagate is untrue with perfect certainty.</p>

<p>However, a showing of direct evidence has to be made to break even the lower bar of preponderance of the evidence. This has not happened. Only circumstantial evidence has been presented.</p>

<p>Instead of weighing evidence and thinking critically you just reject the whole notion that your obsession might be just that, and you have the gal to insinuate they have not even been there? It&#39;s just a regular pizza place, without a basement or secret bathrooms. Magic and Santa aren&#39;t real, and neither are Satanic rings of Pedo Pizza places. Get a life girl.</p>
