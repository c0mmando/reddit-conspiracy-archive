But when you attempt to make a mockery of people investigating abuse of those who are defenseless, whether you actually believe it to be true or not yourself, you are no better than those committing the abuse.</p>

<p>By being aggressive against Pizzagate and discouraging investigation you are proving nothing. But you are helping to conceal every other instance of child abuse that happens around the globe.</p>

<p>Do you think that being arrogant towards Pizzagate researchers is going to have a positive effect on pedophilia investigation in general?</p>

<p>There&#39;s really not any more to it. It doesn&#39;t matter how stupid you think Pizzagate is. What matters is the effect that your tactics have on the world.</p>

<p>And no, <strong>this doesn&#39;t include the people displaying reasonable skepticism</strong>. Skepticism is necessary and beneficial to the cause. This is only about the people taking it upon themselves to personally attack investigators and ridicule the investigation instead of offering rational civilized opposition.</p>

<p>maybe these investigations and not letting up on the subject may save others from entrapment and abuse. Maybe we save one person or thousands. Maybe a parent finally gets an answer to what happened to their child. Hopefully this is he beginning to an end of this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the first time? There are many organizations dedicated to solving the human trafficking problem, organizations which don&#39;t insinuate the most heinous crimes on a person because of the artwork that they buy.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is operating on mob mentality.  Please be careful because you could be contributing to it without really understanding it. I understand that everyone who believes pizzagate isn&#39;t responsible for that guy going to the pizzeria with a weapon.  But that person was online reading what everyone was writing and basing his actions off of that.</p>

<p>If the crime is as heavy and extreme as is being accused make sure you have the proportional amount of evidence to even insinuate it.  If you see a suspicious email call it that and LEAVE IT at that.</p>

<p>The people who are involved in making the pizzagate accusations <em>deserve</em> to be mocked and criticized because of the way they are going about this with no maturity, critical thinking, or respect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, in fact, the topic and research on pedophilia (and interest) has never been so low in the last decade.</p>

<p>If any pizzagater would even care looking to truly help victims, they&#39;d try to learn first where victims are and how to identify them. Most sexually abused children were abused by family members or someone close. </p>

<p>Only a very very small percentage was &quot;kidnapped&quot; and never found, and that&#39;s where pizzagaters are focusing. So with all the trouble the pizzeria owners get lately, I&#39;m hoping the few potential victims that need help will be found (we don&#39;t know who they are yet apparently...). I&#39;m not hoping for victims but I do hope this isn&#39;t a dumb witch hunt.</p>

<p>And of course, I wish the focus was also put on the huge majority of abused children as well. Right now they&#39;re totally ignored and anyone mentioning it is aggressively opposed... for obvious reasons. Sad.</p>

<hr/>

<p>edit: </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna add this already because I know what&#39;s coming: No I&#39;m not saying to stop investigating. I&#39;m saying to not lose focus and to in fact explore ALL the areas where there&#39;s a lot of victims of child abuse, not only the minority happening in &quot;occult network.&quot;</p>

I honestly think it has at least a kernel of truth, but I also think all the &quot;investigators&quot; have been their own worst enemy most of the time by posting things way outta left field as leads and making themselves look batshit by posting this black and white viewpoint kinda stuff</p>

<p>Edit: seriously it reminds me of arguing with my grandma where I&#39;m willing to concede there may be a god, but she wants me to say America is gods chosen country and white people are the best, otherwise my concession that there may be a god means nothing. If that makes sense</p>

Honestly I think there&#39;s a lot more truth to it simply because of the whole &quot;fake news&quot; thing. Their reaction means a lot. So I really don&#39;t want it to be some crazy barbarian charge to their front while they outflank us lol. Also, to be honest, it seems like there is a civil intelligence war going on that is probably informing most of what is going on right now that would make it impossible for pg to be used as a weapon because it would take out both sides Cold War style.

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, and it works both ways. People shouldn&#39;t be shutting down skepticism about Pizzagate either.</p>

<p>Still, shutting down skepticism of it and shutting down research into it have 2 very different consequences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for investigating rape and human trafficking.  But sometimes there are bullshit stories, like the Rolling Stone expose and IMO PG as well.  Some people fight against people running around screaming about horrible evidence because it discredits not just this investigation, but also any future attempts like this that might be more well-founded.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like some of the posts here now.  A guy posts that he sees a pattern of human trafficking near port cities.  That&#39;s an interesting fact.  But he can&#39;t help but throw in the PizzaGate tag and so it all becomes related to some pretty wild claims that are hard to believe.  Instead it would be far better to just be investigating the networks in general.  Then something good could come out of all of the attention that PG has given to human trafficking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re saying when you say that a person questioning is &quot;no better than the abusers themselves.&quot;  Using the logic of that quote, if abusers do harm, and we know they do- that infers that questioning is doing harm.  But that is inaccurate, in fact, it&#39;s absurd.  </p>

<p>People who are asking questions about the truth on an online forum are nothing like actual pedophiles who violate children- and if they do any damage at all, it&#39;s a fraction of that of an abuser.  But they&#39;re not &quot;no better.&quot;  </p>

<p>Skepticism is good.  If you hadn&#39;t at one point in your life started to become skeptical of your government, you wouldn&#39;t have considered believing in PG.  But that skepticism led you to this point.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s a bad idea to be strident about these things.  Why would anyone want to go from being so closed minded to an idea that they&#39;re a million percent closed-minded to its opposite?</p>

<p>Questioning is good- it challenges us to get better evidence of what we believe.</p>

<p>Do you think it isn&#39;t mocking or aggressive to equate asking questions with pedophilia?  </p>

<p>But you are correct: the rest of your post is fair and reasonable, it&#39;s just that that one hyperbolic sentence makes it less legitimate and closes off debate.</p>

<p>Due to my experiences talking to PG believers, I thought your title was addressing the <em>believers</em> and not the questioners/deniers.  I&#39;m dead serious...The ones I have spoken to have been every bit as aggressive as CTR was.  Here&#39;s one example.</p>

<p>My point is it&#39;s aggressive and mocking to equate the two, which means you&#39;re doing what you&#39;re saying they are.  This degrades the legitimacy of the rest of your points.   </p>

<p>I feel like I addressed the fact that the rest of your post was fair.</p>

<p>While I commend you for being so even-handed, the fact that you have a response to everyone who has commented (mostly refuting what you already disagree with) suggests that you may not be as open to fair discussions as you might believe.  It&#39;s human nature.  </p>

<p>I hope you continue to be a role model for other PG believers, they could learn something from you about communication and more importantly, persuasion, because you&#39;re right, it&#39;s a bad look for either side to be rude or disrespectful.

    <div class="md"><p>Joe McCarthy is that you?</p>

<p>This is typical witch hunt logic. Just because the accusation you&#39;re making is very serious doesn&#39;t give you license to say or do whatever you want and it especially doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t be criticized. Calling people who criticize you pedophile enablers is the lowest of the low.</p>

<p>The accusation is extremely serious and if you actually had respect for the weight of the accusation you wouldn&#39;t throw it around as if it were nothing. All it takes for you all to implicate someone as a pedophile is for you to have a funny feeling about them. Don&#39;t understand their taste in art? Pedophile. Conversation sounds off? Pedophile. It&#39;s disgusting to watch and what will happen when nothing comes of this? You will just get bored one day and move on to the next thing and people will be scarred with the pedophile accusation after a brief period when a mob decided to give themselves license to tear apart and scrutinize everything they&#39;ve ever done or said.</p>

<p>Do you think that being arrogant towards Pizzagate researchers is going to have a positive effect on pedophilia investigation in general?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>It enforces the idea that these things require proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s because the 800k a year is a statistic that also includes 200k kidnapped by their own parents, and a majority of teenagers who are runaways.</p>

<p><strong>Then they&#39;d end with about 5% of 100-1000 children who were really kidnapped by strangers and were never found.</strong></p>

<p>So you see, why they push the 800k and not the 5% of 100-1000! Doesn&#39;t make a good story.</p>

<p>Truth is: most kids are abused by their own family and people close to them. Or even pimped by them. That&#39;s an ugly side the majority does not want to be involved into since it&#39;s too close to home.</p>

<hr/>

<p>edit: Oh you know why there&#39;s no victims or body. &quot;They were eaten or dissolved in acid.&quot; Here you go! Now they need to find those buckets in some storage room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>Do you think it isn&#39;t mocking or aggressive to equate asking questions with pedophilia?  </p>

<p>But you are correct: the rest of your post is fair and reasonable, it&#39;s just that that one hyperbolic sentence makes it less legitimate and closes off debate.</p>

<p>Due to my experiences talking to PG believers, I thought your title was addressing the <em>believers</em> and not the questioners/deniers.  I&#39;m dead serious...The ones I have spoken to have been every bit as aggressive as CTR was.  Here&#39;s one example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s important to actually investigate things though. Not throw around wild accusations like this so called pizzagate &quot;investigation&quot;. Hard evidence is required. It takes A LOT of work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the first time? There are many organizations dedicated to solving the human trafficking problem, organizations which don&#39;t insinuate the most heinous crimes on a person because of the artwork that they buy.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is operating on mob mentality.  Please be careful because you could be contributing to it without really understanding it. I understand that everyone who believes pizzagate isn&#39;t responsible for that guy going to the pizzeria with a weapon.  But that person was online reading what everyone was writing and basing his actions off of that.</p>

<p>If the crime is as heavy and extreme as is being accused make sure you have the proportional amount of evidence to even insinuate it.  If you see a suspicious email call it that and LEAVE IT at that.</p>

<p>The people who are involved in making the pizzagate accusations <em>deserve</em> to be mocked and criticized because of the way they are going about this with no maturity, critical thinking, or respect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, in fact, the topic and research on pedophilia (and interest) has never been so low in the last decade.</p>

<p>If any pizzagater would even care looking to truly help victims, they&#39;d try to learn first where victims are and how to identify them. Most sexually abused children were abused by family members or someone close. </p>

<p>Only a very very small percentage was &quot;kidnapped&quot; and never found, and that&#39;s where pizzagaters are focusing. So with all the trouble the pizzeria owners get lately, I&#39;m hoping the few potential victims that need help will be found (we don&#39;t know who they are yet apparently...). I&#39;m not hoping for victims but I do hope this isn&#39;t a dumb witch hunt.</p>

<p>And of course, I wish the focus was also put on the huge majority of abused children as well. Right now they&#39;re totally ignored and anyone mentioning it is aggressively opposed... for obvious reasons. Sad.</p>

<hr/>

<p>edit: </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna add this already because I know what&#39;s coming: No I&#39;m not saying to stop investigating. I&#39;m saying to not lose focus and to in fact explore ALL the areas where there&#39;s a lot of victims of child abuse, not only the minority happening in &quot;occult network.&quot;</p>
