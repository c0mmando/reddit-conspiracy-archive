       Even the most adamant Trump hater should be disturbed by this. Reddit is censoring their most active subreddit... Which happens to be one of the only places where discussion of America's next president is allowed.

       What timeline are we in? What kind of person thinks this is acceptable?

       If it weren't for The_Donald we would not have PizzaGate. Human trafficking would have nowhere near the level of attention as it's getting now. Nobody can convince me that T_D has nothing positive to offer, despite not being the biggest Trump fan in the world T_D has a well earned place here on Reddit.

       It did, I was in some of the early threads. It grew out of /cfg/, the Clinton Foundation General.

      <p>
       Interestingly, there was a hearty mix of voters there, on /pol/ of all places. A few Bernie supporters, obviously a lot of Trump supporters, the occasional Stein or Johnson voter. All people who were worried about the power of the Clintons and their associates.

       The digging into Podesta's emails started on both when wikileaks released them and the pizzagate sub started not long after people started finding odd coincidences in the emails, I think OP's point is that the contribution into the investigation was vital to spreading the word considering the large subscriber base and they're not wrong. I've been following it since day 1 and I've seen more and more people becoming open to the claims every single day thanks to those who continue to dig. Unfortunately there is a large group of naysayers who follow MSM blindly and rather than do any individual research they'll just listen and regurgitate all the "fake news" propaganda.

       You clearly haven't been paying attention if you think that's the most interest human trafficking has ever gotten. It's a low traffic off-brand website that coincidentally hosts both anti and pro pedophile communities. Only problem there is that you're vastly outnumbered by actual, active pedophiles.

       Reddit doesn't allow sexualised images of minors, and pedofriends is a support group. As distasteful as you find that they aren't posting  pictures of kids.

       Voat allows pedos to post pictures of children and allows the sexual discussion of those children.

       If you hate reddit censorship why don't you head back to voat and support their free speech rights and you can enjoy as many images of sexualised children as you like.

      <p>
       And here you are crying about fucking hotdogs and Tony Podestas taste in art. It's a joke mate. Justify it how you like but you are supporting pedos by using voat.

       The generalization and stereotyping of people on Reddit has become ridiculous as of late, I went to voat to follow the pizzagate investigation since the sub was banned here. I'm not racist, I'm not a troll and implying that all people that go to voat are is shitty. It's almost as shitty as people implying all Trump supporters are racist, xenophobic bigots (they're not). Who am I kidding though not a lot of people listen to reason so I'm probably wasting my words.

       I'm absolutely still following pizzagate because any chance at uncovering trafficking or pedophilia is something I'm very curious about as I have a 3 year old son, what people are failing to realize is it's not some bogus proposition that a pizza restaurant owner is peddling kids from his basement. If you take a few minutes to look over the relationships between some of these high profile politicians things get a bit fuzzy, especially when there have been cases already uncovered. I'm really confused how people have their heads buried so deep in the sand, it really isn't complicated, there are sick fucks in this world and unfortunately some of them have a lot of connections and the only way to bring them to justice is by personally investigating since MSM doesn't give a fuck.

       Asking if I'm a kid with an immature response, that's funny. Perhaps one day you'll put on your big boy pants and realize the world is not always a great place and there are some sick people in it, until then keep deleting your shitty comments because it saves people from having to read that drivel.

       I'm not saying it to make fun of you. I'm sincerely frightened by how many people readily believe blatant lies, backed with no real evidence. It's not harmless either, one of you lunatics almost shot up a pizza place the other week because he believed this fucking bullshit.There is no pizza pedophile ring. I can't believe we've gotten to this point where people believe a pizza pedophile ring run by the Clintons was uncovered by 4chan. Jesus fucking christ. Please understand that I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt when I assume you're a child. You're going to look back at this part of your life with shame.

       I'm sincerely frightened by the fact you cannot grasp that there are an eerie amount of high profile pedophiles, check out the open secret it might just open your eyes enough to do some of your own research. Whoever went to that pizza place with a gun is a fucking moron, I don't think any right minded person would advocate behavior like that. However, digging around for evidence on the net isn't damaging anybody, sure there are people who are fucking morons that are going to do stupid ass shit but I'm not one of them. I'm a person who is watching people uncover some very interesting relationships between actual pedophiles and high profile politicians, does this mean it's true? No, but it is worth digging since these people are not held to the same standards of justice as your average American. Look at Hastert, these people have connections, look at Anthony Wiener. I have no shame, I can say however if something damning is uncovered and someone is implicated in crimes due to the citizens investigating these allegations that you will certainly look back at this exact moment with shame.

       Of course that guy was nuts, but dont you get it? Your conspiracy nonsense fuels lunatics like that guy, and you still defend it! If an actual pedophile gets uncovered through this I will eat my fucking boot. Until then, you are taking part in the harassment of innocent people!

       Eh. I don't know if I agree with that. I'm no Trump supporter I'm fact I think he's probably the least qualified president in the history of our country, however there's no proof or reason to believe that pizzagate was invented to distract the public.

       You realize these are the same criterias that are used to prop up pizzagate correct? You can't just short hand your way to a conspiracy for each side that just happen to match your political belief structure without proof.

       Well obviously it's best to not look into the claims of child rape, abuse, and murder even though there are victims who have spoken out. Obviously it should just be ignored that way we know for sure it's not actually happening. I mean there's like so few indicators of sketchy shit going on and the guy that runs it is just so nice and not creepy as fuck at all. Plus it's not like somehow the owner of a small pizza place was able to network with all major news/media outlets and somehow get them to immediately call it fake or a hoax. It's super normal for some unknown person to be incredibly well connected to many powerful people or entities.... Yeah ignoring it the best idea.

       No it's not. The sidebar explicitly says that the sub is solely for the pro-Trump purposes. The whole point of the sub is to promote Trump. The politics sub, on the other hand, is supposed to be neutral, but we all know that it's a leftist, severely anti-Trump circlejerk.

       Discussion about Trump generally would seem like fair game for r/t_d. If the sub is overrun by anti-trump posts then yes, it has failed in its mission and needs more aggressive moderation. There is a big difference between this and disallowing all dissenting opinions which is exactly what happens. It's more like r/MMA disallowing all posts or comments critical of a certain controversial MMA figther.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain members of the sub have also behaved quite badly, in large numbers, it's not like the "censorship" by reddit has happened in a vacuum.

       I think t_d is a community that has decided to focus on a topic (cheerleading Trump) - which is not really 'censoring' - especially when they point those who wish to criticise Trump to another place where this can be done,
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit management has recently decided that what reddit members post on t_d posts should not be allowed on r/all - that is a kind of censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit has recently banned the subreddit devoted to pizzagate - that is pure censorship

       The mods were deliberately gaming the system of stickied posts to continually get to the front of r/all. The community was botting quite heavily. Handling these kinds of issues has been SOP for moderated forums since their inception. Spez made himself and the admins look bad by editing posts, that was about the only thing I found controversial about the whole ordeal.

       They used the system that was in place, and people upvoted the stickies. Do you have any idea how many posts made it to all without being stickied?

       They are a self declared chearing section for trump. It even says when you hover the cursor over the submit button when you're about to comment, that any posts supporting another candidate or against Trump will be removed/banned, and that the sub was created for the purpose of chearleading, not discussion or questions.  It then links to a sub meant for asking Trump supporters questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the exact same practice that got me and many others banned from /hillaryclinton, and it's very clear on the policy and reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for whether reddit has to "allow everything," of course not, but for a site that hosts subreddits for pedophilia and cannibalism, this openly biased treatment of one political affiliation over the other is seriously not a good look, and very inconsistent with their values, both explicitly stated and implied.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone ignoring those facts in citing that defense of their actions toward t_D is being daft.

       The admin responsible for that made a vague allegation of doxxing and harassment, and then he was immediately asked whether those behaviors were tied to the subreddit or were only done by a small few individual users.  He completely ignored the question, but the answer is known among t_D subscribers, which is that it was only one or a small few isolated individuals, and they are guilty of behavior that has been carried out, on record, by users from other subreddits with no administrative action taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the question of brigading, which imo is a petty allegation--but my opinion doesn't matter--however, the supposed remedy was only applied to t_D while the brigading was rampant from the other direction.  EnoughTrumpSpam, a sub dedicated to brigading successful  t_D posts to keep them off the front page, was not the target of any administrative action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I enjoyed reading the Donald because everywhere else on reddit was viciously anti-Trump and it was boring only hearing one perspective on every single event or issue when in reality there are several.  I have had some fun there posting and having a laugh about the landslide victory and the left's extreme reaction to it.  But I'm not super invested in it, and it's even become boring too.  I just want to see objectivity, equal enforcement of the rules, no changing the rules for one sub with blatant political motives which are just inappropriate and lack integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, it's not illegal and we aren't guaranteed free speech on reddit, but seriously.  Look at what happened, look at what was done, from as objective a standpoint as you possibly can, and really ask yourself, is it right?

       . If it were just a Trump support sub and it was like most any other sub where you the good stuff got upvoted and the crap stayed where it was supposed to and people could come in from /all and say something without getting banned, then it'd be fine. But as it is/was it's just spam and it's spam that can't be interacted with. It's one thing to be pro-Trump, it's another thing to just upvote every dank meme in the universe ban any form of dissent.

       It's not off the site, and they get to keep their rally going as long as they like, but that doesn't mean everyone should be forced to watch.

       And honestly, I'd say the same thing about ANY sub that were to do the same thing, regardless of subject.

       As for banning dissent, again, t_D was created for Trump support.  The rules are clear and visible, and it bans users who break the rules--just like any other sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are subs for other candidates that are the exact same way, and do the exact same things, and they're not removed from /all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The correct response would have been to simply make /all filterable.  Which is exactly what was done
       <strong>
        in conjunction with the erasure of t_D.
       </strong>
       Filtering /all is a great idea, but I don't understand what constitutes an automatic, nonreversible filtering of ONE subreddit and no others, even though there are subs which are directly analogous to the one that was singled out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not just let users filter out what they don't want to see?  Very simple, very easy solution that doesn't unfairly suppress any one subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The_Donald was singled out because it was more popular than expected, and made Reddit appear to have more Trump supporters than the admins preferred.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was done to prevent any content showing Donald Trump in a positive light from becoming visible to non-subscribers of t_D.  It's biased censorship and there's really no justification.  And strangely, you're doing a better job at trying to justify it than the admins who actually did it.

       But that's not true. If you went into the Hillary or Bernie subs and disagreed (respectfully) you might be downvoted but they wouldn't ban you just for having a different opinion. And I think if something is going to be /all it should be allowed to be commented on, like everything else.
      </p>

       And there are other subs that don't appear on /all. I don't have a list available right now, but there are definitely others.

       Yeah, I mean I really just disagree with that. I think if it was just a regular Trump support sub it wouldn't be banned right now. Plenty of other non-liberal subs aren't banned because they don't do the same shit as T_D.

       Personally, I think the ability to filter was enough, but I don't blame them for blocking it all together. You can still go there for your 24 hour rally anytime you like.

       The purpose of a subreddit as a page for specific information or subjects differs greatly from Reddit as an all-encompassing platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not censorship to moderate a subreddit and say "this content does not belong here because it is not the purpose or focus of the sub and falls outside our rules."
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Reddit picking and choosing what it allows on its platform, of course they reserve that right and it's debatable whether or not that could be considered censorship. The problem lies in the unequal treatment of the subreddit. There's subs for beastiality and beating women that go unchecked while the sub for the next president of the US is singled out and nerfed left and right. This IS worthy of discussion, however I don't think supporters of t_d do themselves any favors by calling it "censorship."

       How much Hillary bashing does her sub allow? It's one thing to censor a specific subreddit according the intended content of it (because that's the point of being able to make specific subreddits) and quite another thing to ban an entire large, active sub from the front page of the whole site. I most assuredly would not support the banning of a subreddit whether they banned me for not liking my content or not.

       Locking posts, banning people, deleting replies... all of that is technically censorship but that can be expected on any sub you go to and post in direct opposition to what it states its about. Reddit as a whole shouldn't really have personal opinions, biases or partisanship that dictate what users can or can't see.

       Can confirm. I made a pretty inoffensive comment about Trump saying that he was acting a little whiny on Twitter and got the ban hammer instantly. It's not free speech, it's all just a bunch of partisan cock jerking.

       r/conspiracy has 141 posts over 5k upvotes (according to new calculations) in the last year, or roughly one post near the top every 2.5 days.

      <p>
       There are more subscribers, but nowhere nearly as active. Over most of the year, the number online has been under 1000.

       The_Donald has ten times the number online, and going back to the top 999th post of the year, it's still at 11.2k upvotes. That's 2.5 posts per day with over 11.2k upvotes.

       I think a powerful facet to this discussion that often gets overlooked is the 'private' capacity of Reddit. It's a company, which possess it's own social views; not a State-regulated entity that is under any legal obligation to treat all content equally under threat of legal consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as it puts me off towards Reddit as a whole, I am quite happy that companies still have the right to do this. I view it as important—the whole 'Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness,' and regard a company's decision to demote content they view out of line with their political beliefs as an act of Liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said; I think that Reddit should
       <em>
        fear
       </em>
       the demotion of such relevant content for it's certain spark of many influential entities calling out their agenda publicly. The trouble is; most people that have an issue with Reddit try to call them out on Reddit.Surely, you can see the issue there.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a bit of a tangent, although I feel it's intimately-related, I feel there is not only a sharp demand—but also perfect timing—for a news-type entity to accommodate the Trump support base, as well as many others dis-satisfied with the current State of the Union. I don't want to derail this conversation; for those interested in discussing such a concept, I've started a thread here:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5h8wx3/planning_for_the_inevitable/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5h8wx3/planning_for_the_inevitable/
       </a>
       I think r/conspiracy could affect some real change if there were to be members interested in organizing a collaborative project.

       I think your thesis and tangent kind of lead to an expected hostile takeover of reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The content and activity already reflects a new direction for reddit. Instead of embracing its trending content, it's devalued the new blood and is hurting itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arbitrage. By merely being inclusive of the "offending content", reddit can itself service the gap in the market that they are busy creating.

       Or let others come along and do it and become obsolete.

       That's quite my point though; the political beliefs of companies—such as reddit—are clearly exercising their ability to influence by exclusion, even in the face of a potential schism among their existing support. Kind of like an "our way or the highway" proclamation—although without an actual public verbalization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is a huge community, and the presence of Trump supporter is, I would guess, no small minority. Of those however, most are likely not aware of the dynamics and extent of Reddit's suppression of information/articles/links related to non-Political Left goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the  members concerned for this type of suppression are content to bicker within the offender's own real estate (Reddit in this case); the eventuality will be an excising of Political opposition in such a disheveled manner that organization elsewhere would be unlikely. Effectively, the slow action shapes the tone of information while de-incentivizing those that oppose slowly enough that they don't go raise hell about it, but just one day simply say "f
       <em>
        ck it, I'm leaving this sh
       </em>
       thole."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think means such as these are how power gets consolidated. Division by such a creeping means as to avoid later oppositional organization. Maybe I'm paranoid—but I take it personally when a company tries to chop off part of the people that helped make it so popular in the first place simply because they've 'outgrown' them.

       Twitter is locked down, breitbart and drudge haven't moved either. Maybe Facebook is next. They are literally cutting off the people from Trump their elected official and the only places you can get news are back on the ones who were lying to us.

       I got banned a couple times for debating/arguing and I originally felt the same way as you, but in all fairness, they are a 24/7 Trump rally, not a place to go and argue other viewpoints.  They make it pretty clear in the rules and they're pretty open about it.  If you want to do that,
       <a href="/r/askthe_donald">
        /r/askthe_donald
       </a>
       is the place to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also a big difference between having a subreddit that is for a particular point of view, and having a website that claims to be for free speech and the open sharing of ideas, and then have that website single out individual subreddits and suppress/censor them.   I think the difference there should be rather obvious and even if we disagree with the viewpoints of the sub, censoring opposing viewpoints should raise a pretty obvious red flag.

       It's a different perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been banned from a number of political subreddits for arguing with them before accepting that they exist for people to discuss that topic directly and not have to constantly defend it to every outsider.  It's a gathering place for trump supporters to talk about things that relate to trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to understand the perspective of Trump supporters (or any politicial viewpoint), it makes sense to subscribe to those subreddits and at least be informed of their viewpoint and what's behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Trump sub can probably be pretty obnoxious at times , but straight up censoring it when people already have the ability to filter it out.. well, that's disturbing to say the least.  Might not concern you today, but perhaps one day you'll have the viewpoint that someone wants to censor and suppress, and you would hope that others would support you on principle alone, even if they don't agree with your specific views.

       A 24/7 Trump rally is not "a different perspective." It's a circlejerk, and by definition a circlejerk is only of interest to the people inside it with their dicks out. We might as well have a sub called
       <a href="/r/poopshots">
        /r/poopshots
       </a>
       where you put a video camera in your toilet and film the slow opening of the anal aperture and emerging excremental sausage. That's a different perspective too, how valuable it is, we must make sure
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       has to scroll past it, because people on the internet totally don't have enough to scroll past already.

       As an anarchist I've been living this reality for years, getting banned from the frontpage of reddit wouldn't even make me flinch. Whether or not X or Y corporation allows me to use their service as a platform for my beliefs isn't really a concern of mine, I don't expect it since my beliefs are against their existence in the first place. Let me know when T_D posters get added to the no-fly list without notification or find FBI bugs in their organizing spaces, then we can talk.
      </p>

       Personally I'm most worried about the perspectives of Muslims, immigrants, LGBT, and black people going forward, who are going to suffer much more repression than poor lil T_D is, precisely

       What you're saying is the equivalent of there being no point in having fox news on standard cable tv, because it's only interesting to the people who are interested in fox news.

       People are entitled to feel how they want about Trump, or the people in the Trump subreddit, or Trump's policies, but trying to censor the viewpoints you feel aren't worth of being heard only leads to one place and I feel like anyone who's an "anarchist" should understand that inside and out.

       Censorship is the denial of a platform you have a right to. A private corporation's front page is a place you only have a

       </em>
       to. What
       <em>

       that Fox News give
       <em>

       airtime, for free, because I want it that's why.

       The thing you are not taking into account, and arguably the most important part of it all, is that they aren't DISCLOSING that they are doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take google for instance.  Imagine I search for "Did Russia Influence our election", and the top 100 results are right leaning publications with right leaning bias, that all insist Russia did not influence our election in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine the reason why a left leaning publication did not show up until result 101 was because google altered their algorithm to make sure left leaning publications weren't on the first 10 pages of search results.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means your average person consuming the information is being manipulated by omission of data. We (hopefully) both see how concerning that is in shaping public opinion.
      </p>

       What you're implying,  is that someone should have to type in "what is the democrat viewpoint of whether or not russia influenced the election" to ever see that the viewpoint exists.   And yes, a private company is allowed to present information how it chooses, but reddit is claiming to be a platform for freely sharing information, while it is blatantly suppressing (maybe that's a better word than censoring?) a particular political viewpoint, and not only is it doing it, it's HIDING it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who don't want to see the_donald on /all have the ability to filter it out, but taking the extra step of making sure people never see it unless they specifically go hunt for it, is extremely concerning to me about the overall agenda of the website.

       It says all over the place, and even pops up before you click when hovering your cursor over the submit button, that it's a pro-Trump sub meant solely for chearleading for Trump, and not discussion or questions for Trump supporters, and then it includes a link to the sub that was created for discussion and asking questions of Trump supporters.   It sounds like maybe you broke that rule.

       If that's your opinion, then you should just leave and not post there.  But the reality is that its made very clear, the sub serves a specific purpose which was in high demand, given the attitude toward Trump supporters literally everywhere else, and finally, the exact same stipulations were enforced on /hillary, with equal strictness and very swift quashing of even the slightest dissenting opinions... the only difference being that on /hillary, my recollection was that it occurred  without any warning.

       Not every forum is designed for debate or totally free speech.  There are plenty of options for that, and Donald supporters adopted t_D as a haven from the incessant bashing on every other forum.

       It doesn't seem stupid to me, it seems like a very appropriate and logical reaction

       I think they've mainly proved how fundamentally broken Reddit's format is. They did almost every single thing they could within the the confines of the rules to circlejerk themselves to the top. Reddit has had to hurt the entire site just to slow them down. They aren't some enemy of Reddit, they are the embodiment of everything wrong with it. In the process they have also created reactionary anti-trump subs that resort to the same tactics as them, which in turn inspired even more reactionary subs. And this ideological warfare has gotten to the point where a large number of subs were essentially taken over by one side or the other flooding in.

       Places like this are still on r/all though so I don't think that explains it. Seems much more likely to be because of how obnoxious their posts were.

       Also, being put in prison/labour camps is so much worse than your subreddits posts not appearing on r/all that they aren't even comparable.

       Yes, if you want to find true examples of hate, just turn on CNN, or maybe go to a "Not My President" riot.  Nobody's calling for them to be banned.  Banning "hate speech" is nothing more than an excuse to exercise power to silence the opposition.

       Same could be said for r/politics and r/news, good luck bringing a dissenting opinion there. T_D and Enoughtrumpspam are obviously meant for cheerleading and opposition and I'll admit it gets tiring seeing it plastered on the FP which is why they implemented the filter feature, so guess what? You can filter it and not have to worry about seeing it.

       Bigots come in forms, and both sides of this made up isle.  No one does it better and dripping with hypocrisy while in self denial like the intolerance of so called "liberals".  Only real liberals are Libertarians.  The "left" wants a nanny state and the "right" a police state and neither one will even take a single critical glance at the criminal enterprise they support.

       And we are all just heretics painted with the brush of their opposition depending on which side we upset today.

       Now it's becoming clearer. So, the sub about Donald Trump is continually celebrating "racism and bigotry" because of the articles you linked! That seems to be the extent of it. Too bad you can't describe in your own words what you're so strongly feeling. Sad. You lack a coherent statement on your very strong feelings. Work one up and get back to us.

       Did you actually look at the links you posted, or did you just copy and paste that from Enough Trump Spam? It's full of Huffington Post articles and half of those articles don't even match the bold headline, "refused to disavow support from the Klu Klux Klan multiple times" which the article claims based on a quote of him saying he doesn't know how David Duke is..."Analysis shows that 62% of the people Trump retweeted on the week of January 19th 2016"  I mean you can't make this stuff up, its so cherry picked and the bold headlines don't even match the articles and half of them aren't even about him they are about other people. The fact that you copy and pasted it probably without reading it shows you willing to regurgitate these same narratives based off of nothing which is sickening. The fact that you called him a racist for pointing this out shows that a "racist" in your eyes is anyone who questions your beliefs.

       I think it's paid posters more than anything.  Last week they tried to discredit this sub and obviously that wasn't going to work, so I think they have just started spamming this sub with politics to try and change the tone.  All the political threads are very atypical for this sub

       bunch of t_d people ARE 9/11 truthers, they ARE infowars listeners, they are people who are interested in "conspiracy theory". they're also right wingers, nothing wrong with that. i do agree there is a bit too much of a right vs. left paradigm thing going on here and in t_d, but the neo-liberal left deserves all of the flack it's getting right now, just like the neo-conservative dinosaur republican establishment deserved it during the bush era. hopefully we killed off that establishment for good, and now it's time to do the same to the left's version of it.

       So when I post here, no: It's not the_donald brigading. There's ideological overlap. Those who are critical thinkers are drawn to those questioning things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was impressed by Trump for years, because he actually hit third-rail topics (that no one was supposed to ever broach). Like questioning 9/11, or openly discussing the biased media, or the rigging of elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Careers have ended over stuff like this. Trump could get away with it because he's a billionaire.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny now, looking at the mainstream media contradict itself so blatantly over the course of just a month. Remember a month ago when Trump openly talked about our broken electoral system and the entire media (in one voice) said it was crazy to question the outcome of an election, and that it couldn't be hacked--and anyone suggesting as much as "a threat to our democracy".
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Trump wins and the entire media does an about-face and starts claiming the Russians hacked the election. [Fake news.]

      <p>
       Gotta love our hysterical, hypocritical media.

       I was just listening to a great podcast from the X22 Report about energy (and the economic collapse that's coming). You can see it here:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkgNxLt7X2s">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkgNxLt7X2s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically (according to Steve St. Angelo) the energy demands that the world is placing on itself are going to imperil us. A century ago, when 100 barrels of oil were pumped from the ground, 99 were pure profit. (It required only one barrel of oil to cover the costs for the rest). So they could profitably extract the resources and we built our society around that 1-to-100 ratio. (We predicated all our city planning around the notion that oil would be cheap and plentiful. So we built everything with long drives in mind.) Little by little, though, oil became less profitable for those excavating it. Today, it's something like a 1-to-5 ratio. You put the costs, materials and manpower into the endeavor and get back a fraction of the payback from a century ago. (And, the profit margin is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. In a few years, you'll be getting no profit at all. Which means: People will stop excavating.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Even now oil companies are going bankrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is already affecting supply lines, energy grids, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't get the oil, you can't run the electricity generators. You can fuel the trucks that take food from the freighter to the local grocery store, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       (The single biggest cost to a company is energy. It's even bigger than labor. If energy is expensive, companies won't move their operations to that location.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I just listened to a clip of Canada's "Warren Buffet" worrying about Trump pulling out of the Paris accords (and ditching the global carbon tax on oil). That 15% overhead removed from the cost of drilling (by not paying off bureaucrats, who want a cut.) The financier was also panicked, saying, "Trump will cut corporate taxes from 32% to 15%. So if you're an international business and you have $2 billion to invest, are you going to go to expensive Canada or the inexpensive United States? We're going to get crushed. Trump is like Godzilla and Kevin Trudeau is like Bambi."
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, what's happening is: America is on the edge of a financial collapse (as is the entire world), and Trump was brought in to try and walk the damage back.
      </p>
      <p>
       To slash government parasitism (where tax upon tax is slapped on goods and services so that parasitic bureaucrats can get fat pay raises), but they make the costs of everything else go up, for both the business and the consumer.
      </p>
      <p>
       If energy costs are cheap (and more profitable), more businesses will come to the United States, and more jobs and wealth will be created.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think that it's like putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound. (We've been so screwed by the financial malfeasance of the "casino capitalism" that took off on steroids under Bill Clinton . . . with his cozy relationship with Goldman Sachs . . . that we're probably doomed. There are over $2 quadrillion in derivatives and the bubble's about to burst, taking down the entire global financial system with it.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Noam Chomsky said, "In the 1970s, a decision was made to transition the American nation from a manufacturing economy to a financial economy."
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, we stopped making things like Henry Ford did. We switched from a productive economy to a cook-the-books, scammy financial economy. (Like in the recent LIBOR scandal, where they were buying crack houses in Detroit for $1 and having their fake ratings agencies say they were worth $500,000--so that (on the books) they looked like they had awesome assets. They would then use the fake house valuation to take out loans for $5 million, using the crack house as collateral. This is an example of the fake wealth of the "financial economy". The problem with fake wealth? When the bubble bursts, it evaporates overnight, because it was fraudulent to begin with.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Our whole system has been like this: a house of cards, built on lies, malfeasance and corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem? Since Bill Clinton created "Too Big Too Fail" [when he gutted Glass-Steagall] and allowed investment banks to merge with commercial banks, we've seen so much financial manipulation and outright theft, that the whole system is about to collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump (and the people backing him) appear to be trying to switch it back from a "financial economy" to a productive economy again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch a Brazilian journalist Pepe Escobar talk about Trump's attempt to switch us from Clinton-era casino capitalism to 1950s Eisenhower-era productive capitalism:

       I'd surprise you. I rail against fossil fuels and the internal combustion engine, because we're being kept on 19th Century technology due to the Petro-dollar being pegged to oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have zero doubt [
       <em>
        zero!
       </em>
       ] that we have free energy devices (and have had them since Tesla started messing with zero-point energy back in the 1890s).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one of the bad things about crony-capitalism and monopoly: the technological retardation. And I mean that in both senses of the term.
      </p>
      <p>
       But knowing that anyone who tried to pull us out of oil would be whacked, I'm proposing a theory of what Trump and his backers might be trying to do. (They would likely never allow themselves to think beyond the parameters of oil. So, knowing that, they'd be trying to increase production and make it cheaper, in order to attract industry.) It'd be awesome if they concluded that more drastic measures must be taken, and Trump takes us to futuristic zero-point energy machines that the government has in underground bunkers. But somehow I doubt it.

       Trump didn't create this system.
      </p>
      <p>
       (He's not even President yet.)
      </p>
      <p>
       He's walking into a House of Cards that he had no hand in setting up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your assumption is that he should rush in like Kennedy--and end up like Kennedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is: Kennedy was assassinated, and the system was even more corrupt
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       they whacked him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't serve Trump to rush in like a bull in a China shop when the reality is: He has to ease in like a SWAT team demolitions expert to defuse a bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politically, this is Jenga.
      </p>
      <p>
       One false move and the whole structure collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step one of getting us off of oil: Removing oil as a peg for the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       (That's going to happen anyway. U.S. monetary policy changes roughly every forty years. We had forty years of the traditional gold standard. Then came the Bretton Woods standard. Then the Petro-dollar standard.) Right now, we're about five years overdue for a change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many experts around the world think that, after the crash, the US may peg the dollar to a commodity again to stabilize it. (China has been calling for America to peg the dollar to silver.)
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, the Petro-dollar is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Americans don't realize it, but it's so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's Presidency will see the collapse . . . and then the re-structuring.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the dollar is de-pegged from oil,
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       it will be easier to shift us from 19th Century fossil fuel dependency and ease us onto more appropriate technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see little baby steps now, like Bloom Energy (which posits a cleaner energy source for most US homes and a destruction of the traditional energy grid):

       That would all make sense.....if he wasn't looking like he was doing everything to keep us stalled in time and staying on the fossil economy.  Maybe if he were appointing people that didn't have stone age ideas your scenario would be somewhat believable.

       I have strictly caveman thoughts: My brain filled with monster trucks, big boobs and mixed martial arts fighting.

       That's why I voted for a President who 1) Participated in WWE events, 2) is a Lothario, who womanizes and 3) communicates with the public via a 4th Grade vocabulary.

       I only reluctantly voted for Trump because I couldn't vote for this guy:

       I go to both too.  The thing is, I don't want to see the same things here as on the_donald.

      <p>
       This wasn't a shitpost/meme kinda place when I started reading things here.  Lately it seems like I just see x-posts from donald in the formula 'if you saw x it was fake news', and I'm tired of those kinds of low effort things taking over the front page over here.

       Yea people IRL are way better you can actually have real conversation and learn things and actually change people's minds and they can change yours plus at the taverns there TVs beer women and it's a great way to expand your mind because random people are well random it's great to do at airport bars it's were I've met some of the coolest people that I'll never see again

       reddit is pretty huge, so is facebook, so is twitter... those are pretty much the three big "social media' corporations right now, and then you have google. All four of these corporations are engaged in censoring pro-trump, pizzagate, infowars, etc. material right now. they've come out in the media saying they're going to decide for us what information is determined as "fake" and "authentic" (fake being any alternative information they don't approve of or goes against their corporate politically correct narrative). this is pretty concerning stuff. you can still talk to randos in a pub, but there's no doubt that you'd have a much larger effect on society by engaging in these sort of discussions using social media technology. you reach more people that way. this information is now being censored/suppressed, and it's only being done because they're scared of that information entering the minds of people in society. they're calling this information "russian propoganda" and insinuating that the information isn't true and using fear mongering to scare people away from it, as well as psychological warfare to deem anyone interested in it or espousing it as crazy.

       Yea but I don't use facebook, , twitter, instagram or google I use Reddit and that's only been in the last month. But I understand what your saying it's concerning i guess for people who don't have media fluency or critical thinking skills. And well you and everyone have only one choice and that's to hurt their bottomline and break their power hold and leave and build your own social platforms that have no censorship but as private corporations they have a right to censor they are private the first amendment is about government censorship. Now if the government starts censoring the news then it's a serious problem

       Bit of a derail, but:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the oldest representations, Kekui is given the
        <strong>
         head of a serpent
        </strong>
        , and Kekuit the
        <strong>
         head of either a frog or a cat.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        In one scene, they are identified with Ka and Kait; in this scene, Ka-Kekui has the
        <strong>
         head of a frog surmounted by a beetle
        </strong>
        and Kait-Kekuit has the head of a
        <strong>
         serpent surmounted by a disk.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        In the Greco-Roman period, Kek's male form was
        <strong>
         depicted as a frog-headed man
        </strong>
        , and the female form as a
        <strong>
         serpent-headed woman
        </strong>
        , as were all four dualistic concepts in the Ogdoad.
       </p>

       Honestly, seeing a lot of anti Trump rhetoric around here not getting brigaded into downvote hell lately is refreshing. But also concerning. They are up to something, regrouping for another big play I'd bet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the front page of this sub, it is so pro Putin / Pro Trump right now but the top comments are questioning even the narrative of this sub, which is really great.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, the amount of deflection around here regarding Trump/Russia ties is very telling and hopefully people start seeing right through the BS soon enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Pizzagate... Does anyone think that ANYTHING will become of it? The power families around the world run all the governments, they have intelligence capabilities greater than the best in the world, and our law enforcement work for them, not us. They will let this bubble up. They want us to know what they do so their ritual is more meaningful. But the end game will only be for a military coup of not our gov't but the string pullers above them. They are literally multi trillionaires that have enslaved mankind and even the Clintons, the Bushes, and especially not the Trumps get to partake in the inner workings of their power. The only thing that will come of it, and I guarantee this, is that those who get too close to the flame will burn so brightly even Trump bots will cease to acknowledge it.

       I am no more disturbed by r/all getting rid of r/the_donald than I would be if they got rid of any other kind of spam.
      </p>
      <p>
       R_thedonald is the only sub I've ever been banned from because the mods and the participants are a bunch of thin-skinned hypocrites that don't want their echo chamber safe place bothered while they simultaneously bother everyone else with their low-information crap - there were no interesting policy discussions in the comments, most of the posts were trolling bullshit as well.  The sub was spam garbage on the same intellectual level as the Kardashians - all publicitly is good publicity (guess the Kardashian parallel is to be expected when you think about it).

       Good. They were abusing the shit out of moderation tools to force their content to the front page. Their most common abuse tactic was to sticky random posts they wanted to reach the front page and encourage mass upvote brigades. The reddit admins even said the sticky feature was intended for moderators to add announcements and such, not to manipulate their content to appear on the front page of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       About 80 percent of all T_D posts that appeared on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       were stickied. If you really care about reddit you should be glad that the admins are cracking down on this abuse.

       There was some talk about botting throughout the span onT_D's life. They would get spikes in likes according to some posts I read, and also video links with 1000ish views would have 7000 upvotes. It didn't seem like the sub was growing organically.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, that doesn't mean Trump supporters weren't randomly joining en masse or upvoting based on title alone, which is commonplace in today's online media viewership.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, if, say, reddit found conclusive evidence that they were botting, it could have been grounds to remove the posts from
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       while leaving the subreddit intact.

       Well that sub is also a bastion of censorship. Any desenting comment results in a ban. The place is just filled with pro-trump comments and supporters and their alt accounts.

       I don't think it's humanly possible for anyone to be unbiased. It is hardwired into our psyches.

      <p>
       I think the best way to pursue true bipartisanship would be to create a platform with a board of, (this is just a random number example,) four conservatives and four liberals. Unchecked, people make unbiased decisions subconsciously.

       Unbiased within reason... Like by not targeting one political candidate's subreddit and suppressing their visibility... Or by not deleting entire subreddits investigating paedophilia in our government (which somehow the mainstream media is convincing people is a far out conspiracy theory despite the MANY large pedophile rings exposed in connection with various governments in recent history).

       Okay. Not everyone that uses the Donald is perfect... But I don't see how it can be proven that no other subreddit users used this against the Donald.
      </p>
      <p>
       And more importantly, the Donald's vote weighting has been manipulated by reddit for a while. Surely you've seen the private chat between the reddit CEO and the mods. They are actively suppressing the Donald and looking for a way to ban the entire section, which is absolutely ridiculous. And Hillary's CTR team is also proven (they don't even try to hide it)

       When then CIA is on MSM stating there needs to be a do over for the election there is nothing possible about it. It's a 100% soft coup attempt. When this fails are they going to attempt a hard coup?

       The only thing reddit did was to make it so that they couldn't harvest upvotes by cycling pinned topics?
      </p>
      <p>
       If their posts got more upvotes, they'd hit
       <a href="/r/all">

       .

       Fuck the donald,  i am not disturbed by it, on the contrary, I enjoy any hardship that comes to donald supporters.  Freedom of speech died long ago on this site.  I am banned from the donald for "dissent" and my pozt on the donald and red pill has been used to ban me from many other subreddits because of "hate speech". The free discussion of ideas is lost on this site for 99% of subs.  Conspiracy does not censor based on content so i will continue to post here.

       first off,
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       is not the most active subreddit on Reddit, where do you get that nonsense from? As of this moment right now, it has 320,529 subscribed users and 9,853 currently online.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/WorldNews">
        /r/WorldNews
       </a>
       has 14,231,472 users with 12,780 currently active and I am sure there are plenty of subreddits that are more active than that. So lying doesnt help prove your point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not believe that Reddit should be in any way censoring
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       . If it organically makes its way to the top it should be allowed there, but that doesn't make it any less of a cesspool. If they wanted to simply talk about Trump and what they like about him, etc. I dont think it would have ever gotten here. But the bullshit that is flung around that echo chamber is not representative of a majority so dont kid yourself.

       Lol, what? Just because you haven't seen a pro-Trump post in a while doesn't mean much. A lot of people were given the option to censor certain sub-reddits from r/all. I still see Trump pop up from time to time, and not just posts criticizing him.

       Now let's look at what I said, that you quoted, only I'll bold a key point.

       "You can discuss him in

        just about any forum

       here devoted to politics and government."
      </p>

       See the bold? Now, since you mentioned the other forum, I don't see anything in their rules/posting guidelines that prohibit postings that are in support of trump.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ? Kind of like how r/Hillaryclinton is only for Hillary supporters and r/android is only for Android discussion

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not familiar with either of those subs so I can't comment on them. However, if the android forum has a rule that says, APPLE SUCKS, POST APPLE AND BE BANNED or the Hillary forum has a rule that says THIS IS ONLY FOR FOLLOWERS OF MADAM CLINTON. ANY OTHER POSTS ABOUT ANY OTHER CANDIDATE WILL RESULT IN A BAN, then fuck them too.

       makes reddit a much less usable place for people who dont give a fuck about politics, which is most of its users. Its no conspiracy, its a business trying to push back against people who literally call the CEO of said company a pedophile.

       What? This makes no sense at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are Trump haters so afraid of the one trump lover channel out of the thousands.  Only one place they can talk about their man crush and not get harassed or ridiculed or whatever.  Why does it terrify HRC lovers so much to allow one tiny corner of reddit for Trump lovers to voluntarily corral themselves into??  They are so scared of them they have to completely shut them out of Reddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish hillary lovers would corral themselves too into the HRC sub and quit pissing and moaning in here when she is implicated in yet another conspiracy.  I would be thrilled.  Then again I am not afraid of any truth coming out of their mouths either and making it to the Front Page.  Ah hah!

       How does the Donald do that? Make Reddit less usable?  Last time I checked you have to click a link to read a post, don't like it? Don't click it?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the most active subreddit of course it will have top posts, I was okay when the admins scaled it back to only one or two the Donald posts were at the top but now how they only get there during peak user time is a weak show of force from the admin team trying to make it so people can't see new to them posts that the admin happens to frown upon

       I got banned a couple times for debating/arguing and I originally felt the same way as you, but in all fairness, they are a 24/7 Trump rally, not a place to go and argue other viewpoints.  They make it pretty clear in the rules and they're pretty open about it.  If you want to do that,
       <a href="/r/askthe_donald">
        /r/askthe_donald
       </a>
       is the place to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also a big difference between having a subreddit that is for a particular point of view, and having a website that claims to be for free speech and the open sharing of ideas, and then have that website single out individual subreddits and suppress/censor them.   I think the difference there should be rather obvious and even if we disagree with the viewpoints of the sub, censoring opposing viewpoints should raise a pretty obvious red flag.

       It says all over the place, and even pops up before you click when hovering your cursor over the submit button, that it's a pro-Trump sub meant solely for chearleading for Trump, and not discussion or questions for Trump supporters, and then it includes a link to the sub that was created for discussion and asking questions of Trump supporters.   It sounds like maybe you broke that rule.

       The generalization and stereotyping of people on Reddit has become ridiculous as of late, I went to voat to follow the pizzagate investigation since the sub was banned here. I'm not racist, I'm not a troll and implying that all people that go to voat are is shitty. It's almost as shitty as people implying all Trump supporters are racist, xenophobic bigots (they're not). Who am I kidding though not a lot of people listen to reason so I'm probably wasting my words.

       Discussion about Trump generally would seem like fair game for r/t_d. If the sub is overrun by anti-trump posts then yes, it has failed in its mission and needs more aggressive moderation. There is a big difference between this and disallowing all dissenting opinions which is exactly what happens. It's more like r/MMA disallowing all posts or comments critical of a certain controversial MMA figther.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain members of the sub have also behaved quite badly, in large numbers, it's not like the "censorship" by reddit has happened in a vacuum.

       I'd surprise you. I rail against fossil fuels and the internal combustion engine, because we're being kept on 19th Century technology due to the Petro-dollar being pegged to oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have zero doubt [
       <em>
        zero!
       </em>
       ] that we have free energy devices (and have had them since Tesla started messing with zero-point energy back in the 1890s).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one of the bad things about crony-capitalism and monopoly: the technological retardation. And I mean that in both senses of the term.
      </p>
      <p>
       But knowing that anyone who tried to pull us out of oil would be whacked, I'm proposing a theory of what Trump and his backers might be trying to do. (They would likely never allow themselves to think beyond the parameters of oil. So, knowing that, they'd be trying to increase production and make it cheaper, in order to attract industry.) It'd be awesome if they concluded that more drastic measures must be taken, and Trump takes us to futuristic zero-point energy machines that the government has in underground bunkers. But somehow I doubt it.

       He did an AMA in the same format as all AMAs are done.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was open to public questioning, it was heavily moderated as all major AMAs are. The_Donald is the heaviest brigaded sub of all time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It had hundreds of questions posted within a minute, heavily upvoted and he answered the questions top down.
      </p>
      <p>
       While his AMA was gone from the front page within a half an hour (before he began answering) r/rnoughtrumpsspam's mock AMA stayed at the top for hours.

       A 24/7 Trump rally is not "a different perspective." It's a circlejerk, and by definition a circlejerk is only of interest to the people inside it with their dicks out. We might as well have a sub called
       <a href="/r/poopshots">
        /r/poopshots
       </a>
       where you put a video camera in your toilet and film the slow opening of the anal aperture and emerging excremental sausage. That's a different perspective too, how valuable it is, we must make sure
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       has to scroll past it, because people on the internet totally don't have enough to scroll past already.

        I've been banned from a number of political subreddits for arguing with them before accepting that they exist for people to discuss that topic directly and not have to constantly defend it to every outsider.

      <p>
       Okay, well maybe Reddit thinks their front page exists
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to be spammed by bot-upvoted T_D garbage that's rarely insightful even in the slightest. Is that hard to accept? Front-page exposure on a corporate-owned webpage is not a right, it's a privilege. If it upsets you and T_D so much, go start your own website, see how much money you make with zero content discrimination.

        If you want to understand the perspective of Trump supporters (or any politicial viewpoint), it makes sense to subscribe to those subreddits and at least be informed of their viewpoint and what's behind it.

       Is reddit not allowing people to sub too?

        Might not concern you today, but perhaps one day you'll have the viewpoint that someone wants to censor and suppress, and you would hope that others would support you on principle alone, even if they don't agree with your specific views.

      <p>
       As an anarchist I've been living this reality for years, getting banned from the frontpage of reddit wouldn't even make me flinch. Whether or not X or Y corporation allows me to use their service as a platform for my beliefs isn't really a concern of mine, I don't expect it since my beliefs are against their existence in the first place. Let me know when T_D posters get added to the no-fly list without notification or find FBI bugs in their organizing spaces, then we can talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I'm most worried about the perspectives of Muslims, immigrants, LGBT, and black people going forward, who are going to suffer much more repression than poor lil T_D is, precisely
       <em>
        because of
       </em>
       T_D.

       As for banning dissent, again, t_D was created for Trump support.  The rules are clear and visible, and it bans users who break the rules--just like any other sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are subs for other candidates that are the exact same way, and do the exact same things, and they're not removed from /all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The correct response would have been to simply make /all filterable.  Which is exactly what was done
       <strong>
        in conjunction with the erasure of t_D.
       </strong>
       Filtering /all is a great idea, but I don't understand what constitutes an automatic, nonreversible filtering of ONE subreddit and no others, even though there are subs which are directly analogous to the one that was singled out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not just let users filter out what they don't want to see?  Very simple, very easy solution that doesn't unfairly suppress any one subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The_Donald was singled out because it was more popular than expected, and made Reddit appear to have more Trump supporters than the admins preferred.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was done to prevent any content showing Donald Trump in a positive light from becoming visible to non-subscribers of t_D.  It's biased censorship and there's really no justification.  And strangely, you're doing a better job at trying to justify it than the admins who actually did it.
