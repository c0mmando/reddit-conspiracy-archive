       Think of this. Sex is one of the most addictive things in the world. Now anyone rich can get access to tons of hot people waiting to impress them. What they can't have is children. Now I believe pedophilia is a sort of delicacy for higher ups. A delicacy they are addicted to because they have no other way of getting children. Stars and higher ups who are caught with CP obviously tried going around the BIGGER man. They tried getting another supply from a different source and was sold out. Maybe children have something older women don't. Maybe its the fact that its so hard to find. Either way there must be a reason it's so rampant that they would have to create an ENTIRE OPERATION in order to supply their needs. Now if we expose pizzagate then their entire bargaining leverage is gone and their lives crumble. Maybe just maybe this might have to deal with mind control. I know this sounds far fetched but imagine this. They find people of interest susceptible to porn addictions BUT also have the abilities to be very useful to them. They subtly sneak in cues and various sort of taunts. Something that will get them curious about the idea. Maybe its a young girl flirting with them. Maybe its showing them hints of CP hidden in plain sight. Affecting their subconscience. Introducing the idea of it all. Now they want it. That's when they go in. Willing to supply for these hungry important people as long as they play nice and do their bidding. Thinking of it in this way might help us in our search. Stay strong friends. Keep up the hunt.

       A lot of criminal organizations have initiation practices. Usually the initiate has to do something particularly damning, like rape or murder. This way, the group can control the individual through knowing a horrible secret about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be surprised if this wasn't a feature of the higher levels of organized, absolute power. Somebody wants in on your kickback deal? Sure, just take these insurance photos, and if they ever betray those in power, release the pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot think of a better way to control a bought politician. Force them into some degraded sick shit when they ask for campaign contributions and if they don't keep their end of the bargain, make it all public.

       It's actually probably the nazis we imported to fight the commies, ironically. Russia//former USSR might actually be the anti-pizzagate force.
