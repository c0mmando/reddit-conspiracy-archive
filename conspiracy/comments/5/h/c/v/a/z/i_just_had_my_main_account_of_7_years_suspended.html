    <div class="md"><p>To be fair the <a href="/r/self">/r/self</a> post had &gt;1,500 upvotes and all comments in support of Pizzagate downvoted and then magically when someone on voat bitched about it, it fell off the front page with &lt;400 upvotes and suddenly all the posts in support of pizzagate were highly upvoted. That&#39;s censorship being perpetrated by the very group that claims to be against censorship.</p>

<p>That is a textbook example of brigading, and you even admit to arriving at the <a href="/r/self">/r/self</a> post by clicking a link from Voat. The reddit admins can see your referrer header so they know that you followed the Voat post with the intention of brigading. It&#39;s clearly spelled out in the rules that following a link to a post and voting in it will result in a shadowban, I don&#39;t know what to tell you if you think breaking the rules and getting punished for it is some conspiracy.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s against the site rules. And for good reason: there is blatantly a negative bias calling for the suppression of the post in that Voat post. Allowing people to follow off-site links calling for action is blatant censorship, and it&#39;s kind of amusing the calls for censorship are coming from a site that claims to be the bastion of free speech on the Internet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they all went to reddit directly and then voted, would you be OK with that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes because the referrer header would have came back as the reddit homepage. Although I believe the reddit admins have a system to detect abrupt changes in voting patterns, so it&#39;s still possible they would have been caught by a filter when the post went from &gt;1,500 upvotes to &lt;500 and got bumped off the front page within an hour. </p>

<p>Can you not understand why linking an &quot;anti pizzagate&quot; thread on a &quot;pro pizzagate&quot; forum leads to a brigade of downvotes?  The brigade doesn&#39;t have to have a leader, the nature of where the posters came from is enough of an indication.

This has the benefit of being accessible at any time when the notebook is in hand and can be kept in a safe place. The other option is to use an electronic spreadsheet to keep records, which is convenient and can be easily changed. An electronic list can also be printed, downloaded into the Cloud, or stored on a thumb drive.</p>

Imperial yo-yos. This is your classic, circular shape. These are for &quot;looping tricks&quot; -- where the yo-yo isn&#39;t sleeping but routinely coming back to your hand as you make loops and circles with the string.
Butterfly yo-yos. These are shaped just like their name -- larger on the outside, smaller on the inside (like wings). They&#39;re good for string tricks, where the yo-yoist creates intricate, woven webs with the string.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t someone follow a link without any intention of brigading, and then legitimately upvote/downvoted as if they found the link on their homepage?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that&#39;s against the site rules. And for good reason: there is blatantly a negative bias calling for the suppression of the post in that Voat post. Allowing people to follow off-site links calling for action is blatant censorship, and it&#39;s kind of amusing the calls for censorship are coming from a site that claims to be the bastion of free speech on the Internet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they all went to reddit directly and then voted, would you be OK with that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes because the referrer header would have came back as the reddit homepage. Although I believe the reddit admins have a system to detect abrupt changes in voting patterns, so it&#39;s still possible they would have been caught by a filter when the post went from &gt;1,500 upvotes to &lt;500 and got bumped off the front page within an hour. </p>
