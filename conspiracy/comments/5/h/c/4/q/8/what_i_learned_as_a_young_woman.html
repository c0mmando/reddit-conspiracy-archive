       *Abortions are so cool and amazing. Nobody ever should question abortion, and if you do, you're an idiot. There are no emotional repercussions. Oh, look, another top post of

       <a href="/r/gonewild">
        /r/gonewild
       </a>
       now, but don't you dare comment on me being attractive or else you're a creep!
      </p>
      <p>
       *There's no more value to a woman than how many likes she gets on a selfie. That is so much more empowering than being a homemaker!

      <p>
       *Real women have curves
      </p>
      <p>
       *You can be pretty, but only that "natural makeup look pretty." Don't you dare pretend you like makeup!!
      </p>
      <p>
       *It's OK to hate men
      </p>
      <p>
       *Women don't need men. Women don't need to fall into any gender roles whatsoever. Instead, let's have no purpose and finally feel free!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, I'm just being bitter tonight, but I feel I was lied to my entire life about gender roles, and what it means to be a woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I disagree with all women's rights issues. Of course, there are valid issues and there are many women who suffer greatly just because they are women.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm so tired of being told what to think and believe as a women, and if I don't fall into that paradigm, I'm evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the larger conspiracy is to break up family units (or the concept of family in general) and turn men and women against each other. Gender wars. Eventually we will not need mothers and fathers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I'm also tired of not fitting I with women. I'm not saying this in a way to get attention from men, or try to be one of the "bros." I seriously find it extremely difficult to relate to most women because I feel they are just complete products of an operation they couldn't even begin to understand. While this can be said about all people, I feel women are like robots in today's society. "Oh, Ellen Degeneres says we should all support this issue. I better believe her! Now I better go shopping for more clothes to impress men, but let me make sure I post a feminist rant on Facebook about how no men appreciate my beauty because I'm overweight!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       As for me, I really think that there is a value and purpose for gender roles, and there is a reason 'they' are trying to do away with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post is more of a rant than anything. I've posted better posts about this topic that I'll link here in a moment.

       I'm tempted to write a similar post, "what I learned as a young gay man":  be as promiscuous as possible, take zero responsibilities for your actions, aspire to the surface trappings of masculinity but eschew the real thing, etc.

       Well, not sure what to add.  Gay male culture seems to be about pure hedonism and taking no responsibility for its consequences.  No interest in the health of the community outside the narrow bounds of your subculture.  Worship of narcissism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It kind of dovetails with what you describe.  When I was younger and more naive, I thought the fictional character Carrie Bradshaw was based on a gay man (made into a woman just to gain wider audience appeal), but I now realize that women
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       sometimes behave exactly that way, and modern culture encourages more of that behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to overgeneralize, not every gay man is like that, but it is the predominant theme within the culture.  I've kind of dropped out from it.  My partner has a little bit more tolerance for it, but not much.

       I find it funny you're saying this, because I was talking with a buddy (we were both raised to be men, by men, who were raised by WW2 survivors whose survival depended on being macho - my buddy's grandad drove trucks of nitroglycerin for the Nazis and said they did it smoking cigars and drinking brandy) and we both don't see other men as equals.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were taught men self sacrifice until you die. So when I hear a guy say "I just had to do something for myself" I see a woman or a child. Me doing something "for myself" means fixing something for my own house or car, not I need to buy something worthless and materialistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a problem with homosexuality, I have a problem with the culture. You can be a man and fuck one too. Being flamboyant running around flying the rainbow flag as you make things more difficult for every gay person just trying to duck their head and get through life without a hassle. That I have a problem with, it's not manly. Your sexual preference doesn't change what you are, it's not an excuse to be a disgrace to your gender.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through a buddy I've met a couple gay iron workers, and goddamn were they manly. They were just men who happened to like other men. Anything a "man" would stereotypically like to do, they liked like most others. They just went home to their boy not girl friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm never going to be able to call up a flamboyant gay and say "I'm installing a new staircase, get out here I need someone to hold it." It ain't happening, so I'm never going to be friends with them because there'll never be a reciprocation of value. I'll do it for a woman, because I'm supposed to be chivalrous and help. It also helps out when they tell my wife what a great husband she has. Dont think it works the same when a Hollywood stereotype gay man says it.

       I guess you're a sophisticated city slicker, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       All I hear is a child. Self-sacrifice is a pillar of being a decent human being (charity work, doctors without borders, you know things that aren't solely in your own best interest but societies), but I'm guessing you know nothing of that because you sound like a narcissist, but even that sounds too complimentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're weak because you seem to think any physical work means you instantly fall apart. You're a coward - oh no you're a big man because you wanna make fun of those in the military without even giving a shit as to why they joined. Which goes onto, you clearly think you're more important than anyone else and they're not worth you self-sacrificing for.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can tell by your user name you like imaginary manly things, so what you're too much of a wuss in real life to actually do manly things?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I have anything to back it up? How about a psychology and sociology degrees, and I went into the trades to make money - and I make more than anyone I know in my age group, especially the ones I went to college with, most of whom work at walmart.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can do just about every construction trade better than most - except structural concrete. I do work for people, and they're so impressed by the quality they ask what else I can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bought my first house before I even had a credit card in my early twenties. I have a wife and two kids, two god children of my best friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       What cultural indoctrination anyway? If I listened to what everyone was telling me to do I'd have gone on to sit on my fat ass in an office job struggling to pay off my student debts, working until I'm almost 40 before I even had a hope of buying a house or being able to afford starting a family.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep on deluding yourself. Please! That bullshit steering boys away from the trades has made them so fucking lucrative. If you have skills people just throw money at you.

       Lmao maybe because you majored in fucking psych and sociology. Jesus christ, for someone who's trying so desperately to come across as manly, I honestly cannot think of a more feminine major. Hahahha oh my fucking god.

       Sorry, I'm the narcissist? Buying a house in some southern hick village isn't anything to be proud of bud. If you weren't so fucking stupid as to major in psych/sociology, literally one of the most oversaturated and low-paying fields known to man, you'd probably be able to buy a castle in whatever backwater you live in, and you wouldn't be a hunchback at 45.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trades are fine, but please stop deluding yourself into thinking they're superior or "more manly" than other fields, especially ones that require a college education. The trades wouldn't exist without an engineer behind it all, and they sure as fuck go to college.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, remind yourself that I'm not the one claiming to be some "big man", that idiot is you. Which is so ironic given the fields you got your degrees in. It's clear you learned literally nothing from your time in college.

       You're trying to make fun of psychology as a feminine subject? Okay buddy. Sure thing! It has gender parity, but you're clearly sad enough to be looking for any way to try and get a rise out of me. And of course you're an expert of job market pays too. I mean naturally you must be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trades wouldn't exist without an engineer? Yeah... okay! So God first Created the Engineer, and then the Tradesman? Oh no, it was the other way. And nope. Never been on a residential site that had anything to do with an engineer. Architect sure. Design drawn by the home owner and passed by the building department, yup. But you're clearly the expert on everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I live in Canada buddy, outside of Toronto. Yeah those house pricing bubbled backwaters of Canada's biggest city. You also might be interested I emigrated from the UK, and got fucked by the system like most tradesmen from other countries do.
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, you seem to be an expert on absolutely everything you delusionally claim. So you're a fucking troll. Have fun, you're boring.

       You're right, I am boring. I'm not nearly as interesting as the big manly construction worker with a fucking sociology degree, bitching about how other men aren't his equal because they don't break their backs at whatever job they do.

       Clearly you envisioned a testosterone-filled, ruggedly masculine life for yourself when you chose psychology as your major. Who the fuck are you trying to fool? Do you have any idea what people with that kind of degree do, if they manage to land a job? It sure as hell isn't breaking rocks and mining coal, that's for sure.

       I'd argue a physically gendered man has no obligation to act manly, gay or straight. Masculinity is largely a social construct and no one should feel forced to comply with their gender's social norms. That said, people who act outside of gender norms should not expect to be accepted by everyone with open arms, just as they have a right to act flamboyant, I have the right to find it obnoxious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't think "flamboyant gays" are a disgrace to other men or gays. If you dont like that sort of behavior then dislike the individual for acting that way,  it should in no way be seen as an affront to men as a whole.

       If masculinity and femininity are social constructs, then why have those traits been associated with those genders since the beginning of time? I understand most of what you're saying, but that just seems quantifiably wrong to me.

       People have the tendency to assume roles they're good at. Men are physically stronger than women, generally speaking of course, so they assumed the role of hunter, while women are capable of child rearing, the biggest factor here being the ability to breastfeed, and so they assumed that role. They started as roles motivated by necessity and ability. These days though, a woman is more than capable of assuming virtually any role traditionally done by a man, and visa versa. So the perpeturation of gender roles is more a cultural norm than something that actual benefits us as as species.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm trying to say is that while you're right, gender roles have existed for most of human history, we've reached the point technologically, and socially, where those roles no longer need to be rigid, and the only reason they are is because it's normal and we're used to it. A woman being weaker physically no longer matters because we've domesticated animals, no one's wrestling a caribou for dinner. And with breast pumps and formula, a man is fully capable of child rearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end do what makes one happy, whether it fits with their gender's supposed place in society or not, as long as people aren't being parasites to society who gives and shit.

       I agree. If I can remember correctly from over a decade ago back when I was getting a psychology degree; there was a tribe (from Papua New Guinea, or somewhere similar) where the females adopted our traditional masculine roles.

       I had a super annoying discussion with my wife's friend over breakfast yesterday. She was talking about some feminist play she'd seen and how well it got the point across and bla bla. My wife said she's not a feminist and this got her friend all riled up because she couldnt believe she wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said I wasn't either because labelling something as a victim will manifest that reality and just as much as the feminine is wounded, so too is the masculine because they're inextricably linked energetically.
      </p>
      <p>
       She just kept wanting to go on about it and convince us and saying how she's experienced sexism in her workplace at the bank and she's gonna fight to change it. Im like dude you work at a bank, the whole banking industry is set up in hommage to the systematic rape of the population by the phallus, you ain't gonna do shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile she's in a relationship and living with a mysogynistic morrocan feeder who's systematically destroying her relationships with all her female friends and calling them fucking sluts just because he doesn't like them.

       That's because you're not dealing with rational human beings but rather agents of cultural marxism triggered into victimhood. Behind them is the desired effect of their handlers of a divided masculine and feminine and a nifty vector to justify censorship.

       Well, there are countries where women are treated like complete shit, and I think feminism is needed in that sense.

       In addition, I think feminism should be more philosophical, debatable, and open-ended. I think too many women cling to views without really going deeply into them.

       The divisive nature you mention is by design- subversion can be one of the most powerful weapons of war.  I think Sun Tzu is the earliest known person to have spread this idea (The Art of War) and that was over 2,000 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subversion is predicated on the target population being unaware of the attempted influence on them, of course..  that is what I find to be the most frustrating with regard to
       <em>
        social issues
       </em>
       and the magnitude and frequency of conflicts that they so often entail.  We're all humans here- as long as you aren't hurting anyone else then keep on doing you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note:  While typing this, I thought of "Join or Die"- the famous newspaper cartoon in Colonial America from 1754.  It illustrated the importance of all of the different states coming together as one for the sake of the collective group.. I'd find it hard to debate that this policy of unification didn't help those colonists back then and, with a little hope, I find solace in thinking that this policy will help us all, globally as it had helped those colonists in the past.

       I'm going to tell you what you should think as a woman so brace yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a woman you should think as an individual.  That means that if you find yourself most comfortable in a traditional homemaker role, don't feel like you're letting down all these other women who want you to be something else.  It means that being a homemaker is not a nothing role, it's not a lowly role.  It's very different than being a top defense lawyer for the best firm in whatever city you're in, but it's not less than or greater than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, if you find yourself becoming that defense lawyer... Do it well.  Don't waste your time worrying about the haters.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you've come in conflict with is identity politics.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Women everywhere are going to celebrate when Hillary Clinton breaks that glass ceiling and a woman holds the highest office in the land.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Obviously that concept was proven wrong since Hillary didn't dominate the female vote.  But if they can talk you into putting yourself in a box labeled "women" then they can talk you into doing their bidding.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a woman! Great! But more importantly, you are an individual.  Whatever else you are, besides a woman, should be more important to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish you the best of luck in life and I'm happy you didn't voluntarily jump into that box.  Free range women are the best women.

       Social Marxism, ie. insanity - damn near schizophrenia, and a perfect 10 on narcissism (not you OP - your topic). Have my cake and eat it too. I really don't care about female issues, because 9/10 men deal with the same thing, and we get the worst end of the stick, on many cases. Not saying I don't empathize, but yea, nah, fuck it. There is a reason there is a ying/yang. Female/Male ratio...  We complete each other, and die off if we isolate one another...

       Women have complained about not feeling valued, and then they spend their entire lives doing completely invaluable things.

       By the way, I know men have plenty of the same issues (in different ways), but just feel that women are so caught up in this because it is cool to be a feminist and if you don't support modern feminism, well then, you must be evil.

       I feel you, and like I said, I can empathize with women. We are all slaves an held to a certain standard.... I'm not discounting people, I just commentate based on my experience and my opinions. It's good to vent :). I should say I'm not religious, and think abortion is 100% immoral and should be illegal. That may get me some downvotes, but I don't care (I've grown morally and spiritually). Abortion is murder, plain and simple.. If people only knew, TPTB want us to kill ourselves off.......

       As long as murder and manslaughter ( along with others) are on the books. Abortion is murder, to me. I take this from the NAP (Non Agression Principle). All lives have rights, doesn't matter the "scientific" mumbo-jumbo stages. I believe life starts at conception. Think of it this way. A female gets an abortion because she can, at late term. A female smothers her autistic child. Which one is murder, and what is the difference?

       Yes, I agree for the most part which is why I'm morally against abortion. However im not legally against it (right now) because I feel that there are grey areas.

       What are the grey areas, though? Mother's life is at risk, rape, molestation? One is different than the others... I hope you can see that. I used to be: As long as my tax dollars aren't paying for it. Now, no, it's murder. Long time coming, and deep reflection has been done..

       Nothing is black and white. That's why I said I take a moral stance against abortion, but not a legal stance.

       Not that I necessarily disagree with you, but what of taking a person in a coma off life support, who theoretically could recover
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       function but in all probability will be a vegetable the rest of their life, versus removing a fetus from it's mother (essentially life support) and letting it die because it's too young to survive, even with care? What is the difference
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize that's not how abortions are done today, but in the abstract that's what it is, and it could be done that way if need be. Is there a difference between taking a life and not doing what is necessary to preserve one?

       I'll preface this by saying I have shared this fact a few times on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Australian law, a foetus is a 'person' once it becomes viable ie after 25 wks gestation. Before that there is no chance of it living outside the mother, therefore not considered a person.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that if you were, for instance, to physically assault a woman who was 26 wks pregnant and her baby died, you would be charged with murder as well as assault. If she was 23 wks pregnant, the law doesn't consider the baby a 'person' and it would only be assault (likely grievous bodily harm).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you can only have an abortion before 14wks, with that extended to 18 wks if you are high risk. You can only get an abortion after that if there is a life threatening situation for the mother or child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't think that the moral issues this topic raises justify a blanket ban on abortion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not for me personally, but who am I to make decisions for others? I'm prolife in that I am a mother and value the life of my own children, but I'm pro choice in that I believe that everyone has the right to choose what happens to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As humans we have come so far, I feel like making abortion illegal would be a giant step back in human rights.

      <p>
       We attribute consciousness/sentience scores, on a gradient, to all living things. This is done on a subconscious level by everyone. Everyone's scoring criteria is different, but generally speaking an ant would be about a 3, a dog would be a 30, an adult human would be 97-100.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us assume for the sake of argument that an unborn fetus is generally about a 5. Considering the fetus is in a coma-like state throughout almost all of gestation, depending on how you define consciousness you could potentially even put it at a 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is acknowledged, is there much difference between killing an ant and killing a fetus?
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, assume a born baby has a score of about 70. Autism is conscious-alerting, but even then the baby would likely be around a 50-60.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most pro-choice people attribute a low score to fetuses, and most pro-life people attribute a high score to them. Things could be complicated by discussions of potential for future life, but taking that argument to its core may require accepting that humans should produce as many children as possible (and many people do agree with this and implement this under certain consequentialist ethics systems).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, excluding arguments purely from theistic belief, it really comes down to debate over the scientific interpretation of what consciousness and awareness and qualia and pain is, and where fetuses fall into this.

       I agree with you 100% as a woman. :( I want to be a home-maker now, a gardener, a provider in my own way but society makes you think that those things are not valuable or useful. I used to think I wanted to go to college and get a high paying job, never have children, abortion was morally OK, but now... Im realizing what these things truly mean, being a woman. And yes it's ok for people to want this but honestly I don't think a college degree can even get you far. I'd rather focus on family, and making things for myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't change what your heart finds valuable though. They can never change how you feel inside. I'm re reading 1984 and it's making me wake up to all this separation of the sex. Divide and conquer, that's what the people in power are doing and it sickens me.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I want to go buy property (also how dumb is that, we can't even go into the wild and live off the land anymore) and build my own home, garden, build furniture for it, etc. I know this sounds insane but living in an AMISH community sounds much better than what is expected of me at the moment
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: also I can't fucking stand twox or trollx anymore. I can't relate to women that well either. I just don't have the same values or thoughts and I feel like no one would get it either :/ they're all ideologues, only interested in how they can deem your beliefs partisan. It's fucking stupid as fuck and it's not just women. It's most "liberals" and "progressives"

       You really should have gone to college, education is paramount and it'd help alleviate how stupid you are. How do you expect to buy property when you're not even educated? You contribute NOTHING to society. Christ.

       Am I wrong though? Do you honestly think people should  be allowed to just go into the wild and live there without any contribution to society? Like what kind of a dumbass thinks that's a good thing?

       Partly yes, partly no I would say..  Obviously we live in a capitalistic (more or less) world where everything has a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic value.  Also true that education
       <em>
        generally
       </em>
       helps, though, I have many reservations about higher ed.  Regardless, it felt like you kind of just berated the OP which turned me off to the points you made.

       Your first sentence is a really nice word salad.

       I don't give a fuck if my words insulted op. They're fucking retarded if they honestly believe in whatever bullshit they're spewing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And education is paramount. I can see some reservations over how some schools provide an easy place for sociology type folk to become kinda radicalized ( heavily preaching consent, abortion, etc), but college is still where the scientists, engineers, lawyers and mathematicians need to go, and society is nothing without people like that.

       Ya, I agree with you regarding their views but you obviously aren't going to get much corroboration lashing out at someone here unless they're like fucking Hillary Clinton or someone equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also agree about college.  My issue is that it is such a glutinous industry.  As well, I have noticed many people around me that performed very well in college but that lacked almost any ability to critically think.  Not so much with engineers as that is the crux of engineering but some people in the sciences I have found to be surprising simple minded.  Idk, it is what it is, I guess.

       I'm so glad you made this post, OP. I see this constant struggle with my wife every single day. She's a stay-at-home mom while I work 12 hour shifts in a steel mill. I see her bounce back and forth between fighting/embracing her role as the homemaker, and myself as the bread winner. I can tell she wants to feel independent at times like she doesn't need me to survive, and then she'll come back thr next day thanking me for working so hard to provide for our family. The media plays a huge role on her attitude. Again: great post!

       Black Mirror is a series on Netflix. Each episode deals with a different futuristic, often dystopian, story. I recommend the entire series. This episode specifically follows a woman in a future where up/down votes affect our day to day life. Came to mind as I was reading your post

       Lol, because I didn't have any glaring issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anybody is editing my posts. Just a fun conspiracy theory.

      <p>
       But I reread my post and there wasn't anything that interfered with the meaning of the post. I talked rather informally, but I normally do on Reddit.

       I think the difference is that you just want to be an asshole. My writing piece was a rant/vent, and I stated as such. I had 1 or 2 errors, and they didn't interfere with the overall meaning of the piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've written thousands of other posts, each with different styles to suit my purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you liked it or not, it was generally well-received and led to good discussion. Even if everybody didn't agree with me, most were polite and respectful.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim that I come off as self-centered and immature, but I was writing from a place of frustration.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, your post comes off as just completely arrogant and rude.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are the one who takes this whole Reddit thing a little too seriously. In additon, you have the same writing style as other trolls that have bothered me. These trolls always say the same shit you are saying.

        I feel the larger conspiracy is to break up family units (or the concept of family in general) and turn men and women against each other. Gender wars. Eventually we will not need mothers and fathers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is the goal. It isn't to say that they hate families but dividing up the man and woman and causing them to rely on government is one of the primary objectives too.

       <p>
        While this can be said about all people, I feel women are like robots in today's society. "Oh, Ellen Degeneres says we should all support this issue. I better believe her! Now I better go shopping for more clothes to impress men, but let me make sure I post a feminist rant on Facebook about how no men appreciate my beauty because I'm overweight!!"

       One could say that society is in a "zombie apocalypse" in terms of consciousness. Women are more likely to stay within the norms and rules given to them and are less likely to deviate compared to men.

       Doubling the population competing for the same number of jobs increases the quality of the workforce while lowering wages. This increases profits for the 1%. If you get burned out, we can easily replace you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing is that you have to think and find your own way and nobody else will or can help you. It is harder now because there are more choices, but you have to find what YOU want. For some, it is a high pressure job. For others it is a more traditional role as homemaker. Only you can decide what is best for you.

       You sound like a cool chick. ;)

      <p>
       Women do have (or had) so much power in society, and it seems like the modern agenda has basically sought to remove it. Replacing it with dependency while claiming empowerment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beauty, femininity, compassion, nurture of children, creating a true home are all aspects of female power, but these have been disparaged and, horribly, outsourced into corporate hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really quite the pickle. So glad to hear you see through it.

       Really good question. I think in some ways women were mistreated and I understand the need for feminism in that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, destroying the concept of the female figure as a mother and nuturer? I don't think that had to be a byproduct of feminism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The movement of feminism itself was funded by the CIA, and one has to ask why they would care/want to get involved.

       Okay I see what you're saying.  here's my interpretation.. one of the primary goals of feminism was to get rid of gender roles because they saw them as necessarily repressive and induced too much social policing.  you don't agree with that.  but the funny thing is you're using that same logic to critique feminism.  you're saying feminism is responsible for too much repressive social policing to watch ellen degeneras or whatever the fuck.. i can get behind this, but i disagree totally with your implied solution which seems to be to revert back to 1950s era gender roles. this gets us nowhere but a constant back and forth of imposing one set of roles and then the backlash imposing a new set next generation.  i think the elimination of repressive roles and social policing should be the goal-- sometimes that means calling out feminism and sometimes it means calling out traditional values...

       I think gender roles hold some value.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I never said that we should go back to an Era of repression.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that we have destroyed roles so much that we have lost important family structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the goes deeper than this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not advocating for regression or repression. I'm saying that gender roles are influenced by undeniable biological sex differences. The complete elimination of gender roles was irresponsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       We cannot ignore that there are differences between men and women, and those should shape some of our roles in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you heard about the controversy in STEM fields for example? Despite all this effort to push women into STEM, it just doesn't work. It has nothing to do with sexism. Women are biologically better suited in roles that have to do with people and humanities.

       Well, one of the products of people doing whatever they want is the complete breakdown of family structure. How many dads are actually in their child's lives anymore? Is this a good thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said, I'm not calling for policing people. I'm calling for elimination of propaganda that perpetuates a sole liberal feminist view of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are teaching children that their biological sex means nothing, and that gender roles are "evil"
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, in the strangest twist, we are allowing 5 year Olds to choose their gender?!??!
      </p>
      <p>
       Feminists hate gender roles, yet they believe a 5 year old boy can choose their gender because they might like to play with girly things.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just feels completely upside down.

       I'm definitely worried about our children and their future, especially when harmful measures are taken to convince parents and their children that they should choose a gender and stick with it at the age of 5....wtf?!?

       it just sounds like you're worried about forcing people to think the way you do because you objectively know what is best for everyone-- which, again, is what you are accusing the feminists of.

       Hmm, since you have no idea what other views I hold, let's not jump to labels (as feminists seem obsessed with).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still in a state where I'm trying to figure out what I believe. My beliefs have definitely transitioned over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't support is the way our current society is operating, and our current society is far from a "democracy" anymore anyway...if it ever was.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said, the government spies on us, censors us, and controls and brainwashed people through a variety of means. If they are going to do that shit anyway, I'd like to know what beliefs and ideals they are pushing on us, and if possible, change those.

       Honestly you don't seem like you want to have an actual conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm clearly not in control of our current society. But something is very wrong. If we keep going the way we're going, well, I'm not looking forward to the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we were lied to, and a lot of us, especially women, got caught up in the worst of it.

      <p>
       If you want to argue specific points, that's great, but you're saying things that I haven't directly said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have all the answers, but the way society is operating now is not benefiting the majority.

       This post is just great. It's tough to be a woman on this website. I took a 6 month hiatus. After the election though, I needed my conspiracy community. I was starting to worry about those around me. The comment about gone wild.. I wish something could be done about this. So many garbage people are on the site because they can find whatever bullshit they want. It's rare for a man to reply to my comment positively. They own us on here, just like many believe they do IRL. Thank you for the post!

       I'm definitely not anti-women or anti-feminist. I'm just tired of women going on the bandwagon when it comes to any liberal issue. And maybe I'm generalizing but I honestly cannot find one women (maybe a few on this site) who have though critically on these issues.

       In the same way that young women are socialized in way that makes it hard to form meaningful relationships, or even interact with strangers in a friendly way, so are men, though differently. The whole MRA/red-pillers phenomenon is sort of a reaction to that, albeit misguided in my opinion. It gives them reason that their life didn't turn out how they thought it should, and puts that blame on women. It's terribly unhealthy because it puts them in a victim mentality, and when you're in one of those, they only thing you can do is lash out at those whom you perceive to have wronged you.

       Sounds kinda fakish, like something that one might read on an alt-dimension version of Jezebel. It has the same commercialized vibe/tone of magazines directed at younger woman with a 'progressive' slant, the only difference being the negation of the 'progressive' proclamations while retaining the same cookie cutter "feminine" feel. Perhaps the stereotypical tone was done as parody, who knows, in any case it came across as insincere, artificial, at the very least unprofound and generally uninteresting.

       Great post. All of our minds have been captured. Breaking out is not easy, because they have provided us with many alternatives, so it's hard to find an alternative that isn't also some kind of trap. Anyway, thought you might like these essays:

       Scary isn't it? I've found that a lot of my "friends" who claim to be so open minded about feminism and stuff are only that way as long as it pertains to their beliefs. Ugh. People seem to have a really hard time accepting that you don't have to be a "feminist" or a "liberal" to have an open mind.

       I respectfully disagree with you on some issues, but if you wish to live in a more traditional fashion, you should be free to do so. I do believe that the elites have an ulterior motive in doing away with some traditionalist actions, but some aspects of traditionalism is a "trap" and full of shit. So no don't hate men, but yes the elites want to turn men against each other, like they want to turn black people against white people, old against young, etc.

       It's not that I don't think women shouldn't have careers or anything like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather, I think women have been mislead in the name of "feminism" without taking time to really think about the issues.

       I really don't consider myself a red pill women or anything like that. I just am tired of certain aspects of modern feminism.

       Ironically, I actually agree with you on several of your points. Women should definitely think for themselves instead of going along with whatever popular notion society says. This is why I'm against both extreme traditionalism and extreme liberalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have extra free time, research different forms of feminist thought. The things you describe in your post is more reminiscent of liberal feminism. Radical feminism, the school of thought I like the most, is refreshing. A lot of radical feminists are against porn, the hookup culture, sex positivism, and the trans takeover of female spaces. Of course, there are some major differences that don't mesh well with 100% your post, but it's nice for women to think for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes! Let's definitely talk more. Our conversations would be very interesting and educational.

       You're right, I am boring. I'm not nearly as interesting as the big manly construction worker with a fucking sociology degree, bitching about how other men aren't his equal because they don't break their backs at whatever job they do.

      <p>
       Clearly you envisioned a testosterone-filled, ruggedly masculine life for yourself when you chose psychology as your major. Who the fuck are you trying to fool? Do you have any idea what people with that kind of degree do, if they manage to land a job? It sure as hell isn't breaking rocks and mining coal, that's for sure.

       I don't give a fuck if my words insulted op. They're fucking retarded if they honestly believe in whatever bullshit they're spewing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And education is paramount. I can see some reservations over how some schools provide an easy place for sociology type folk to become kinda radicalized ( heavily preaching consent, abortion, etc), but college is still where the scientists, engineers, lawyers and mathematicians need to go, and society is nothing without people like that.
