    <div class="md"><p>EDIT: WHOA whoa whoa now....this article is about HSV-1...that is canker sores and is not and STD.  Canker sores aren&#39;t even contagious from &quot;swapping saliva&quot; with a person with open sores it their mouths.  I&#39;m not saying this changes the ritual, I&#39;m saying that a strong majority of people are already infected with HSV-1 at birth... </p>

<p>Some I guess have a tradition to do this, I definitely do not.  My wife and her family have never even seen it done (just asked) and they have been to dozens of these.   I have been to over a dozen and I haven&#39;t seen it done, so it might be some sort of ultra ultra ultra traditional thing done by a few, but it definitely isn&#39;t a required part of the mitzvah...nor is it sexual...duh...but my thoughts are, &quot;I mean come on man, we have disinfectants now, this stuff is outdated and pretty gross, no lie.&quot;   Also, that&#39;s a tale of two babies, we don&#39;t know the history or if the mohel had herpes...either way, I agree, gross.  But this isn&#39;t a pedo thing, it&#39;s a tradition that is way outdated and unnecessary with modern medicine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, trigger much?  It isn&#39;t torture, it&#39;s removing the only one small unnecessary physical part of the body commanded by and according to the Creator of the Universe.</p>

<p>Some people are born without needing it, so only time will tell.  Adam, Jacob, and Moses were born without it (complete physically).  </p>

<p>There is a lot written about it, but I keep it simple.  G-d treats it like an unwanted growth that should be removed. He makes man in such a way that we can be partners with Him in our perfection both physically and spiritually.  That organ is the one where the most base physical drives come from and can distance us from our relationship with the Creator rather than help us become partners in creation, using the organ to create more life.  </p>

<p>I had one, I didn&#39;t feel any bit of torture nor trauma...but I can&#39;t force view to view things through my eyes.  Seems kind of odd to call it torture though when observant Jews aren&#39;t claiming torture issues even once in the last 3,300 years.</p>

<p>It is very clear  that Mary was betrothed to Joseph and marriage was imminent.  The usual  age for marriage under Jewish law is 13 for boys, 12 for girls.   Considering the circumstances described in the Gospel and giving enough  weight to Jewish practices 2000 years back Mary was 13 when angel  Gabriel appeared before her.  Please also note that Mary was not  subjected to a physical relation with God.  According to our best knowledge she was 14 at the time of giving birth to Jesus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they wanted to normalize their pedo tendencies then why not just get society to accept them?  Pedophilia is an acceptable form of sexuality in some cultures (think the Greeks, some tribes, Islam during time of Muhammad).       </p>

<p>There&#39;s a contradiction in this conspiracy theory:  if the elites are all pedophiles wouldn&#39;t they use their power and influence to normalize their predilections?</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna guess 0.5-1.5 % tops (Maybe not including Muslims). But they have to work in secret. They know what they&#39;re doing is heinous, they&#39;re doing it anyway, they&#39;ve done it for millennia, and they hide it. </p>

<p>Spiritually or, perhaps even physically, it gives them enormous power and and authority to do much of what thy want. </p>
