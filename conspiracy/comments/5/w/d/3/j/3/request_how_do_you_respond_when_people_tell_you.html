<p>He told me, his lawyer at the time was representing a client, and refused to join the Union, and Hoffa told him if he didn&#39;t join the union in 48 hours, he&#39;d break both of his legs.  </p>

<p>2 days later, my Dad got a call from his friend in the hospital, they broke both his legs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A person such as you describe believes that the nature of society is such that it could never precipitate the conditions necessary to allow for such grandiose conspiracies to possible be true. </p>

<p>The best response to this sort of thinking is to slowly eat away at the perception of what is possible within a society. History is rich with genocide, backstabbing, inside-deals and secret police. Show them examples of such things over an extended period of time and they may slowly experience a change in the way they perceive society, and what can be orchestrated within it. </p>

<p>The history of the United States is filled with examples of organized injustice. If a person knows of these things, and accepts them as either true, or possibly true, then they will more readily admit the possibility of such things being recurrent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talk about compartmentalization <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_(information_security)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_(information_security)</a> </p>

<p>A lot of times, people don&#39;t even know what they are doing. They don&#39;t know what they are apart of. They just know that they are apart of something bigger, better. They are the reason why the US works.</p>

<p>For example, a handful of TSA employees were caught smuggling coke. It was not just those employees. They probably worked under one person leading. And some one was leading them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s compartmentalized. And the one person thy actually knows what&#39;s going on has TWO INCENTIVES. </p>

<p>First LIVING. The CIA will take you out if you rat. Second, a sweet deal. Look at how Hillary took care of thy child trafficker. Judges went light, she gets a cushy job when she gets out. Lawyers and money for the rest of life.</p>

<p>So it compartmentalized so most people involved have no actual idea what the duck their doing. They move bags, get paid 10k. </p>

<p>Then for the single person that does know, incentives. Life, money, paid judges. </p>

<p>It is CLASSIC CIA. This is how it works. </p>

<p>Even doctors in organ harvesting operations don&#39;t know how the person was murdered. They are just doing their job and getting parts to where they need to go. The people doing the murdering are just told the people are bad. The ones getting the people are told their used for a survey l. Etc on and on and on. It&#39;s just on person with money compartmentalizing everything.</p>
