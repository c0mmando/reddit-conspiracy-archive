<p>Did you forget about the tea partiers who are in the republican party calling congressmen niggers and faggots and spat on them?</p>

Let me make the proper connections for you, SOROS = LIBERAL &amp; DEMOCRAT KOCH = CONSERVATIVE &amp; REPUBLICAN. These are the relevant connections. Soros&#39;s actions have nothing to do with his connections to Obama, and everything to do with him being a D and Trump being an R, which is why Koch would fund pro-Trump marches because they aren&#39;t just pro-trump anymore, they are also pro-republican now. And since Koch has been known to fund these sorts of things in the exact same way Soros does, it&#39;s an easy conclusion that this is Koch funded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disgusting, fascist partisanship. Protesters are not &quot;Soros paid.&quot; At worse, organizations that receive some money from him pay for the travel expenses and signage of protesters. But the will and desire to protest is natural.</p>

<p>Shame on cultists like you, who are unable to tolerate criticism against your current master.</p>

<p>I happen to know many protesters and believe you me, the 3 million people who marched against your master weren&#39;t just &quot;Soros-paid&quot; zombies.</p>

<p>Interesting, Russia used literally the exact same rhetoric to claim EuroMaidan - which involved 100,000s of Ukrainians - was a &quot;Soros-paid&quot; coup.</p>

<p>It seems you Trump cultists have become brainwashed by Russian disinformation. How sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Soros paid&quot; implies they are protesting <em>because they were paid.</em> If even 1% of them got free signage and free transportation by a Soros-funded organization, then how does that discredit them? They
re desire to protest and opinions are just as valid.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, I&#39;m only speaking hypothetically. I doubt most protesters are connected to Soros. Millions of people have marched against Trump <strong>in the biggest protests in American history (and possibly in all of mankind.</strong></p>

<p>Yeah..But Occupy was stamped out. </p>

<p>The entire media is on your side, but we did it guys! By ourselves!</p>

<p>You seriously believe that? Yes I know real protestors, they believe in the cause and spend their own money to support it. I believe they are being used by the establishment, NOT TRUMP but the military industrial complex. There is a reason why they pick the most inflammatory people to represent the movement, because they know it will generate buzz and will only play on the media as more anti-Trump rhetoric.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually genius.</p>

<p>Occupy fizzled away. That wasn&#39;t the fault of authorities.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not even close to the entire media. Regardless, the protests were 100% organic.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The establishment IS Trump and his cronies (DeVos and co). As for the MIC, you should realize that the current administration is the most military-heavy one in history. The government is full of &quot;the generals.&quot;</p>

<p>Step away from using the terms &quot;MIC&quot; and &quot;CIA&quot;, and think: why did stocks for arms manufacturers go through the roof when Trump won? Why is Trump increasing the military budget?</p>

<p>The MIC is very, very happy. Moreover, you should be ashamed of yourself for calling millions of protesters tools for the MIC, without any basis in reality.</p>

<p>Maybe the reason everybody got so fat is becuas they are being fed a steady diet of blue pills and they just basicly gave up on living a prosperous life. Maybe their spirts were cooked up idk?</p>
