<p>Edit: To all the replies saying he didn&#39;t rig the primaries or &quot;he wasn&#39;t in the DNC&quot;, you&#39;re right. But he helped to smear Bernie&#39;s name, he&#39;s friends with Podesta, who actually was the ringleader to help the DNC and media collude against Bernie. He might not have done it personally, but he knows it was done. Therefore, the guy shouldn&#39;t be eligible to be DNC Chairman and he should have his reputation questioned.</p>

The primaries are a privately held election run by each private party ( all political parties in the US are private not public). No party by law is required to even have a primary vote and the primaries did not come into existence until 1973.   No party is required to run the person that wins their parties primary.  basically each party is in full control of who runs under their party name. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t believe more Democrats aren&#39;t pissed off about this. You know why the GOP controls all levels? The DNC took money away from state parties to prop up Clinton. Senate and House races were forced to turn over everything including &quot;coffee money&quot;; local races practically had to pay like CutCo. Anyone that doesn&#39;t think the DNCs decade long slide into irrelevance isn&#39;t systemic. The DNC is still campaigning on Obamas 2008 speech in Denver like the Eagles are touring on their first album. And it resonates with the same number of people. Pathetic. </p>

<p>It is a tactic the Trump crowd has been using during the whole election to try and divide the democrats.  Before the general they were pushing the whole &quot;  I supported Bernie but voted for Trump narrative&quot;  to try and lead Bernie supports to Trump.  Now they are trying to get this anti-Perez narrative to continue to divide the democrats.  It is really amusing to me because anyone that knows a little bit about political parties knows that the chair of the DNC or any party for that matter does not really matter and position has very limited power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an old right wing tactic. Watch interviews with tea party protesters and you&#39;ll keep hearing this claim that they were all loyal Democrats until this Obama guy, when they grew concerned and left.</p>

<p>Conversation is just a game to the kind of person who says this. The outcome of whatever you&#39;re discussing is sorta meaningless as long as they win. So lying about their political persuasion gains them a few extra points and maybe even red pills a naive noob or two along the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are all true things. </p>

<p>Tea party people were populated by Democrats who became disillusioned with the direction of their party. </p>

<p>Bernie supporters <em>did</em> support Trump in larger numbers than they did HRC. Many were, and still are, pissed off that their dude literally got cheated.</p>

<p>People who <em>never</em> supported Trump are now leaning that way as they look around at the splintered remains of their political vehicle.</p>

<p>You guys are going to keep the blinders on, and be totally irrelevant by 2019. It&#39;s really happening. You guys are leaking support to third party and also to the revamped right. You have to understand this or your party will go the way of the dinosaurs.</p>

<p>The rules governing national elections are set by the law of the land.  Violating these rules is illegal and a fundamentally different magnitude of problem than anything related to the primaries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>all of those are fair points until they break their own rules. Then your argument goes out the window.

    <div class="md"><p>So?  It is a private organization.  You are welcome to debate the prudence of their actions but the DNC leadership is under no legal obligation regarding how they run an internal contest.  Democratic leaning voters may punish them in the general election but not showing up but they have not violated any laws.</p>

<p>Actions taken during the general election can violate the law of the land and are a much more serious accusation.</p>

<p>It is a false equivalent to try to compare the two.  It would be like killing someone because they cheaped at Monopoly then trying to justify the killing because of the actions of the victim.  </p>

<p>the trump hysteria had herded a sizeable number of them back into the blue tent, but perez&#39;s election might just be the thing that finally liberates the left from the democratic party for good.</p>

<p>hopefully, they&#39;ll wise up and join us on the left that already left the dems for good. </p>

<p>i can&#39;t speak abour any other party, but the DNC party chair is a big deal to the progressive wing of the dem party. </p>

<p>i&#39;m sick of having to disclaim, so at this point i couldn&#39;t give a fuck who anyone thinks i voted for. </p>
