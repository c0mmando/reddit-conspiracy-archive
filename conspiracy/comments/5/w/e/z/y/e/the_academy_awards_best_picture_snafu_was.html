<p>Did you forget about the Janet Jackson super bowl wardrobe malfunction?</p>

<p>This was a cheap publicity stunt for an awards show with failing ratings that get worse every year.</p>

<p>They are hoping it goes viral, becomes a meme and people tune in next year with the idea that &quot;anything can happen in the Oscars!&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah I know that.</p>

<p>The Oscars are a different story. People aren&#39;t watching them. The ratings have been in freefall mode for the past decade. They are desperate and to continue the football analogy, they threw a hail mary with the publicity stunt at the end.</p>

<p>It obviously worked.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to get a degree in &quot;viral marketing&quot;. If I had a degree in &quot;Viral Marketing&quot; would you even take it seriously?  </p>

<p>Yes. I am well versed in this history of PR and marketing, as well as current marketing trends. I was previously working in the field of marketing but left a year ago for a new industry and have not looked back since :)</p>

<p>The book Brandwashed is good if you are interested in learning more about marketing, it&#39;s actually a very interesting field.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like viral marketing (anymore) has leaked into the field of actual marketing. Just like web content generation has leaked into the field of journalism, in which I hold my degree. It&#39;s inevitable with the changing times.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just enthralled at all this discourse about the awards show last night. Specifically on this thread, I haven&#39;t watched any other coverage except for a clip of the actual event itself. It seems more like a PR nightmare than a benefit. All the hate would seem to eclipse any good this debacle created. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ARG elements are massive and widespread, and lightly strung together so that if you try telling someone about it you&#39;ll sound nuts*. They&#39;re spread throughout the last couple decades of Hollywood but also international media connected to LA, including video games and music (this is the explanation for all the illuminati symbols in music videos--there&#39;s many more layers to it than that, though).</p>

<hr/>

<p>*(for example, in Star Wars, I can tell you that it&#39;s important that C-3PO now has a red arm, and a stormtrooper gets a bloody &quot;3&quot; on his helmet, but it wouldn&#39;t make sense to tell you why yet. Ben Swann posting a rebel alliance symbol before he disappeared is not a coincidence.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>As for a starting point, here&#39;s one: Tom Cruise isn&#39;t real and his entire career is constructed, with clues strewn throughout. He&#39;s actually a character played by Jim Carrey. Research this for yourself--they&#39;re facially identical down to laugh lines and ear anatomy, with the only difference being teeth (but &quot;both&quot; wear false dental fronts). There are references to this everywhere in Cruise/Carrey movies, from the first few lines of The Mask to the latest Dumb and Dumber movie, in which Carrey plays multiple characters and at one point even wears the dress uniform from Top Gun. This is the real reason Cruise is never in public, and why he claims to have prosopagnosia (face blindness!).</p>

<p>This is referred to as the Ruse Cruise--look into that term.</p>

Humphrey Bogart wore platform shoes in Casablanca. The hobbits in LOTR weren&#39;t really hobbits. The Carrey/Cruise height thing? It&#39;s directly referenced in the intro to Austin Powers 3:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFhrc32kF6E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFhrc32kF6E</a></p>

<p>Perform a facial match analysis yourself. For those who are unaware: ear structures are like fingerprints, which is why you must show your ears on passport photos. Tom Cruise and Jim Carrey don&#39;t just happen to coincidentally have identical ears in addition to identical bone structure, eyes, noses and facial lines. </p>

<p>If I post more details I&#39;m not going to waste time disputing them. I invite people to research themselves and come to their own conclusion. <strong>It is a feature of this ARG that people will try to discredit me.</strong> Meaning the more details I reveal, the more I&#39;m exposing myself to people nitpicking details (even if they&#39;re completely wrong), because I&#39;ll get bogged down if it&#39;s me vs a mob of plants.</p>

<p>Either way you&#39;re wrong. I&#39;m not speculating here, I have a concrete basis for talking about this event. </p>

<p>But by design it&#39;s very difficult to communicate this to people, so I&#39;m more interested in people investigating for themselves than I am in debating anybody on reddit, particularly if all they&#39;re offering is incredulity disguised as some sort of objection.</p>

<p>Well lucky for you I did investigate myself ;) Using the above website, I compared many pictures from google of Tom Cruise and Jim Carey and when comparing the two against each other, the system found less than 12% match when comparing the two. However, when comparing different pictures of jim carey to jim carey, I always got positive matches (59%+) and when comparing pictures of tom cruise to tom cruise, I always got positive matches (61%+). So I have to say I am <em>convinced</em> that Tom Carey and Jim Cruise are not the same people (see what I did there)?</p>

<p>But since I&#39;m a plant and I&#39;m just going to discredit you because I&#39;m a feature of this &quot;ARG&quot;, I just have a couple questions. What is an ARG? Are there multiple ARGs? When did you first notice you were in an ARG?</p>

<p>Wow look at this guy transparently teeing up a &quot;you&#39;re schitzophrenic&quot; attack. You&#39;re in the wrong sub.</p>

<p>As for betafaceapi, that system and other low-hanging fruit like it are likely to be compromised--this ARG is massive, with zillions of hollywood bucks behind it (I have a specific basis for thinking so in this case but it&#39;d be an annoying tangent). There are many layers of contingencies and memetic protection, just like there would be if this were a government conspiracy.</p>

<p><strong>That&#39;s the whole point.</strong></p>

<p>If anybody has their own facial recognition setup on their personal systems I encourage you to give that a try, instead of believing this anonymous poster providing an anonymous facial recognition link.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude.. I&#39;ve looked at both their faces from multiple angles for like 15 minutes now. Cruise&#39;s jaw is far more square, and his nose and eyes are much different. Carrey has a flat bridge and flared nostrils, while Cruise has a prominent bridge with more narrow nostrils. They look noticeably different. </p>

<p>Not just that, but your reasoning as to why they would have Carrey play Cruise doesn&#39;t add up. What, they selected him to play two different people? Why the fuck would they do that? What&#39;s <em>one</em> more actor? Don&#39;t they have loads under control?</p>

<p>Having an opposing viewpoint is not the same thing as deliberately discrediting you. If these &quot;details&quot; are all like the Cruise vs. Carrey thing, no wonder you face dissenting opinions on a regular basis...</p>

<p>What I&#39;m talking about isn&#39;t a theory: I&#39;m an entertainment professional and came into this information firsthand. But it just takes someone saying &quot;I don&#39;t see it; you&#39;re crazy&quot; and the conversation is aborted.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve gone a lot further than that though, including full takeover of the mod staff of several subs, CTR-style. It&#39;s a feature. Most ARGs have the organisers helping/hinting players along. Here it&#39;s the opposite: an information supression game.</p>

<p>Believe me or not, we&#39;ll be seeing increasingly weirder coincidences like this Academy Awards thing in coming months. No idea how it&#39;s all meant to end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>woah initialism is actually a word, huh TIL. Ok I googled.</p>

<p>ARG appears to be the ticker symbol for Airgas, Inc. They are a company that sells welding, safety, gas products. Airgas is a company under the umbrella corp - Air Liquide. Their head of investor relations is Aude Rodriguez. Oh I see where you&#39;re going with this, weed-bot, you clever fox.</p>

<p>A quick google search of Aude Rodriguez reveals <a href="https://yt3.ggpht.com/-Xg8nXsqX4ik/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/BgjlGCk2cCY/s900-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg">this image</a>. Aha! A woman with nice <em>features</em>. I get it now! I too am in an ARG, the feature of this ARG is when women with nice features ignore me!</p>

<p>Thanks for showing me the light, weed-bot, I thought I was a fucking loser who never tried to make myself a better person and thats why I was always getting rejected. But now I understand that it&#39;s actually a &quot;feature&quot; of the &quot;ARG&quot; I&#39;m in.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware. You&#39;re acting like the <strong>one single comment</strong> that you&#39;ve seen in this thread is somehow representative, which is illogical. I&#39;m stating my preference and will adhere to it for reasons which I&#39;ve explained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Carrey has a flat bridge and flared nostrils, while Cruise has a prominent bridge with more narrow nostrils. They look noticeably different.</p>

<p>As Cruise he wears a scowl and sets his jaw forward. As Carrey he gurns, smiles and flares his nostrils. These are not facial identifiers, they&#39;re expressions.</p>

<p>Key facial indicators match. I&#39;m not going to lecture on the subject, but try reading up on what is actually involved in matching faces.</p>

<p>Not just that, but your reasoning as to why they would have Carrey play Cruise doesn&#39;t add up. What, they selected him to play two different people? Why the fuck would they do that? What&#39;s one more actor? Don&#39;t they have loads under control?</p>

<p>Again, incredulity dressed up as an objection. You&#39;re saying it &quot;doesn&#39;t add up!&quot; because you don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>However, if you had asked me, I might have been able to shed some light.</p>

<p>I&#39;m bored with oppositional posting, so I&#39;ll just ignore you if you supply demands or insults instead of questions. Again, this is me stating a preference that I intend to adhere to. If there&#39;s anybody who would prefer a conversation however, I&#39;m game. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point is that you can show people evidence and nobody will believe shit that&#39;s right in front of them because everybody has been so thoroughly conditioned by the government. It just takes a tiny bit of ridicule and people drop the subject. However since this is everywhere, it&#39;s connected to basically everyone--when the lid is blown off and people start pulling threads, there&#39;ll be nobody who hasn&#39;t been fooled in some way. <strong>Meaning there&#39;ll be nobody who isn&#39;t left asking themselves what else they&#39;ve been lied to about.</strong></p>

<p>The cruise/carrey thing is like 1% of it, but I thought it might make for a potentially convincing entry point.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re familiar with Operation Snow White, this is an extension of that, on a massive scale and directed at the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I mentioned, this is partly a response from people in entertainment who have been forced to do the dirty work of the US govt in previous decades. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also a way to take the tools that have been used to lie to the public and turn them against that very system--this is why, if you begin digging into this, you&#39;ll see 9/11 references everwhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to reveal my source but it wouldn&#39;t make sense yet.</p>

<p>The Cruise/Carrey thing was a single example since somebody asked for an entry point to the ARG. Apparently I chose poorly (though it seemed apropos for this thread). It&#39;s a tiny fraction of the whole however.</p>

<p>The event is a lot broader than that--we&#39;re talking about hundreds or potentially thousands of entertainment industry people and all of their combined social media outlets. (I&#39;ve heard around 4000 and growing, from about 2000 a year ago, but I don&#39;t necessarily trust that information.) Working together they&#39;ve actually pretty much taken control of the memescape--internet culture which we expect to be manipulated by the government etc is also being manipulated by this ARG--I believe this phase of it kicked into high gear around September 2015.</p>

<p>In contrast to the laughable &quot;bro biden&quot; forced meme bullshit, these people are highly intelligent, keyed into the culture and have access to cutting-edge hollywood technology. They&#39;re affecting not only politics but even the language the internet speaks, and it&#39;s building towards something kinda big, which I also don&#39;t wanna reveal yet (partly because I don&#39;t have the full picture, but mostly because you wouldn&#39;t believe it yet).</p>

<p><strong>Note that I&#39;m not even describing anything that we don&#39;t already expect the entertainment industry to do:</strong> collaborate, produce media and influence culture and politics. But I&#39;m saying they&#39;ve gone a step further, collaborating on a political and not simply a professional level, and have been weaving a giant game into our culture.</p>

<p>That was my take. The wrong announcement was made, and then overturned to recapture the intense wishful thinking that millions of Americans indulged in when Trump was announced as the winner of the election. They were told it couldn&#39;t happen, so were convinced there must have been an error when it did, and believed <strong>it would shortly be overturned</strong>. Millions of them are still hoping.</p>

<p>After watching the clip though I realized how little I care about that world and lifestyle.  I just don&#39;t give a shit about why someone won over someone else and I think the entire industry does very little to better people.

    <div class="md"><p>Nice rant! It is comical watching people lose their shit because of a &quot;mistake&quot; whether its real, staged, or because someone, somewhere, wanted to pull off the Steve Harvey challenge.</p>

<p>Hollywood is alot like politics.  People expect and unfortunately accept that politicians (not all but some) are disengenuous and dirty.  Hollywood is known to be a very evil place with alot of predators. Despite this people still tune in so they can tune out of everything else in their lives.  So the real problems and issues they have with themselves never has to be addressed.   </p>

<p>I do love the actor/activist though but admittedly am a bit frightened by those that listen to them.  Its all a bit comical even though I dont think its meant to be.  </p>
