       It took a minute, so rating could get boosted by people turning it on based off friends or social media buzz. It also helps next year's broadcast interest spike from people wanting to see what happens this year.

       No. People watch the superbowl regardless. I don't think anyone expects the halftime show to have something happen again any more than any dance performance. The oscars seem to get more interest by silly things the hosts do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things like this make the topic trend for a short period. But what kind of logic is it to think people would be like "oh let's tune in to see if they make a mistake" when we'd expect they'd rather do everything they can to make sure it doesn't happen again.

       The Oscars are a different story. People aren't watching them. The ratings have been in freefall mode for the past decade. They are desperate and to continue the football analogy, they threw a hail mary with the publicity stunt at the end.

       Anything can happen with any live event. We expect that a mistake like this won't be repeated again. The possibilities with the hosts are what brings extra viewers in. I don't understand what low level logic people are expected to have that they'd think the Oscars are a special case where crazy things happen because they made an announcement mistake once.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes mistakes happen and they're not a planned psychological tactic. That doesn't really make sense here

       Do you still think that  the Seth McFarlane/Jennifer Lawrence "controversy" wasn't planned either? It later came out that both were in on it. This is Hollywood. Manufacturing PR and fake controversy comes as easily as breathing to these people.

       I feel like viral marketing (anymore) has leaked into the field of actual marketing. Just like web content generation has leaked into the field of journalism, in which I hold my degree. It's inevitable with the changing times.

       I'm just enthralled at all this discourse about the awards show last night. Specifically on this thread, I haven't watched any other coverage except for a clip of the actual event itself. It seems more like a PR nightmare than a benefit. All the hate would seem to eclipse any good this debacle created.

       all PR is good PR. If Lala Land won as expected, no one would be talking about the Oscars right now. It was an extremely effective stunt. Look how much discussion it generated on reddit alone.

       From a larger perspective, there's no possible winner of Best Picture that could produce more division in the U.S. than Moonlight - an independent film about a gay, black man.

       Moonlight is a great film no doubt. But it's not something the Oscars would ever showcase. It's far too art-house for the general public to stomach. If not for last years whole black nominee issue, La La Land would have been a lock. I think it's win was a statement.

       The Artist had well known actors like John Goodman and Malcolm McDowell. The academy loves to rub shoulders with celebrities. That's how you get your movie nominated. Like Manchester by the Sea is pretty art housey, but it has a lot of Hollywood big wigs involved to bribe the academy with their presence. Moonlight has no big celebrities. I doubt Mahershala Ali had the funds to throw the voters a party, which is standard procedure for nominees.

       Get out would qualify for next year's Oscars. It's amazing, but Oscars would never go to a horror flick anyway, the academy deems it "unartistic" with a stick up their ass

       The way I see it Hollywood is bleeding. They have money, wits, power, and fame but I believe they are losing there grips on the sheep that worship them.

       They will in turn do anything to stay relevant. IMHO the last few months have been chaotic for all of us but we must keep fighting to shed light on these truths. The world became a more dangerous place when the media showed themselves for who they really are and what agendas they are trying to push.

       Scripted yes. For publicity, no. Artists who have been subject to government control for decades have organised a massive conspiratorial ARG, with clues like this running throughout a massive network of media.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's designed specifically so that government social condition prevents people from noticing--they can operate in the open and in plain sight because of government-implemented blind spots in the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this conspiracy is partly to expose and mitigate that exact social conditioning, which hollywood has (against their will, largely, thanks to instruments like top spook Jack Valenti being placed in charge of the MPAA in response to public outcry against vietnam) been complicit in implementing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a heap of mindblowing details about this shit but I'll be downvoted and ridiculed by bots/shills (the ARG is a mirror of government tactics--hence the 9/11 references all over it) if I post much more than this. But if you're investigating this, PM me.

       You were supposed to PM me! But I'll post my reply to somebody who did:

        The ARG elements are massive and widespread, and lightly strung together so that if you try telling someone about it you'll sound nuts*. They're spread throughout the last couple decades of Hollywood but also international media connected to LA, including video games and music (this is the explanation for all the illuminati symbols in music videos--there's many more layers to it than that, though).
       </p>
       <hr/>
       <p>
        *(for example, in Star Wars, I can tell you that it's important that C-3PO now has a red arm, and a stormtrooper gets a bloody "3" on his helmet, but it wouldn't make sense to tell you why yet. Ben Swann posting a rebel alliance symbol before he disappeared is not a coincidence.)
       </p>
       <hr/>
       <p>
        As for a starting point, here's one: Tom Cruise isn't real and his entire career is constructed, with clues strewn throughout. He's actually a character played by Jim Carrey. Research this for yourself--they're facially identical down to laugh lines and ear anatomy, with the only difference being teeth (but "both" wear false dental fronts). There are references to this everywhere in Cruise/Carrey movies, from the first few lines of The Mask to the latest Dumb and Dumber movie, in which Carrey plays multiple characters and at one point even wears the dress uniform from Top Gun. This is the real reason Cruise is never in public, and why he claims to have prosopagnosia (face blindness!).
       </p>
       <p>
        This is referred to as the Ruse Cruise--look into that term.

       Jim Carey is reportedly 7 inches taller than tom cruise. How does someone shrink to a different size to pretend to be someone else? And wouldn't it be easier to just find a "Tom Cruise" and propel him to stardom as opposed to having a different actor with an already blooming career play him? This just doesn't even make sense.

       "Reportedly" is the key word there. It isn't true (because they are the same person). Nor is height even a factor in Hollywood. Humphrey Bogart wore platform shoes in Casablanca. The hobbits in LOTR weren't really hobbits. The Carrey/Cruise height thing? It's directly referenced in the intro to Austin Powers 3:

       Perform a facial match analysis yourself. For those who are unaware: ear structures are like fingerprints, which is why you must show your ears on passport photos. Tom Cruise and Jim Carrey don't just happen to coincidentally have identical ears in addition to identical bone structure, eyes, noses and facial lines.

       Well lucky for you I did investigate myself ;) Using the above website, I compared many pictures from google of Tom Cruise and Jim Carey and when comparing the two against each other, the system found less than 12% match when comparing the two. However, when comparing different pictures of jim carey to jim carey, I always got positive matches (59%+) and when comparing pictures of tom cruise to tom cruise, I always got positive matches (61%+). So I have to say I am
       <em>
        convinced
       </em>
       that Tom Carey and Jim Cruise are not the same people (see what I did there)?

       As for betafaceapi, that system and other low-hanging fruit like it are likely to be compromised--this ARG is massive, with zillions of hollywood bucks behind it (I have a specific basis for thinking so in this case but it'd be an annoying tangent). There are many layers of contingencies and memetic protection, just like there would be if this were a government conspiracy.

       Dude.. I've looked at both their faces from multiple angles for like 15 minutes now. Cruise's jaw is far more square, and his nose and eyes are much different. Carrey has a flat bridge and flared nostrils, while Cruise has a prominent bridge with more narrow nostrils. They look noticeably different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not just that, but your reasoning as to why they would have Carrey play Cruise doesn't add up. What, they selected him to play two different people? Why the fuck would they do that? What's
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       more actor? Don't they have loads under control?

       Having an opposing viewpoint is not the same thing as deliberately discrediting you. If these "details" are all like the Cruise vs. Carrey thing, no wonder you face dissenting opinions on a regular basis...

       honestly, this is the problem with discussing conspiracies and why they never gain any mainstream traction. Because you can approach the stage with the evidence that supported pizzagate - emails, symbols and codewords used, connections to known pedophiles, etc. But someone will shout "all the world leaders are lizard people!!!" and suddenly you are lumped in with that looney. And nobody would agree to both of those things so you get dismissed despite having legitimate claims.

       What I'm talking about isn't a theory: I'm an entertainment professional and came into this information firsthand. But it just takes someone saying "I don't see it; you're crazy" and the conversation is aborted.

       They've gone a lot further than that though, including full takeover of the mod staff of several subs, CTR-style. It's a feature. Most ARGs have the organisers helping/hinting players along. Here it's the opposite: an information supression game.

       I tried to ask you nicely, but you started diagnosing yourself with mental illnesses and since there was no way to get you to answer my questions, I had to take a different route. Thank you for answering my question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think you need help. Because Tom Cruise and Jim Carey look nothing alike. Maybe some glasses, you're probably far sighted and didn't even know.

       I'm aware. You're acting like the
       <strong>
        one single comment
       </strong>
       that you've seen in this thread is somehow representative, which is illogical. I'm stating my preference and will adhere to it for reasons which I've explained.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Carrey has a flat bridge and flared nostrils, while Cruise has a prominent bridge with more narrow nostrils. They look noticeably different.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As Cruise he wears a scowl and sets his jaw forward. As Carrey he gurns, smiles and flares his nostrils. These are not facial identifiers, they're expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Key facial indicators match. I'm not going to lecture on the subject, but try reading up on what is actually involved in matching faces.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Not just that, but your reasoning as to why they would have Carrey play Cruise doesn't add up. What, they selected him to play two different people? Why the fuck would they do that? What's one more actor? Don't they have loads under control?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, incredulity dressed up as an objection. You're saying it "doesn't add up!" because you don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if you had asked me, I might have been able to shed some light.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm bored with oppositional posting, so I'll just ignore you if you supply demands or insults instead of questions. Again, this is me stating a preference that I intend to adhere to. If there's anybody who would prefer a conversation however, I'm game.

       From a reply to someone who PM'd me:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The point is that you can show people evidence and nobody will believe shit that's right in front of them because everybody has been so thoroughly conditioned by the government. It just takes a tiny bit of ridicule and people drop the subject. However since this is everywhere, it's connected to basically everyone--when the lid is blown off and people start pulling threads, there'll be nobody who hasn't been fooled in some way.
        <strong>
         Meaning there'll be nobody who isn't left asking themselves what else they've been lied to about.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        The cruise/carrey thing is like 1% of it, but I thought it might make for a potentially convincing entry point.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you're familiar with Operation Snow White, this is an extension of that, on a massive scale and directed at the public.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As I mentioned, this is partly a response from people in entertainment who have been forced to do the dirty work of the US govt in previous decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also a way to take the tools that have been used to lie to the public and turn them against that very system--this is why, if you begin digging into this, you'll see 9/11 references everwhere.

       I'd like to reveal my source but it wouldn't make sense yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Cruise/Carrey thing was a single example since somebody asked for an entry point to the ARG. Apparently I chose poorly (though it seemed apropos for this thread). It's a tiny fraction of the whole however.
      </p>
      <p>
       The event is a lot broader than that--we're talking about hundreds or potentially thousands of entertainment industry people and all of their combined social media outlets. (I've heard around 4000 and growing, from about 2000 a year ago, but I don't necessarily trust that information.) Working together they've actually pretty much taken control of the memescape--internet culture which we expect to be manipulated by the government etc is also being manipulated by this ARG--I believe this phase of it kicked into high gear around September 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast to the laughable "bro biden" forced meme bullshit, these people are highly intelligent, keyed into the culture and have access to cutting-edge hollywood technology. They're affecting not only politics but even the language the internet speaks, and it's building towards something kinda big, which I also don't wanna reveal yet (partly because I don't have the full picture, but mostly because you wouldn't believe it yet).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Note that I'm not even describing anything that we don't already expect the entertainment industry to do:
       </strong>
       collaborate, produce media and influence culture and politics. But I'm saying they've gone a step further, collaborating on a political and not simply a professional level, and have been weaving a giant game into our culture.

       That's not what that term means. And as I said, these people have been forcing memes. The term comes from the Cruise/Carrey thing, but on the internet it has previously referred to something specific. I invite readers to look into its origins. And I'll give you a free dot for connecting it back to Carrey: The Truman Show.

       I think it was intentional and evil.  Firstly this was a divisive message to undermine Trump's victory.  In this "ceremony" the accepted result of voting is demonstrated to be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly there is a worrying racial element here.  Both blacks and whites seem dissatisfied by what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally they are trying to make Oscars newsworthy (even while ratings continue to slip every year).  Let's not forget Hollywood is run by a paedophile ring.  Boycott Hollywood movies.

       That was my take. The wrong announcement was made, and then overturned to recapture the intense wishful thinking that millions of Americans indulged in when Trump was announced as the winner of the election. They were told it couldn't happen, so were convinced there must have been an error when it did, and believed
       <strong>
        it would shortly be overturned
       </strong>
       . Millions of them are still hoping.

       I don't watch this self gratuitous crap of egocentric people wallowing in their own 'brilliance'. Makes me sick. Most of their films are so mainstream and 'hollywoody', they are unwatchable anyway, unless you like big explosions, lots of CGI or sickeningly schmalzig stuff. There are far better films in the independent genre.

       I don't really know where you're drawing this from, the Oscars field this year was one of the most 'indie' in history - Hidden Figures, Fences, Moonlight, Manchester by the Sea - low budget, no CGI, schmaltz or explosions necessary.

       Of course it was staged. They heard the chatter after Steve Harvey goofed up that beauty contest winner and realized the dying Oscars could use the same after show boost in discussion.  Had this not happened, what would there be to talk about from last night? Exactly.

       I watched this with a group of friends last night. What's stupid is that the fake drama wasn't necessary. It just made the show look like an unprofessional joke and gave the country a good (not even that good, kind of awkward/uncomfortable) ha-ha at the silly celebs who got pranked. Yes there'll be social media buzz, but the tackiness will be remembered longer than the ha-ha
      </p>

       I wouldn't watch the Oscars if there wasn't a party at a friends place. Now why would I watch it at all?

       In the clip I watched showed the card that had the winner on it.  It didn't really look like there was a way for the wrong name to be read since the runner ups name wasnt even on the card.

      <p>
       Unless ge was given the wrong one to begin with and they swapped it. I dunno.
      </p>
      <p>
       After watching the clip though I realized how little I care about that world and lifestyle.  I just don't give a shit about why someone won over someone else and I think the entire industry does very little to better people.  Celebrity doesn't make you a good person and it helps delude people into thinking they need to be more like the actors they see on tv.

       Yeah, I didn't watch it, but it sure is funny watching people react to it. To me, the whole thing feels so Marie Antoinette level of disconnect from anything remotely real. An extravaganza of pompous, self-congratulatory people, viciously jerking each other off under the veneer of designer clothes and sparkly shit. Then some of them have the nerve to tell you how to vote and think. It's hilarious.

       Nice rant! It is comical watching people lose their shit because of a "mistake" whether its real, staged, or because someone, somewhere, wanted to pull off the Steve Harvey challenge.

      <p>
       Hollywood is alot like politics.  People expect and unfortunately accept that politicians (not all but some) are disengenuous and dirty.  Hollywood is known to be a very evil place with alot of predators. Despite this people still tune in so they can tune out of everything else in their lives.  So the real problems and issues they have with themselves never has to be addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do love the actor/activist though but admittedly am a bit frightened by those that listen to them.  Its all a bit comical even though I dont think its meant to be.

       You're falling into the presidential trap. Thinking too small, stop obsessing over Trump and understand there are many other people in office that want things done. That gets things done for them and their constituents. More and more Trump is becoming the political fall guy for unpopular policies.

       Well the news cycle on this Oscars gaffe is about 1 day max, so Trump is running out of time to do something unfavorable before the news cycle shifts.

       Because the legislative branch can't pass a law in one day, so when you're talking about the government doing shady shit, that leaves only the executive branch to do something sketchy during this Oscars news cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're talking about intelligence agencies or the military or something, I wouldn't really call that the government. But if that's the case, I get what you're trying to say.

       That's fine with me.

       Either way you're wrong. I'm not speculating here, I have a concrete basis for talking about this event.
      </p>
      <p>
       But by design it's very difficult to communicate this to people, so I'm more interested in people investigating for themselves than I am in debating anybody on reddit, particularly if all they're offering is incredulity disguised as some sort of objection.
