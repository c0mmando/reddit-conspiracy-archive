       If they do, which assuming they have extensive education they should, they have it buried deep under a mountain of materialistic greed and have decided that monetary mortality is more of a priority than human lives and our home. 
The thing is, that kind of inert wholesomeness does not mix well with old money/ a lot of money. One concept will win in the end and for them it is the latter.

       No, they think the meaning of life is money, the pursuit of money, getting more money than King Midas could dream of, doing anything up to and including launching world wars for a bigger number in their balance sheet. Money is an imaginary resource invented by human beings to enslave human beings.

       No - i dont believe that they know; and i dont believe they care to know either.  I think they are more afraid of death than we are, so they cling to life and earthly things like theres no tomorrow - sell their souls to illegally steal organs and try to buy themselves an extra 20 years here and there

       They know certain occult methodologies that have been existence for at least 6000 years.  These secret methodologies concern the control of the physical realm of existence.

       However, in applying them, one is cut off from the true Source.

       That everything is One and we are all interconnected energetically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything, at its most basic level, is energy. We know that below molecules exist atoms, below atoms exist subatomic particles, and so on until we reach the point where everything is made up of quanta that exist simultaneously as both a wave and a particle. This is called "Wave-Particle Duality."
      </p>
      <p>
       What this means is that what we perceive as the future doesn't exist until it's perceived. Another way of saying this is that the future is always uncertain. The only thing that makes the future certain is the special gift of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we observe or measure something, it moves from a wave into a particle. This means our consciousness affects, to some degree, what's going to happen in the future. It also means that what we perceive or expect is more likely to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because everything is made of up energy, and energy essentially exists in waves, we, as humans, at our most basic level, are constantly vibrating (or, more accurately, oscillating, for you fancy science people).
      </p>
      <p>
       Our thoughts are also energy. This is something that's not taught in school. They vibrate at different frequencies. Love, compassion, and gratitude are some of the highest vibrations, while fear, anger, and powerlessness are some of the lowest.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we think takes form because as we continually expect something to happen and we continually perceive it, it will eventually manifest. We can all relate to the Tuesday morning where we stub our toe, spill our coffee, and say "guess it's gonna be one of those terrible days." Then it happens, and we're left thinking "man, did I call it or what??" This is how the universe works in a nutshell.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the elite know is exactly this: people's perceptions create their reality. And when a bunch of people are expecting something to happen, it becomes more likely to happen because we all are co-creators in this shared universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite also know that we have just moved into an incredible time in human history and our consciousness will be evolving rapidly at a pace not seen for 13,000 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is bad for them, because they have been keeping humanity locked in lower vibrations for millennia. So what they're doing now is fostering these low vibrations through things like the media in order to "divide and conquer," keeping themselves in control and in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of 2012, a great awakening is happening right in front of us (and within us) with the advent of the Internet and a pseudo-collective consciousness, and the information above is being spread at (en)lightning speeds (hah). This is terrifying to the elite because it means they'll soon be exposed for what they've been doing, and their power will be taken from them while humanity enters into a golden age of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know yourself is going to be the next #hot phrase because what and who we truly are has been hidden from us for a really long time.

       Sure! When Max Planck and other early quantum physicists were doing their work on measuring quantum phenomena, they all independently came to the conclusion that nothing can be measured without reference to an observer, or consciousness. It means that our experience is created by what we perceive through our lens of 3-dimensional consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conscious observation 'freezes' the wave, making it into a particle at a specific point in time. The uncertain future is always unfolding in front of us, meaning we're constantly creating our reality all the time. This is what people have meant when they said "there is only the present moment."

       Like a radio, we receive whatever frequency we're tuned to. Some frequencies have crappy music (Nickelback) and some have great music (Childish Gambino). Because we vibrate at certain frequencies, we will call to us experiences that match the frequency to which we're tuned.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone is vibrating at a frequency of fear, they'll tend to attract situations that reproduce that same fear vibration, because the universe sees that as the station the person wants to be tuned into. So they'll be presented with fearful situation after fearful situation, like debt or romantic failure or emotional abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, someone that's tuned into the frequency of, say, gratitude will be given by the universe more experiences they can be grateful for, like meaningful sex or finding a fulfilling passion.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're continuously thinking about and what beliefs about yourself and the universe you hold will be what shows up again and again in your life. The way to break that chain of repetition is to think new thoughts to rewire your brain and the frequency you're sending out.

       Yeah, that's a good point. The collective is always going to be stronger because of how many people are envisioning what's going to happen in the future. Take 9/11, for example. Millions of people witnessed an 'act of terror' and called for retaliation and war. This became the collective emotion driving what was going to be created (for-profit war). Because the momentum of the collective thought was on one side, it manifested in reality and people were empowered to act on the 'will of the people.'
      </p>
      <p>
       In this way, as long as people are easily swayed by things like the media, the people on top can enact their will, even if a minority wants something different. The collective power of human consciousness shouldn't be underestimated.

       We're all made of energy. We get our energy from light emitted from the sun (this is why many early religions are sun-focused). In 2012, our solar system hit a critical point where we are moving towards the galactic center (and receiving more light) at a very fast rate of speed. The Hindus call it the 'Kali Yuga.' It's part of a cycle called the procession of the equinox, where a full cycle takes about 26,500 years and we move through all 12 of the zodiac signs. So when we get that extra light, we are affected and become more conscious. It's a cool time to be alive.

       I wouldn't have believed it myself, but I've seen beings from other dimensions with my own eyes, seen ships in the sky on multiple locations that couldn't exist with our released technology. Plus I've experience telepathic communication myself, and been able to see auras so I know all the officially released documents I've read are also true.

       Oh shit whats up....! You are intelligent. Not sure but I think we found another one of us right here. See the questions you are asking show that you feel something is wrong. the world, the system, the people, something is just fucking wrong. Sometimes laughable the shit is so wrong. So welcome to the other side. Reality will never seem the same from now on... but its important to remember that the best weapon you have to against all the bullshit is to be positive. Even if shit fucking sucks you have to make yourself smile. Laugh at it all and go do something cool, or nice, or compassionate. You dont have to end world hunger. Just hold that door for a person a little farther behind you. Then when they try to hurry up tell them not to. Tell them your not in a hurry and have a good day. Its little shit. Some will do big things. You may do big things. But if not dont ; dont stress it. Just be cool, compassionate and smoke DMT

       No way! We've all got the power to change our own lives. It starts with us, each of us individually. When we feel the fire that's inside each of us and seek to express it, we become catalysts for change more powerful than any news station. Look inside yourself and you'll find what I'm talking about.

       They don't know the true meaning of life, no one does, it's all speculative.  We can observe the parameters under which we live/survive though and try to make the best of it - this is probably to closest you will come to a true philosophy under which the 'elite' live.
