        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So basically if everything below sounds ridiculous to you then just skip it for others here is the point.</p>

<p>As we all are affected by law of reason and outcome which is called Karma in one way or Dharma, which is basically a law transmitted to this reality by Saturn/Kronos. He is the one who gets the harvest and we are the ones who plant the seeds.</p>

<p>Christ cross is basically a cube which is lying on sides which basically represents an escape out of 3 dimensional cube, which represents escape out of this reality.</p>

<p>Now the Christ phrase to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; probably means not an attempt to be weak or love your enemies(even though love is basically a mechanism of escaping Saturn karma ) it means that you have to nullify your karma.</p>

<p>If someone beats your cheek it is probably an karma/dharma outcome of the seed you have planted some time ago or maybe even several lives ago and if you respond you continue the chain by creating another &quot;reason&quot;, planting another seed for Saturn/Satan harvest inside this material prison.</p>

<p>Everything in this reality goes in cycles/circles so if you continue to respond you will turn the wheel on and on again. This basically represents Ouroboros.</p>

<p>All the material world around you + archons + everything else wants you to plant the seeds for Saturn Karma so you will be reborn more and more times. All the negative emotions you feel, all the aggression, these are all mechanisms which force you to respond all the time. </p>

<p>You have to stop responding and planting seeds, I don&#39;t know how much time exactly it would take to completely nullify your karma, maybe even several more lives, but you have to lessen or completely stop planting seeds so there won&#39;t be any harvest.</p>

<p>If you reach the point when you have no debt for this world and no harvest left for Saturn you should be able to escape this world by universal law of how this material world works. </p>

<p>The Christ life itself btw was overwhelmingly full of happenings which wanted him to respond and react to material but he allowed everything material to happen and simply escaped the karma law of rebirth because he had no debt and in result was not affected by this plane.</p>

<p>All of this is just a thought. For some of you which has at least some understanding this may be interesting. For other ones, simply skip this.</p>
