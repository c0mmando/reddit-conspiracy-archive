       I'm very curious about this. Much respect to all of you on this sub, but particularly to the guys who have been preaching this stuff for decades upon decades and were laughed at. How long have some of you been into this stuff? Im interested in hearing your experience, how you first delved into this information, how you feel about finally being validated  after all these years of being called insane, as many of the things we said years ago, are finally coming true.

       This community and the people that frequent it, are the kind of people that stand up to government corruption, and spread ideas to defeat globalism. Do you not consider that a social force? Are the things conspiracy theorists have been saying, turning out to be true? Seems like it. Even the term conspiracy theorist has lost its value as condescending word, "fake news" is the new jargon word.

       I figured this was pretty obvious. Especially to anyone who frequents this sub, as you supposedly do. What's with the hostility dawg?

       Otherwise, they've watched over the years as 99% of their predictions have been proven wrong, again and again, time after time (ask somebody like Nancy Lieder or any of those stupid Nibiru doofuses who swore up and down the world would end in the 80s, then the 90s, then 2003, then 2012, then 2016).

       Personally, it happened for me when I read "none dare call it conspiracy". Cant remember the name of the author for some reason. But this was in the 90's. I am definitely seeing an awakening occur. It turns out, we were right about JFK, 9/11, the sex trafficking scandal, and so many other things. The Internet has allowed old salts like myself to see the progression happen. It's slow, and incremental, but it's happening. I'm not as old as some of the other guys.

       I suggest you check out Bill Cooper's series
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahSZV56ywqk">
        The Lost Light
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It barely even scratches the surface, but is WAY deeper than has permeated into the general consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-wSzD_jWFI">
        try this out
       </a>
       and see what you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have consumed all that, I recommend you look up the archaeological history of earthquakes in the first century AD.  What you should at that point realize is that, contrary to the second link I have provided you, the events of the new testament in the bible actually happened around 0-33 AD, not around 70 AD.  But the presenter isn't wrong for the most part - he just doesn't realize there were two real guys instead of one.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if Rome was covering up for the second, who was covering up the first with the second and why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you start getting a good grapple on that question, you are well on your way.

       You say these resources only scratch the surface. I don't necessarily need to know every historical permutation, but as one travels deeper down this rabbit hole, does one begin exploring higher and higher spiritual Realities?

       This is basically making an argument from the symbolism, that there are occult meanings to the Bible. That is true no doubt, but the question is whose occult knowledge? The Bible references its own mystery, distinct from that of the mystery schools:
      </p>
      <p>
       "We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. No, we declare God’s wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory." (2 Corinthians 2:6)
      </p>
      <p>
       You should look at the manuscript evidence relating to the New Testament. There's a lot of Dan Brown/Jesuit deception in this area.
      </p>
      <p>
       The New Testament has a mountain of support: early, extant manuscripts, early quotations and references confirming the existence and scope of the canon, hostile references to Jesus confirming several important facts, etc.  Hell, we can reconstitute 98% of the text just from the quotations of the New Testament in other documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in spite of this, we have almost no disagreement between the copies. The woman caught in adultery in John 7-8, and the end of Mark's gospel are the only major question marks. And most scholars believe these are authentic, just not perhaps in those gospels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most important, most of the disciples were tortured to death, and refused to recant an exoteric understanding of Christianity. Not many would die from a known lie like this.

       I agree that the church is almost completely infiltrated TODAY. And this has been the case for most of its history. But the text itself is much more sound than even most "woke" people realize. The scandal is in the false interpretations.

       Let me give you some more to chew on, because this is a real mind fuck, and you sound like an esoteric Christian.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is clear that there was mystery knowledge from ancient times, perhaps before the flood (i.e. Julian Jayne's consciousness). The Bible acknowledges this: Job is righteous, but there is no evidence of connection with Abraham; we're not even sure when/where he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also Melchizedek, priest of God Most High. He already worships the one true God when he meets Abraham, and Abraham gives him a tithe (see the Book of Hebrews), because he is God's priest at the time, based only on philosophy/general revelation (Romans 1-2), and his knowledge of the antediluvian mysteries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the mysteries become corrupted over time. Solomon's friend Hiram, King of Tyre is murdered (recreated in the masonic ritual) and Jezebel takes over. The mysteries eventually become Mystery Babylon (Revelation 17:5) because they are so thoroughly corrupted (Rome, freemasonry after 3000 BC or so, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible AND the ancient, uncorrupted mystery schools generally predicted a Messiah figure who would descend from heaven and rule as king. They also knew there would be a dying God (Isaiah's suffering servant, Persephone, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       What was never clear from either the Old Testament or the uncorrupted mysteries is that the dying God and the Messiah are the same person. And that dying God would die first, having committed no crime, murdered by the followers of the corrupted mystery schools (thus completely refuting all of their/Satan's arguments), then return a second time as the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, the reconciliation of esoteric and exoteric Christianity. Jesus really did die for sins, the uncorrupted mystery schools are true, and Mystery Babylon/Satan is proven, for all time, to be false.

       In the known history of mankind there have been two major revolutions against freemasonry.  The first I covered a bit above, but let me go over the second for you because the methods, motivations, and such are very similar and you will be familiar with the details of the second.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the topic is the American revolutionary war.  It is often said in conspiracy media and such that this was a fraud perpetrated on the masses by mystery babylon.  Freemasons will boast about their role in the revolution and offer that as evidence that they are not such bad people, or that they give people the chance to be free who then squandered and therefore need / deserved to be ruled.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, nothing could be further from the truth.  The revolutionary war was an event where Christians infiltrated the freemasonic cabal in order to turn it against itself and make the revolution possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read a book like How the Nation Was Won by Lowry you'll find a mountain of evidence about how a very few families labored intensely to create the conditions that would allow the war to be successfully prosecuted.  They retreated to the distant frontier to set up iron foundries that would fuel the war effort decades later.  They were set upon over and over again by the crown, the secret societies, and literally did their work in hiding - out in the Appalachian hills, locations and purposes concealed, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the conditions were ripe for revolution, a psy-op was conducted against freemasonry that you now know as the "Illuminati."  The idea was simple: because freemasons operate under cloak and dagger, deception, and disinformation campaigns, you can insert one of your own into the order.  So the psy-op was created as such: the freemasonic society is going to create a "fake" freedom for the masses in order to quell their growing rebellious nature, that the American revolution can be allowed to succeed because it is part of a larger plot towards tyranny.  Furthermore, because freemasons are sworn to protect the lives of other freemasons, by inducting much of the revolutionary officer corp into the society you give them protection against assassination (temporarily, until the psy-op is unraveled) and allow the revolution to have a chance to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can tell that is actually what happened because leaders of the revolution were killed later on.  George Washington was murdered by his doctor.  His kin, Meriwether Lewis (Martha Washington's family, which was the primary source of wealth that funded the revolution) was also assassinated and clearly by what we now know as Skull &amp; Bones (they took part of his skull as a trophy).  These sorts of mopping up operations by the masonic cabal in the aftermath of the revolution show you that they realized they had been had by subversion within the ranks and were set out to kill those who had played tricks on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can start to elucidate much about the characters involved in the revolution from that starting point.  For example, Thomas Jefferson publicly shilled for the "nothing amiss here" version of Meriwether Lewis's death and proclaimed it a suicide.  This, despite the unassailable forensic evidence to the contrary which was known to him: a large chunk of your skull cannot walk away from the scene of its own volition.
      </p>
      <p>
       As time passes, the masonic cabal starts to shill publicly that the revolution was their idea all along.  They promote the "illuminati" as a real society that is taking over the world (to this day) when in fact it was never more than a psy-op meant to make the revolution possible.  So not only can you identify traitors like Thomas Jefferson through this information, you know that controlled opposition media that goes on and on about the "illuminati" are just freemasonic fronts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, faced with a real revolution, the cabal is forced into a big coverup operation lest others get wind of the idea of challenging them.  Many more would put to death at the hands of the cabal like the whistleblower Captain William Morgan and those who supported the anti-Masonic party in the wake of an assassination spree by the cabal against Americans in the early 19th century, endorsed by a president (Jefferson).
      </p>
      <p>
       After the life of Jesus, very similar things happened.  The freemasons create an alternative story, go on a murdering spree against the original revolutionaries, and seek to co-opt everything to their own purposes.  Rumors abound in conspiracy circles about the original Jesus being a Rothschild plant way back in the day, because this is what they always do: destroy the idea that you can fight, that you can do right, and suck the hope out of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is abundant hard, objective scientific evidence against their narrative even for the irreligious though like the fact that an Earthquake really did happen when Jesus was put upon the cross.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sort of thing they hate the most, because the most carefully concealed secret in freemasonry (by the top of the food chain from their foot soldiers) is that God is real and they will fail.

       He was real, his message was the best ever delivered, he was divinely inspired, God is great, and the holy spirit will move through anyone who lets it, and everything you really need to know is still there in the Bible even if it isn't obvious the first time you read it.

       I plan to give it a go and read it. I've just always brushed it off, knowing that it has been altered and isn't in its pure form. I think now that I have 'awakened', I'll have a better shot at deciphering what's real and what's not.

        I can easily accept that Simon Magus

       was the one who established the "Christian" church in Rome as Nimrod's Mystery Babylon in christian-garb, i.e. Catholicism. What takes a greater leap for me is concluding that Saul/Paul either worked in collaboration with Simon Magus or that they were one in the same.

       Both do seek claim to the title of "apostle" under dubious circumstances.

       Jesus was a King, born of the highest bloodlines of Rome and Persia,
His mother was a rather brazen woman who put her face on the coinage which angered many.
She was driven out and took hundreds of courtiers and half the treasury with her.
After travelling to Edessa and using the money to build a city state,
Her son became King Esus of Edessa.
At the time, the seat of Emperor was more or less won by whomsoever could command the most wealth, political support and armed forces,
King Esus was one of a number of contenders and thus started a revolution,
However, this conflict got him crucified as Emperor Vespasian eventually won the conflict.
With the revolution over, word of rebellion spreading throughout the empire had to be stopped as soon as possible, so the King, was crucified.
After 3 days on the cross, Rome's official Jewish historian Josephus Flavius, ordered him to be taken down and given medical attention which saved his life.
Flavius then proceeded to rewrite the history for Rome's sake.
After all, the story of King Esus Manu, The One King, Warrior, Revolutionary &amp; rightful ruler of the Kingdoms of Edessa, Persia &amp; the Empire of Rome...
Was a bit too inspirational a story for Jews who'd just been kicked out of Israel and scattered across Europa &amp; the barbarian hordes Rome had waiting at the gates.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead, Flavius changed the history, rewrote many gospels and made Esus into Jesus, a pauper pacifist friendly to Rome who would sooner "render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's" and "Turn the other cheek" in order to pacify the masses rather than lead a revolt.
And it worked!
Many disparate Christian factions fell in line behind Rome and the myth is still widely believed to this day.

       I don't know what to think either. u/closedsociety404 didn't say that "King Esus and Jesus of Nazareth are both real and distinct persons", he only remarked in rather cryptic way "see what you think." Per Ellis, they were both Nazarene.

       Ralph Ellis seems to say that the events happened in AD 60-70, not AD 30, ad if so, we may have a problem with the earthquakes.

       I found that HLI-comment curious when I first read it. The cognitive dissonance lead to to wonder if he meant it esoterically, as in the Egyptian sun-worshiping sense of "the East" being the place from which the spirit proceeds.

       Are we being validated? It's an interesting idea. There's no doubt, looking at recent events in Britain and the US, that our supposedly democratic political system is increasingly operating under Moscow Rules, as it were. I think people will be increasingly open to the utility of conspiratological worldviews. However...this will be for different reasons, and some of those reasons should give us pause.
      </p>
      <p>
       An intelligent, informed parapolitical worldview can be very useful to navigate during the low dishonest decade or so we seem to be in for. But an uninformed, knee-jerk, shallow conspiratological worldview, what I call the 'conspiratoid' view, which is hyper-partisan, lacking in nuance, and falls into the classic error of assuming only one omnipotent, omnimalevolent conspiracy, is not useful for anything good for humanity - it's only good for pulling the wool over peoples' eyes, spreading confusion, advancing propaganda and most likely serving as 'chatter' to mask the genuine machinations behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       One good thing which could come out of the present ructions is an increase in people taking the former view, but what I see more and more instead is people engaging in mutual pearl-clutching over the same obvious disinformation in an endless circle-jerk, and shrieking 'SHILL!' at anyone who suggests something which doesn't fit with the rules of their little safe space echo chamber. If those people become the public face of parapolitical thinking then we can kiss any chance of being taken seriously goodbye, frankly.

       Nuance is the key. So many times people want to put things into a binary decision tree. Is this true or not? Do you believe this or not? Do you like this or not? Real world isnt like this. I don't "believe" anything. I think bits and pieces of lots of things are close.

       My  hope is that we can change societies trajectory in terms of where we are headed overall in  the future by, say  even just .002 degrees away from the heading we were  on towards our civilization's destruction through greed, psychopathic leadership and banking.
      </p>

       As the future unfolds, any small  change in the right direction will extend and increase and  we'll end up far better off
 because of it.

       Agreed, but just as a heads up, "underground" doesn't even really exist in rap anymore. It's pretty much "internet" rappers or "radio" and a bunch of bouncing back and forth.

       As for punk, I mean, as far as any mainstream appeal, punk is dead. However, I know some crust punks in OH that would swear up and down punk is on the upswing.

       I woke 20 years ago and embarked on a wild zealous mission to wake everyone around me. Back then people got afraid of me.

       Well, I took this stuff public. Held documentary film nights in my city, built a website etc. The main fear people had/have with associating with me is the belief that I am under surveillance by nefarious organisations for being so outspoken. I live in a small country. They are correct in believing that. They fear they will be looked at by the same nefarious organisations for associating with me to closely. They are probably correct on that as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this because people have directly said that to me. They agree with most of the stuff I put out there, they also express their approval of what I do, they just don't want to be outwardly seen as involved for their own safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from that I am a douche sometimes.

       Any feelings of validation are eclipsed by the fact that everything is, in fact, going to hell as predicted.

       One upside is that I've got a decades old understanding, and a plan, and there may be enough people soon to do something about it.

       If conspiracies where taken seriously they would be main stream. Also you say finally coming true, what's finally coming true? What was validated? I honestly don't understand this post in any way. And not all conspiracies are the same and connected you talk as if we all believe the same things which is far from being true.
