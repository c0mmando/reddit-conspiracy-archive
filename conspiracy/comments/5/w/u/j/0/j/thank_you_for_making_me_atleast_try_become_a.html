       I have noticed that the further the rabbit hole you go, the more you realize that the world needs more love and positivism to be spread around it. It's a dark path to learn about the dark occultists ruling us for decades with suppressed technology and dark spirituality,  but the Light at the "end" of the road is worth it. I think. If you have good intentions good things will happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just ordered a batch of books I feel will change my life. I'm gonna keep it to myself until I feel I have enough knowledge to spread it around me. Because I have a feeling the truth is catching up, and the more you know  the more you can help People around you to start understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       The negativity in my life has always been present, and I struggle with it every day. I am just glad I have become aware of it so I can change it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tldr:
I love this sub!

       I don't know.  The more I go down the rabbit hole, the more I want to kill myself.  I've hung in there for 29 years, but I don't know if I want to live past age 50.  A bullet through the head seems like the best option at times.

       Nope! Not while you know better. There are others still stuck in the dark, you can help them now, were all fucked, but fucked much less together. You're woke?...then you know there are dates worse than death. Don't waste this life, make it worth something

       Fucking right. Been waiting for someone else to say it. I have been there man. Im close to your age. I was only able to change I when I stopped internalizing. I mean I had to stop putting my energy into why "Me" and I started to volunteer. Habitat for humanity, read at old folks homes and shit like that. It was not always a good time but it made me feel better. Specially the old folks. Knowing what kind of world they lived through and still smile made me realize I was being a little bitch. Fuck the negativity, fuck the darkness. We're unbeatable!

       This! I used to be an EMT &amp; would love going to the nursing homes (despite the smells and general dismay...) because those old folks would light up when you spoke to them &amp; were kind to them. I loved being a ( most likely sole,) light in their dark day. 
Take the time to treat a senior citizen with some kindness today if you can, you're breaking cycles of strife as you do so.
Only thing I disagree with is that we're unbeatable, only the struggle is real, we stick together or we're very beatable

       Its really shitty to realize that suffering is inescapable, but why will you suffer?
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember this :
      </p>
      <p>
       "so we do not lose heart. Though our outer-self is being wasted away, our inner self is being renewed day by day, for this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are
       <em>
        eternal
       </em>
