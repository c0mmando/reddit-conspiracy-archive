       I wondered if he deleted his stuff to get the 'Ben Swann' attention.  Everyone's been riding Seaman because he wasn't to their standards.  I found it extreme and weird, but apparently everyone wants private journalists to be something more than he is.

       Some people won't forgive anything. I understand that people might not want to forgive the elite because of the massive amounts of destruction they caused but they made a huge deal on Seaman's error in saying that people will be arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know a lot of people don't care but some people are seriously unforgiving. They want him crucified as if that is going to help our cause.

       That man has done more than most people on this board. He risked life and limb and instead of thanking him, people are abandoning him while the elite terrorizes him. This isn't helping anyone except the elite.

       Yeah, they had some serious paid shilling working against him.  I wondered if he found something or what, but maybe he is just done with it.  I know I'd consider it if I was him.

       You're right, it's so aggressive and unforgiving. All we had to do was quietly distance ourselves from him, that's all. No need to go all ape shit on him. The guy was one of the earliest researchers and promoters who covered the topic, I have respect for that.

       By propping up gatekeepers like Seaman who spread disinfo, we are discrediting the whole movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the timing of the
       <a href="http://archive.is/0nhNy">
        Buzzfeed article
       </a>
       and [Goldmoney attack video]
      </p>
      <p>
       This is occurred less than two weeks after Seaman participated in the spread of the obvious
       <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagateshills/1650596">
        "The kid says Podesta" WorldCorp video disinfo
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They wanted to get one more round of pizzagate disinfo out of their gatekeeper before blowing him up to solidify the idea that "pizzagate is fake news".

       I think by attacking and drawing all this negative criticism and attention toward him for being untruthful, we inadvertently associate ourselves with him by doing do, and THAT discredits him.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we needed to do, was simply and quietly distance ourselves from him, and watch how it unfolded. Now we're seeing all his shit get deleted? It does seem a bit weird in the context of what we saw with other journalists like Ben Swann.

       Funny isn't it? Seaman removed all his videos (low quality nonsense but still paid for by his Patreons), his personal Twitter account (the official one is still up), but leaves Patreon up.
