        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>Please check my older threads for information from end of November 2016 onward.. I have run out of characters because there is just so much shit going on.</p>

<p>I will continue to post until I feel there is a change of &quot;pace,&quot; and everything slows down... but I don&#39;t feel like that&#39;s going to happen anytime soon. I don&#39;t feel that I am the only one who has suddenly become &quot;awake,&quot; at something not being quite right at the moment in the world, whether it being a local change I can see or a global change as detailed below.</p>

<p>Apologies if you have read most of this already.. but just check on the recent updates at the bottom to see that whatever is going on is a global phenomenon and not something to turn your nose up at... and it&#39;s not stopping.</p>

<p>First.. read this - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events</a></p>

<p>Regardless what you think, this Order is worded very seriously and encompasses a huge amount of resources in only a short release. It was released rather quickly and;</p>

<p>&quot;But the order bypassed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), the interstate grid security monitor, which has been developing solar storm protections for the grid since 2012.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a surprise to us,&quot; said Gerry Cauley, NERC president and CEO.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw</a></p>

<p>Information on the &quot;Earth Wobble,&quot;.. or pole shift etc. Whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html">http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html</a></p>

<p>We are wobbling on our axis, which will obviously have consequences on the earth.. if you notice in that plot diagram that the latter half of 2016 looks much more.. extreme. The Earth Wobbling is natural my only correlation in this is that where the graph gets more extreme is where I feel the world has started to respond at a similar pace.</p>

<p>Why is this happening? I don&#39;t know. Climate scientists will tell you that our water levels are causing this to happen.. but this is actually a debated topic and not proven.. essentially a &quot;theory.&quot; </p>

<p>This is just a theory of mine, so bash it all you will but take in some of the rest of this information seriously and take note because this isn&#39;t a fucking joke.</p>

<p>For Earth Changes (weather,seismic,volcanic) I started posting around November.. because November is when I started to become &quot;awake,&quot; that there is something not quite right with our planet at the moment and it is behaving abnormally.</p>

<p>Why do I say this? Most articles state that scientists are &quot;perplexed,&quot; or &quot;puzzled,&quot; at things that are happening.</p>

<p>FYI - All information is from watchers.news, an invaluable resource which is unopinionated and deals in facts. They reference various local institutions.. obviously depending on what the earth change is.</p>

<p>(I have cut content from older posts, please see those for additional information)</p>

<p>OKAY...</p>

<p>STILL WITH ME?</p>

<p>Going to pre-face December with some quick facts about Earthquakes.. because most of you will be saying &quot;volcanoes and earthquakes happen all the time.&quot; and you&#39;d be RIGHT! they do..</p>

<p>but; There have been 257 earthquakes over magnitude 5 and many more very close to this number. Just to put this into perspective on average there is an estimated 3.6 earthquakes of a magnitude of 5-5.9 a day, in the last 9 days there have been an average of 24.8 nearly 7 times what is usual. It is estimated there is a 6-6.9 magnitude earthquake every 3 days, we have had 2.6 a day for the last 9 days. Lastly for the big earthquakes of magnitude 7-7.9 you usually get 1 every 25 days (estimate) there have been an average of 1 a day for the last 9 days. (Stats from End of Dec.)</p>

<p>This is also referencing a cosmic energy wave, which is also being attributed (mostly on youtube unfortunately.. but nothing [mainstream] is talking about this) a helium gas cloud which we have entered bringing in higher H3,H4 into our atmosphere.
does anybody know what a brown dwarf star is made of????? (HELIUM)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much.. means alot! I wonder what lies around the corner?..</p>

<p>1) I really have no idea.. </p>

<p>The article actually states that &quot;they examined the samples in an electron microscope, the small amounts of silicon and oxygen in the starting sample had combined together to form silicon dioxide crystals - the same composition as the mineral quartz found at the surface of the Earth.&quot;</p>

<p>What does quartz have as properties though?</p>

<p>&quot;Squeeze certain crystals (such as quartz) and you can make electricity flow through them. ..&quot;</p>

<p>I guess this raises questions in my mind against the whole &quot;electric universe,&quot; theory.. or if you listen to Mr.Tesla.. &quot;If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration...&quot; I think Quartz resonates (no pun intended) with his words.. in my head anyway.</p>

<p>Another thought.. Hollow Earth? is the &quot;inner-sun,&quot; a burning electrical ball of quartz? who the fuck knows.</p>

<p>2) Potentially! If it is as disastrous as those... we are all fucked. I&#39;ve grown to accept I may not reach 30 and i&#39;m opening the doors to all the good things in life.. love etc.. I&#39;m sort of at peace with the world and happy to watch it all unfold like i&#39;ve got a winning movie ticket due to being awake before the show actually starts, despite being sad that I like the direction my life is going at the moment.</p>

<p>Peace to you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool.  I didn&#39;t really want to know you age, I was just interested in your prediction of the amount of years this could possibly culminate in or whatever.  Thanks.  Yeah I agree.  But this prediction has been around seemingly every generation too, so we have to take that into account as well.  Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post, but the contextual use of scientific &quot;theory&quot; to reference a  hunch or guess is incorrect. A scientific theory explains why something happens given what the entire body of science suggests. It is not beneath a law, as a scientific law describes what is actually happening. The two are separate and one can never merge to be the other, but of course both can be changed given new evidence...that much is true of all things in science, nothing is irrefutable. My issue is the use of air quotes to suggest that a theory is beneath facts, when facts are used to develop a theory, as well as a law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When talking about climate change you stated that it is &quot;not proven, essentially a theory&quot;. Technically, nothing outside descriptive facts are ever &quot;proven&quot; in science, and even those are subject to change. This is does not mean nothing is not supported by vast, independent evidence, which is what theories are. Then you went on to state &quot;I have a theory&quot;, which equates it to a hunch or guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much.. means alot! I wonder what lies around the corner?..</p>

<p>1) I really have no idea.. </p>

<p>The article actually states that &quot;they examined the samples in an electron microscope, the small amounts of silicon and oxygen in the starting sample had combined together to form silicon dioxide crystals - the same composition as the mineral quartz found at the surface of the Earth.&quot;</p>

<p>What does quartz have as properties though?</p>

<p>&quot;Squeeze certain crystals (such as quartz) and you can make electricity flow through them. ..&quot;</p>

<p>I guess this raises questions in my mind against the whole &quot;electric universe,&quot; theory.. or if you listen to Mr.Tesla.. &quot;If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration...&quot; I think Quartz resonates (no pun intended) with his words.. in my head anyway.</p>

<p>Another thought.. Hollow Earth? is the &quot;inner-sun,&quot; a burning electrical ball of quartz? who the fuck knows.</p>

<p>2) Potentially! If it is as disastrous as those... we are all fucked. I&#39;ve grown to accept I may not reach 30 and i&#39;m opening the doors to all the good things in life.. love etc.. I&#39;m sort of at peace with the world and happy to watch it all unfold like i&#39;ve got a winning movie ticket due to being awake before the show actually starts, despite being sad that I like the direction my life is going at the moment.</p>

<p>Peace to you!</p>
