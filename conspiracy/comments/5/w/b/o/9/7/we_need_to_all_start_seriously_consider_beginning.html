        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A kickstarter or some such effort would be doomed to fail in the same way that any number of other kickstarters which could be used to free ourselves were. Did you know it&#39;s possible to send a wifi signal miles away from one device? There was a kickstarter, then when that was removed, there were free plans scheduled to be released, but the inventors were compromised. That&#39;s one example, but the point is that we cannot do this commercially.</p>

<p>So, we need to begin to develop easy, cheap, low-technical-ability-requiring devices that can be assembled from easily sourced materials, then programmed somehow. </p>

<p>We would need to worry about infiltration, and to whom we would give the power to allow others onto the meshnet. </p>

<p>We would need to come together and agree on goals, specialize, then democratize, once every device is secure enough to allow a valid vote. </p>

<p>There are countless contingencies I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not able to think of, so if you are able to see why a meshnet will have to come to be if we are to continue to grow, please start thinking about how you can contribute to it once it is born. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing special about long range mesh networks. You just aren&#39;t going to find hardware for it in your local walmart because most consumers don&#39;t have a need for it plus propler hardware is expensive. </p>

<p>Most people who actually go forward to consider buying hardware then decide is too much trouble to install it properly. Putting an antenna 30+ feet in the air is not for everyone.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is we still need a backbone for going from City to City. Maybe if ham radio operators started transmitting data voluntarily that might help a lot. We would have to remove the Restriction of ham radio being not for commercial uses though because most of the internet traffic is commercial, and there would be no way to tell which traffic is commercial and which isn&#39;t. And all traffic would have to be encrypted because everybody could see everything. </p>

<p>You also would need space on the top of a reasonably high structure to achieve LOS or close to LOS for best throughput and reliability. When installing wireless backbones its very popular to go city to city by renting space on the top of each city&#39;s water tower for your radios.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>High speed traders are using lasers to communicate over long distances. Of course their equipment has some features for handling rain and fog. But right off the bat, I figure it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to modify a laser pointer to modulate the signal in sync with the signal coming from a wired router. Another benefit is that you can hide the laser pointer at the end of a long tube, so that it can&#39;t be spotted, (unless the beam is spotted).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because this is an interesting topic, lets get hypothetical.  </p>

<p>If you were dead set about doing this on the amateur spectrum, you&#39;d have to set up a pirate radio station(s).  With the advent of low powered computers on a single board like the raspberry pi, you can build stations and repeaters that can be placed in remote locations (like rooftops and hill tops).  Using repeaters would be an ideal way to separate your station location from your main broadcasting antenna to prevent being located during transmissions.  People are currently operating pirate radio stations in this fashion, and the successful ones can do so basically indefinitely without being identified or shut down.</p>

<p>Because legit amateur operators get a hard on for busting pirate radio operators, you&#39;d probably have to regularly move your equipment and you&#39;d be constantly looking over your shoulder while broadcasting.  Ham&#39;s take their spectrum dead seriously, and making pirate broadcasts brings about all kind of ethical and legal issues.  If you&#39;re in the USA, the FCC will investigate if they receive enough complaints - they do not fuck around and can impose large fines and even criminal convictions at the federal level.</p>

<p>Keep in mind most amateur radio operators are smart, nerdy people who operate in a small community.  They tend to keep meticulous logs about the on-air activities they come across.  They have the ability to physically locate transmission sites, and they will defend their spectrum with more rigour than you might expect.</p>

<p>Pirate radio has always intrigued me.  While I wouldn&#39;t recommend doing it, its a fascinating topic.  If you find this interesting you should look into &#39;numbers stations&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Maybe if ham radio operators started transmitting data voluntarily that might help a lot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would all be transmitted in the clear.  Encryption is prohibited on Part 97 bands.</p>

<p>And, there&#39;s lots of non-commerical traffic to be carried.  Reddit - the ads, for example.</p>

<p>But, the biggest kicker is, in fact, no encryption (ie, no SSL).</p>

<p>However, backbones between cities can be done over many methods.  The problem is getting people involved in it.  I tried to build a meshnet in my city.  Couldn&#39;t get people to install free fucking hardware in their house, and nobody wanted to show up to work parties, so it always ended up being myself and one other person.</p>

<p>That shit gets tiring.  It&#39;s hard to get people to leave their house.</p>

<p>And, I was not saying ads are not commercial traffic.  I was stating it could be done, if you were to strip things like ads.  Nothing commercial about IRC chat, for example.</p>

<p>In fact, public chats would be a good use case, as encryption isn&#39;t even required (It is a public chat, after all).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The problem is we can really only get functional radios that have any kind of useful data transmission capabilities in 900mhz / 2.4ghz / 5.8ghz bands. </p>

<p>This makes any meshnet based on consumer products VERY easy to block as all you need to do is broadcast loudly on these few frequencies, and any hope at a functional meshnet is completely destroyed.</p>

<p>Lasers could be used for meshnet, but they are super expensive, have issues with fog/rain/snow (unless you have the insanely expensive military grade equipment), and require very stable towers for long-distance shots. Unfortunately these are also easily blockable with inexpensive flying drones carrying mirrors (or really any physical obstruction that would block/reflect light).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are fooling yourself if you think the government / military does not have hardware designed specifically to do this.</p>

<p>Also, you don&#39;t need to swamp the whole area. Just the areas near the endpoints. Which would be easily identified due to the broadcast nature of wifi. </p>

<p>Also it&#39;s not broadband spread spectrum. The frequency bands available to consumers are very narrow, and therefore easily disruptable. The radios available are &quot;respectful&quot; of other broadcasters (on a time slice basis) so as to allow multiple networks to coexist on the same frequency (albeit at lower usable bandwidth). All one would need to do to disable them completely is to broadcast a signal that triggers the &quot;someone else is currently broadcasting on this channel&quot; feature of these radios, at which point they would basically stop functioning while waiting for their time-slice on a given frequency.</p>

<p>You&#39;re working against the inverse square law here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Consumer wifi equipment uses spread spectrum technology.  And the SOCs are smart enough to know to ignore the &quot;move aside&quot; signal (Which is simply collision detection).</p>

<p>Start by building an Android app that can communicate handset to handset. Even a simple &quot;walkie talkie&quot; app would be a step in the right direction. Then try to get the app up to something like firechat but less annoying. </p>

Scalability becomes a  real concern in regards to security, data integrity and privacy if these are your concerns.

<p>Also, you don&#39;t need to swamp the whole area. Just the areas near the endpoints. Which would be easily identified due to the broadcast nature of wifi. </p>

<p>Also it&#39;s not broadband spread spectrum. The frequency bands available to consumers are very narrow, and therefore easily disruptable. The radios available are &quot;respectful&quot; of other broadcasters (on a time slice basis) so as to allow multiple networks to coexist on the same frequency (albeit at lower usable bandwidth). All one would need to do to disable them completely is to broadcast a signal that triggers the &quot;someone else is currently broadcasting on this channel&quot; feature of these radios, at which point they would basically stop functioning while waiting for their time-slice on a given frequency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because this is an interesting topic, lets get hypothetical.  </p>

<p>If you were dead set about doing this on the amateur spectrum, you&#39;d have to set up a pirate radio station(s).  With the advent of low powered computers on a single board like the raspberry pi, you can build stations and repeaters that can be placed in remote locations (like rooftops and hill tops).  Using repeaters would be an ideal way to separate your station location from your main broadcasting antenna to prevent being located during transmissions.  People are currently operating pirate radio stations in this fashion, and the successful ones can do so basically indefinitely without being identified or shut down.</p>

<p>Because legit amateur operators get a hard on for busting pirate radio operators, you&#39;d probably have to regularly move your equipment and you&#39;d be constantly looking over your shoulder while broadcasting.  Ham&#39;s take their spectrum dead seriously, and making pirate broadcasts brings about all kind of ethical and legal issues.  If you&#39;re in the USA, the FCC will investigate if they receive enough complaints - they do not fuck around and can impose large fines and even criminal convictions at the federal level.</p>

<p>Keep in mind most amateur radio operators are smart, nerdy people who operate in a small community.  They tend to keep meticulous logs about the on-air activities they come across.  They have the ability to physically locate transmission sites, and they will defend their spectrum with more rigour than you might expect.</p>

<p>Pirate radio has always intrigued me.  While I wouldn&#39;t recommend doing it, its a fascinating topic.  If you find this interesting you should look into &#39;numbers stations&#39;.</p>
