       Yeah, overwhelmingly the shills i've seen are Politics users posting nonsensical SJW rants and then vote brigading.

       Plenty of left leaning users have been calling them out as well because they're so blatantly CTR-tier shills.

      <p>
       Oh you guys still trying that angle?
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of Conspiracy likes Trump because...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The entire establishment, left and right, all the MSM and every piece of shit politician we've hated for years joined forces to oppose him. This was unprecedented and the exact opposite of what we've seen from the faux two-party controlled system. Most didn't know what Trump would do but they knew no matter what it was it was going to hurt the elite globalists. And that's ALWAYS a good thing.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <a href="/r/The_Donald">
          /r/The_Donald
         </a>
         and Conspiracy were one of the few places on Reddit during the entire last year, growing more and more obvious as the election got closer, where you could get actual information about what was going on, since the censorship, lies and blatant spin by the MSM was the most obvious and all encompassing it's been in a long time and the admins had clamped down.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         All the confirmed Soros shills and astroturfers were against Trump. Coming into a place that opposes Hillary and claiming how shit Trump is "because reasons" and then being gilded and heavily voted up is so glaringly obvious that there was no need for any Trump shills, the sheer fact that actual shills were against Trump removed that.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       But almost no users here like your Hillary-loving tier bullshit. Hence the obvious discrepancy.

       Dude, I dont like the deep state either.  But people such as yourself willing to do seemingly anything in order to defend Trump and his administration, are being GAMED.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are playing in to their hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump IS the establishment.  He filled his Admin with the swamp, and he is and has been solely for himself his entire life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to know what research you have done into Trump himself.  What books have you read on the man.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to your points:
1. They
       <em>
        seemingly
       </em>
       joined forces to defeat him, now Trump IS a Republican.  His right hand men?  Bannon and PRIEBUS.  Priebus, Mr. establishment himself.  Trump since has since repealed Dodd Frank.  Please explain to me how that is good for the American people.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         I can agree with your statement to a degree.  At least with R/Con before the MAGAheads took it over.  It was a good place to find info, that was not reported elsewhere.  However, a lot of it is bullshit too.  Like Obama implementing martial law.  DIDNT HAPPEN.  As for The_Don, yes I think there is good info on that sub, especially when it comes to what Podesta is really up to.  Im a liberal who basically believes in Pixxagate.  BUT, I also think it will be used by Trump to cleanse the government of other innocent people as well.  Its how purges in history work.  The_Donald is also an obvious psychological test, and boy is it working.  If anyone on reddit has a cult mentality its the SJW and The_Donald.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Fuck Soros.  Another thing, as a lib, I dont like.  He's obviously evil.  There are shills on both sides.  Thats part of the age we are in.  The big data age is going to get scary, quick.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Here is what I will say.  This fight isnt black and white.  Its got shades of gray, and to be honest, rainbows of color underneath the layers.  Trump may seem enticing.  I almost want to jump on the bandwagon too.  But he is an evil man.  All you need to do is research his history.  Use your heuristic knowledge!

       It's more like "enraged Hillary lost". Hillary is iconic of Neoliberalism, deep state fuckery, Russian propaganda, identity politics, MSM propoganda, etc which are all very much alive and well unfortunately. Hillary is shorthand for all of that.

       No shills are liars who support scams/frauds. There are people shilling for Trump too, but they're usually useful idiots. The ones shilling for the Democrats are more often bought though. That's why they're easier to dismiss, the liars supporting Trump aren't just doing it for a paycheck.

       What? Are you saying that I'm saying there's no more effective communication going on? That's not what I meant. I mean the discussion that does go on here is the target they want to drown it out and inundate it with disinformation, straight up lies, distractions and hoaxes.

       and trump didn't ban anything. Spicer made a shitty stupid comparison, but it's all speculation at this point. I doubt Trump wants to turn down all that tax money so his buddies in the CIA can keep cashing checks...

       Now everyone is calling everyone else shills, people constantly spam PizzaGate and other distractions from 4Chan, and much of the sub has tried to turn pro-establishment because of the election.

       I think the anti-Trump machine has finally gotten its game plan together. Places that are a little too 'Kekian' are facing backlash. I'm not sure this sub realizes that Hillary publicly denounced Pepe the frog - yes the meme. So it's natural that any rougue elements of the internet are feeling extra heat. Elements of the government consider you a threat, if that isn't a badge of honor, I don't know what is.

       Yeah, overwhelmingly the shills i've seen are Politics users posting nonsensical SJW rants and then vote brigading.

       No shills are liars who support scams/frauds. There are people shilling for Trump too, but they're usually useful idiots. The ones shilling for the Democrats are more often bought though. That's why they're easier to dismiss, the liars supporting Trump aren't just doing it for a paycheck.
