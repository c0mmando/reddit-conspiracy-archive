       Bannon apparently said CNN was not allowed in because it is a "corporatist" news outlet while Fox is allowed in because it is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the definition of Newspeak, where the word corporatist, which was once used to describe both Fox and CNN, Wal Mart, and to a large extent the mafia-inspired operation of entities like Monsanto, whoever is building DAPL etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now that word is going to mean to a lot of people CNN and moderates like the Associated Press(that they boycotted is fricking amazing in my opinion)
      </p>
      <p>
       My brother is a teacher and he tells me that the kids in his classes absolutely love to make fun of words like 'safe space', 'snowflake', 'trigger warning' and other words that have been used by liberals to de-escalate conflict and make our society more inclusive and polite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is to say these words which were implemented to created a barrier for bullies, sociopaths and tyrants are now being used for the opposite purpose and if you say them, expect persecution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The immigration issue is framed entirely as if ten million people are here just draining society while in hiding, as if there is no interaction at all with the economy.  The people who hire them, as noted in a recent popular meme, are completely ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short term fixes and giant boondoggles like walls and pipes are touted as huge accomplishments while private companies are making self driving cars, solar and wind farms, flying to space and making virtual cathedrals.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now he's reversing on the drug war?  Plus the republican party now is chill with our president owing half a billion dollars to a foreign country that happens to be russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what it looks like once too many people can't think for themselves and when propaganda(which was made legal in the united states btw by obama, of all people) is allowed by law, and eventually crowds/bleeds out actual journalism.

       edit: im drinking so im going to edit freely and i know the title is missing an s and should read 'the meanings of words are' yeah yeah i know dont quibble when we're talking about big ideas unless you want to just admit you have a small brain

       wow.  That is a lot of words.
btw: Cnn, Buzzfeed, others were not included in today's gaggle for who knows what reason.  Regardless of the official message, I think the real message is clear: return to ethical journalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fox talks crap about Trump all the time, yet were in the gaggle.  So, it isn't that only positive groups were allowed.  But maybe there is a common denominator of the ones that were left out.

       I didn't say one damned word about your rambling, incoherent, drunk-uncle post. I simply pointed out that you are rude. See? Here in r/conspiracy, we pay attention to our own forum, rather than surviving on the teets of our overlord mods to ban assclowns like youreself. Perhaps you should return to your that shithole, r/politics Cause it looks as if you jumped the fence &amp; can't people yet.

       Apologize to u/EricCarver who reached out to you as a polite community member, seeking to understand your whiskey-soaked-patheta-rant, and maybe someone will engage you in conversation long enough for you to make some sort of coherent point.

       Also, I feel like maybe you just broke rule 10 like a gazillion times, so here's a tip: when you run back to your pals, bragging about being banned, remember it's because you're literally failing at human socialization, not because you're an edge lord...although I'm sure you're mom will tell you you're doing a fine job, Ronald.

       You had a point through all this?  Oh yeah, Bannon.  Bannon didn't appear to say that about CNN, but all MSM.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "They're corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda," Bannon said on stage...

       Just like I disagreed with you but was nice, so could CNN and others.  You don't have to agree with everything Trump says but the guy is the POTUS, and a modicum of respect seems due.

       The most glaring newspeak to me is the recent claim  form self professed alt right trumpeteers  here   who have said that the   right, (a false dichotomy)  has always been anti  war and the left  has always been pro  war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that neither of the claimed sides has been effective at being collectively anti war except for the early left. That is unless you think hippies were suit wearing right wingers.

       Safe space is newspeak for "space where wrongthink will be harassed out".  It's the opposite of safe, thus newspeak.

       Your points get worse from there.  You're basically using a "NO U" argument to shill for your own side without addressing the fact that your side is being directly mocked for its inclinations to use newspeak.
