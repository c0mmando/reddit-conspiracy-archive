        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Seriously, Fuck off. I was a trump supporter until my jaw literally fell to the floor when i watched sean spicer live saying that &quot;greater enforcement&quot; will be undertaken. Oh yeah and I looked up the biggest stocks that rose after the election.. #1 and #2 are private prisons. Sorry, shillary ain&#39;t going to jail because he has no plans on putting her in there. So he&#39;s gonna fill it up with pot heads cuz you know what its just as bard as opiates!!.. Oh, and before you say &quot;he&#39;s gotta enforce the law,&quot; remember this: theres so much laws being broken, and precious few resources. So while he&#39;s locking up your next door neighbor jim because he had a joint, and deporting those mexicans who had no criminal priors (he will, watch), all the real assholes who do the worst harm to our society (bankers, etc) aren&#39;t going to be touched.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and maybe we wouldnt have a fucking mexican immigrant problem if our CIA didn&#39;t destroy their country for drug money.</p>

<p>Fuck off the_donald, you bunch of dick sucking hypocrits!</p>

<p>Edit: I don&#39;t even smoke pot. I quit recently due to wanting to focus more on work and curtail spending. But if anything is the canary in the coal mine it&#39;s this. This proves he is a shill. Or that he is a fucking idiot (and wants to get back at california/oregon/washington/colorado for not voting for him.) Oh, and saying that Sean Spicer misspoke and thats not his stance is bullshit as well. Stop covering for him! <strong>Hold your government ACCOUNTABLE!</strong></p>

<p>I am sick and tired of people who are too goddamned lazy to learn the history of and the mechanics of our government sitting around and claiming that there is no difference or that &quot;they are all the same&quot; when the contrast between individuals candidates and elected representatives is often massive.</p>

<p>According to those people, only zerohedge, infowars, randompizzagate youtubers and brietbart/fox are the only &quot;news&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>everyone is implicated in a lot of conspiracies, i heard a conspiracy that said <a href="/u/NationalDenbt">/u/NationalDenbt</a> is a reptilian hyper-shill from Jupiter&#39;s forbidden moon...  </p>

<p>There is one strand of Narrative which suggests George Soros and other important people are part of a nonsensical left-wing conspiracy, this ties Obama and Hillary and all sorts of other people into a complex network of shadow cartels and Illuminati hi-jinks however this is only one of many conspiracy based narratives - a much more plausible one suggests that the European Aristocracy who used to rule most the world continue aided and merged with various colonial developments (rich americans) this theory makes a lot of sense because unlike the counter-theory &#39;obama and the nwo&#39; it has a rational start point, during the age of empire the aristocracy of Europe really did rule most of the world, especially England who used economic and military power to carve an empire the sun never set on and declare defacto global hegemony... that this continues is all but proven by the fact there&#39;s no point in history where it ever stops, in Britain the queen still has a shiny hat ffs.  </p>

<p>So what happened is people started working together to create a better world for themselves, french and american revolution for example however power wasn&#39;t just a document it&#39;s a physical thing - money, food, and weapons are what really matters... the very rich used their power and influence to make sure they got richer at the expense of everyone else and to scupper the electoral process and government every change it gets - when the government is week people can&#39;t combine their resources and efforts so the rich have all the real power - for centuries a very powerful cartel of ultra wealthy criminals has been actively working to undermine any for of progress that help&#39;s the people and everything to enforce system that compel people into endless servitude which benefits the bosses a lot more than the workers...  </p>

<p>this is who organisations like Fox News support, notice how they&#39;ll flit from one set of values to another without any regard for consistency? that&#39;s because none of it matters to them, they&#39;re just trying to find the weakpoint of everything and cause as much conflict and confusion as possible because that stops people being able to organise and do more positive things... it&#39;s about spreading doubt, confusion, conflict and slowing down the advance of progress so that their well funded lobbyists can get in there first and rig the system to favour the mega-rich.  </p>

<p>the word conspiracy doesn&#39;t mean &#39;things the right-wing want everyone to believe about their enemies&#39; and we need to stop acting like it does, there are some very real conspiracies in the world and many of them unsurprisingly involve the richest people in the world trying to keep and increase their wealth and power at the detriment to everyone else. i.e. the right-wing agenda.  </p>

Barring the fact that I don&#39;t think that many of the people we&#39;ve fucked with over the past 60 years have fallen into either of those categories, we&#39;re pretty equal opportunity when it comes to fucking over people for gains.

<p>While it comes as no surprise that the rich and powerful attempt to use control to remain more rich and powerful, I find it very dubious as to whether or not there is any significant collaboration across varying industries.</p>

<p>But you&#39;ve also only listed some of the things to be least skeptical about.  For instance there&#39;s the elephant in the room, Pizzagate.  Most of the shit talked about on that is fan fiction at best.  Don&#39;t get me started when people start talking about demons.  Chemtrails, vaccines, GMOs, heart attack guns.  It&#39;s perfectly reasonable to take a skeptical view and also still be interested in the topic.</p>

<p>you can&#39;t believe everything, especially if there&#39;s no reason to believe it.

<p>but uh, the heart attack gun isn&#39;t demons, congress believe in the cia heart attack gun - <a href="http://www.military.com/video/guns/pistols/cias-secret-heart-attack-gun/2555371072001">http://www.military.com/video/guns/pistols/cias-secret-heart-attack-gun/2555371072001</a> - democratic senator Frank Church believed it, why do you think you get to write it off with a wave of your hand? and do you really think the cia wouldn&#39;t at least try to assassinate people with heart attack guns? have you read how many times they tried and what obscure methods they resorted to try and kill comrade Castro? </p>

<p>yes of course you&#39;re a fool to believe everything that&#39;s spouted in a a hyperbolic infowars shitpost but get some serious docs in there, some court testimony, a bit of video evidence and you&#39;ve got yourself a stew going....</p>

<p>I actually wasn&#39;t waving off the heart attack gun, I think it&#39;s perfectly sound scientifically and historically.  I&#39;m not certain that it&#39;s correct, but I can&#39;t really see anything to rule it out as a possibility.</p>

<p>My point was that this is certainly a place for skeptics, particularly when people can sit down and talk like adults.  The people responding with &quot;cuck&quot; however, IMHO, should just be fucking banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well no of course he wasn&#39;t technically &#39;democratically elected&#39; because that would be literally impossible, the Viet Minh who wrestled control of Vietnam away from the french oppressor never had a chance to establish a fair and just system for the people because when the imperialist forces of old Europe were defeated they called on their bully boy America to come and drop chemical weapons and fire on villages burning innocent men, women and children to agonising death and causing chemical problems which persist the form of high incidences of birth defects to this very day... the exact same method of ultra-violence, shock and awe [i.e. terror] and pure brutality unleashed by America on any nation that&#39;s ever tried to free itself from the oppressive grasp of the old masters...  </p>

<p>it&#39;s a place for sceptics not denialists, it&#39;s a place to judge each and EVERY thing on it&#39;s merits and not take anything for granted - that includes the &#39;official story&#39; or &#39;conceived wisdom&#39; just because it totally seems like it should be true or we&#39;d really like it to be true doesn&#39;t mean it is.  we should never lump all conspiracies together and treat them as equal any more than we should lump all objects starting with a together and treat them as identical, you&#39;d have trouble when they rushed you to hospital in an apple for trying to take a bite out of an aardvark...  </p>

<p>Yap yap yap.  I&#39;m not disagreeing with any of that.  Vietnam had the utter misfortune of trying this after there were enough global powers interesting in stopping this but before there were enough global powers to keep them from being stomped.  They attempted a violent revolution, and like most violent revolutions they angered enough people to get shat upon.  I wish it had gone differently, but you can&#39;t be a minority power forcing out a majority powers puppet, kill the rest of your opposition, and then somehow expect things to be all hugs and puppies after.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a typical American.  I know for a fact that we&#39;ve done some ridiculously fucked up shit.  I also can acknowledge that some of it was done with good intentions of those involved, some of it wasn&#39;t, and that we&#39;ve more or less fucked up every pie we&#39;ve tried to bake in the past 60 years.  Unfortunately, I think a lot of that is due to the fact that humans are just plain fucked.</p>

<p>Honestly?  A non-zero percentile.  I think it&#39;s inconceivable that at least some of the decision makers didn&#39;t go that route under the logic that it was either our citizens or theirs dead, and really I don&#39;t envy that.</p>

<p>I think that there are some individuals who have been ignorant or deluded on our military actions.  I don&#39;t think that everyone involved in Iraq Round 1 was intent on protecting Iranian oil money, and I think it&#39;s naive to believe some of them didn&#39;t genuinely see Iraq as a valid humanitarian threat at the time.  I can equally some in Iraq Round 2 just seeing Saddam as someone who was never going to mesh with western interests and it would be in the best interests of the planet to snuff him out.</p>

<p>And then there are the absolute knob-gobblers pushing through conflict overseas via lies for monetary gain, and the spineless degenerates who do the same for political gain.  And yeah, unfortunately the gobblers and degenerates seem to be in a majority.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t mean to make you lose your boner, but have you been reading what I said here?  That part about assholes being a majority.  I was talking on the stupidity of black and white morality on the real world, and more specifically bringing the conversation away from baby-napalm-burning.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, the Iraq and Iran armies were smashing each other over and over again with no real sign of stopping.  At a certain point it&#39;s obvious that financial motivations played the significant part, but realistically either party could have been sided with.  Saddam simply made a better enemy on paper.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if that statement displays a pathological distrust of humanity, or an utter incapability to emphasise with the nuance of another human mind.  There&#39;s never black and white.  This isn&#39;t a novel.</p>

<p>ah so we sided with Iran and went out of our way to help Iran and get the toppled Iraq back on it&#39;s feet so it&#39;s people could prosper.... yah.... it was a war far oil, for control and dominance of the middle east - if they wanted to do good things then there&#39;s a million things that&#39;d have been more effective, the rarely do anything that actually makes things better but they always manage to maintain or increase their power and keep the impoverished regions firmly under the jackboot...  </p>

<p>but we&#39;re talking about the people that had a choice, it&#39;s stupidly easy to find people who don&#39;t have a choice and say &#39;oh everything is nuanced and complex because this guy is a victim too&#39; but firstly no, not Vietnam, if you went to Vietnam you&#39;re a terrible person -- plenty of good people made a moral choice and resisted. None of this really matters though because the actions of people who have no option don&#39;t count for anything, it&#39;s the people who do choose that matter and those people chose to smash an effort by people trying to organise a better life away from the oppression of western imperialism and they did it because they were scared uf working people started getting on their feet then there would be no one to do act as cheap labour and they wouldn&#39;t be able to make such vast profits...</p>

<p>When all was said and done, the pot industry had grown to a multi-billion dollar a year industry, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say Obama &#39;aggressively&#39; went after dispensaries.

<blockquote>
<p>Looking back at President Obama’s legacy, the Council on Foreign Relation’s Micah Zenko added up the defense department’s data on airstrikes and made a startling revelation: in 2016 alone, the Obama administration dropped at least 26,171 bombs. This means that every day last year, the US military blasted combatants or civilians overseas with 72 bombs; that’s three bombs every hour, 24 hours a day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty easy to ignore that when you realize he likely wouldn&#39;t have engaged in those wars to begin with and was a president entering an administration already at war, and someone who just so happened to be THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT OF THE USA, after a string of FOURTY-THREE WHITE MEN OVER 200 YEARS OF SUCCESSION.</p>

<p>Humans have a HARD time dealing with change of any kind. Face it: the real problem for you and the rest of T_D was seeing a non-White (or Partial White) in the White House, and NOT his politics. </p>

<p>You really think that 8 years of republicans not giving him an inch had ANYTHING to do with Obama&#39;s centrist approach? He was the first president to be vilified openly during a fucking state of the union address for fucks sake. Remember &quot;YOU LIE!&quot; ? Yea. That&#39;s what you get for being a fucking black dude in the White House. NO one has ever broken decorum like that for any other president in recent history, likely ever. The racists and war hawks (same people) who make up congress kept Obama from accomplishing his goals.</p>

<p>Blacks make up 37 million out of 303 million in this country or about, 12%. There are 100 senators in the US Senate and only TWO are black, making it 2% of the senate legislative body. </p>

<p>How the fuck can you not see that as underrepresentation?</p>

<p>T_Ders and anyone else will always claim that they aren&#39;t racist and yet EVERYTHING THEY SUPPORT OR SAY OTHERWISE IS OBVIOUSLY RACIST AS FUCK...</p>

<p>T_D mods routinely and consistently allow fake news articles to stay on the subreddit (which usually place in the top 10 of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>) and bans <em>everyone</em> who calls it out with evidence-based responses, even if the comments are not anti-Trump. </p>

<p>I get banning anti-Trump comments because yes its a pro-Trump subreddit but when you start exposing the entirety of this site to fake news articles and cover up the fact that its fake news is a HUGE problem.</p>

<p>And while this is conspiracy, and honestly many here interpret maybe a little too much into things, I think its a sound strategy by Trumpers to enforce strict obedience, because the alternative is to lose your only connection to the group. </p>

<p>You were a supporter until it hit you personally. Trump and the Republicans had support of conservative people on Obamacare, and then lost it as they started talking about repealing it. It&#39;s kinda funny, but also serious business. Especially in light of transgender rights in the news, you don&#39;t care, it doesn&#39;t affect your personally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Echo-chambers are only a good thing if I agree with them&quot;.</p>

<p>Fuck off, you absolute moron.  </p>

<p>The fact is r/the_donald doesn&#39;t pretend to be anything but an echo chamber. If you get sick of the anti-Trump spam that hits every single other sub you spend a little time there to remind yourself that you&#39;re not the only one. That&#39;s the whole reason it was made, not to be another place for people to spam anti-Trump stuff. You have literally any other subreddit for that.</p>

<p>The real problem with echo chambers is when they pretend to be impartial and goad people into thinking there is only one accepted view. Like a certain political subreddit.</p>

<p>This argument basically boils down to a misunderstanding of how subreddits work. If people only posted about cats on r/cats, that&#39;s expected and nobody cares. But if you went to r/animals and there were only pictures of dogs there would be reason to question the subreddit.</p>

<p>Liberalism is a political philosophy or worldview founded on ideas of liberty and equality.[1][2][3] Whereas classical liberalism emphasises the role of liberty, social liberalism stresses the importance of equality.[4] Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but generally they support ideas and programmes such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, free markets, civil rights, democratic societies, secular governments, gender equality, and international cooperation.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11]</p>

<p>They are literally propagandizing all of the news in an effort to mislead the public.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Propaganda is &quot;information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view&quot;.[1] Propaganda is often associated with the psychological mechanisms of influencing and altering the attitude of a population toward a specific cause, position or political agenda in an effort to form a consensus to a standard set of belief patterns.[2]</p>

<p>Ah, got it.  So being screwed over by Trump <em>makes you</em> an idiot - so Trump can screw anyone in the world, and they are therefore idiots, and it&#39;s not a problem!</p>

<p>Most people would readily give services on a net-30 basis to someone who is both a Presidential candidate and a billionaire, but I guess everyone everywhere is an idiot.</p>

<p>Still, as a Trump supporter, you might stop and think what it means when you think that trusting Trump implies you&#39;re an idiot.  What does it say about you?</p>

You basically just said &quot;give me an example but I won&#39;t allow it as evidence.&quot; In this article a guy took a standard business order from D.

    <div class="md"><p>Of course not. That&#39;s not the issue. The media was not elected to run our country. Trump was. And in a functioning democracy, access to true information is vital. If you want a dictatorship, it&#39;s to your benefit to stifle the media and its damn questions. If you believe America is a land of free people who give the government its power, then you want the media to be in those meetings to answer the questions you and I cannot.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the real litmus test: If you&#39;re just fine with the opposition party doing this, then it&#39;s probably not that big of a deal. If it really bothers you if Hillary Clinton were to do the same thing that Trump already did, then you&#39;re just a political tool who apparently works against his own interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it is, does my post indicate otherwise?  One of my favorite authors says it best - “If you accept – and I do – that freedom of speech is important, then you are going to have to defend the indefensible. That means you are going to be defending the right of people to read, or to write, or to say, what you don’t say or like or want said. The Law is a huge blunt weapon that does not and will not make distinctions between what you find acceptable and what you don’t. This is how the Law is made. People making art find out where the limits of free expression are by going beyond them and getting into trouble. [...] The Law is a blunt instrument. It’s not a scalpel. It’s a club. If there is something you consider indefensible, and there is something you consider defensible, and the same laws can take them both out, you are going to find yourself defending the indefensible.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want a real gateway to harder drugs, try opioids. Many people that start on prescription painkillers move on to Heroin and other nasty shit. If you want a problem, focus there. People don&#39;t give a fuck if drugs are illegal. If I wanted to smoke some dope I could waltz down the road to my buddies house and walk home. The only reason I did it was because I had a &quot;Fuck the government&quot; sort of edgy emntality. Marijuana laws only exist to lock up youth and profit drug companies and for profit prisons. More harm is being done by it being illegal than for it to be legal. Users may have to visit a nasty part of town for a deal and risk getting ripped off, robbed, killed in the process. Make it a safe deal where the user isn&#39;t going to eitehr of the latter. The justification for parents to tell their kids not to use it is &quot;You&#39;ll go to jail!&quot;, that was the focus of the entire marijuana unit in my High School health class. My cousin underwent breast cancer treatment last year and she used it through treatment to cope with the sickness and pain of chemo. Do you want these people to go to jail for smoking it? Do you want these people to suffer from treatment? What is your justification for it being illegal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because... why?</p>

<p>Last year, my wife and I left America for a social democracy in Europe.  You have no idea how much better things are here.  Yes, somewhat more of your paycheck goes to the government (but I lived in New York City, so the difference is small) but the level of services!  The comfort!   </p>

<p>And the friggen efficiency here.  Jesus.  We live on a busy street in Amsterdam.  A few weeks we got a letter in our mailbox explaining to us that they were going to be doing repairs on our block overnight for two nights in a row - very apologetic.</p>

<p>Starting at midnight they ripped up half the block, did the maintenance, put back the road before the morning.  The next night, they did the same to the other half.  All done!  Two nights!  In New York City, this would have easily been months.</p>

<p>Watching them work was a trip.  They didn&#39;t seem in a hurry - they just worked steadily and efficiently, taking a short break every hour or two, until it was done. </p>

<p>Of course, all Dutch apartments have the bedrooms facing away from the street, so we didn&#39;t even hear it.</p>

<p>Because we just moved here, we have had a lot of contact with bureaucrats.  In <em>each</em> case these government workers were <em>on our side.</em>  &quot;No, I wouldn&#39;t put that here on this form, you&#39;ll be hit with taxes.  Let me white this out for you!&quot;  In <em>each</em> case they underpromised and over-delivered.  &quot;You&#39;ll get this residence permit within six week.&quot;  Four days later, there it is.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think the reason that social democracy would never work in the USA is because the rich like to see the poor suffer bitterly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your examples aren&#39;t due to socialism, but due to a small country with lower population.  You think the Netherlands is better because road work is finished faster? That&#39;s kinda ridiculous.</p>

<p>You have had contact with bureaucrats because they govern a lot less people so its easier to listen to individuals.</p>

<p>The unemployment rate is higher in Netherlands and the value of the currency is lower.</p>

<p>Agai , not defending her or her policies, but she WAS more experienced and more qualified, and she did know more about how Washington and the government ran. Trump literally had no clue what he was/is doing, and will do irreparable damage that likely would not have happened under Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you answered your own question. Experience and even failure can make someone more qualified than a billionaire playboy businessman who&#39;s never held public office and who very clearly has zero grasp on our country&#39;s most important contract between citizens and government, the constitution. The constitution is like a whopping 27 pages and this fucker can&#39;t be arsed to even read it. He actually thinks the President has the unfettered right to free speech when he speaks for the country. Clinton is awful and I&#39;m glad she lost and I hope I never have to worry about her getting elected ever again. But at least she studied the constitution for 3 years in law school and spent the rest of her life learning the ins and outs of federal governance. </p>

<p>The DNC is a private organization and they have the full rights of one so they can pretty much do whatever they want.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s important that we get someone like Keith Ellison in to change the mindset of the DNC.  </p>

<p>I still attest that Trump is the single best thing to happen to the Democrats; democrats are finally organizing and uniting, and stopping their apathetic ways.  We might have to suffer in the meantime, but the future looks bright.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that the DNC is a private organization. They can utilize whatever policies they want, but they don&#39;t just outright skip primaries and put the person they want as their nominee because then Democrats and independents allowed to vote in primaries would see that it isn&#39;t a democratic process. They may as well though, since they&#39;ll do chickenshit things like use superdelegates and at the last minute change contribution rules to favor Clinton. </p>

<p>There is no real democracy in the primaries and that is my beef. This is the system that determines ultimately who is president because it produces one of the two choices. I think primaries should be subject to extensive transparency rules that make it more Democratic and fair since it ultimately produces the choices for which vote in the general election. </p>

<p>Seriously.  This is a man who&#39;d hire your uncle to retile his hotel bathrooms, promise him a huge payday, and then stiff him on the bill because he knows your small-business uncle can&#39;t afford to even go to court against Donald J Trump and his legion of lawyers.  </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t fiction, it happened hundreds of times.  He gobbles up the hard work of small business owners and shits on them when it comes time to pay.  He says things like, &quot;Doing business with Trump will pay more than our money could ever pay&quot; but that good advertising doesn&#39;t pay for all the supplies you used to do his work.  </p>

<p>Trump University was a literal scam school, and he was being sued for it during the election.  <strong>He was running for President while being sued for scamming people.</strong>  Then he just settled like a bitch for millions and millions of dollars while everyone was distracted with his &quot;tremendous electoral victory&quot;.</p>

<p>He&#39;s always been a con artist, scamming people every chance he gets to recoup a couple bucks here and there, small change, pennies for a &quot;billionaire&quot;, but he still does it, scams, bullies, sues, and then settles like a bitch if they don&#39;t run away.  And these idiots welcomed him into their open arms because they suddenly think he&#39;s going to start scamming people <em>for them</em>.  </p>

<p>Insane.  Trump doesn&#39;t care about you or your coal job, or your economic anxiety.  He only likes you until he&#39;s gotten money from you, then he is done with you.  T_D are just Johns who think that Stripper really liked them because she smiled when he paid her. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you actually know anything about geopolitics? I wasn&#39;t talking about a genocide in America you dumbass. I was talking about Syria. </p>

<p>Hillary wanted a no-fly zone in Syria, and an expansion of military aid to terrorist groups like Islamic Front, Fatah Halab, etc. Look, I&#39;m no fan of Assad, but the truth is that the Syrian government is the only thing holding the country together. Russian airstrikes was the only thing standing in the way of the Syrian government&#39;s collapse. If Hillary did implement these policies, Assad&#39;s government would fall and the result would be unthinkable.</p>

<p>The Syrian Army is the only thing protecting ethnic minorities. Already, in areas of the country controlled by rebel/salafist groups, ethnic and religious minorities are being systematically cleansed and driven into sexual slavery. Not only ISIS, but also Al Nusra, Army of Conquest, and other Saudi-backed Wahhabist groups like Islamic Front have targeted minorities, like Shiites and Christians, in their territories.</p>

<p>If Hillary Clinton implemented her policies, and the Syrian government fell, there WOULD BE GENOCIDE. There is no disagreement on this point by most serious Syrian analysts. Islamist and Wahhabist groups would systematically &quot;cleanse&quot; Alawites, Ismailis, Christians, and Kurds. They are already doing this, and if there is no stable government in the region, they will become genocidal. Kurdish Democratic forces realize this, and have already established militias to protect from genocidal action by Wahhabist groups. Kurdish leaders implored the Obama administration to stop supporting the Wahhabists, because they wanted the Kurds dead. </p>

<p>There are 4 - 5 million Christians, Ismailis, Alawites, and Kurds in Syria. There is already widespread racial and ethnic violence against all these groups. The first genocide will probably be against Alawites because of their control of the Syrian government, and then the other atrocities will follow. By the end 2-3 million would be dead. </p>

<p>It would be the worst humanitarian crisis in the twenty-first century and make the Syrian war up until this point look like nothing. NOTHING Trump has done or is suggesting to do would be more destructive than collapsing the Syrian government, and potentially causing genocide. </p>

<p>Really? Cause it&#39;s a pretty easy decision. If you can&#39;t see Trump is worse... you probably shouldn&#39;t make important decisions in general. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Sessions is against it, a large chunk of Trump&#39;s base is against it, and marijuana is one more drug that can be tied to Mexican cartels, illegal immigrants, etc. Law enforcement likes it illegal, if only because if they can catch a guy with a nug of weed they have cause to look for other drugs if they think there&#39;s more to find. And there&#39;s likely no money (currently) in it for Trump and his freinds to gain if its recreational. </p>

<p>&quot;States to govern themselves&quot; is a nice catchphrase for putting off comment or decision on what Fed powers they want for handy use, and what responsibilities they want to pass on to others so they can avoid blame on unpopular stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the reasons behind it. I have a friend who works for HS. He gave me some very good reasons as to why it should be illegal at a federal level. I also don&#39;t disagree with it either. Like you said it allows a fair bit more leeway for the fed to crack down on cartel movement etc. Most local law enforcement I know consider mj a hassle that has weird laws from lots of different angles. </p>

<p>My biggest frustration is the consistent support for a person who has been so erratic and unpredictable in his decisions. How can people fervently feel like he is doing a good job when he doesn&#39;t even know what direction he is going in </p>

<p>I do though disagree that trumps supporters were for mj crack down. Just look at op. Trump was supposed to be anti establishment. He was. He has just been pro financial establishment instead. </p>

<p>Difference is I voted for weed. Taking my weed would be proof of tyranny and non democracy as it was something I voted for, that I&#39;ve had for years that I&#39;m told I can&#39;t have.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is the middle-ground argument that you never see made. While technically many Central and South American people have come to the US illegally, even if you staunchly disagree with that it&#39;s important to remember that these people are escaping violence that the US is very much responsible. I consider them refugees, more than anything. That part of the world has been devastated by drug violence</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And here&#39;s the really crazy part: Mexicans have every reason to hate the US. We fought an aggressive war and took away part of their country... twice! (Texan rebellion &amp; Mexican War--then we bought another chunk of land off them because we made them an offer they literally couldn&#39;t refuse) We have fucked over their country every which way for decades now. But the Mexican elite keep the populist sentiment tamped down, historically because we threatened them with invasion if they every got rowdy, but more recently due to economic ties. </p>

<p>And Trump is destroying those ties! He wants to build a wall? Not only that, he wants to revoke NAFTA! I don&#39;t care what your position is on either of those--you can agree that those things will make the average Mexican <em>very</em> pissed. Mexicans have been fucked over by their elite for their country&#39;s entire history. Nieto currently has something like a 12% approval rating. </p>

<p>The stage is <em>ripe</em> for a populist Mexican President to take over. If we&#39;re lucky, it&#39;ll be Evo Morales. If we&#39;re unlucky, Hugo Chavez. Think Mexico would miss our money? Ha! Imagine how much China and Russia would pay to have a major ally right on our border? And this isn&#39;t the sort of shit that would go away just because Trump leaves office. This could be a long realignment. </p>

<p>Donald Trump might actually turn one of our strongest allies, one of only two neighboring nations, into a hostile nation. I doubt he would have the same vitriol for us as Chavez brought. They probably wouldn&#39;t welcome Russian missiles like Castro. But allow a Russian or Chinese naval base? Why not? After all, we have troops in Poland. We have bases in South Korea and Japan. </p>

<p>It&#39;s entirely possible that all this stupid fucking Mexico hate coming from the White House could result in the greatest geopolitical fuck-up in US history by taking out a national asset we&#39;ve always taken for granted: that the nearest a hostile country could project power has always been at least an ocean away.</p>

<p>At least Trump isn&#39;t boring, but I&#39;m no longer so sure I want to live in interesting times.</p>

<p>//////</p>

<p>Not to mention, welcome <a href="/u/2016pantherswin">/u/2016pantherswin</a> . Coming from being a Trump supporter to realizing that you can&#39;t trust his words is going to be a hell of a paradigm shift. </p>

<p>If you keep going, you may get to the point where you see that he&#39;s setting up economic and regulatory policies that expand and solidify the control of elites (Goldman Sachs running Treasury, billionaires running our schools, oil companies running the EPA), massive tax cuts that will almost all go to the wealthy, rubbing shoulders with drug and private prison companies... and then you also realize that he&#39;s systematically attacking anything that gets in the way of his power (&quot;so-called&quot; judges, &quot;fake news&quot; media, &quot;paid&quot; protesters--the judicial branch, the media, and free speech all being pillars of our democracy) shit starts to get real. I only expect it to get worse as he gains more power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freedom of the press was absolutely important to the founding fathers in the first years of creating a new state and during the revolutionary period (led to things like <em>the federalist papers</em> and numerous other inflammatory publications) and they made a point to explicitly state that fact and make it a pillar of their new country. </p>

<p>That being said the press is often controlled and manipulated like all the major news outlets today are, both left and right. But that isnt because the press is shit, its because those are symptoms reflecting a shit system. Of course most journalists aren&#39;t idealists looking to shed light on the truth just for the betterment of humanity, but neither are judges, and the courts are certainly a pillar of american democracy, neither are the cabinet members and the different branches of government but they certainly are pillars of american democracy. As difficult as it is for a lot of Americans to realize, not even the mythical founding fathers were idealists looking to make a country full of justice for everyone and shit, they were just a whole bunch of pretty well-off businessmen who got the fuckin chance in a lifetime to make their own country and they made the best possible country <em>for them</em>. </p>

<p>So yeah if a country is full of corruption, from the cops to the judges to its industry leaders to its secretary of state, dont expect its news corporations to be clean either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand me. I&#39;m not making any kind of value judgment. I don&#39;t call it a pillar of our democracy in order to convey a mark of nobility but as a simple observation. The press is not <em>just</em> a PR firm, though they may act in that capacity. It&#39;s something much deeper and more complex than that. It is a collection of separate agents exercising authorship over our historical record and over consensus reality. It&#39;s a collection of institutional norms and social doctrine that spin the threads from which our discourse is woven.</p>

<p>The press and the state are two of the major pillars of the system that governs our country today. Our country was practically founded by the printing press and it is the press that lends the state a large portion of its public legitimacy and vice versa. De-legitimization of one affects the other and each exert great influence on the speech and actions of the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with much of what you have to say, but it&#39;s important to remember just how hated NAFTA was by the Mexican left and in particular the Indigenous communities in Mexico. The Zapatista uprising happened on January 1, 1994 specifically because that was the date NAFTA went into effect. NAFTA was responsible for a really unfair trade relationship between Mexico and the US in many ways, but particularly around corn as a commodity. Corn is originally from Mexico (the genetic predecessors and original human breeding is from the Oaxaca valley) and is deeply entwined in the spiritual and philosophical systems of many Indigenous groups particularly in southern Mexico. NAFTA at that time served to undermine heirloom corn by flooding the Mexican and world markets with cheap GMO corn from the US. Mainstream capitalist Mexicans now might like NAFTA and want to keep it, but the grassroots and left Mexicans (and folks in the US for that matter) hated NAFTA when it went into effect and fought against it with mass mobilizations. I&#39;m not saying Trump&#39;s economic policies are good, and I assume and &quot;renegotiation&quot; of NAFTA will probably likely favor the rich, but NAFTA on its face hasn&#39;t been welcomed by the many Mexicans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good point. That said, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Mexico+GDP&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8">NAFTA has been good to the Mexican GDP</a>.

<p>Meaning that while NAFTA screwed over a number of people, a large number of people are now directly tied to its success. And as you mentioned, Trump is the type of person that--if he does try to &quot;renegotiate&quot; NAFTA--will attempt to do so from a &quot;positions of strength,&quot; meaning that he&#39;ll try to get as much as he can for us at Mexico&#39;s expense, forgetting that you can fuck over small-time contractors as a developer and not have to worry about their lawsuits, but you can&#39;t fuck over neighboring nations without serious backlash.</p>

<p>You are absolutely 110% correct.  While Mexico is no saint, we could have dealt with them in a much better way, starting decades ago.  Instead, we&#39;ve propped up their elite and allowed them to send their poor and disenfranchised to us.  We&#39;ve been bad neighbors in every sense.  Do people think Mexicans are eager to immigrate?  They&#39;re not, they&#39;d rather stay with their friends and family and not be forced to learn a new language and work bullshit jobs.  Problem is, their country and economy has been systematically fucked by both internal and external forces.  And we haven&#39;t been good neighbors and helped out when and where we could - we chose to profit off their misery for misguided short-term political and economic gains.</p>

The vast majority from Mexico came from the Northern states where the drug trade has had the worst impact.  Most from Central America are from Honduras and Guatemala where US funded wars have turned the countries into dangerous places.  They are doing work that most US born citizens wouldn&#39;t do and they take pride in their work regardless of what it is.</p>

<p>It makes me sick to think that so many good people and their families will be thrown out when all they were trying to do is provide for their loved ones in a safer environment.  If anything they are the embodiment of the American dream; Immigrate here, take any work you can, work hard, create new opportunities for your family. </p>

<p>One thing to add to this is that Marijuana was outlawed initially because the US wanted to take land owned by Mexican Americans in the Midwest and West.  Much like opium was outlawed to make it easier to subjugate the Asian immigrants out West prior to that. </p>

<p>Which is it? Is he blatant anti establishment, or undercover good guy? Fuck off with the wacky bullshit guys, nobody here was born yesterday, you&#39;re not fooling anyone. </p>

<p>Just so you all know, CTR here tries to paint this sub as a trump conservative fuckfest to make us look stupid and racist.

<p>No sir. I&#39;ve been on this sub in some shape or form for nearly a decade now.

Hint hint, starts with a T and ends with a D.</p>

<p>The newbies being scared out of here aren&#39;t being turned away by big bad CTR. They&#39;re getting turned away by the Donald folks and the mods who have banned them for whatever flimsy reason they could cook up. It&#39;s not even a secret. The mods BRAGGED about it a week or two ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he&#39;s kept most of his promises very well. He moved the Dakota Access Pipeline farther away and made sure it was built with quality materials, which is a good compromise for both sides. He&#39;s already diffused tensions with Russia somewhat, which I think will be beneficial for both sides, and he does seem to be working towards other promises like removing Obamacare. He does seem to be keeping up to the deal-making promise of his campaign.</p>

<p>On the bad side, I think the most pressing issue is his press secretary, he in particular seems to have no interest in telling the truth. This is not much different than previous administrations, but it is certainly no improvement, and honestly might be even worse. I also thought that (while not some human rights crisis) the &quot;Muslim ban&quot; is a largely ineffective measure and that some of his cabinet picks (Ben Carson for HUD, what the fuck?) seemed very stupid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will hijack this post.</p>

<p>I am a Trump supporter. Earned 40,000 Karma on t_d. Got banned for asking mods to stop censorship and to stop banning people for not agreeing with Trump. </p>

<p>They banned me. I sent a PM to many t_d users with proof of censorship. I got a common themed reply from a lot of people. Lots of people are pissed at the mods for massive censorship but they can&#39;t say anything because they will get banned. They can&#39;t go to other subs to discuss because those subs ban them for the flimsiest of reasons(still better than what the mods on t_d do).</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR - Any Trump supporter who questions mod authority on t_d gets banned. Most users know the mods on t_d are steaming pieces of shit.</strong></p>

<p>Regarding creating a new sub- I&#39;m not sure because I haven&#39;t participated in creating one yet, but as far as I know it&#39;s as simple as pressing the &#39;Create subreddit &#39; link on the homepage.  Of course then you&#39;d have to promote it etc... but the possibility is definitely there if there is a will to make it happen.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m jewish, and I&#39;m not self-hating, as far as I know.  However, there are several large donors who happen to be jewish, and who&#39;s primary and only issue is Israel.  In the service of that singular concern, much influence has been purchased through donations.</p>

<p>Sabin donated 7 million towards the construction of the DNC, and is the DNC&#39;s top donor (and was HRC&#39;s top donor) and they were close, having donated 10 million to the campaign, another 10 million to the Clinton Foundation, and more.  He felt Hillary needed to be more to the right of Obama on issues related to Israel.  He accused Ellison (the DNC nominee) of being anti-semitic.</p>

<p>This is difficult to talk about without sounding anti-semitic.  I don&#39;t believe that there is a &quot;jewish conspiracy&quot;, but I do believe that powerful pro-Israeli donors exert an outsized influence on our politicals lives right now.  </p>

<p>The issue with Israel remains complex.  I&#39;m unresolved on how to understand the issue.  I see both sides, but I am clear that I would like the Israeli&#39;s and their advocates to stay the fuck out of my government.  People are worried about russia hacking the election - how is this different?</p>

<p>Just like there are several large donors  who happen to be farmers, and their only issue is farming oversight. or how there are several large donors who happen to be part of the military-industrial complex, and their only issues are starting more wars.</p>

<p>People doing everything to defend their interests is nothing new. And the fact that different people have similar interests gives absolutely no indication that they&#39;re secretly all working together. If anything, they&#39;re probably disagreeing with each other in many things, or might even be actively working against each other. Remember that any group or subgroup has arguments within the group. To think that all of it is one big conspiracy of people working together is fundamentally misunderstanding how people work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know of a born again Christian (turned catholic) that believes this (my brother-in-law). I roll my eyes whenever he talks about these things. I play along of course.  He would be a Trump supporter if he lived in the US. He believes the fake news bit. He believes  that immigrants and their religion are the root of all problems. He doesn&#39;t realize that people come to our countries for a reason. Their beliefs do not match the beliefs of their radical countrymen. Granted that some of them have evil intentions, but we have that already in our countries.  We deal with it and move ahead. I don&#39;t understand why there has to be a number set and a time line set for refugees, when we could just accept refugees who have passed certain tests (speaking English, society integration, learn beliefs and values of communities that they are moving into [even though it may not be their own], etc) , at a slower pace. </p>

<p>Given that we hope to encourage them to not vote for Trump in the future, they&#39;ve presented us with an opportunity to converse, learn about how we democrats failed to attract their vote (for future strategizing), and perhaps persuade them come over to our side.

<p>You think that an organisation meant to appeal to roughly half the population of the entire United States shouldn&#39;t have any positions that you personally disagree with?</p>

<p>Regardless, you realise that Shareblue is not &quot;the Democratic Party&quot;, nor is it run by the Democratic Party, right? It&#39;s run by some people who support the Democratic Party. So the situation is &quot;some people who support Democrats are pushing out messages that you may not agree with&quot;.

<p>This is simply untrue, you cannot buy the type of supporters T_D has, if you could Shareblue and the other attempts would have been successful, T_D is the result of Trump being a huge underdog (Odd for a billionaire to be an underdog) and people get extremely passionate about underdogs, he was also running on the message of representing the average Joe, and the average Joe see&#39;s themselves as an underdog and thus empathise with a billionaire.</p>

<p>Trump won on passion, which is why the posts on T_D are so passionate, you can&#39;t pay for shitposting like that. </p>

<p>Take it from a T_D regular, we all know we&#39;re playing this online persona but it&#39;s strictly for that sub, check the accounts of people shouting MAGA and GIVE THIS GUY A COAT etc, outside of that sub it&#39;s just normal users chatting on other subs, but once you go to T_D you&#39;re a 110% Trump cock blower and happy about it too.  </p>

<p>Yeah, the whole &quot;I got downvoted, NO ONE WANTS TO TALK TO ME&quot; shit is retarded. Most of the die hard Trump supporters at this point are so far up his ass that they twist themselves around in the worst ways, and talking to them basically results in them doing 2 or 3 things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Blame Hillary</li>
<li>Blame &quot;Tolerant Left&quot;</li>
<li>Tell us to shutup and he won</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;ve had a few good conversations with Trump supporters. The ones who are polite and not totally useless morons who just derail any conversation with childish calls of &quot;FAKENEWS REEEEEEEEEE&quot; it&#39;s tiresome to deal with. </p>

<p>The_Donald only <em>exists</em> because it is subject to &quot;mod rule&quot;.</p>

<p>Start something about Trump and it only has two possible directions: Either it is managed, criticisms pruned, tailored to fans, nay-sayers <strong>deleted</strong>...</p>

<p>...or it evolves to represent what Trump actually is: an empty character who was <em>never</em> going to drain the swamp, puts his right-wing corporate cronies in high places and panders to the lowest common denominators of fear and anti-establishment sentiment (which, for most of his voters, are now clearly revealed as the lies that sane people have been seeing forever).</p>

<p>A new, &quot;honest&quot; Trump sub would fill up with so much criticism that not even former/excommunicated T_D&#39;s would enjoy it.</p>

<p>To paraphrase a famous quote &quot;Reality has a distinct anti-Trump bias&quot;...</p>

<p>Not being invited to be included in a meeting held in a small room IS NOT THE SAME as being &quot;banned&quot;!  All the outrage is just more manufactured FAKE NEWS!  Those not present were given copies of the pool report; they didn&#39;t miss a damn thing!  And there will UNDOUBTEDLY be other occasions when these whiners are invited and others (the smaller outlets) will not be.  Will you be pitching a fit when this happens?  No!  Your one-sided agenda is just so painfully obvious that it&#39;s hard to understand why you&#39;re not too embarrassed to pursue it; you&#39;re just making absolute FOOLS of yourself.  </p>

<p>And where is the outrage over the exclusion of reporters of all the small media outlets who are prevented from attending the official press briefings because the room will only hold about 50 people?  WHERE IS YOUR (FAUX) OUTRAGE ON THEIR BEHALF?  Report back to your masters at Clinton News Network (or whichever other fake news outlet you work for) and let them know they&#39;re only fooling themselves and DRIVING MODERATE VOTERS FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY!  Keep up the good work!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Screaming fake news every time you disagree with something is retarded. For the most part, Donald has been criticising the media for their &quot;dishonesty&quot; and has been actively running his mouth talking about instances which never happened or stating &quot;alternative facts&quot;. He has since picked up criticisms from news outlets for the hypocrisy he is creating around himself and looks to have subsequently forbid them from taking part in a press conference. He is simply giving fuel to a fire. </p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t help himself in these scenarios. If he can&#39;t take criticisms then he is not in the correct job. Every US president in modern history has had their critics. Trump looks to be creating more and more every day with his, and his team&#39;s actions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a trump supporter and I agree completely. I think there&#39;s so much division that everyone is doubling down to the point of unfairness. People who blindly praise trump are failing to address legitimate concerns. The other side is anxious so any news that comes out will be distilled into an anti trump talking point without considering all the facts. </p>

<p>For example the recent transgender controversy will hurt transgender people, yes. But the arguments about title nine were complex. It&#39;s likely that trump was motivated to act in order to appease his anti LGBT supporters but it&#39;s very reductive to say title nine was only about transgender bathrooms. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been reading a lot about the health care issue and while I am insured and dependent on the ACA some of the ideas the gop suggest are not bad. Opponents imply everyone will lose coverage right away and die in order to scare us but that&#39;s not accurate. It&#39;s important to have all the facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a democrat, didn&#39;t vote Hillary - but I live somewhere that it was irrelevant (which is a problem in itself, I think state votes should be split like NE/ME, not winner-take-all).  I&#39;m so sick of Trump supporters still bringing up Hillary.  He&#39;s president now, it&#39;s time to stop trumpeting the electoral victory and start leading the country, which he has done very little of in his first month.  He has signed a bunch of EO&#39;s for theatrics and ultimately just repealed some environmental and consumer protection laws (nice?).  I&#39;m waiting for him to do ANYthing that does GOOD.. for people who aren&#39;t coal executives or predatory financial brokers.</p>

<p>Trump supporters ALL seem to have this internal ability to translate his intentions.  Which is wrong, and dangerous as fuck - especially since they deny his actions.  The man is an idiot and idiots around the world are listening to him and reaching into their guts to pull out this deeper meaning.  Nobody knows what the man intends to do with things like legal weed because we have no accountability of the guy.  He lies and changes his position on a whim, he&#39;s petulant and reactive.. his own staff can&#39;t even get on the same page for the press.  His supporters either don&#39;t care or stay unaware in their safe spaces, making nonsensical claims - usually rife with hypocrisy and double-standard.  Not willing to get into a true fact based debate - it always spirals into this emotional (and usually xenophobic) argument.  But whatever, anybody who claims to be a republican at this point is firmly party over country - that has been their whole platform since the TEA party reared its ugly head, it&#39;s been a disgraceful show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, there are different ways people can confront cognitive dissonance. The straightforward way is to accept that your worldview is incorrect, and alter it to match the new information. For people who cant seem to do that, they can employ ego defenses such as rationalization, denial or projection to offset their dissonance. T_d is like a beautiful museum of ego defenses, you can see the whole array of them on display whenevet Trump does something extremely difficult to defend. When the level of dissonance gets really overwhelming, they will collectively pretend that the bad news of the day (that is plastered accross the front page of every newspaper and news website) simply never happened. Like I said, its beautiful in a perplexing way, like some kind of fantastical outsider art.</p>

<p>That requires your worldview to have been incorrect in the first place. To judge whether people are actually experiencing that you&#39;d need to full understand their world view. </p>

<p>Ego defenses would also only be necessary if the change to world view needed was so dramatic that they&#39;d prefer to not accept it. I have yet to see any combination of actions by Trump severe enough to justify that myself; other people may be different. </p>

<p>You also need to take into account the social forces in play, ingroups are always fortified when they are under threat. This changes the cost - benefit ratio a lot. </p>

<p>People can, and do, live with cognitive dissonance on a daily basis. If they didn&#39;t then every persons believes and world view would have to be a perfect match for society. </p>

<p>That&#39;s based on the assumption that people in t_D never leave t_D. So you can&#39;t really assume that just because it&#39;s not on t_Ds front page that people there are ignoring it. You could say exactly the same thing of places like r/politics - when something bad happens its never there. </p>

<p>The dissonance becomes unavoidable when an event happens that makes Trump look bad whether one accepts it as fact or denies it. An example of this is when Trump&#39;s own scotus nominee Gorsuch harshly criticized Trump&#39;s handling of the immigration executive order. To accept Gorsuch&#39;s criticism is to infer that Trump made a bad mistake with his executive order. To declare that Gorsuch is a hack is to infer that Trump&#39;s claim of having impeccable judgement is false. It&#39;s a lose-lose situation for people who consider Trump to be infallible, and just as I expected, I found zero mentions of Gorsuch on that day or the day after that story came out on r/the_donald, even though he was their hero up until that point. The denial ego defense was in full effect.</p>

<p>I saw a post on t_D where subscribers were discussing their disbelief that much of reddit distrust Trump, and someone said they were unsubscribing r/pics because they saw a post critical of Trump. That&#39;s the kind of thing i&#39;m talking about, if they don&#39;t like it, they turn on the blinders, i.e. protecting the ego.</p>

<p>Cognitive dissonance is overrated to start with. It does describe accurately and experience you could have in a given situation but the idea that its explains everything is laughable. </p>

<p>OP seems to be operating on the assumption that everything happening with Trump is inherently contradictory to what people expected. What is actually happening is that OP is taking his own perspective on the current state of affairs and wondering why t_D isn&#39;t collapsing from dissonance. You can&#39;t really generalise like that. </p>

<p>You first need to understand what the individuals in question actually believe before you can determine if their beliefs are directly contradictory. </p>

<p>I supported Trump for several reason, none of which have yet been undermined by actions Trump has taken. Why would I experience cognitive dissonance about that? </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the question of whether cognitive dissonance is even worth discussing in this case. People hold contradictory beliefs all the time, it&#39;s not unusual it&#39;s actually probably the norm. Often the actions of an individual don&#39;t match what they believe so how does everyone survive.</p>

<p>A more appropriate thing to consider would be cost - benefit analysis. Especially in this situation where both sides are so hostile to each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>youre nuts. hes cutting taxes for the middle class and jacking it up for rich people. eliminating taxes if you make less than $25,000. hes returning wasteful federal regulation issues to the people by deregulating and shrinking the federal governement. the defecit has decreased $12bn in his first month, compared to a $200bn gain in Obama&#39;s first month. the people in his cabinet are not corrupt and he has forced them all to sign a 5 year anti-lobbying agreement, which also places a lifetime ban on lobbying for foreign countries. what exactly has he sold? other than the 20% of our uranium futures to russia. wait, oh yeah that was hillary. i forgot. she walked away with $150m. funny how her foundation closed less than a week after election day. if it was so charitable and beneficial you&#39;d think her supporters would be flooding it with donations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the first month of a presidency, the president has not had time to effect meaningful change on the defecit. The defecit right now is still following the trend created over the last 8 years by Obama. Same for the first month of Obama&#39;s presidency, following the trend set by Bush. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, reddit is exactly what youre describing, but on a much bigger scale. banning dissenting news orgs? i thought the NYT and CNN purported to be unbiased? why would they be dissenting if they are unbiased? nobody is preventing them from writing whatever they want. they are only called fake when they misrepresent with a dishonest headline or just flat out lie, which they do all the time. the first amendment guarantees nobody can be arrested for speaking their mind. it does not guarantee that people have to listen to your bullshit, especially if it is dangerously dishonest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The wall is going to add more debt. The government is going to be as corrupt as it is or even more. The Muslim ban was on countries that haven&#39;t caused recent terrorist attacks in the US. Coincidentally, the countries he didn&#39;t banned were countries who HAVE caused terrorist attacks in the US and COINCIDENTALLY are countries that Trump has business ties with. </p>

<p>Trump is such  toxic, immoral, and a liar. He manipulated so many to vote for him by using fear and intimidation towards others. He demeaned women, he generalized muslims, and to him, the only &quot;illegal immigrants&quot; are Mexicans who &quot;rape and kill.&quot; </p>

<p>Trump is filled with so much bullshit. </p>

<p>People like him because he speaks his mind, but guess what, half of the shit he wants to enforce would be illegal under our constitution. Making trump our president was clearly a step back instead of a step forward. What a fucking shame. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>illegal immigrants cost over $120bn to the country in welfare every year. the wall will cost $20bn. removing the non-team players will cost like $1bn. its a net win. get over yourself. trump has already reduced the debt by $12bn in 35 days so the wall is half paid0for. you&#39;re throwing around ad hominems with ZERO statistics or reports or claims. your argument is based in opinion, which means its not really an argument ar all. How does the Saudi Arabian government, who gave hillary clinton $150m dollars to win, treat women? how do they handle illegal immigrants who wish to make them adapt to ther beliefs? they kill them. with stones. or cages that they throw in the water. Trump is the anti-sharia. sharia is the enemy, it is not welcome here. he has done more for women than any executive in his field. maybe if the general muslim population was more proactive in the fight against jihad and domestic terror, they wouldnt be generalized into the caterogy of &quot;accessory.&quot; their silence is bringing the generalization on themselves. trump got elected because most of the country agree with what he was saying. i havent heard any bullshit from him tho, just this <a href="http://www.track-trump.com">http://www.track-trump.com</a> and i am holding him to his promises made. he is through about 40% of them, and it is less than day 40 of 100, so he is ahead of schedule. his platform is open and transparent, it prioritizes veterans and the middle class over immigrants and criminals. if he fails on it we will call him out. if he has actually committed any kind of illegal breach, he would have been destroyed already. you need to stop being such a worry wort, go out an do your job and make money, add to the GDP, and enjoy life. trump is the most qualified president to have ever run in our lifetimes. everything is going to be ok.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with your statements regarding money if there was really no conflict of interest. The president of the United States who owns several businesses will only run this country as a business for his own gain because his businesses are some of the worst that this country has seen. He is an individual that claims so many riches but can&#39;t even pay taxes. </p>

<p>Something that I hate when arguing about trump is how the other person will always bring up Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton. Who even brought them up into the statement? No one. Can you please tell me something that trump has done for women besides belittling them? </p>

<p>You CAN NOT say his administration is transparent when he just banned several news outlets from his briefings.</p>

<p>&quot;Trump is the most qualified,&quot; is a statement that you should keep to yourself because quite honestly, half of the world knows he&#39;s not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice analogy. What would make more sense is to.. start cutting more trees down in forest fire territory and using the wood to benefit the US economy and infrastructure building.. glass half full</p>

<p>The US is in serious economic and social trouble. To go down the same road is fcking stupid.. and I&#39;m sure mistakes will be made. Atleast you&#39;ll know about it and won&#39;t be hidden behind the Leftist media and CIA, or whichever of the 17 intelligence agencies that are doing god&#39;s work for all of us.

    <div class="md"><p>The US economy has been steadily improving for the last 8 years. DOW hit an all-time high, unemployment went from ~10% to ~4%, the housing market has been recovering, etc. To keep going down that road would have been the smart choice. Are there areas of the US that haven&#39;t seen a lot of that improvement? <em>Absolutely</em>. Some parts of middle america are hurting bad. But coal jobs will <em>never</em> come back. Automation has already made most factory jobs obsolete, and outsourcing low-skill labor is far, far cheaper than our labor will ever realistically be barring a new great depression. We need to reach out and retrain and help people in those areas, not feed them lies and false promises. </p>

<p>And off topic, but cutting down trees in forest fire territory actually doesn&#39;t make sense. The forest need the fertile ashes, and the undergrowth needs to be burned away so new growth can thrive. That&#39;s why firefighters generally conduct <em>controlled</em> burns rather than simply cutting down growth.  </p>

<p>It depends on how you measure it. Using the measure traditionally reported, unemployment is ~4%.

    <div class="md"><p>With the amount pro Trump content and subs are censored on here, it&#39;s impossible to start any other sub and have it gain any traction.  The_Donald just benefitted because it existed before Reddit realized how popular the candidate was, and got too big to completely shut down.  New subs are just brigades, spammed, and consoled to the point nobody ever finds out about them.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a t_d user&#39;s findings of odd behavior that is pretty obviously shilling from an objective standpoint, although this obviously isn&#39;t evidence of ShareBlue or CTR doing it: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4vsyul/rpolitics_taken_over_by_paid_campaigners_andor/">https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4vsyul/rpolitics_taken_over_by_paid_campaigners_andor/</a></p>

<p>Hope that helps. Keep in mind that CTR has been revived as ShareBlue along with some other shadow organizations that basically have paid users spending their time spreading propaganda against the political opponents of their bosses.

<p>However, security people aren&#39;t 100% on it, mostly because a lot of the releases from the USGov on it were funny:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The DHS list is none of these things, as Lee, founder of the cyber security firm Dragos, discovered when he ran the list against a stored cache of known clean traffic his company keeps around for testing. The results stunned him. “We had thousands of hits,” he says. “We had an extraordinary high amount of false positives on this dataset… Six of them were Yahoo e-mail servers.”</p>

<p>Reddit is way more orchestrated than you realize. Mods and power users spend all day on reddit and as soon as they see a sub like that popping up, they can hijack it. </p>

<p>You see the videos about shills on reddit recently and think that there arent both left and right? There is a reason you rarely hear such polar conversation in real life. Not everyone is so crazy and thinks in such absolutes. </p>

<p>There is influence and power in controlling the conversation and its been proven time and time again that it can be pretty easily done. As long as they can hijack a sub before it gets very popular by either astroturfing it, downvoting all the posts, or getting their own users into mod positions, its not going to get enough traction to become what it was intended to before it is corrupted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time I see an article on the first few Reddit front pages on Trump ALL I see is negative comments on Trump.  THIS is why they are kicking people out, plain and simple.  And I don&#39;t blame them.  It&#39;s hard to even get any kind of conversation going on Trump b/c of this.  It&#39;s censoring his supporters who want to debate issues and the sad part is I would like to have discussions with people about Trump but when people can&#39;t even see you&#39;re there unless they filter through all the comments then there&#39;s no point.</p>

You&#39;ll notice on most days in conservative and Republican subs, that the mods make up a bulk of the front page submissions; often half or more of the front page.  These are subs with tens of thousands of users and yet consistently mod posts will be on top of the heap. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m banned from <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> for life. Reason? &quot;Wow slow down friend&quot; because I went through the new comments on a thread and tried to explain to everyone who didn&#39;t read the article and was confused what a certain policy was. I was just trying to inform people but they rather keep the people ignorant I guess.</p>

<p>I got banned from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> for being mean to someone and calling them a shill for three days but I guess I deserved it. I&#39;m super anti-Trump btw.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had multiple posts deleted from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for being anti-Trump, including one that reached <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> #20 and then the mods deleted it because they were scared. Honestly worldnews etc subreddits are really uptight but this sub is the worst when it comes to censorship, almost on par with the_donald. I&#39;ve never been banned or had my post deleted for my OPINION from any subreddit, except for this one, the_donald, offmychest (because I post on KiA) and ShitRedditSays. So I hate it when people try to lump in news/politics/worldnews with places like SRS and t_d.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sick and tired of this bullshit about private prisons. They house 6% of prisoners. SIX PERCENT! The vast majority of prisoners are in public prisons. If you really did want to make more profits for the private prison companies, privatizing existing facilities would be a FUCK TON more effective than expanding the pool of prisoners. There are plenty of prisoners here already that you could just relocate to private facilities. Why not do that?</p>

<p>Private prisons make a few billion dollars a year. They&#39;re a tiny industry. The entire private prison industry is probably 1/20 the size of Lockheed Martin, a single military contractor. They simply don&#39;t have the size to muster significant political influence. The private prison industry is probably 0.02% of our GDP.</p>

<p>Far more significant are the contractors who build and supply public prisons and use public prison labor. The Trump administration has already taken steps to fight these interests and the perverse incentives they create, by abolishing no-bid contracts, using smaller local contractors rather than national monopolies for federal prisons, ensuring transparency in the contract process, and cutting down on private use of prison labor.</p>

<p>The problem is most trump supporters just want to deny anything bad all the time, continue to point to hillary/obama (seriously, when will they get over that and accept that tehy can&#39;t blame someone who didn&#39;t even get elected) and deny that anything anti-donnie is posted by &quot;very fakenews&quot;</p>

<p>Same with T_D. I have complained numerous times, got banned, came back and fought for Trump. Not because I liked the mods but because Trump&#39;s victory was more important. Now that Trump has won, holding his feet to the fire is more important. It makes no sense to support the mod&#39;s censorship now.</p>

<p>I am fairly consistent in my reasoning.</p>

<p>As for suckers, liberals are the biggest suckers IMO. At least Trump is keeping his promises.</p>

<p>You can do that with executive orders, but not with the support of most Americans. Unless everyone in the United States jumps up and says &quot;I love dictatorships!&quot; it will ultimately backfire. Trump is rolling back whatever hard earned protections for Americans he can, it&#39;ll be just easy to roll them back when he leaves office... with executive orders</p>

I watched for years people complaining about Obama playing golf and the cost of his trips to Hawaii. Even Trump was tweeting about it.

    <div class="md"><p>Are you basing it off the Washington Post report? Few thing to keep in mind - </p>

<p>A. It is an estimate by WaPo. Not hard data.</p>

<p>B. WaPo, in its estimate, includes expenses for protecting every Trump family member. It&#39;s not Trump&#39;s fault that his family has received threats. </p>

<p>C. Trump apparently and correct me if I am wrong on this, paid for Abe&#39;s trip to Mar-a-lago. Something WaPo didn&#39;t consider.</p>

<p>So the fact that more money has gone into Trump&#39;s trips is not only misleading(as he has a bigger family than Obama) but also not based on hard fact. </p>

<p>If it does come out, based on hard data, that Trump(&amp;not his family) cost tax payers money for travelling while NOT working, then yeah, I wouldn&#39;t like it. But if he does diplomacy, like he did with Abe, during these travels, there is no problem. The gripe with Obama was that a lot of the money was spent on his vacations. If a lot of tax payer money is spent on Donald Trump&#39;s vacations, sure I would be pissed.</p>

<p>Obama had one incident where Fox was left out, either intentionally or unintentionally depending on who you ask. He never outright blocked organizations from a press briefing. To compare the two is hilariously disingenuous, just like most comparisons you people use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not accurate to compare censorship on t_d with r/politics for example. T_D is specifically a forum for supporting a certain politician. Obviously they should be able to kick people out of the community who do not support him. If I start a club for people who love Star Wars, it&#39;s reasonable for me to kick people out who hate Star Wars and complain about it. However, if I start a club for debating about Star Wars, then it would be a dick move to kick out Star Wars haters. In a similar way, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is not supposed to have a political agenda and is supposed to be a neutral forum. I do not have a problem with r/hillaryclinton kicking out Trump supporters, nor r/the_donald kicking out Hillary supporters. My problem is with allegedly neutral subreddits that have been hijacked by a political agenda.</p>

<p>I agree, on this occasion with the weed thing it&#39;d be like complaining there were no tits at the strip club and the club kicking you out for conplaining, Trump said he&#39;d leave it up to the state and even if he didn&#39;t he was elected with the idea that he&#39;d have a business savvy mindset to it aswell, there is nothing business savvy or clever for the country about harsher weed enforcement. </p>

<p>I said this in a previous post, we Trump supporters pre-election bragged and boasted that we actually had the better weed candidate and everyone was stupid for worrying, should this go ahead and Trump not say or do anything, rub our faces in it loud and happily, because we sure as fuck would have done it to you for Hillary. </p>

<p>This sub is also very quick to ban people who voice dissenting opinions, so it should be surprising that there are so few comments compared to the number of downvotes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course many t_d regulars responded to tell me how/why I was wrong, but ironically my post was remove by the mods and I was banned shortly thereafter, so I never got a chance to reply. Instead of just leaving it at that, I decided to PM several people who responded and ask if they could explain or justify my ban, since it didn&#39;t seem to fit the explanations and defenses they gave to justify the strict moderation and censorship.</p>

<p>While I kept my PMs civil, I honestly wasn&#39;t expecting much...figured I&#39;d probably get called some names and maybe hear some MAGA rhetoric, then move on. To my surprise, I actually had some reasonable and insightful conversations with t_d regulars who seemed angry and frustrated with the moderation and general direction the sub is headed.</p>

<p>No. There are checks and balances that will hold back Trump if he goes authoritarian(which he won&#39;t). Reddit mods have no checks and balances on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much all political rules and regulations can be exploited in some way or another. The process for change is carried out, sometimes over long periods of time, by swaying public opinion and voting the change out/modified. Democracy takes time, and I think a lot of Americans who voted for Trump are just tired of how long it takes for certain changes to take effect. I don&#39;t blame them, but the issue is picking and choosing which process should remain, and which should be expedited. Which greater good is &quot;the&quot; greater good? Too many differing opinions, built on a system that does not allow expediting change. Ugh!</p>

<p>Secondly, I broke no rules. I merely asked why the words Ben Shapiro were part of the auto filter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been a republican for years, and have worked on campaigns, have worked on the hill for a republican office, etc. I was banned from the conservative subreddit which I have been a semi regular commentor on because I openly opposed Devos on there. The mods then blocked me from messaging them because I messaged them asking why. I then pm&#39;d one of them to finally get an unban but it was a little ridiculous the way they are acting. Yes I know some liberals jump on when it gets 400+ upvotes, but generally most commenting in the sub is by conservatives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my point of view as a <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> subscriber, based off of casual observation.</p>

<p>Consider what would happen if the mods allowed criticism of Trump on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. It would become <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. It&#39;s easy to see the majority of Reddit is against Trump. On most days, multiple anti-Trump posts are at the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and <a href="/r/popular">/r/popular</a>. With <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> opening up itself to criticism of Trump, the sub would be subjected to mass posting of negative propaganda. I suspect nothing positive about Trump would ever reach <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> again. The same reasoning also addresses why criticism of the mods is not allowed. Anti-Trump subreddits would brigade <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>, attacking the mods in the hope of forming distrust and probably to try to get mods replaced with people who would further attempt to make <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> a place of anti-Trump sentiment.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the censorship, at all, but I defend it for now because Reddit&#39;s user base have made it necessary in order for <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> to function.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A. Removing censorship and particularly the rule of concern trolling, will give T_D the moral high ground.</p>

<p>B. T_D&#39;s posts already barely make it to the top of r/all.</p>

<p>C. Criticising mods will sow discord and disunity? Why does unity around Trump have value? Shouldn&#39;t you try to hold him accountable? Also, if someone makes accusations against mods, you can ask for proof and make up your mind based on facts.</p>

<p>D. Most of the people banned are those who criticise Trump constructively. If you remove people critical of you, you will lose your customer(voters). There is a reason companies ask for feedback . So they can improve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A. I know that. What difference would the moral high ground make now when the rest of Reddit is jerking off to how much they hate Trump?</p>

<p>B. Right, since the algorithm change that limits one post from each subreddit to reach <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> so long as its not a stickied post. The work around for that being make multiple subreddits that have the same goal in mind.</p>

<p>C. Unity matters when there is a constant barrage of negativity and propaganda and down votes. I would never know any good things Trump does if it weren&#39;t for The_Donald and other alternative news sites. It would always be half-truths and twisted facts to undermine what Trump is doing. Yes, holding Trump accountable is important. Good thing there are plenty of other subreddits officially and unofficially dedicated to doing that to near ludicrous degrees.</p>

<p>Regarding the mods, sure, I can be shown proof and make decisions for myself. The issue, however is trust and unity. Allowing open criticism of the mods would invites our opponents to do their best to undermine the mod&#39;s activities. Sow distrust. Demands to remove existing mods. It would open The_Donald to the threat of the mods being replaced with people looking to subvert the existing subreddit and turn it into <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>D. I would love to know how you know that.</p>

<p>Again let me reiterate...</p>

<p>You want to state your case against something Trump has done. Good. Pick a subreddit. Just not <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. And let us present a counter to your case in the only place on Reddit where it is allowed and it will be publicly visible on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.</p>

<p>The extreme censorship and nazi like banning of <em>any</em> firm if dissent, including anger at broken promises is on purpose. </p>

<p>The mods, likely working with the Trump administration, are creating an army of only 100% completely servile brainwashed monkeys. </p>

<p>Of course they can&#39;t see it and if course they don&#39;t want to. It offers them the one thing they can&#39;t get in the real world, acceptance. </p>

<p>My estimates have the place at about 20k actual users (not including bots). A couple of thousand brainwashed space monkeys with a desperate lack of self worth in each state is all that they need or want. Only the most unquestioning and loyal are suitable to become brownshirts/redhats. </p>

<p>They literally don&#39;t care about the cognitive dissonance they&#39;re experiencing about now. 1st ammendment trampling and broken promises. Because they don&#39;t care about those things. They only care about feeling accepted by something. Anything. </p>

<p>This is incredibly misleading. The Ninth circuit has 80% of its decisions <em>that are reviewed by the supreme court</em> reversed. The Supreme court hears 0.177% of cases from the federal circuit, and 0.151% of cases from the Ninth circuit. So of the 114,199 cases the Ninth Circuit has ruled on between 1999 and 2008 (the date the paper I&#39;m getting my numbers from was published), 138 have been overturned. The Ninth Circuit gets 0.12% of all cases overturned, not 80%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, my apologies, I thought you were using that number to suggest that this ruling is likely to be overturned or is in some way significantly likely to be flawed. If your only point is that that Supreme Court tends to disagree with them on cases they agree to hear, then that&#39;s easy to explain. Like you said, they&#39;re the most liberal court in the country. The Supreme Court until recently has been a 5-4 conservative majority. It&#39;s just different beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll believe it when I see it.</p>

<p>A Great Wall is also beyond the executive branch alone. Doesn&#39;t stop him from promising it.</p>

<p>Same thing with making Mexico pay for it.
Remember when the Trump administration proposed a 20% tariff on Mexican goods to fund the wall? Yeah... that means AMERICANS are paying for the wall.</p>

<p>Re: Obamacare, on 1/17, Trump said:</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re going to have insurance for everybody,&quot; Trump told The Washington Post. &quot;There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can&#39;t pay for it, you don&#39;t get it. That&#39;s not going to happen with us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;[They] can expect to have great health care. It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better,&quot;</p>

<p>Good luck. If I see a plan that actually does this, I&#39;ll be all for it. As far as I can tell, Donald and the Republicans are fumbling hard on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but they refuse to do that they can&#39;t even fathom that he has some flaws, according to them Obama was the worst president ever, so the person they chose can&#39;t have flaws. They have so much hate for Obama from a mix of stupid conspiracy theories to their own lives going to shit once he was in office, it&#39;s like he was their scapegoat. 
But Trump has failed them he said he&#39;d get Mexico to pay for the wall he hasn&#39;t done that. He said he&#39;d protect the LGBTQ community yet he removed a law to protect them. They voted for Trump cause Hillary was in Wall streets back pocket and Trump would serve the common man, look at his cabinet and ask yourself if they really give two shits what happened to you. </p>

<p>And then there&#39;s their incredible hypocrisy. 
Hillary was under investigation by the FBI, the FBI must be right she&#39;s a crook but now that Trump is firmly in office what the FBI and CIA says is a lie. 
Hillary got money from Saudi Arabia according to some not 100% proven sources, we must investigate her.
Trumps camp had contact with Russia continuously according to our intelligence agencies, leave it alone you&#39;re lying. Or how about how r/The_Donald had multiple posts about how much time Obama spent golfing but look at Trump or how Obama spent our money on himself when Trump is going to easily beat how much Obama spent in a year in months.</p>

<p>And it amazes me how they are completely okay with him putting down the media, can you imagine if Obama said that shit about Breitbart or Infowars. 
It&#39;s so hard for them to admit after they thought they won they elected someone who&#39;s incompetent. Trump is not for you Trump is for him and his friends </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. This has Jeff sessions written all over it. Sessions has a point though- Federal law over rides state law. If Federal law stops Marijuana, then it must be enforced. Jeff&#39;s job is to enforce the law and not make it. So, in a way, Sessions is right.</p>

<p>Having said that, Trump promised to leave weed upto the states and he must remove weed from schedule 1 classification. Change federal law so weed is not illegal.</p>

<p>Having said that, the_donald is a cult now. The mods are full blown authoritarians. Worse than most other subs.</p>

<p>The way I see it, and having observed him on the Apprentice, there are striking similarities to how he ran his business, how he ran the show and how he is running his presidency. Trump delegates and lets people perform. He then evaluates them and if they have done well, he rewards them. Else he fires them. </p>

<p>I would say that Trump&#39;s biggest weakness is articulation. You can be a terrible president but if you articulate your side&#39;s position well, you will be remembered as great. Opposite is true if your articulation is bad.</p>

<p>Does that not make her a shill? That whole wing of the party is bought and paid for, and they&#39;re constantly making it hard to talk to conservatives as a liberal. It&#39;d be a lot easier to get along if I didn&#39;t have to be associated with them, so I&#39;m not about to defend Hillary Clinton&#39;s actions because Trump did something similar.  I will only point out Trump&#39;s actions to call him a hypocrite for criticizing her for something before doing it himself, but that doesn&#39;t justify her actions or make her not a shill. She is a shill. I don&#39;t even mind if Trump supporters call her a shill, never mind how hypocritical.

    <div class="md"><p>Dude he hatessss the CIA why do you think the elusive &quot;shadow government&quot; is suddenly in the media while also ironically shitting on Trump? His intentions are clear because they also align with the insane human trafficking agenda this country has ignored (along with many others) that ties into working with various drug cartels all over the place. US soldiers have been told to guard opium fields in the Middle East but you want to tell me there&#39;s nothing shady going on and Trump just hates weed?? Come on now... </p>

<p>So yea he&#39;s probably going to crack down on weed being sold illegally but that was one of those inevitable things that goes along with legalization of something. You can&#39;t just sell it anymore and it&#39;s going to matter where you get it... </p>

<p>Do you have any idea why we guard poppy fields in afhanistan? Do you know our goal behind it, or who we are guarding them from? Do you think it&#39;s because the west is processing the poppys to be sold as opium? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I will absolutely admit I&#39;m not super-informed on the topic, I have friends in the military and have my own reasons for believing certain things but I can&#39;t say anything for sure. 
It just seems to me, that since the US has gone to war with various countries over oil while not yielding any major influx of oil from those countries, while also having another massive heroine epidemic breakout during the past few years; idk it doesn&#39;t seem like stretch thinking that our government is making deals over something other than oil. Multiple corporately-controlled factions would gain from it (hospitals, pharmaceutical etc. especially with the OxyContin getting banned and switched to a &quot;slightly less addictive&quot; variation), I mean I can&#39;t say for sure but it seems to fit? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a heads up, this a long one lol. </p>

<p>Okay, so first of all, very little opium/heroin produced in Afghanistan gets into America. It&#39;s almost impossible to smuggle, it would have to go through Europe. And why would they smuggle it through Europe when Europe is just as addicted to opiates as America is? All opiates from Afghanistan remain in Europe. We get our heroin from down south. </p>

<p>Now, poppys have been grown and cultivated into opium for thousands of years in Afghanistan, literally thousands of years. And it will be cultivated for another thousand years. Nothing will change this. The federal government has essentially no control over the areas where poppys are grown, and even if they did they would never enforce a law against poppy cultivation. Too many farmers rely on it as their only source of income. </p>

<p>Now, since the federal regime has no control over these areas, the areas are left to the control of warlords. These warlords essentially enslave the local farmers and keep all the earnings for themselves. With the invasion of Afghanistan, this presented the allies with a very big conundrum. What do they do here? They have warlords who are assisting the allies against the Taliban exploiting civilians who are producing drugs that the federal government of Afghanistan is refusing to regulate. What do you do in this situation? Burn the crops? That would hurt the farmers. Force the federal government to outlaw poppys? That would hurt the relationship between the allied governments and federal regime. Do they force the warlords to stop exploring poppy farmers? This is about the worst idea, if they did this the warlords would turn on the allies and go back to the Taliban. So what  do they do? There is literally no good solution. </p>

<p>So they guarded the fields. They just stationed troops around the fields. This way they weren&#39;t directly telling the warlords to back off (since the warlords were doing this exploiting under the table, in &quot;secret&quot;), they were just there claiming they were protecting the local farmers from the Taliban. The farmers were free to cultivate the poppys, the warlords stayed away from the fields, and the farmers were free to sell the opium without first going through the warlords as a middle man. The only ones who got fucked over were the allied European nations who were looking the other way as heroin and opium was smuggled into their countries. But like, it was coming in anyways, and heroin will always flow. If not from the mideast, than the far east. At least if you know where the supply is coming from you can attempt to curtail it once it arrives in your nations. </p>

<p>Now, to me, this explanation makes perfect sense. And I spent a long time in Afghanistan , this is exactly how this country operates. </p>

<p>Could the US be involved in the sale of the opiates? Sure. But there is no evidence of that. Literally the only evidence is the soldiers guarding the fields. But it&#39;s not like this is done in secrecy. There are pictures, literally recruiting pictures, of soldiers in poppy fields. Dont you think if the CIA or some other agency was selling the opium they would have used paramilitary officers or mercenaries to guard the fields? It doesn&#39;t make sense that they would use the military, and it doesn&#39;t make sense the military wouldnt classify these operations if they knew something illegal was going on. </p>

<p>So, to sum it up, you could be right, but I believe there is a much more plausible explanation as to why soldiers guard poppy fields. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look you know better than I do and I want to believe that I&#39;m totally off base with all of it and I very well could be. I just think it&#39;s worth mentioning that the heroine epidemic has spiked in this country since our presence overseas and our initial reasons for taking action did not yield the results we were told they would. Again, I&#39;m not super informed and have only looked at numbers (addiction and epidemics were part of my research for my thesis last year and it kind of blew my mind) so while I know I&#39;m looking at it out of context, the numbers and dates are very interesting.</p>

<p>Thank you for answering though, I really haven&#39;t gotten any input from someone with any real perspective and I&#39;m actually really glad it&#39;s not as bad as it looks. I mean it could be lol but it&#39;s good to know that it&#39;s not so much direct involvement as it is protecting assets, which I completely understand and agree with.</p>

<p>You are being downvoted because your reading comprehension is poor.

    <div class="md"><p>Well maybe you shouldn&#39;t act so surprised as to why the sub is acting the same as it has been for the last two months. At least this can kind of be attributed as a conspiracy, mods on The_Don are hiding and censoring shit, it might be a shitty conspiracy but it&#39;s a light one at that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say posts like this are better than the million+ &quot;Hillary colluded with DNC!&quot; or &quot;Obama dropped 10,000 bombs&quot; reposts that we see here every single week. It&#39;s safe to say that less than two percent of the posts here are actual new conspiracies, or provide new information to older conspiracies. The rest is just reposts and propaganda for the most part. </p>

<p>Sorry, didn&#39;t mean to come across as harsh in my first comment, I just haven&#39;t been happy with how this sub has turned out since Trump won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If everybody likes them? What&#39;re you going on about? The law is a blunt instrument that doesn&#39;t take account for popularity. Being born here does not make them legal. Those are the Dreamers Obama pardoned with DACA. Trump has wavered on how to treat those people but some are already being rounded up and deported in a wrong place wrong time kind of way. While the very presence of these people in our country is technically a crime, that&#39;s no reason to totally uproot them (especially those born here!!!) so long as they aren&#39;t getting involved with these &quot;bad elements&quot; Trump is so fond of talking about. Those are felony convictions. Widening the cause of deportation to lower-level crimes or even just accusations (see Duterte) is the wrong way of going about this. It makes the particular tragedy general, and we should focus on minimizing human cost while still enforcing immigration laws. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never mentioned all Mexicans. But you&#39;re right - I equated the Dreamers with people who were born here. I guess my mistake reveals the fact that I don&#39;t make much a distinction, personally, between people who crossed before birth and people who crossed at 1 or 2. I don&#39;t know why anybody would. And by the way, Trump on the campaign trail wanted to do away with that &quot;by birth&quot; section of immigration law. I&#39;m sure you remember him going on and on about anchor babies.</p>

<p>Citizenship of the United States is not a requirement for universal human rights as defined in the Declaration! If the only requirement for deportation is &quot;ANY problem&quot; for the locals, what&#39;s to stop locals from acting out xenophobia against those around them by accusing them of crimes, therefore putting them on the chopping block for deportation, or even ICE harassment if they&#39;re in fact naturalized? This sweeping generalization of any problem (even without conviction!) = deportation is the exact same strategy Duterte took in the Philippines against drug offenders. Even an accusation was enough to get away with murder, so his program quickly and obviously got out of control. We obviously don&#39;t have the manpower at the judicial level to try every case accused of undocumented immigrants, so why not set a very clear line about what kind of laws CAN warrant deportation? Even under Obama, when he was deporting people left and right (but nevertheless operating under a much narrower set of criteria than Trump proposes) the courts couldn&#39;t keep up. I&#39;m trying to tease some nuance out of your view, but I&#39;m finding very little. Help me understand.</p>

<p>A. I believe welfare expenditures are around 100 billion on illegal immigrants. I could be wrong. </p>

<p>B. It was a campaign promise. He can&#39;t back out, can he? The left will accuse him of being a con man. I saw plenty of posts on reddit where people were saying Trump won&#39;t keep his promises and that he is a con man. Now 62% believe Trump keeps his promises. That is part of his brand. He won&#39;t let it go - for better or worse.</p>

<p>C. Regardless of net immigration, the rule of law must be upheld. It shouldn&#39;t matter than 10 people are going out and 10 people are coming in, so there is no need to stop the 10 people coming in. No. Those who break the law must be stopped regardless of any other consideration. If a border law stop 10 people coming in, it must be built. Border patrol has endorsed Trump&#39;s plan for a wall too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A: Illegal Immigrants also provide the same amount in state and local taxes. Illegals provided $10.6 billion in taxes in 2010 alone, so if we removed every single illegal in America we wouldn&#39;t see an extra dime in our pockets, not only that but we would make millions of peoples lives worse, illegal or not. Also undocumented immigrants can&#39;t qualify for medicaid, welfare or food stamps, and even legal immigrants have to wait five years to use public services such as those. </p>

<p>B: He&#39;s already completely broken his &#39;drain the swamp&#39; and &#39;take down Wall Street&#39; promise, so what&#39;s one more? For me drain the swamp was the one reason I was actually excited for a Trump presidency, when he filled his cabinet with Goldman Sachs CEO&#39;s and execs and Rex Tillerson as well as Steve Bannon I lost complete hope. I also don&#39;t buy the &#39;62% believe Trump keeps his promises&#39; statistic, I&#39;ll definitely have to see multiple articles for that one because that number seems impossibly high. Maybe if those polls were taken in week one of his presidency I&#39;d believe it, but those numbers seem like something Trump would pull out at a press conference. But I do agree that &#39;the wall&#39; is one of Trumps biggest projects and definitely the one he hyped the most on his campaign.</p>

<p>C.Immigrants really aren&#39;t that bad for our economy, illegal Mexicans have gone down 90% in the last 10 years anyway so they really aren&#39;t a threat. If we take away 8 million illegals in a day there will be thousands of businesses that will be fucked because of it. Why do you think Trump continuously used illegal immigrants to work and build his many buildings? I know it&#39;s a matter of &#39;enforcing the law&#39; and I agree with that, but it just doesn&#39;t seem like an issue in any way. If we&#39;re going actually give a shit about &#39;enforcing the law&#39; we should really focus on real issues like the fact that Trump was illegally caught not paying sales tax or paying off prosecutors via political donations to avoid charges, or using his foundation for other illegal expenses. </p>

<p>Point is there is so much illegal shit going on that we don&#39;t enforce. I find it insane how people want to get rid of illegal immigrants who pay billions in taxes each year, but turn a blind eye when Trump skips out on millions of dollars of tax and then passes the costs onto the people who actually do pay taxes (me and you).</p>

<p>Also border patrol isn&#39;t really down with Trumps full wall, the agreement is that walls/fences are put up/reinforced in specific areas and that a wall from Cali to Texas would be insane.</p>

<p>The head of the border patrol union had this to say &quot;We&#39;re not talking about a great wall of the United States. We&#39;re not talking about a continuous wall from California down to Texas. We&#39;re talking about a wall in strategic locations which then helps the Border Patrol agents do their job better.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for Trump doing what he said, building walls or reinforcing parts of the border. But spending 35 billion+ on the &#39;great wall of the united states&#39; would be insane. Have you ever driven from California to Texas? It will literally be impossible to build the entire wall like he&#39;s proposing in under four years, especially with all the Indian reservations that have gone on record saying that they will actively fight the wall building, which could take months if not years in court alone. </p>

<p>deporting illegal aliens who commit a crime while in the US</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We were already aggressively doing that. A lot of people don&#39;t reazlie that Obama actually deported more people than any other POTUS in history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In terms of legislation, he signed a bill to repeal coal regulations that would bring jobs back to Kentucky and West Virginia. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The coal industry is in it&#39;s final death throws. Those jobs are never coming back like they were before, ever. It&#39;s a harsh reality that republicans need to face.</p>

<p>I think this is just optics, PR, and a way to throw some bones to the elites who own those coal companies. Get some more millions out of the ground before the whole industry goes belly up. That won&#39;t help those people living in the mountain valleys of W.Virginia, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is doing everything he promised. Whether you agree with it or not, it&#39;s a refreshing change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This I find frustrating because he is ignoring many of the campaign promises he made, but putting a lot of attention on the few he is doign something about.</p>

<p>What about a plan to &quot;destroy ISIS&quot; within 30 days?</p>

<p>What about prosecuting Hillary?</p>

<p>What about the &quot;draining the swamp&quot;? (filling your cabinet with billionaire donors does not equal draining the swamp, in my book)</p>

<p>That&#39;s my two cents, at least. I&#39;m not trying to argue or start a fight or anything, just wanted to share my thoughts as a non-supporter independent (not dem or repub).</p>

<p>Turkey is an ally. Egypt at one point was and is still an ally(I could be wrong). Regardless, both these countries are not torn apart by civil war.

<p>To suggest that he banned only the 7 countries he doesn&#39;t have business in is intellectually dishonest. The 7 countries were chosen by Obama.</p>

<p>As for Saudi Arabia, I already gave you the reasons. If anything, Pakistan should have been on the list.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe there is such a thing as gateway drugs, it&#39;s a concept used to scapegoat addiction causes instead of looking at root social and cultural issues, and victimizes regular and medicinal users of marijuana  that never use anything more, and may even be averse to alcohol. You sound like you grew up watching reefer madness. It&#39;s 2017 and we have ample anecdotal and scientific evidence demonstrating the benefits of marijuana medicinally, and the relative safety of it recreationally, and yet our administration is proving that it does not care about the voice of the people or the facts, but will instead continue to create divisive legislation while spoon feeding it&#39;s flock of blind mice whatever rhetoric it likes for the week, a la &quot;state rights are key, but fuck state rights&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that marijuana is a gateway drug is unsubstantiated at best. Research has shown that <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/marijuana-gateway-drug">the majority of marijuana users don&#39;t move on to harder drugs</a>, and <a href="https://msu.edu/%7Echuyuwei/harddrug.pdf">one study</a> found that medical marijuana usage correlates with <em>decreased</em> use of harder drugs.</p>

<p>Additionally, any likelihood of marijuana acting as a gateway to harder drugs is likely due to its illegality, as drug dealers are likely to offer harder drugs to marijuana users. This is supported by the Netherlands largely decriminalizing cannabis, which has shown correlation with fewer marijuana users moving on to harder drugs.</p>

<p>Is it a blatant lie that Priebus went begging to the FBI to be shills for the President? and that the FBI said no? Is it a blatant lie that Flynn was talking to Russia? get your heads out of your colective assess, and realize that at a certain point is no longer &quot;Oh they are coming after my poor daddy Trump!&quot;, and it becomes &quot;holy shit this demagogue is incompetent, lied to  us in saying he was a &quot;man of the people&quot;, and is doing extremely dangerous shit for our democracy&quot;.</p>

<p>Please be alert and knowledgeable as a citizen. We can call out the bullshit from the corporate media, but PLEASE call out the bullshit even when it comes from your Dear Leader Emperor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much of the focus is on Trump when the vast majority of what he&#39;s done in office hasn&#39;t differed from the average Republican playbook. Aside from the wall, the attempted ban, and attacks on the media I reckon all of the ruling is being done by the people president Trump has surrounded himself with. While many voted for him on the idea that &#39;he can&#39;t be bought&#39;- those around him can be, or are part of the very industries trying to buy influence in the government.</p>

<p>You can harp on about saving the children all you want. The &quot;think of the children&quot; argument has always been a shallow justification of bad policy. How many children have had their lives destroyed when they were removed from their parents over a little weed? </p>

<p>The problem is that many Trump supporters, not all I realize, but many, are being groomed to ignore anything that is negative against Trump as &quot;fake news.&quot;</p>

<p>I fear that by the time 2020 rolls around, ~40% of the country will be immediately discounting literally any criticisms of Trump as &quot;fake,&quot; without doing any personal fact-checking.</p>

<p>So even if he is fucking over legal marijuana, blowing up our national debt with military spending, destroying our economy with insane policies, or w/e other shit he might get up to, it just won&#39;t affect his poll numbers....</p>

<p>TL;DR - I&#39;ve lost so much faith in the American electorate, I&#39;m not sure there is any &quot;one big issue&quot; left that can damage Trump</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The election was very close. Don&#39;t discount the stoner vote.</p>

<p>Hillary&#39;s private/public stance thing ruined her with much of the cannabis community. While Trump promised to leave it alone and even claimed to support medical. On paper, it looked like Trump was the least bad candidate for weed. </p>

<p>If somebody like Bernie runs in 2020 and promises full out legalization, it would be a landslide win. Assuming the DNC doesn&#39;t pull another fraud and screw over who the people actually want.</p>

<p>As for the fake news. There&#39;s been a lot of fake news and propaganda coming out of both sides. There&#39;s always going to be the gullible or uniformed that will buy nonsense wholesale. Doesn&#39;t mean that everyone will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly I disagree completely regarding censoring any posts but thats that sub for you. &quot; ITS A FUCKING DONALD TRUMP FAN SUB STOP PRETENDING ITS ANYTHING DIFFERENT &quot;</p>

<p>Secondly his entire campaign NEVER EVER talked about the legalization of pot. We always knew Hillary was never going to do it but he was NEVER EVER asked about it. It was never brought up in interviews.</p>

<p>If the legalization of weed was so fucking important to you WHY DIDNT YOU OPEN THIS DEBATE THEN? Why would you complain now when it was never a campaign promise. </p>

<p>The Bankers dont like him , the deep state dont like him , the pedos dont like him, the globalists dont like him so ask yourself HOW DID HE BECOME PRESIDENT WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE HATING HIM? </p>

<p>Because he had to grease someones palms and he decided that the Military and the corporate side of the justice system was who he would bow to.</p>

<p>For the rest of your rant the man has 4 years to do what he needs to do and if he doesnt do it then he doesnt and we will know where he stood and who he stood for.</p>

<p>I dont want pot to be legalized in the fucking slightest. I dont want my children to be able to freely pick it up when they feel like it and get hig , but what I do want Is I want it to be freely available for medical use and medical research and I have to accept that that will only happen if weed is fully legalized, decriminalized so that investment will flow into it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s their sub, their rules. They don&#39;t pretend like it&#39;s a sub for open and honest debate; they&#39;re pretty up front about what posts are allowed and what are not. I&#39;m comfortable with that. </p>

<p>Frankly, there&#39;s no room for healthy and honest debate in democracy. Demagoguery is king; we&#39;ve known this since ancient Greece.</p>

<p>On the whole weed issue, you&#39;re looking at the wrong branch of government. It&#39;d be a bit hypocritical to run on a platform about enforcing the law against illegal immigrants, and then not enforce the law in other subjects. Legalization is happening in legislatures. It&#39;s congress or the courts that need to be tapped to either change the law, or strike down the federal drug laws as unconstitutional.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you guys in the US got Hillary you may have gotten rid of first past the post voting at one point because it benefits the democrats a lot. Eventually it would have ended up destroying the two party system (it does in other countries). Now you will have basically permanent Republican rule in all three branches for at least ten years if not more. Dems are never taking the senate or congress back once the SC is stacked, and Trump will win a second term. With the laws in 2024 I&#39;d be surprised if Dems even win the popular vote again.</p>

<p>Also many would argue that Trump is beneficial for dems. They have not been so enthused and organized in a while.</p>

<p>There is e very good chance the dems win the senate and the house next election in 2018. If they put out a decent candidate they can definitely win in 2020, but that is not for sure.</p>

<p>Just look at the Bush presidency, the last time the was a Republican majority. It led to Obama, the most liberal president in a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you were a Trump supporter but because of differences on views about marijuana that makes you suddenly not a Trump supporter anymore?</p>

<p>Yea, I don&#39;t think many are going to believe you to be honest.</p>

<p>Those that do, will think you&#39;re an idiot.</p>

<p>If that issue is such a big one for you, why are you even in the US? Go to the Netherlands, clearly it&#39;s integral to what you deem important in your life.</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t care either way, marijuana isn&#39;t the worst thing in the world for people to be taking, but then, it isn&#39;t the best either. Though from a libertarian point of view it should technically be made legal.</p>

<p>But there are so many problems that surround this logistically, tactically, politically, socially and economically, so to cast Trump off based on this one thing I find absolutely retarded to be honest.</p>

<p>Go on, be honest, were you really a Trump supporter to begin with?</p>

<p>I agree only on ONE point, which is the_donald needs to lead by example [since the rest of reddit can&#39;t] and not be a complete echo chamber.</p>

<p>But then, does it really matter? if you want the truth go between many subreddits and then see what the consensus is, then make up your mind from that. Or just, do your own research like you should be doing.</p>

<p>The fact the_donald may or maynot be censoring counter-narratives only really balances out reddit on the whole, since every other sub is anti-trump anyway..</p>

Because Americans are spoiled no one would want to do the backbreaking field labor jobs, so the wage for those jobs would rise until enough people were willing to take the job.

<p>Not a doctor. Health professional I said. And VERY good at what I do. Your chances of survival when I walk in a critical care room go up. I&#39;ve worked at Bostons best hospitals too. So, I&#39;m gonna go ahead and say people who understand my field agree with the value of my skillset. </p>

Don&#39;t give me this dramatic shit about his exec orders killing millions of people. I hope to God that nobody else has to die in this shitty situation but don&#39;t act like voting for the other person wouldn&#39;t result in even more lives lost. Just like the ones already lost under the previous administrations. Just like my friends who died over there. So you keep believing that you&#39;re up on the high road. Those of us who chose to vote for him did so because we were so fucking sick of what the other side promised to offer. But you telling me that I&#39;m childish just because I voted for someone that you didn&#39;t just shows you have a very narrow view on what it&#39;s really like. Stay in your bubble and keep listening to those telling you how to feel. </p>

<p>Utterly delusional. Clinton wasn&#39;t perfect, of course she wasn&#39;t. But when things don&#39;t go your way you don&#39;t flip the board and throw the pieces on the floor, which is what what voting for Trump equivocates to. With Clinton in office we could have had some stability in Government while the growing anti-establishment movement pushed for election reform. Instead, like a child, you threw a tantrum and tried to bring the whole thing down. Now the US&#39;s international relations are being ruined, public services are being absolutely gutted, and the administration is in such disarray it leaves the whole country vulnerable. Those who could actually do something about corruption have been crippled, and the worst offenders of corruption and corporate interests have almost total power. </p>

<p>No matter how good your intentions, your vote was self-defeating and foolish.</p>

I really don&#39;t expect you to get it though because it&#39;s just words to you that you choose not to hear. Go out and see it yourself and make opinions and views based on that. Nothing is ever black or white, good or bad. It&#39;s all grey and shit. I don&#39;t agree with 100% of Trump and what he does. I&#39;ll call him out on things he does that I don&#39;t agree with, like this, going back on marijuana and states decisions. But you keep spreading doom and gloom and alienating anyone who has a different opinion than yours. </p>

<p>This was me, I began to do double takes when I saw what people he was appointing, the coal dumping regulations being repealed, and now this? </p>

<p>Nah, I&#39;m done with Trump. I said I&#39;d give him 100 days, to accomplish that &#39;contract for the voter&#39; plan, which he did have a start on. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/gkRsglrsZwg?t=3969">https://youtu.be/gkRsglrsZwg?t=3969</a></p>

<p>Sean does not say the DoJ would be taking action on anything. Only that the reporter would need to follow up with the Dept of Justice for clarification.</p>

<hr/>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read in Bloomberg, Forbes, et al, the DoJ has yet to respond to questions regarding recreational use. So we&#39;re still stuck relying on the statements AG Sessions made during the confirmation hearing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-marijuana_us_58750d2ae4b099cdb0ff9313">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-marijuana_us_58750d2ae4b099cdb0ff9313</a></p>

<p>which he danced around it, but did not openly commit to devote federal resources to chasing cases of recreational use.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Further to that. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/975/">The House Resolution 975 was introduced</a> which in turn would force the executive to recognize the State&#39;s rights over the aims of the Fed.</p>

<p>This whole bit feels like doom and gloom when really, we just don&#39;t know yet.</p>

It is ridiculous to think you wouldn&#39;t want law enforcement while still supporting him. Another reason I know you never supported him is the fact that enforcing the law is enough to make you go on a tirade, when real Trump supporters stayed loyal even after access Hollywood, and ever other attempt to take him down. The reason? Trump supporters see Trump as the last chance to save this country. They see this as do or die. You never supported Trump, you think illegal aliens are not criminals, and that we should not enforce our laws. TRUMP RAN ON THIS, ARE YOU RETARDED?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same, just with a Y chromosome.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, DEA was still running operations in California after commercial legalization, it to an including registered pot businesses.  It&#39;s the reason why banks as a rule won&#39;t open business accounts for these folks; unless someone puts a halt to enforcement, there&#39;s nothing to stop the feds from coming in and seizing property and funds, because so long as pot is federally scheduled the DEA can superceed state law and take action.</p>

<p>Until Spezzy&#39;s comments are clarified, the assumption is that DEA may continue operating under this mandate as they see fit</p>

<p>This is incorrect, I&#39;m sorry. Very very very incorrect, in fact.</p>

<p>In 2015, for instance, about 575,000 (!!) people were arrested for <strong>only</strong> possession of marijuana. <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/drug-war-statistics">source</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m just very curious- does the fact that your belief that marijuana possession arrests were rare is incorrect, change any of your preconceptions of the drug war in the united states?</p>

<p>The Donald and frankly many posts in this sub seem to ignore any legitimate concerns people have with trump which is disturbing. They like to say it&#39;s patriotic to criticize the government and I agree but doesn&#39;t this extend to the president?</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy trump voters are paying attention and being honest with themselves and others. We the people are united and strong. I don&#39;t care about partisan affiliation or who someone voted for. There&#39;s a movement now of angry worried people who want what&#39;s best for our country. Things will be bad for 2-4 years but I have hope that the important things we learn from it will outlast trump.</p>

Seeing how all the news organizations that sucked her dick constantly before the election, keep trying to say that Trump is a Russian agent, or hacker, or whatever, and every single time there has been no proof, yeah I made the right decision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He did separate medical from recreational in his statement, in other words he wants the fed to control the dispersal like opiates yeah it will make the fed alot of money but poor people will be left out unless they go to a doctor and get a prescription and I doubt the fed requirements will be as easy as Californias were when it was only legal medically. This could be an attack on dispensaries alone so the government or one of their friends (big tobacco) can control where it comes from and how you get it (shitty mass grown weed) this is why the legal states should start preparing for battle. Protect your dispensaries at all costs this message is to owners, local and state governments, and local police this is not just about weed its about rights no government should tell us what we can and cannot put in our own bodies including a naturally growing plant.</p>

<p>Trump is for Gutting/Eliminating:</p>

<ul>
<li>net neutrality</li>
<li>EPA</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Things that help pay for the cost of the ACA</li>
<li>Dissenting press</li>
<li>Dissenting personnel in govt. agencies</li>

<li>Prison Industrial Complex</li>
<li>Nuclear weapons</li>
<li>Military</li>
<li>Homeland security</li>
<li>Things that cost a lot in the ACA</li>
<li>Voter suppression</li>
</ul>

<p>And it&#39;s only be 1 month!  We are witnessing the last political party the United States will ever have.</p>

<p>This sub has been sounding the alarm that the growth of executive power matched with an overarching surveillance state is dangerous.  </p>

<p>There is now a man in the White House who does not flinch at using all the aggregated power to undermine the core of our country. He does not give a shit about America. He only cares about himself, and those loyal to him.</p>

<p>Snowden was our last chance to get people to CARE about what the government is doing.  It failed.  Now we are going to watch the whole thing morph into some sick combination of China and Russia.  </p>

<p>And those fucking assholes in the_donald are going to cheer as he tears down our constitutional republic brick by brick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was watching t_d when news first broke that they were going after states that have legal marijuana.  There were between 3-5 posts about the subject, with most comments suggesting this was a bad idea.  I thought to myself, &quot;hey, first time I see myself agreeing with people from t_d. Maybe this will spark a real conversa...&quot;
Then the mods arrived and it was over.<br/>
Glad to see people talking about this in a civil manner.  Of coarse, it would be weed that brings people together. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the worst part of T_D&#39;s censorship is that they use it to push outright, blatant fake news to the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, and ban anyone who calls it out.</p>

<p>Take <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5vx0ur/american_college_of_pediatrics_reaches_decision/">this</a> post from yesterday, about the &quot;American College of Pediatrics&quot; ruling treating transgender kids is akin to child abuse. It made #3 on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. First of all the organization in the headline and title doesn&#39;t even exist, it&#39;s the &quot;American College of <em>Pediatricians,&quot; not pediatrics. They got the name wrong as a deliberate attempt to confuse it with another, legit organization, the American *Academy</em> of Pediatrics, considered the de facto authority of pediatric medicine. </p>

<p>The group the article quoted is a right-wing, conservative Christian lobbying group masquerading as a &quot;medical association.&quot; It routinely puts its political agenda above valid medical science, and the claim the article made is no different.</p>

<p>Just take a look at the <a href="https://r.go1dfish.me/r/The_Donald/comments/5vx0ur/american_college_of_pediatrics_reaches_decision/">removed posts</a>, anyone who called out the ACP&#39;s Christian bias and the fact that the name in the headline wasn&#39;t even correct had thier posts removed and banned. All to avoid admitting Trump outright lied about protesting LGBT rights. </p>

<p>Shit like that happens every day on T_D and always reaches the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> due to what appears to be widespread vote brigading. Through that censorship, I think it&#39;s fair to say T_D is the biggest source of fake news on reddit. It&#39;s disgusting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would hardly label an article highlighting the aggressive stance of the previous administration &quot;propaganda&quot;.</p>

<p>It is merely meant to show the juxtaposition between the system that Americans have been living under for the past decade--which was nominally &quot;socially liberal&quot;--and the one being adopted by the current administration.</p>

<p>The facts (not propaganda) show that Obama went against the decrees of the Congress, and prosecuted the MEDICINAL marijuana industry at a rate much, much higher than the average American is aware of--to say nothing of the litigation pursued against recreational users.</p>

<p>If one were so inclined to peruse further facts, they would see that Spicers comments would actually indicate a LESSENING of the litigiousness of the DOJ by acknowledging the benefits of, and support for, the medicinal marijuana industry.</p>

<p>The ultimate irony of this situation, which will never be reported by the media, and completely refutes your wikipedia-sourced, attempt at Russian humor in the form of whataboutism, is the fact that the comments by Spicer should be seen as progress for legal marijuana advocates, as anything would be a step forward from the Obama years.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll accept your downvotes in lieu of a concession. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell me, virulentthoughts, what the relevant issues of the day are?</p>

<p>We live in a world where people are at one another&#39;s throats because of their perceptions of reality. Those perceptions, are dictated to them by very deliberate, very controlled source. You can call it &quot;the media&quot; if you want, but really, it&#39;s much deeper than that. Our attention spans have been shortened, our entertainment has embarked on a consumer-driven push towards ever increasing instant gratification, and our information flows have followed suit. Everything is now designed to be consumed in as quick a manner as possible, and anything running counter to that is either censored or ignored.</p>

<p>Does the_donald censor material running counter to the opinions of it&#39;s users? Absolutely. But all other forms of media do the same, to promote whatever viewpoint/agenda they are pushing at the moment.</p>

<p>Do those agendas connect? Is there a person/group/entity behind the agendas? Those should be the topic of conversation for a conspiracy minded individual. Today, on this &quot;conspiracy&quot; board, I see numerous threads dealing not only with Spicer&#39;s comments, but the reaction that one SHOULD have to those comments.</p>

<p>The simple fact of the matter is, his comments have been misconstrued and misrepresented by each and every person who has reported on them, and by the majority of the people who have &quot;consumed&quot; this news item. </p>

<p>People should fight to know the context and sources of the information they are being given, as it&#39;s &quot;truth&quot; is subjective. The censorship of the_donald is equaled by the thought censorship here. One is no better or worse than the other.</p>

<p>Any number of people, organizations, and agencies can post here, and flood the board with any narrative they see fit.</p>

<p>What is the motive behind that agenda? </p>

<p>That is the conspiracy.</p>

It was a paean to moralists and law-enforcement the same way Pence saying &quot;pray for me&quot; to a standing ovation at CPAC was a dogwhistle to Christians. The polling on  MJ is too strong for Trump to push back that hard. If anything, they&#39;ll ramp up enforcement in neighboring states.</p>

<p>This is not coming from a Trump supporter. This is coming from someone who thinks that nothing his administration says should be taken at complete face value. I think Spicer&#39;s statements are just indicative of them &quot;walking the line&quot; and not an indicator of a future crack down.</p>

<p>Come on. There is no excuse for being that daft. I would urge you to take it as a sign that perhaps your entire outlook on what the Republicans and Conservatives stand for and maybe even the political landscape in general.</p>

<p>You all made a choice and were well informed of what the results would be. There is no excuse for such blatant ignorance and the bottom line is, this is the sort of logic that is at the root of this disaster of a President.</p>

<p>&quot;He is a fucking idiot&quot;</p>

<p>So what does that make the people who support and have supported him? You voted for a yuppie thinking he&#39;s the champion of the working class for fuck&#39;s sake. Trust me the rest of us all know the cognitive dissonance doesn&#39;t stop there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The poster doesn&#39;t even smoke pot. </p>

<p>This was posted only as an excuse to troll Trump and it&#39;s nothing new here. </p>

<p>As you can read there are hardly any poster discussing using pot but taking full advantage to troll \trump on subjects that aren&#39;t even close to smoking pot.</p>

<p>Most importantly how the fuck is this anything close to being a conspiracy??? </p>

<p>The Donald is not playing any games they make quite it&#39;s a sub that is 100% in support of Trump and will only accept post that are positive towards Trump. They know it&#39;s one sided and make it clear it&#39;s one sided and they ain&#39;t gonna change just because you can&#39;t have you own way. .......grow up.</p>

<p>She has been in the game a long time and had a lot of time to develop networks to keep shady things under wraps and would probably be less exposed than he is.  I would hope he has a huge learning curve about how his government even actually functions that would hinder his abilities to put one over on the people.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now this will never happen but let&#39;s just be hypothetical for a minute. What would happen if the entire American public stops paying attention to these people? To politics and the media in general and we all cut back on spending money for only the things we need a just a little bit of indulgence beyond that. How quickly do you think things would change? Because I&#39;m willing to bet as soon as the bank accounts of the big wigs, who own the conglomerations of media and business, not to mention lobbyists, as soon as their bank account stop going up they will start caring. Not about us, about their money. But that will translate into a better country for the general public. It&#39;s a shame that so many people are fully entrenched in the values promoted by this country and it&#39;s businesses like overconsumption, blind faith, excessive pride, and total ignorance of what&#39;s going on around us. I&#39;m surprised none of the people on our currency have risen from the dead and  and demanded they be removed as a symbol of this fraud of a country. Well, except for Alexander Hamilton. He&#39;d be up at the top with the global bankers </p>

He exists as president soley to make this country richer, and by doing this he elects to send countless harmless drug offenders to private prisons, which he supports, furthering that industry. Illegal Marijuana also profits drug companies. He does not care for your rights, he only cares to make money.</p>

What do you think Trump has done so far that warrants a &#39;fantastic job&#39; rating? He&#39;s lied multiple times during his first conferences, he completely backed down from &#39;draining the swamp&#39; and &#39;taking down Wall Street&#39; and he&#39;s now completely blocking any media that&#39;s critical of him from questioning him. </p>

<p>This guy essentially sold his campaign on draining the swamp and being different from Hillary and the establishment, and then he goes on to hire 7 of the most powerful execs at Goldman Sachs, the CEO of Exxon, Betsy Devos and Steve Bannon among many many others. Doesn&#39;t that bother you in some way and make it apparent that he&#39;s someone who frequently lies to get where he needs to be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally every single subreddit is against r/The_Donald and now they just HAVE to nitpick at everything like it is supposed to be the moral standard subreddit. No, it is clearly based on supporting Trump just like the bernie or hillary subreddits are. It really is sad that the shills have turned so much of reddit into a blindly onesided opinion. The people who don&#39;t want to join in the hivemind will just leave and give up. They have to go to work or school tomorrow and don&#39;t have the resources to combat the corrupt admins and big financers. Soon they will probably just outright ban The_Donald like they did with other subreddits. They want to back you all into the same corner before they pull the plug. </p>

<p>I have no problem with The_Donald, but if you can&#39;t critique or view the president or government in a bad light then you need to get the fuck out of a conspiracy subreddit. News flash, this subreddit has always been anti president and anti government, if Hillary or Bernie were president we&#39;d be critiquing every wrong breath they took. </p>

<p>And bro FFS, you literally look like a pro Trump propaganda machine. Your posts are literally The_Don circle jerk posts or bashing people who dislike our president and calling people shills over at conspiracy subreddit. </p>

<p>Of all places you guys had to bombard you guys chose a conspiracy sub, one that&#39;s been known for actively critiquing and bashing presidents. It just goes to show how smart that entire sub is. </p>

Point being, &quot;let&#39;s not touch this and let the states decide, we are damned if we do, damned if we don&#39;t address it.&quot;, Trump is cutting cost, the former complaints on private prisons was that they compare poorly with Fed prisons. Fed prisons cost monies, and the Federal budget reflects that. What do you do if you want to save 12billion your first month? Cut funds, to datada daaaa fed prisons. Then &quot;private&quot; owned prisons take over the market, stocks go up :) as you stated. Eventually private prisons is profitable again, more people jump in that market,(insert friendly competition) tada!; capatlism! Hooray. I would be interested to see the regulations on them however. Anywho, if you are low energy on the_donald, they kick you. You sound low energy. I mean, seriously, you take a statement out of context, or maybe I&#39;m wrong, either way, you hinge you entire opinion about the new administration off of weed, that you said you don&#39;t even smoke anymore? Really dude? No, really? I mean, I&#39;m all for it, but there is bigger shit going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao you dumb fuck you actually believe Trump. Find me one statistic in which he won the popular vote. News flash kiddo, he didn&#39;t, he actually lost the popular vote to Clinton by 3 million. </p>

<p>Also he won because of Hillary Clinton being complete shit, even I voted for Trump. Doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t admit I was wrong or that I can&#39;t criticize him, but you kids over at T_D are praising him like how North Koreans praise KJU and it&#39;s hilarious in a way.

    <div class="md"><p>The Russian &#39;Troll army&quot; as the Netherlands named them is a real thing and was uncovered when the Dutch were doing their MH17 investigation. The whole &#39;shit posting&#39; tactic is what they used on subs like worldnews in any thread that was critical of Russia.  This was going on in 2014 and 2015  when things were going down in Ukraine.  Hell even the 4D chess meme was heavily used by them.  They would claim Putin is playing 4D chess and Obama is playing tic tac toe etc. </p>

<p>Anyways there are a lot of similarities. </p>

Experience and even failure can make someone more qualified than a billionaire playboy businessman who&#39;s never held public office and who very clearly has zero grasp on our country&#39;s most important contract between citizens and government, the constitution. The constitution is like a whopping 27 pages and this fucker can&#39;t be arsed to even read it. He actually thinks the President has the unfettered right to free speech when he speaks for the country. Clinton is awful and I&#39;m glad she lost and I hope I never have to worry about her getting elected ever again. But at least she studied the constitution for 3 years in law school and spent the rest of her life learning the ins and outs of federal governance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not accurate to compare censorship on t_d with r/politics for example. T_D is specifically a forum for supporting a certain politician. Obviously they should be able to kick people out of the community who do not support him. If I start a club for people who love Star Wars, it&#39;s reasonable for me to kick people out who hate Star Wars and complain about it. However, if I start a club for debating about Star Wars, then it would be a dick move to kick out Star Wars haters. In a similar way, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is not supposed to have a political agenda and is supposed to be a neutral forum. I do not have a problem with r/hillaryclinton kicking out Trump supporters, nor r/the_donald kicking out Hillary supporters. My problem is with allegedly neutral subreddits that have been hijacked by a political agenda.</p>

Conveniently leaving out the people who gave up trying to find work because there no longer enough jobs since they all left for China and Mexico under Obama&#39;s watch. Unemployment is still around 10% and the jobs people have are part time as welfare and Medicaid skyrockets every year. Negative trade deficits with nearly every country.. middle America, you mean 90% of the land mass that doesn&#39;t live on the highly populated coast. Yea that&#39;s a big fcking problem.</p>

<p>Speaking of the DOW.. what does the stock market and business think of Trumps&#39; plan? </p>

<p>Steadily improving= the first time in history economic annual growth hasn&#39;t reached 3% in the last 8 years.
Doubles the debt to $20 trillion and borrows an insane amount of money that we&#39;ll never be able to pay off. All while fighting in endless culture wars around the world that will cost us a hell of a lot of money and lives.. Brilliant!</p>

<p>Turkey is an ally. Egypt at one point was and is still an ally(I could be wrong). Regardless, both these countries are not torn apart by civil war. Vetting is possible in these countries as governments have control. In most of the 7 countries, governments don&#39;t have control over their entire territory.</p>

<p>As for Trump&#39;s businesses, dude has businesses everywhere. </p>

<p>To suggest that he banned only the 7 countries he doesn&#39;t have business in is intellectually dishonest. The 7 countries were chosen by Obama.</p>

<p>As for Saudi Arabia, I already gave you the reasons. If anything, Pakistan should have been on the list.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a ridiculously naive and childish view of politics. The only people who benefit from flipping the chess board over and destroying people&#39;s faith in the political system are the corrupt assholes that want to step in and take advantage. Which is exactly what has happened. Just look at the jackals that have crept into the White House since Trump was elected. Rich, selfish, morally bankrupt snakes who are gutting the country&#39;s public resources as quick as they can. </p>

<p>You think you&#39;re helping by undoing all the progress we&#39;ve made and putting a moron and his sycophants in power? How fucking old are you? The whole &quot;burn it to the ground&quot; attitude is just so childish and careless. That orange-faced idiot has the God damn nuclear codes, his executive orders and bills pushed through by congress can be the difference between life and death for millions of people. And you think you&#39;ve done the world a favour? Jesus Christ man, you really need to take a step back and think about your decisions. </p>

<p>Thats about 500 doctorates all conspired and produced fake findings.. Across years of academia and hundreds of institutions?</p>

<p>Thats some good logic there, lou. </p>
