       So if Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard testified before Congress to say that "there are no moderate rebels"...aka "all ISIS".  Then why is our military saying that there is a coalition of rebels that were just bombed by a President (Assad) who is trying to save his country (with the help of Russia)?

       They're foreigners imported, armed and trained by outsiders to "rebel" against democracy and secularism. There is perhaps no greater example of "fake news" than our MSM rationalizing support for Al Qaeda.

       US saudis and UAE want to build a pipeline that needs to run through Syria. This is bad for Russia (a big part of why we want to do it) and Syria, ally to Russia isn't about to let us build a pipeline through there so we've been trying to take them out. Trump is seemingly on a different page as far as foreign policy goes so he is planning on stopping the bullshit, hence the emphasis on destroying ISIS.

       Adding to your post, the US is bombing ISIS territory to push their forces further west. There's a reason why the US has let ISIS survive and even aid them sometimes. They (US) wants Assad out more than anything so they use ISIS to push on Assads eastern front while the "rebels" push on the western front.

       Yes, they're basically all ISIS. And we knew this the whole time.

       US knew that the rebels included Al Qaeda in Iraq, which became ISIS. And funded them:

       That's at least a rational response. But the firing of Flynn basically turned me against the whole administration. He was their best guy, by far.

       Yes, I agree with you about Flynn...but he was a lightening Rod as long as he was in a public position.  I believe that he is still working his magic behind the scenes (along with his entire staff that left with him).  Personally, I hope that Russia has no real "ill will" for the US and that we begin to cut the funding of all Globalists organizations working in American (via IRS, FBI, DOJ etc...) and kick them all out of our country like Russia did (and like what Hungary is doing now).  I am on the fence about how Israel is involved in all this....I've heard some pretty terrible things.

       I have no idea. It sounded like he was going to pivot against ISIS and the Saudis, but then he fires Mike Flynn, and we're selling the Saudis more weapons.

       the U.S. is supporting the Syrian Defence Forces, who are not rebels but are actually pro-Assad. The U.S. have not supported rebels in Syria for over a year now.

       look up literally anything about the Syrian Civil War, the SDF have killed thousands of ISIS soldiers and conquered 1000 kms of Islamist territory in the last 3 months alone, all because of air support provided principally by the US. And just today the SDF linked up with Assad forces to block the Turkey-backed rebels from advancing further in the north of Syria.

       you must be really bad at looking things up,

       was literally the first thing that came up when i typed SDF into google.
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. no longer supportS the rebels. The U.S. supports the SDF, who are (literally as we speak) fighting rebel forces in northern Syria.

       no problem man. The SDF are an interesting group with a noble mission, the US are doing a great thing by helping them out.

       You have actually given me some hope and lifted my spirits some, rollinggrove.  I was pretty down in the dumps since a couple of months ago when I came upon the realization that, under 0bama, the US was arming the rebels (ISIS) and that Assad was really a decent man that loves his country and that our country was trying to overthrow him just to control oil/natural gas in his country...what kind of sick evil people did we have in our government????   I love our US military and was very distraught about this...
