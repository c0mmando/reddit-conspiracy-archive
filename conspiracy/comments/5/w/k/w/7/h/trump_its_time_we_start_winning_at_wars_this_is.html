    <div class="md"><p>wrong. we&#39;ve been at war. far too long. we need to close this war out.  this has nothing to do with starting another one.  the military industrial complex is america.  also remember, if we stood up against it, the .0000001 % would be funding both sides so they can watch us eradicate ourselves. the 1st step in how we win our war at home, is stop letting them divide us. build strong, no fighting yet. together we stand strong. races, religions, and political ways of thought all need to come together. that&#39;s how you start winning. once we the people get on the same page, we win by numbers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i mostly agree. there is some that will never end, in reality it hasnt ended for over a thousands years, but i do feel that trump wants to knock out isis and radical islam taking over these countries we destroyed.  ...probably because it&#39;s easier/safer for us to go in and profit off everything you said.  it&#39;s all a game pankake.. they write the rules, especially POTUS.. if winning to him is liberating countries from isis and having us come out to take over.. it would be his win. more jobs. etc... ...also writing this i just realized since i was an immature kid after 9/11 and events during the iraq war, i always said &quot;donald trump should just buy all the desert and make it resorts to compete with UAE..&quot; ..not looking for &quot;i called it&quot; kudos.. but.. this is the craziest political times in our countries history. wth is going on anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is Islam is bigger than just ISIS, they have actually convinced over a billion people that they should pray 5 times a day in a specific direction and have unquestioning loyalty to the church. Religion is the problem here. This ain&#39;t no game, people are dying out there, they&#39;re lied to, misinformed, and end up hurting other people just because they were &quot;following orders&quot; or &quot;following the word of allah&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I saw in your first comment you said religion was the problem, but in this one you say &quot;organised religion&quot; is the problem, and that I agree with. The problem isn&#39;t inherent with religion itself as a concept, it&#39;s simply religion in its current organised incarnation that&#39;s fucked us. Most (if not all) major world religions have been hijacked in some way or another, to varying degrees, in order to manipulate the public and hold power over them rather than religion&#39;s original intent which is to share love and show compassion. A lot of phony religious leaders like to focus on fearing God, following strict sets of instructions in order to get into a &quot;good&quot; afterlife, and just plain brainwashing techniques. This is not what religion was intended for. I&#39;ve done a bit of research into religion, but I think I articulated my point in a comment I made the other day. (maybe read the parent comments for context)<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for adding some information in your post up there. I am going to dig into these videos and see what they have to say. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard of these dancing Israeli&#39;s before but it just seemed like fakenews before it was fakenews. The original report on them came from CNN right?</p>

<p>Soros was a Jew and working with the Nazis was the best time of his life. The Globalists put everyone at risk by importing Islam into Western countries. I don&#39;t think that the Rothchilds are Jews first. I think they are Rothchilds who happen to be Jewish.</p>

<p>There are other groups of people who openly want to destroy us, and there is a lot more hard evidence that says they are the real problem in the world.</p>

<p>But hey I am going into your material here with an open mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t give a shit about jews either. So working with the Nazis to forwarding the Muh Holocaust meme isn&#39;t new for them. They fund both sides. Like Clintons and Trump. 
Rothschilds donated to Clintons(?) - the anonymous leaks, Lynn Rothschild is a &#39;dear friend&#39; of Clintons&#39;, and they also saved Trump from bankruptcy in 1999, see Wilbur Ross who worked for the Rothschilds Inc for 24 years and is now the Secretary of Commerce in Trump cabinet. Also Steve Mnuchin, former soros employee, Goldman Sachs employee, as Trump Secretary of Treasury. </p>

<p>I am watching this now and what I am finding troubling is that almost all of the sources are MSM news. On one hand you are asking me to believe what the MSM would say, but then when its doesn&#39;t fit what you want to hear they are lying.</p>

<p>It seems interesting that the Dancing Israels did turn out to be intelligence agencies but they were investigating Muslim terrorist organizations themselves. </p>

<p>When they are discussing the 60 Israelis detained due to possible links to Mossad, all the same anonymous sources who can&#39;t explain anything in detail. Sounds a lot like how the Democrats can&#39;t explain how Russians hacked the 2016 election but they know they did somehow! </p>

<p>To further draw that comparison in that video around 12:40 the reporter says that they know nothing conclusive, but the Israelis must have know something darnit! Very similar to the NYT article about Trump&#39;s Russian connection - their third paragraph literally said that there was no evidence of wrong doing but fuck that we know!</p>

<p>I am still working my way through what you posted. But can you tell me know who owns Trump - is it the Russians or the Jews?</p>

<p>Yea, on the same day as 9/11 conveniently taking pictures and dancing. So obviously they knew something before hand. Also, why do we even belive the &#39;intelligence agents&#39;. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lol yea but it&#39;s the 17 intelligence agencies who has all the resources. They couldn&#39;t prove the Russians hacked the dnc/ was working with wikileaks, so it was bullshit. But again why should we believe the agencies or the msm here too. For now I believe in what Julian Assange says. 
We don&#39;t have all the information in the world or this wouldn&#39;t be so much of a conspiracy if we had the resources of the NSA. Not saying we should believe every crap they say in the video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate that you are trying to convince me but I am just not seeing enough evidence that clearly points to Israel being a real problem.</p>

<p>The Dancing Israels is fake news. They are talking about a video that they don&#39;t show, unnamed sources making accusations, and other MSM tactics. Why should we accept what they are saying at all when we know they lie and especially in something they would have a big interest in covering up.</p>

<p>That being said Dancers&#39; behaviour is suspicious. I totally get that its fucked that a van, loaded with explosives being at the &quot;right place, right time.&quot; Absolutely something was up here.</p>

<p>However, everything else in this story relies on us talking the MSM at face value - which is something that we shouldn&#39;t be doing! There is a lot of evidence that the USA was aware of these attacks and let  them happen, and so why are we trusting that country to tell us the truth?</p>

<p>Also the accusations that Israel spies knew about the attacks in advance but did not nothing sounds an awful lot like projecting. We know that the USA knew something was up and sat on that info. Why do we expect that foreign spies to protect us?</p>

<p>I am really trying to see your side things here but none of this adds up. </p>

<p>First of all buddy here cites an article from the International Business Times as proof that Israel is working with ISIS. Problem is that the only connection mentioned here is that Israel provided medical attention to wounded ISIS fighters. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In the past two years the Israel Defence Forces have been engaged in humanitarian, life-saving aid to wounded Syrians, irrespective of their identity.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those fucking scumbags!!!</p>

<p>Next, he says thats ISIS never attacks Israel. <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2017/02/22/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-rocket-attack-israel/">This is not true.</a></p>

<p>Now as for France helping Palestine and getting punished, I think its more likely a case Taqiyya. Benny warned them not to bring that viper home but they did it anyways.  </p>

<p>The difference between the article you presented and the White Helmets is that in the case of the WH we have photographs and a paper trail exposing the collusion. In the case of this (very short) article there isn&#39;t a lot of proof. Just Israel admitting that they help wounded Syrians. Then its up to the reader to take that as they will.</p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t that rocket a valid example? That was just the most recent one. And my point was that when people claim terrorists don&#39;t attack Jews or Israel is just wrong.</p>

<p>I used to think this but have come to think the opposite. I mean if we hadn&#39;t gone there in the first place maybe you&#39;d be right.

    <div class="md"><p>Not gonna happen. We can however take care of our own damn selves by watching out for the truth.</p>

<p>Moving on,</p>

<p><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/foreign-policy/iran-deal">https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/issues/foreign-policy/iran-deal</a></p>

<p>This is a reasonable deal, when you look at it, that Iran has to follow. As is with politics they surely must have gotten a handsome payout to eliminate their nuclear energy.</p>

<p>Recently though Iran has been acting daft and conducting missile tests. Add the fact that they are the number 1 terror sponsor as the SECDEF said last month and we can presume another war on terror will kick off since they are capable of putting america at risk. </p>

<p><strong>However</strong></p>

<p>The real reason Iran is in US optics is because they are going to drop the petrodollar for the petroeuro. I outlined this in a post here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5u1io1/theory_iran_will_be_the_next_war_within_3_years/?st=izp7e8k9&amp;amp;sh=256cc84d">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5u1io1/theory_iran_will_be_the_next_war_within_3_years/?st=izp7e8k9&amp;amp;sh=256cc84d</a></p>

<p>The nuclear deal was announced Jan 17th 2016 then on the 9th of Feb Iran announced they were going to start moving away from the petrodollar to the petroeuro. This year they have announced they are able to do so and will implement this the 21st of March.</p>

<p>When you keep in mind the debt ceiling is the 15th of March with the outcome affecting the economy, plus Iran&#39;s wildcard move, you can see how a war would stimulate the economy while keeping the dollar in power. The last country to put the dollar in jeopardy was Iraq. Before Iraq was invaded they too dropped the dollar for the euro and made some handsome profits. </p>

<p>I get surprised at how some people refuse to face reality and realize the recent wars have been economical. If the petrodollar were to stop being used by foreign nations the US economy would tank.
It&#39;s not hard to surmise that it is not a matter of if but <em>when</em> Iran will kick off. The foundations for a war are already there with the civilian support of the administration, evil boogeyman, economic threat, military support. All that is needed now is a false flag to set it all off to keep the dollar in power.</p>

<p><strong>Trumpets</strong>: THIS is a real manipulation tactic a &quot;4d chess&quot; if you will. You&#39;ve already proven you refuse to see the connection between recreational marijuana crackdown and private prison stocks price soaring now you won&#39;t see the Iran war you&#39;ll be fighting in. You voted for this now you&#39;re going to fight in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you arguing that Trump&#39;s statement means he is going to end wars? Trump just approved a spending increase of $54 Billion to defense, that&#39;s not how you end wars. It is literally impossible to &quot;close this war out&quot;. First, what war are you actually talking about? Because there are many. Second, the military industrial complex is not America. The military industrial complex is the alliance between the nation&#39;s military and the arms industry. The only way you sever that cord is by cutting defense spending, not increasing it. Third, there is no war at home. There are people with different points of view, and there is a media that actively exploits and exaggerates those differences so we continue to fight among ourselves and not direct our anger at our oppressors, the government. When you actually start to have a conversation with people with opposing views you will find a lot of common ground. The insinuiate that there is a war at home, is to insinuate that the American people are naturally violent, they are not. You should stop listening to the news so much, they will poison your mind into believing average people are overwhelmingly violent (most of us aren&#39;t). The news likes to portray exceptions as the norm. When the leader of the American government says &quot;Its time we start winning at wars&quot; and increased defense spending by billions, that means get ready for more wars. Not we are ending wars. It&#39;s pretty simple ...</p>

It is by far the most bloated, wasteful, crony, corrupt, slice of the budget.  It is completely unreasonable to increase defense budget while slashing other programs.  It&#39;s horse shit.</p>

Syria sounds like it would be the right thing. There is not much in the secondary part of most of the past couple of wars in terms of resources to exploit. This proxy war is great for population control and to get the military industrial complex going and creating debt. Expect mandatory conscription for the next one.

<p>You drone bomb a house that has a dozen people in it to kill one guilty party is injustice not justice.</p>

<p>And all you get is the relatives and friends of the innocent pissed off and more likely to become radicalized.  Just like Osama found out after the twin towers. That injustice gave dyslexic nut and pyscho Bush for the never ending war</p>

<p>Hitler made that mistake WW2 and tried to cower the allies by bombing the crap out of civilian centers and it only made people angrycand joining up to fight Hitler. Same British bombing of Dresden.</p>

<p>Air force Brigadier General Munzer Zaman, Syrian group commander of Kuweires airbase, after goverment soldiers broke a three year ISIS siege on the airbase. He was one of 300 survivors of the 1,100 garrison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I agree with you about the crazy devils involved with ISIS, Al Qaeda, Nusra, etc...</p>

<p>But killing a dozen innocent children and non combatants to get the one devil is not the way to go. It is what the terrorist do. All you do is end up recruiting more terrorists.</p>

<p>You have a relative or friend come into your house that you haven&#39;t seen in years and you invite him in your home so you can talk about old times
Next thing your place is bomb killing everyone (including children) cause your friend was an alleged terrorist. How would your relatives and friends feel about that? Think they will be cheering for the government that killed you and your family?</p>

<p>My guess is they&#39;ll hate the person who bombed your place. Might even join terrorist groupings as they are the only ones who have the capabilities to fight the government who bombed your place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah. I feel like winning the war would be in contrast of the military industrial complex. We&#39;ve been embroiled in a flimsy war for too long. Saying you&#39;re going to win it means you&#39;re going to finish it. Is it a winnable war? Maybe not. Is there a greater justification for fighting it now, more than the past 6 years? Absolutely. </p>

<p>And whether you like it or not, it&#39;s gonna take a lot of boots on the ground. That will undoubtedly line the pockets of war profiteers. But dropping bombs from drones also lines the pockets of slightly different profiteers and does nothing to end the war but does a tremendous amount to prolong the war. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be pro-war, but being anti-war makes you a fucking idiot. Just be critical of the war, and hopefully have a salient alternative. Otherwise you&#39;re just someone complaining. </p>

<p>The real reason Iran is in US optics is because they are going to drop the petrodollar for the petroeuro. I outlined this in a post here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5u1io1/theory_iran_will_be_the_next_war_within_3_years/?st=izp7e8k9&amp;amp;sh=256cc84d">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5u1io1/theory_iran_will_be_the_next_war_within_3_years/?st=izp7e8k9&amp;amp;sh=256cc84d</a></p>

<p>The nuclear deal was announced Jan 17th 2016 then on the 9th of Feb Iran announced they were going to start moving away from the petrodollar to the petroeuro. This year they have announced they are able to do so and will implement this the 21st of March.</p>

<p>When you keep in mind the debt ceiling is the 15th of March with the outcome affecting the economy, plus Iran&#39;s wildcard move, you can see how a war would stimulate the economy while keeping the dollar in power. The last country to put the dollar in jeopardy was Iraq. Before Iraq was invaded they too dropped the dollar for the euro and made some handsome profits. </p>

<p>I get surprised at how some people refuse to face reality and realize the recent wars have been economical. If the petrodollar were to stop being used by foreign nations the US economy would tank.
It&#39;s not hard to surmise that it is not a matter of if but <em>when</em> Iran will kick off. The foundations for a war are already there with the civilian support of the administration, evil boogeyman, economic threat, military support. All that is needed now is a false flag to set it all off to keep the dollar in power.</p>

<p><strong>Trumpets</strong>: THIS is a real manipulation tactic a &quot;4d chess&quot; if you will. You&#39;ve already proven you refuse to see the connection between recreational marijuana crackdown and private prison stocks price soaring now you won&#39;t see the Iran war you&#39;ll be fighting in. You voted for this now you&#39;re going to fight in it.</p>

<p>You post a supporting opinion of that fact; 5 upvotes.</p>

<p>Reddit is fucking stupid sometimes. I only posted to try to clear up all the hysteria and bullshit people are ranting on about; taking what he said out of context, but people don&#39;t seem to want to acknowledge anything but &quot;Trump = Dr. Evil&quot; narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you arguing that Trump&#39;s statement means he is going to end wars? Trump just approved a spending increase of $54 Billion to defense, that&#39;s not how you end wars. It is literally impossible to &quot;close this war out&quot;. First, what war are you actually talking about? Because there are many. Second, the military industrial complex is not America. The military industrial complex is the alliance between the nation&#39;s military and the arms industry. The only way you sever that cord is by cutting defense spending, not increasing it. Third, there is no war at home. There are people with different points of view, and there is a media that actively exploits and exaggerates those differences so we continue to fight among ourselves and not direct our anger at our oppressors, the government. When you actually start to have a conversation with people with opposing views you will find a lot of common ground. The insinuiate that there is a war at home, is to insinuate that the American people are naturally violent, they are not. You should stop listening to the news so much, they will poison your mind into believing average people are overwhelmingly violent (most of us aren&#39;t). The news likes to portray exceptions as the norm. When the leader of the American government says &quot;Its time we start winning at wars&quot; and increased defense spending by billions, that means get ready for more wars. Not we are ending wars. It&#39;s pretty simple ...</p>
