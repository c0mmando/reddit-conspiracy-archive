If you look on youtube one of the most popular type of videos is &quot;SJW fail&quot;, &quot;feminist fail&quot; &quot;libtard fail&quot; etc. The whole trump movement is a psyop. They want to destroy us and they are succeding. They want you to believe that any protest, any idea, any thought - is a &quot;fail&quot; and to support the alt-right. You are being tought to dislike the liberals. To dislike the anti-trumpers. To dislike the left. To call them cucks. To call them idiots. To call them morons. Meanwhile you are being swept up in a psyop meant to discredit protesters. To discredit feminists. To discredit the whole left. By being condescending to them. To laugh at them. If you recognize yourself they already have you. Because in the near future, when a REAL protest happen - you are so indoctrinated that you will mock them. Whether or not the protest is REAL and against something very real - you are being brainwashed into mocking them. Calling them names. All the while they are progressing their agenda of world domination. The alt-right movement is a psyop. Trump is a psyop. Youre being had. </p>

<p>You sound unhinged, but there are plenty of people in the African American community that want to &quot;retire the N word&quot; and don&#39;t like it being shouted at strangers in public. Many don&#39;t like the word used in popular music as well - and who can blame them.</p>

<p>The newcomers from 4chan and whatever super PAC is paying TD users to post here make it look like the sub buys into the Christlike nature of our glorious orange leader. Those of us who have been around since before the election cycle are pretty well aware of the nature of politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media is lying to you.  The Right is getting smeared as accepting of violence when they&#39;re not actually violent at all.  Increasing acceptance of violence among leftists is leading to a left-to-right defection pattern due to the high prior incidence of pacifism among the left.  As a consequence of this defection pattern, the right is getting <em>less</em> accepting of violence as pacifists add their voice to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s one way to handle it.  But let&#39;s be real, the vast majority of your comments on your 15 day old acct. is either saying sweden doesn&#39;t have a migrant crime problem, saying pizzagate is fake or calling other people shills for disagreeing with you.  Didn&#39;t see one thing in support of any conspiracy or facts to debunk them.  Then you make this post about how the right is trying to turn everyone against the left.  When it is painfully obvious nothing could be further from the truth, in fact the exact opposite is the case.  And you want to be taken seriously.  What am I missing?  Maybe your real audience is over on r/politics or r/worldnews</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be sure, since the 90s, and the rise of the internet (and Internet based wealth and ability to inform and organize the masses), there has been an advancement of <em>The Plan</em>. Humans hack, by nature. THEY can lay thier nets, but through ingenuity and instinct, humans hack... </p>

<p>I am worried though. I&#39;ve been a fan of protesting, online, in person, to my elected officials; but lately I am nervous. There are an increasing number of hate crimes and violence.  Against races, religions or over protesting/boycotting itself. I&#39;m actually anxious on a daily basis about what might happen in this country within <em>days</em> of a terrorism event. </p>

<p>I was raised as a Catholic Democrat. We actually had a picture of JFK next to Jesus on the wall. I started researching cults and religion in my early teens. The 90s were fucking awesome, as far as social progress without what has now become the <em>politically correct narrative</em>. Society was changing because it WAS, not because of self-congratulatory bullshit or dogmatic enforcement, it was pushed forward by the arts. Politics followed the arts and science! </p>

<p>I don&#39;t recognize this country anymore. The liberal &quot;agenda&quot; (feminism, queer rights, the green movement) have all been co-opted and marketed. The Evangelicals have conflicting Republican values and that&#39;s so not what being a Republican in the 80s meant... Somedays, I want to sell everything but my books and kitchenware and disafuckinpear. Shit, I used to create so much more than I consume. </p>

But no one wants to observe and report they want to give a everything a clean &#39;cause&#39;. Two sides of a huge platform war couldn&#39;t possibly have polarized and extremely emotional statements and responses, could it?! </p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s not logical that a group of extreme &#39;fans&#39; panic when their world view is challenged? Is this not the same attitudes that happen every election on the losing side only with greater &#39;wtf&#39; reactions? I mean republicans spent eight years crying over Obama with the same extreme styled rhetoric. </p>

<p>It would be nice if OP pointed to something concrete, where the funding is, where the academic and media influence originates to indoctrinate people away from the left/progressive stance.</p>

<p>The USA and Europe in general have been moving to the left, progressively, since at least the end of WW2, with some notable and temporary exceptions. This move left has accelerated since the end of the Cold War and has often been linked to the Frankfurt school notion of the, &quot;Long march through the institutions.&quot;</p>
