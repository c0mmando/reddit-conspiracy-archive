       There is a psyop happening as we speak. Its huge. If you look on youtube one of the most popular type of videos is "SJW fail", "feminist fail" "libtard fail" etc. The whole trump movement is a psyop. They want to destroy us and they are succeding. They want you to believe that any protest, any idea, any thought - is a "fail" and to support the alt-right. You are being tought to dislike the liberals. To dislike the anti-trumpers. To dislike the left. To call them cucks. To call them idiots. To call them morons. Meanwhile you are being swept up in a psyop meant to discredit protesters. To discredit feminists. To discredit the whole left. By being condescending to them. To laugh at them. If you recognize yourself they already have you. Because in the near future, when a REAL protest happen - you are so indoctrinated that you will mock them. Whether or not the protest is REAL and against something very real - you are being brainwashed into mocking them. Calling them names. All the while they are progressing their agenda of world domination. The alt-right movement is a psyop. Trump is a psyop. Youre being had.

       You sound unhinged, but there are plenty of people in the African American community that want to "retire the N word" and don't like it being shouted at strangers in public. Many don't like the word used in popular music as well - and who can blame them.

       The newcomers from 4chan and whatever super PAC is paying TD users to post here make it look like the sub buys into the Christlike nature of our glorious orange leader. Those of us who have been around since before the election cycle are pretty well aware of the nature of politics.

       The media is lying to you.  The Right is getting smeared as accepting of violence when they're not actually violent at all.  Increasing acceptance of violence among leftists is leading to a left-to-right defection pattern due to the high prior incidence of pacifism among the left.  As a consequence of this defection pattern, the right is getting
       <em>
        less

       pizzagate research IS the real protest.  politics and placing trust in celebrity are missteps.  you make a good point, but i think you've mischaracterized the general attitude of the average contributor/lurker to this sub.

       That's one way to handle it.  But let's be real, the vast majority of your comments on your 15 day old acct. is either saying sweden doesn't have a migrant crime problem, saying pizzagate is fake or calling other people shills for disagreeing with you.  Didn't see one thing in support of any conspiracy or facts to debunk them.  Then you make this post about how the right is trying to turn everyone against the left.  When it is painfully obvious nothing could be further from the truth, in fact the exact opposite is the case.  And you want to be taken seriously.  What am I missing?  Maybe your real audience is over on r/politics or r/worldnews

       These are not weird or "out there" opinions, they're the opinions of a relatively mature not-complete-moron. Thinking that the mainstream opinion is sooooo out there that it MUST just be "shills" is a great first step in divorcing yourself from reality.

       Boom. I despise the left and know the right has its own bouts of awfulness. I'm about an open mind and willing to make decisions based off of all the information I am able to get my hands on, whether they lean left or right is not of my concern.

       The alt-right was made up by the regressive left.  It didn't exist outside of their circles until they projected it into existence by harassing bystanders.  Some of the targeted individuals had this reaction:  "What?  If these people are that afraid of having opposition, they probably deserve to have more opposition!"

       Seems to me that both sides are being had. The left is telling their base that Trump supporters are violent, sexist racists. The right is telling their base that liberals are child molesting, baby killing racists. There are two distinct reality bubbles that one can choose to live in. This is by design. This is to keep us afraid of each other, instead of joining forces to overthrow our overlords.

       To be sure, since the 90s, and the rise of the internet (and Internet based wealth and ability to inform and organize the masses), there has been an advancement of
       <em>
        The Plan
       </em>
       . Humans hack, by nature. THEY can lay thier nets, but through ingenuity and instinct, humans hack...
      </p>
      <p>
       I am worried though. I've been a fan of protesting, online, in person, to my elected officials; but lately I am nervous. There are an increasing number of hate crimes and violence.  Against races, religions or over protesting/boycotting itself. I'm actually anxious on a daily basis about what might happen in this country within
       <em>
        days
       </em>
       of a terrorism event.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was raised as a Catholic Democrat. We actually had a picture of JFK next to Jesus on the wall. I started researching cults and religion in my early teens. The 90s were fucking awesome, as far as social progress without what has now become the
       <em>
        politically correct narrative
       </em>
       . Society was changing because it WAS, not because of self-congratulatory bullshit or dogmatic enforcement, it was pushed forward by the arts. Politics followed the arts and science!
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't recognize this country anymore. The liberal "agenda" (feminism, queer rights, the green movement) have all been co-opted and marketed. The Evangelicals have conflicting Republican values and that's so not what being a Republican in the 80s meant... Somedays, I want to sell everything but my books and kitchenware and disafuckinpear. Shit, I used to create so much more than I consume.

       Yeah no, that's just regularly 'my team's better than your team.' There's much more polarized language in sports fans against each other. But no one wants to observe and report they want to give a everything a clean 'cause'. Two sides of a huge platform war couldn't possibly have polarized and extremely emotional statements and responses, could it?!
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, it's not logical that a group of extreme 'fans' panic when their world view is challenged? Is this not the same attitudes that happen every election on the losing side only with greater 'wtf' reactions? I mean republicans spent eight years crying over Obama with the same extreme styled rhetoric.

       There probably are people being taught to pick sides and what insults to sling, but the general 'you' are not those people.

       Looks like the OP already deleted their username, I'm sure it wasn't E-T-S.

       It would be nice if OP pointed to something concrete, where the funding is, where the academic and media influence originates to indoctrinate people away from the left/progressive stance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USA and Europe in general have been moving to the left, progressively, since at least the end of WW2, with some notable and temporary exceptions. This move left has accelerated since the end of the Cold War and has often been linked to the Frankfurt school notion of the, "Long march through the institutions."
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure there is alt-right propaganda, but that doesn't mean that the left is not just as much to blame.

       The Alt-right is a conspiracy because there is no such thing.  It's just a name to link frindge groups in with level headed conservatives who distrust the Republican establishment.

       You don't have to be on board with the alt-right or whatever to think that this thing calling itself liberal or left right now is acting retarded. I lean left. I have almost nothing in common cause with the ones classified as SJWs, progressives, or the democratic party.

      <p>
       The left has been hijacked by crazy agendas and I hope there is a reactive snap back to something more moderate and less PC sometime in the future so normal people that care about others have a place to hang their hat.

       You sound unhinged, but there are plenty of people in the African American community that want to "retire the N word" and don't like it being shouted at strangers in public. Many don't like the word used in popular music as well - and who can blame them.
