        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Politics is about compromise. Different people have different interests. Someone may want to have a nice view of the mountains from their back yard, but some else may want to build an apartment complex because people need someplace to live.</p>

<p>There is no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; viewpoint of a situation like that. There is no objective moral standard. Politics is a way to negotiate people&#39;s differing interests.</p>

<p>If you think that your political side is &quot;moral&quot; and the opposing political side is &quot;immoral&quot; - you are not engaging in good faith politics. You are engaging in a religious war. If you are demonizing the &quot;other party&quot; and some sort of demonic evil bad people who just want to hurt people while &quot;your party&quot; wants to bring Peace and Justice and All Good Things to the world - that is not politics. That is religion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s tempting to mistake politics - which is all about compromise - with religion, but that is because so many people have lost their religion. You don&#39;t need to have a &quot;traditional religion&quot; or even a theistic religion, but if you have some moral impulse to &quot;fix the world&quot; and you try to do that through the government, you are trying to fill a spiritual void where your religion would otherwise be.</p>

<p>If you really want to &quot;help people&quot; it&#39;s better to focus on the people nearby - your family, your friends, your neighbors. The reality is you can&#39;t actually &quot;end wars&quot; half way around the world or &quot;feed starving children&quot; on another continent. All you are really doing to giving money to some bureaucracy.</p>

<p>If you have a moral instinct, work on your self first, and your community second. Don&#39;t let people fool you into thinking that politics is a substitute for spirituality or morality. There is no &quot;good and evil&quot; in politics - politics are about negotiations and compromise, it&#39;s about practical matters.</p>

<p>If you feel the need to &quot;save the world&quot; you&#39;d be better off praying (or meditating) and volunteering at a local food bank or homeless shelter. Voting for a politician or a political party is never a substitute for your own actions, in your own community, or your own spiritual life.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let them trick you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are using a metaphor to declare some particular political policy as a universal &quot;good&quot; while making an opposing policy &quot;evil.&quot;</p>

<p>So you are making a religious statement, not a political statement.</p>

<p>My comment was a metaphor as well. Why won&#39;t you answer it?</p>

<p>If you think we should be &quot;tearing down walls&quot; - why haven&#39;t you yourself done that? If you don&#39;t mean physical walls - ok - why haven&#39;t you yourself torn down the metaphysical walls of your own house?</p>

<p>Instead of telling us what &quot;we&quot; should do - why don&#39;t you tell us what YOU yourself are doing.</p>

<p>BE the change you want to see in the world. Work on your own self first.</p>

<p>No it couldn&#39;t. That is not at all what I implied in this post at all.</p>

<p>What good does a bridge do against rain, or home invaders, or cold?</p>

<p>What good does a wall do when trying to cross water?</p>

<p>You tried to make a very lame point with a trite metaphor but it wasn&#39;t nearly as clever as you thought it was.</p>

<p>Even without the metaphor, your political point is trite itself.</p>

<p>Using metaphors does not make one &quot;deep&quot; or wise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay let me spell it out:
&quot;walls&quot; are issues that divide us, like idealistic causes that lead to us not looking at the people around us.   We should look to tear these down by finding common ground with our neighbors.  </p>

<p>You still think I&#39;m talking about a physical wall.  I don&#39;t know what world you were raised in.  In America most people, even religious people, know what people are talking about when someone talks about the walls that divide us in a social context.  They aren&#39;t actually so simple as to think you are talking about a physical wall.  That would be extra special simple....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this! We don&#39;t realize that the way to evolving as humans mentally is first working on our selves. We get caught up in the bullshit that is politics, thinking that, if we vote for so and so, we&#39;ve done our part. How is this possible when we are only offered two candidates, and further more whoever wins is very possibly being controlled by a bigger group.</p>

<p>We pick sides and say our side is the truth when the truth is, it&#39;s all a show, it&#39;s all a script, it&#39;s all so fucking set up it&#39;d funny how I even get caught up in it sometimes. </p>

<p>The truth is, which op so brilliantly stated is, we have the individual power to change the world, by first changing ourselves, then working outwardly starting with our inner circle. We say we want to change the world, but that usually ends up just being our ego. If we focus on our own problems, and work on loving, being kind, enjoying the moments as they arise, we alter the state of our fucked up society and thus shift those around us. It sounds small and insignificant but that is your ego wanting more, wanting to be bigger. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t want to start with ourselves because we are scared of what we might find. We all have problems, and usually they are only problems because we can&#39;t stop thinking about them. They&#39;ve happened in the past or not happened at all yet. To take back our sanity we must stop giving energy to our past and to our future, but we must ground ourselves in the now, which is the only thing that is real.</p>
