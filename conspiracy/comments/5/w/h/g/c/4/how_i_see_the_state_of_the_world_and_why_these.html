        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Been in the conspiracy rabbit hole for almost a decade now.</p>

<p>As you go along you start connecting dots as I&#39;m sure you all have. So far these are some conclusions I&#39;ve come to. What do you guys think? Let me know.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The reason why we have sick twisted individuals &quot;running&quot; the show (not for much longer, they are losing power by the second) is because they are Jesuits/modern day Knights Templars that think Satan/Moloch/Baphomet/lucifer is the true &quot;light&quot; of this world and anything that goes against the teachings of Jesus is favored (because they think Jesus wasn&#39;t from earth and that he is a &quot;God&quot; of another planet)  so the failing elite basically worshipped false light</p></li>
<li><p>these 13 dark &quot;satanic&quot; bloodlines have their DNA linked back to when the annunaki fell to earth (fallen angels) and they have bloodline DNA linking them to negative Draco &amp; Reptillian service to self and power over other beings.</p></li>
<li><p>This is why PizzaGate has so much backlash. Because it can unravel their whole power structure. Because this ties in not only with pedophilia, but child sacrifice, using the blood of children, and other unsavory negative dark things.</p></li>
<li><p>This is why we see so much symbolism in today&#39;s music, media, and more. The all seeing eye, the Masonic compas, the pose of Baphomet often replicated during half time shows</p></li>
<li><p>all these symbols are neutral in nature and were given to secret societies by benevolent ET&#39;s way back in the day, but these &quot;elite&quot; secret societies distorted the teachings and became centered to self (service to self at the expense of others)</p></li>
<li><p>When isolated, photographed, and merged with thousands of other taken photographs, the photon (what might is made of) looks exactly like a Knights Templar Maltese cross. The Knights Templars are also the first instance of banking and interest.</p></li>
<li><p>so now that we have the basis of the ruling elite and their beliefs, let me get into how I truly see our &quot;reality&quot; after years of research and dozens of books researched</p></li>
<li><p>We are all one. We are literally God, the creator, experiencing himself, through billions of humans. We all originate from source consciousness and we are all linked to each other, and to source/God itself</p></li>
<li><p>we are more powerful than we think. We have beyond 5 senses and we aren&#39;t just bags of meat that can think</p></li>
<li><p>We never truly die. We are eternal infinite expressions of creation. Our souls are eternal, and we have all lived hundreds and even thousands of lifes.</p></li>
<li><p>Energy can&#39;t be destroyed. Consciousness is energy. We are essentially, energy. To quote Nikola Tesla, If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.</p></li>
<li><p>We all abide by universal laws. Of these, we have free will, which lets us make any choice we wish but if it&#39;s &quot;bad&quot; we have to face the karmic lesson of that because since we are all one, if you do something bad to someone else you do it to yourself (law of karma, law of energy) but the reverse is also true, if you do something good for someone else you will get &quot;good&quot; karma because you spent energy helping someone. Energy spent is energy returned.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppressed technologies have been held back since the 1950&#39;s and even earlier than that in some cases. Free energy, replicators, anti-gravity, zero point energy, and more, have long been known and held back from humanity (because how do you profit off free energy?)</p></li>
<li><p>Because we are all linked, all one, we can do group things that affect change such as group meditation and more. Mandela affect ties into this, as well as coincidences and synchronicity 
<a href="http://awakeningforums.com/thread/254/studies-collective-benefit-group-meditation">http://awakeningforums.com/thread/254/studies-collective-benefit-group-meditation</a></p></li>
<li><p>Because we have free will, we chose to incarnate in this life time at this time (which is a great time to incarnate because we all get to witness the Ascension of earth and its inhabitants) </p></li>
<li><p>Because of our free will, we also chose our parents, our learning experiences, our challenges, our &quot;soul mates&quot; and more. To learn more about this read Journey of Souls by Michael Newton or read The Meaning of the Life you planned before you were born by Robert Schwartz</p></li>
<li><p>Because of this polarized third dimensional reality we live in, we have the illusion of separation. That is why most everyone isn&#39;t aware that we are truly God, truly powerful spiritual beings having a physical experience. Because of third dimensional living we have a &quot;veil of amnesia&quot; that cloaks our remembrance of &quot;who we are&quot; and how many lives we have lived. This is so we can focus on our tasks and goals for this incarnation</p></li>
<li><p>Because we have this illusion of separation, we have multiple ways to live in this &quot;reality&quot;. &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; are truly one in the same apart of the all that is. But because we can choose either or, it helps us foster our understanding of what and who we truly want to be. If you want to be love and light, seeing darkness first hand, negativity, really pushes you towards the light and the understanding of what light is. And as hard as it is to say, it&#39;s a great learning tool. How would we know love if we didn&#39;t know hate? How would we know the light if we hadn&#39;t felt the heaviness of dark?</p></li>
<li><p>Many ancient civilizations knew of this information. The moment in time we are now in is one of great awakening (ever since 2012, the date everyone thought the world was gonna end but it was truly the Mayans keeping track of when our next great awakening is)</p></li>
<li><p>This is the third time humanity has an option to &quot;ascend&quot; to a higher dimensional frequency </p></li>
<li><p>the other two times were lemuria, and Atlantis (yes it was real)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I will stop there because that gives a general gist of how I see our collective reality. Some will disagree with what I say, and that&#39;s completely okay. I&#39;m not here to force beliefs and I&#39;m not going to tell you how to live, that&#39;s your choice and responsibility.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s have a discussion about this. What do you guys think of the above?</p>

<p>Much love and light and thanks for reading. We live in truly amazing times that gives us the possibility of expanded consciousness and rememberance of who and what we truly are. Earth is a school, and you learn a hell of a lot of lessons in this dense reality!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! I&#39;ve been coming to a lot of the same conclusions as yourself, especially in the &quot;we are all god&quot; way that you describe. I&#39;ve been hearing alot about the fallen angels thing and I just haven&#39;t been able to connect the dots. To be honest I haven&#39;t really gotten into it because so many of the videos just claim this without any evidence. I&#39;m not saying they need to have pictures of these angels but I just have a hard time believing this. Can you explain more in this? </p>

<p>I do believe we are infinite and we are &quot;god&quot; experiencing himself, I think we get lost in our society and as humans we like to put ourselves on a pedestal and say we are more &quot;imoortant&quot; than animals and the earth and thus we destroy the true beauty of the world because of our ego. </p>

<p>I believe we are energy and we can actually connect to those around us through thoughts and feelings. For example, if you think about someone hard enough with positive or negative thoughts, that person will be affected by you. This manifests in many ways. They might think of you, they might dream of you if they are sleeping, they might feel a sudden rush of love or nervousness and depression. The only way to combat that is to live in the present moment thus stopping tour thoughts. </p>

<p>I like what you said about karma and I believe that as well. </p>

<p>I believe in your suppressed technology statement, u think that if it doesn&#39;t benefit them, it isn&#39;t released and we could have had many things that would have made the world a better place, but it does not serve them. </p>

<p>I believe I&#39;m your theory on group things that can affect change. I think mass group energies can literally change the frequencies and vibrations of our reality and harness energy for groups who know how to use the energy. I believe that&#39;s why they do dark rituals and why we have elections, sports championships etc. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t gotten into the choosing of our parents and stuff before birth but I will look into those books because that sounds dope! </p>

<p>I believe in your thoughts about being God and having amnesia. </p>

<p>I believe we as humans are in the early stages of awakening and we are shifting to higher forms of being and love. </p>

<p>I am so happy you posted this! Keep posting and spreading the love!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply man!</p>

<p>I just recently started researching the fallen angels theory. It lines up pretty nicely with everything so far and it makes sense but it needs further research before I can truly connect all the dots.</p>

<p>One thing that sold me was the annunaki and the nephiliam as well as the old paintings, artefacts, and more depicting elongated skulls and other ancient artefacts. I&#39;m going to be doing a post on this and I&#39;ll have a bunch of images on it if you wanna check it out later :)</p>

<p>I truly feel a lot of information is suppressed from man kind, and on purpose too. Money and power doesn&#39;t exist if we were to abide by these naturals laws of creation and especially the golden rule.</p>

<p>Much thanks for the love and the reply man. Glad to see other people sharing similar understandings. I jus t dislike all the hate these types of subjects/opinions get but its complete understandable because everyone is at their own stage of awareness and their own level of consciousness. Everyone eventually wakes up, just depends on when they are ready.</p>

<p>Much love and light to you friend</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s the only thing they are familiar with and too then it&#39;s justified and right. Some elite think we need a leader and naturally believe the majority of humanity are sheep.</p>

<p>Also ties in with teachings passed down through generations after generations that involve distortion and power over others etc. Hard to break free from that repetition I feel like. </p>

<p>Not forcing this on anyone my man. You can leave if you wish, I respect your right to do so.</p>
