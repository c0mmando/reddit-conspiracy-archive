<p>In my 4 years on reddit I&#39;ve learned: A throwaway comment at the right time can get thousands of upvotes, and a well-informed (but unpopular) comment can get dozens of downvotes.</p>

<p>Upvotes feel like group validation and this probably triggers a drug-like rush of neurotransmitters. So people say whatever crap and it creates a false appearance of consensus.</p>

<p>The whole thing was very argumentative, instead of an actual discussion.

Maybe that&#39;s why people tend to put your comments off to the side, and I don&#39;t think that has anything to do with Trump supporters or T_D, since I&#39;ve saw tons of people able to hold a conversation really well against Trump on here, and don&#39;t get </p>

But yeah, their account is pretty blatantly argumentative, and not in a good way. I find solace in the fact that there are people here who never mention their ideologies and just present the facts and why they are important.

<p>While not a direct threat of violence, social groups provide a lighter threat, the fear of being cast out.  This can lead to one modifying their actions <em>not</em> to better support their views of the truth, but to better ensure their secure position in said social herd.  Sometimes not even consciously.</p>

<p>And then we have third parties wanting to study us under a microscope and with numerous, repeated measurements, to understand how to manipulate that, as a discrete task.  Which makes it all the more fun...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, as tribal and &quot;pushy&quot; as they are, they&#39;re a pretty weak element, and I don&#39;t think they&#39;re as corrosive a force as the non-orthodox ones who are overrepresented in all of the highest positions of power in the west: banking/finance, government, academia, and especially mainstream media and Hollywood.  Those are the ones who&#39;ve been doing the most damage, for millennia, to so many different groups of people.   Why can&#39;t they just learn to love people and let them be instead of trying to dominate and control everything and everyone?  Their STS alignment is probably why they keep getting held back spiritually, doomed to repeat the process, but the good thing is they keep pushing too hard and it&#39;s only waking up the loving STO forces that will eventually lead to their demise; people like yourself, who embrace their hatred of injustice, and love of their people, and are ready to kill and die protecting what&#39;s right.  It&#39;s like they don&#39;t want to learn from their mistakes, don&#39;t want to grow spiritually.   I completely understand all the hatred toward them, and truly want what&#39;s best for them, but they can&#39;t seem to even acknowledge their own problems, as if they&#39;re spiritually handicapped.   ...Just &quot;saying what I really think&quot; in respect to the OP,  who knows, these thoughts could and probably will evolve again by tomorrow with how fast everything&#39;s moving these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Service To Self vs. Service To Others.   It sounds like spiritual mumbo-jumbo to the uninitiated, I know, but it&#39;s a kind of really old &quot;meme&quot; that&#39;s present in many different spiritual teachings.   It&#39;s really a spiritual battle that&#39;s going on, above all, imo (and several others in this sub), and it&#39;s all to teach us how to evolve into something greater, a much bigger understanding, where deception will no longer be possible, and where we will feel more and more connected with one another, unified.</p>

<p><a href="/u/kbjay">/u/kbjay</a> posted this video earlier (thanks!) that does a good job explaining the concept.  It&#39;s a 2h vid, worth the time if you&#39;re interested, but like a lot of the Ra material I think it only covers or at least concentrates on half the story.</p>

<p>The relevant part to STO vs STS is at <a href="https://youtu.be/Tltx0Ipc3UU?t=4028">this part specifically</a> if you want a quick explanation, but the whole video, which describes the different &quot;densities&quot; or levels of consciousness that we move through is really good for only being a 2h vid, and will give you a decent foundation of understanding.     Anyway, hope it helps!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think pot should be illegal to the degree that it is, that&#39;s just silly, but all this push to legalize it is rediculous! It&#39;s a fucking tool used to dumb us down, yes it probably has medical uses too, but that&#39;s not what people want it legal for. They want to get stoned, period.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kept illegal to make you want it more, which works, and you go right along with the plan being a &quot;rebel&quot; and getting too high to notice what else is happening right around you.</p>

<p>Lol, right, because most people are so productive and create or do things that are remotely meaningful when they are high. 99% of people don&#39;t. Look at black people for example, it&#39;s another tool to perpetuate their self oppression. It keeps them stupid, lazy, unorganized and unsuccessful in becoming a productive group of society. </p>

<p>The internet was created by DARPA.  Essentially I believe it is a trojan horse that we all allowed into our homes to conduct surveillance on us. The government can now categorize everyone into this group or that group.  Essentially anyone not going full snowden is building a bigger and better surveillance report on themselves every day they use the internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And when downvotes don&#39;t work, narrative control brigade has no problem with harassing their opponents. I was an active poster on r/politics during elections (before I got <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5agmik/cnn_drops_commentator_after_finding_she_provided/d9gkl5o/">banned</a> under hilariously false pretense), I had karma to burn so I took my downvotes as a badge of honor.</p>

<p>At some point I had an account stalk me for weeks, with 80% of their comments being responses in my submissions or to my comments with messages that were borderline personal attacks. I reported individual comments and messaged r/politics mods about that user, with no response.</p>

<p>I eventually resorted to messaging reddit admins, and they found the behavior of that account bad enough that they took measures themselves.</p>

<p>I had a couple of accounts crafting pretty elaborate personal attacks (<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5617l3/expanding_the_debate_green_ajamu_baraka_debates/d8ffee3/">1</a>, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/54slrp/expanding_the_debate_jill_stein_spars_with/d84m0iy/">2</a>, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/533q1n/privilege_many_jill_stein_voters_have_it_and_many/d7ppor5/">3</a>), I reported them all, and even sent mod-mail. None of the comments were removed, let alone users banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, here goes:</p>

<p>Trump is weak.  He&#39;s weak willed and it shows in his fragile ego, his obsession with money and his comical attacks on people and organizations that speak I&#39;ll 9f him on twitter.</p>

<p>His solutions have the creativity of a 5 year old.  People coming across the border?  Build a wall.  Nevermind that most immigrants don&#39;t come here by land, and those that do are here because they overstayed a work visa.  Not to mention that it&#39;s impossible to build a wall in some areas due to terrain.  And not to forget that border agents say a wall won&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Too many regulations?  Pass an e.o. that says for every new regulation, 2 must be revoked.  This is not going to work.  There are millions of tiny regulations, many of which are either not enforced or are just forgotten about.  </p>

<p>These childish solutions to complicated problem only appease the most simple minded of people and reinforces the idea that one person&#39;s knowledge or wisdom is just as valid as another&#39;s ignorance.  </p>

<p>Eventually the reasons the wall will fail and the reasons regulations are in place will take effect and it will be like a rubber band snapping back into place.  </p>

<p>When that happens I&#39;d like to laugh, but I know his time as president will have just made things even more difficult than they were before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to disagree with you in some sense. Trump may be weak in a moral sense... At least in some ways. But the guy clearly exerts power. He exists to be the person people hate. He got on stage flat out calling people liars, calling bankers killers. He went against the narrative being pushed by the media.</p>

<p>I have no faith in Trump just as with an6 other president but for once i am <strong>cautiously</strong> optimistic. I support the deregulation EO that you mentioned. I dont want a wall but really dont think its a huge deal either way. </p>

<p>If Clinton won i would have no sense of optimism because i know what shes about and she is so fuckin fake that it makes me depressed seeing people fall for her. There are. Trump supporters like that as well but they are clearly brainwashed rightwingers ors uber religious. Most Trump voters know he is flawed but could appreciate some aspects of his campaigning.. Wheres the people passionately advocating Clinton were typically reasonable smart people... And it scared me that they actually believed Clinton wanted to help anyone but herself, especially after seeing how much she publicly contradicted herself, then seeing how she basically prevented Bernie from winning, the seeing the emails and leaked speeches where she straight out says she says one thing to the public but doesnt mean it.... And then just the aspect of her family trying to become America&#39;s royals.... Disgusting.</p>

<p>Trump sucks but i can tell her is a real person. He used to get all the girls he wants now hes old and probably slightly insecure, so he gets a spray tan and keeps that goocy ass hair because thats his thing and he doesnt want to be forgotten. I dont know what to expect from him and i didnt vote for him hut at least theres a sliver of hope that he will do <em>something</em> different. Hes spoken against wars, hes said weed should he left to the states, he supports gun rights, and doesnt want to raise tensions with Russia.... If he will follow through on anything is a different story....... But THANK GOD he won and Hillary lost. Id be incrediboy depressed if that sycophant won peoples hearts and minds.</p>
