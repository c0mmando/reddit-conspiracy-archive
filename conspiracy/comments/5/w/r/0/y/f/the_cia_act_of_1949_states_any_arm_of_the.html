<p><strong><em>BLANK CHECK: The Pentagon&#39;s Black Budget</em></strong> by Tim Weiner (1990)...Chapter 5:  KEEPING SECRETS (Pages 116-117)</p>

<p>What the Congress needed to create a democratically chartered intelligence agency was a clear idea of what the CIA was going to do, based on honest information.  The information should have come from Truman; from the Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal; and from Dulles.  What the Congress got instead were half truths and evasions, a wink and a nudge and a warning not to wade into deep waters.  Truman, in a letter transmitting the National Security Act to Congress, said nothing about secret operations overseas--nothing at all about an intelligence agency.  Dulles said nothing about covert actions.  Forrestal testified in no uncertain terms that the CIA never would conduct secret operations.  Congress wound up legislating in the dark.</p>

<p>The National Security Act itself said nothing about the CIA&#39;s power to conduct espionage or paramilitary actions or secret wars.  Nothing in the legislative history shows that Congress intended to give the Agency that power.  But a loophole in the law gave the CIA authority to &quot;perform such other functions and duties...as the National Security Council may from time to time direct.&quot;  From that open-ended phrase sprang more than a thousand covert actions over forty years--revolutionary acts that subverted governments, conspiractorial acts that led to assassinations and attempted assassinations, violent acts that over time contributed to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.  The men who carried out these acts thought they were part of the costs of containing the Soviets, preserving American power and keeping the Cold War&#39;s uneasy peace.</p>

<p>In December 1947, not quite five months after the CIA&#39;s creation, the National Security Council met for the first time.  The NSC acted as a board of directors exercising the President&#39;s foreign-policy powers.  At that first meeting Defense Secretary Forrestal demanded that the CIA begin a secret war against the Soviet Union.  Forrestal wanted action on every front:  the threat was everywhere.  Elections were coming up in Italy, and money and propaganda had to flow to defeat left-wing political parties.  All over Europe, American interests in the struggle for postwar power had to be fueled, and pro-American social opinion shaped.</p>

<p>There was an actual Stalin to be fought, a real tyrant to oppose, but Forrestal&#39;s demands had a tinge of mania to them.  His demands grew along with his madness.  In 1948 he began to hallucinate, seeing communists around every corner, sensing invisible microphones planted in his path.  He lost his mind, and killed himself in May 1949, in some sense an early victim of the Cold War.</p>

<p>Forrestal&#39;s initiative at that first meeting in December 1947 led the NSC to issue a secret order, NSC-4A.  It instructed the CIA&#39;s new director, Rear Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, to begin psychological warfare (cont.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>operations in Europe.  Deeply uneasy, Hillenkoetter consulted Lawrence Houston, the CIA&#39;s general counsel.  Psy ops in Europe?  Was it legal?  Did he have the lawful power to carry out this order?</p>

<p>Houston prepared a memorandum saying it wasn&#39;t legal and the Agency had no authority to do it.  The CIA was an intelligence ministry, not the President&#39;s secret strike force.  It couldn&#39;t set up foreign offices and buy radios and rifles and finance insurrections on its own.  Houston wrote that this would be &quot;an unauthorized use of funds made available to the CIA.&quot;  If the NSC or the President gave proper orders, the CIA would have to go to Congress to ask for the money to carry them out.</p>

<p>The lawyer&#39;s reading of the law displeased Forrestal.  So Hillenkoetter asked Houston for a second opinion.  Houston recalled that he already had told the CIA director the facts:  nothing in the law &quot;specifically gave us authority for such activities.  Hillenkoetter then asked was there any way, and we wrote another opinion saying that if the President gave us the proper directive and the Congress gave us the money for those peuposes, we had the administrative authority to carry them out.  So that&#39;s how we got into covert operations.&quot;</p>

<p>Congress had not given the CIA money for covert operations.  But the communist threat abroad took precedence over constitutional questions at home.  In this legal netherworld, the CIA plunged forward.</p>

<p>NSC-4A was supplanted within six months by a far more sweeping command.  The CIA&#39;s powers were recast by a new secret presidential order, entitled NSC-102.  It established the Agency&#39;s covert-action branch, the Office of Policy Coordination, and it became the blueprint for the CIA&#39;s work abroad.  It authorized the CIA to engage in economic warfare; preventative direct action [in other words, paramilitary operations], including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition, and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states,&quot; anything short of armed combat.  These were the marching orders for the secret war.  </p>

<p>The President would approve and hold ultimate responsibility for these covert operations.  But his hand had to be hidden, NSC-102 set forth the notion of plausible deniability:  the idea that the CIA&#39;s operations should be &quot;so planned and executed that any U.S. Government responsiblity for them is not evident...and that if uncovered the U.S. Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them.&quot;</p>

<p>This was a formal assertion by the President of the government&#39;s right to lie.  The lie must be convincing and must protect the government.  It had to convince the American people as well as the enemy.  The fog of the secret war wafted up from the theatre of conflict, rode the wind and drifted back home.  Lies during wartime predate the crossbow and the catapult; they served as a shield to protect troops in the field.  This was something more:  a double-edged sword of presidential power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>BLANK CHECK</em></strong> by Time Weiner (1990) Chapter 5: Keeping Secrets (Pages 118-119) </p>

<p>That rulers lie is hardly news.  In <em>The Republic</em>, Plato endorsed the &quot;noble lie&quot; as a political fable by which the powerful could convince the poor to accept poverty and injustice as God&#39;s will.  The Renaissance scholar Erasmus defined these lies as &quot;deceitful fictions for the rabble, so that the people might not set fire to the migistracy, &quot; and &quot;falsifications by which the crass multitude is deceived in its own interests.&quot;  The political tradition justifies lying--but only in the way that parents lie to their children and doctors deceive a dying patient.  The lies were noble only if they served as bitter medicine spooned up for the public&#39;s own good.</p>

<p>Plausible deniability was something else.  It let the President lie to protect his own power.</p>

<p>The doctrine of deception was laid down in May 1948.  The year passed, and 1949 was passing, and still the CIA had no formal legal charter, no formal budget, nothing beyond secret executive edicts to legitimate its power.  The CIA still subsisted on funds taken surreptitiously from the armed servies&#39; appropriations.  This had been going on for nearly two years.  It was hardly legal.  The CIA&#39;s Hillenkoetter came to Carl Vinson of Georgia, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, to tell him that the CIA needed a law giving it operating authority passed immediately.  It was &quot;a matter of urgency.&quot;  Frankly, the CIA director said, &quot; we find ourselves in operations up to our necks.&quot;  The CIA already was beyond the law.  It needed the law enlarged.</p>

<p>The Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 is the sole legal basis for secret government spending in America.  It remains one of the more unusual acts of legislation in the nation&#39;s history.</p>

<p>The CIA Act was reviewed behind closed doors by the ranking members of the Armed Services committees of both houses.  Vinson summed up the secret sessions by saying:  &quot;We will have to tell the House they will have to accept our judgement and we cannot answer a great many questions that might be asked.&quot;  The same cloaking of the bill precluded open debate of its contents.</p>

<p>As a result the Congress had no clear idea of what it was doing.  It enacted the law &quot;without knowing what all its provisions meant,&quot; said Senator William Langer of North Dakota.</p>

<p>The first black budget received its formal baptism over the course of a half hour or so on the floor of the House of Representatives on March 7, 1949.  Vinson introduced the bill and gave a very brief and highly circumspect description of its contents.  The language of the bill was not discussed.  Vinson said it would not be &quot;wise&quot; to reveal the CIA&#39;s budget.</p>

<p>--------------(page 119)-----------</p>

<p>The closest he came to candor was to suggest that Congress had to &quot;legalize&quot; the confidential funding of the CIA.</p>

<p>Debate focused on the secrecy surrounding passage of the bill, not the bill itself.  Congressman Emmanuel Celler of New York, who voted for the bill, protested the refusal of the few in the know to share their knowledge:  &quot;If the members of the Armed Services Committee can hear the detailed information to support this bill, why cannot the entire membership?  Are they Brahmins and we are untouchables?  Secrecy is the answer.&quot;</p>

<p>The only member who spoke out against the bill was Congressman Vito Marcantonio of New York, a left-winger.  &quot;The Committee informs us through its report that the Members of the House must pass theis bill without any explanation of all its provisions,&quot; Marcantonio argued.  &quot;This makes every single section of the bill suspect.&quot;  For the congressman to pass a law kept secret was &quot;to abdicate their functions.&quot;  The members were &quot;evading their duty to the people.&quot;  The CIA Act had the force of &quot;suspending all laws with regard to government expenditures.&quot;</p>

<p>Dewey Short of Missouri, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, expressed the more conventional wisdom :  &quot;We are engaged in a highly dangerous business.  It is something I naturally abhor but sometimes you are compelled to fight fire with fire....The less we say in public about this bill the better off all of us will be.&quot;</p>

<p>So not so much else was said.  The bill passed without amendment by the convincing margin of 384 to 4.</p>

<p>Even less debate was heard after the Armed Services Committee chairman Millard Tydings of Maryland brought the bill before the Senate on May 27, 1949.  Tydings warned that discussing the mechanics of the bill would be a grave mistake.  He assured his fellow senators that &quot;every possible democratic safeguard&quot; surrounded the new law.  In other countries, Tydings said, governments funded their intelligence agencies by fiat; they would &quot;simply appropriate a disguised sum of money, without any authority of law...If the Senate knew the details, it might be willing to do as other countries do, but we do not do business that way.&quot;</p>

<p>The Senate, not knowing the details, passed the bill legalizing the appropriation of disguised sums of money.  The implications of the bill, the secret funding mechanisms, the lack of any formal oversight all remained oibscure.  By a voice vote, without a roll call, the Senate enacted a law like no other.</p>

<p>The CIA Act said any arm of the government could transfer money to the CIA &quot;without regard to any provision of law.&quot;  That meant legal appropriation for weapons, public welfare or water-pollution control could be earmarkede for the CIA and smuggled into its classified accounts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t recommend Tim Weiner&#39;s work highly enough--especially <strong>Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA</strong> and this book <strong>Blank Check: The Pentagon&#39;s Black Budget</strong> (both of which can be bought used on amazon for ONE CENT (plus delivery).  </p>

<p><strong>Legacy of Ashes</strong> is really a reference book---it begins with the creation of the CIA and chronologically follows thru each POTUS&#39;s relationship with the Agency.  Weiner stays on track following documents and on-the-record interviews; the only downside is the omission of controversial subjects.  Pretty long read at 600 pages of text, plus 100 pages of notes/sources.  Short chapters (most are 10-15 pages) with very colorful text--tons of excellent quotes.  I do think Tim Weiner is &quot;controlled opposition&quot; -- but I also think this book is a great entry-level book into the dark, violent world CIA has created. If Trump hasn&#39;t yet read it, he should.  Free pdf can be found at r/TSBD.</p>

<p><strong>Blank Check</strong> was a special secure communications system which Oliver North and John Poindexter used, specifically called PRIVATE/BLANK CHECK during what became to be called Iran-Contra.  Shorter book, 260 pages including notes.  We can only hope that Weiner will do a follow-up into the Pentagon&#39;s black budget (or their budgets?)...Very little in-depth analysis and investigation these days on DoD budget!!!</p>
