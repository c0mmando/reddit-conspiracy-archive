       It's clear that the tides are changing.  I feel it.  I see the content of posts becoming more relevant to the average person, I see the research getting more granular, I see folks who were previously passive coming out of the woodwork to share their intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please keep it up.  Together we are more powerful than the media interests, than the elite class, than the oppressors.  Collective consciousness is the most powerful force we have, and we're beginning to wake up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you all, r/conspiracy.  Thank you all, chan army.  Thank you all, leakers and truthers and enlightened class.  I'm so fucking proud of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. Don't let all the 9/11 revelations distract from the mission at hand.  I want to redpill folks on 9/11 as much as anyone, however there is a reason this is coming back now.  Stay focused.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.P.S. Thank you to those who took my advice and added "Pedogate" to their arsenal (don't abandon Pizzagate, use both!).  I'm sure I'm not the first or only person who suggested this, but people will wake up to this phrase.  If there was ever a mission worth fighting for, we've found it...
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I can't believe I actually have to say that 9/11 is important.  This is all about timing.  Someone takes out tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in "woke" 9/11 ads at precisely this moment and no one is curious as to why now?  Please people, either be a bit more thoughtful, or a bit less obvious about your real motivations...
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT2:  Don't engage the shills, they waste your time and energy, just keep working and keep exposing.  Also, don't allow people to conflate different conspiracies.  This is not an either/or proposition.  Just remember, it's all about control.  Pedogate is the control mechanism that creates the conditions for other conspiracies to occur.

       Why are so many people suspicious? The reason the demolition stuff is being brought up recently is because a University is set to release their 2 year, $300,000 project.

       You are right. Pizzagate and that dumb shit is the distraction. The new 9/11 stuff is definitely going to be interesting but a lot of people are gonna miss it chasing for pedophiles in pizza parlors.

       That's not an outright lie. That's why so many accounts here are days, weeks, or months old. People who went against PG and Trump were banned, and it's been proven on undelete and SRD.

       Or maybe you both have differing ideas of what are important conspiracies to expose. Maybe we can do both. Maybe everyone isn't a shill. inb4 i'm a shill. I'm not. I'm just saying this kind of shit is what makes people skeptical of conspiracies.

       This entire discussion about "How dare OP say that about 9/11!" is exactly the discussion this thread is being purposely driven into. It's called topic dilution and it's very effective at destroying productive conversation about the actual topic at hand.

       Dissent and confusion while companies like Shareblue slowly inject more shills under the guise of fellow conspiracy theorists. It's pretty obvious they're utilizing 9/11 for their own nefarious purposes. You guys are smarter than this.

       You have created a 9/11 thread that is now a sticky post on the front page with almost 6k upvotes. As I write this, two other 9/11 posts are on the front page with 600+ and 8k+ upvotes. Clearly you have a platform for an open discussion about the 9/11 conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it then that many people find it so pertinent to enter this thread about human trafficking and derail the conversation into more 9/11 rhetoric? Why do they feel that OP's thread with only 100+ upvotes is such a threat to the open discussion on 9/11 currently taking place on this subreddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm interested in the results of that 2 year $300,000 project too. This is not the thread to discuss 9/11. Simple as that, if you don't agree with OP that's fine. But the way people are cherry picking the one comment instead of actually talking about the topic OP has put forth is typical topic dilution tactics.

       Oh, I'm a DC political advisor...I can assure you this is true...the rabbit hole goes much deeper. Don't just look at the politicians, look at those who control their schedules (Chiefs of Staff, Schedulers, Heads of Communications).  Remember Lamar Alexander's Chief of Staff a few years back, he was part of a network.  Seems we forgot about him rather quickly and conveniently... Feels good progress is being made.

       How can you work in DC and be virtuous/aware at the same time? I would have thought there would be a natural selection process discarding anyone with a shred of conscience. I'm curious to know how one would cope.

We are the dance of the moon and sun
We are the hope that will never hide
We are the turning of the tide
If we can turn the tide within ourselves
To freedom from fear
Then we turn that tide outwardly in the planet.

       I agree. Use pedogate and pizzagate because there is a lot of info on pizza when people search.  But DHS insider said he refers to it as pedogate.  It sounds more official than pizza, but for the sake of info already discovered, both should be used.

       Thirded. The pizza part of pizzagate is relevant, but the pedo part of pedogate is the bit that catches your attention. Both should be used in conjuction with one another.

       It's obvious to me part of this name switch could potentially be a campaign to dilute the name of our cause and the amount of people we can reach by rebranding us. It's a tough thing to consider. 2 hashtags could be beneficial in the long run though.

       That's exactly what it is. Pizzagate is a dumb name for sure but changing the name right now isn't going to help make the investigation more credible. The name is insignificant

       This thread was founded on the basis of 9/11. 9/11 the epitome of a conspiracy and no one would be here if it weren't for 9/11. Calling it a distraction is the worst thing you could do. I am surprised that anyone would agree with this. People will never forget how the government executed a well planned attack against its own citizens to start two wars and take away our civil liberties. This OP is a distraction.

       Why can't there be a positive post on here without the OP ending by telling everyone what to do? I've seen more than one "stop talking about 9/11!" post in the last 48 hours and it turns into a squabble every time bc this is /everyone's/ (within the scope of 'liking to read and write about conspiracies, I mean) sub, not just OPs, not just mine, not just anyone reading this comment. As long as it's an actual conspiracy theory (y'all know how I feel about this), I'm more than happy to give an upvote and watch the conversations unfold
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 isn't my main point of interest when it comes to conspiracies, but it rubs me the wrong say seeing people telling other people what they need to "focus on". We have good ideas here but we DON'T have a group mentality where we all have to care about/talk about the same stuff

       the problem with shills is, unlike us, they haven't "walked in the enemy's shoes"... we've all been awakened and care about reality.. they haven't.. we can understand them in a way they cannot understand us...

       Don't lie, as soon as someone criticizes Trump they are then part of pizza gate. We all saw this with J.K. Rowling and how
