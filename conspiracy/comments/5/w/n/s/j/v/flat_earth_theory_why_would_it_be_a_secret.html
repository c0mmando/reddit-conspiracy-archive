<p>You have 0 evidence for this and it&#39;s just an opinion. Nobody anywhere has forced FE theory so strongly as to be suspect of derailing other conspiracy theory forums. It&#39;s not even related to most other conspiracies discussed here so that logic doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point.  You are saying what &quot;it&quot; is and we are telling you &quot;it&quot; may not be that.  NASA is smoke and mirrors, lots of pictures and make believe with that government agency, and this is coming from someone who believes we landed on the moon.  But I also believe NASA, for certainty, knows there is a base on the backside of the moon as well.  Basically, you cannot with confidence say &quot;this is a ISS fly over video&quot; when NASA is the one telling you what you are watching</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you can see the ISS at certain times in early morning / late evening when it flies overhead.  When the angle of the sun is such that it&#39;s dark outside on the ground where you stand but the sun still hits the ISS and reflects back to Earth.  That website shows you when you can see it with your naked eye from your back porch or w/e from your location.</p>

<p>The reality is that 99% of the population, KNOWS that the earth is round, just because they have been told so. Ask a person to give you evidence for round earth. They will throw some nasa pictures and some science, but not even one simple method of proving it.  </p>

<p>I thought this bit was kind of funny.

It&#39;s still half the EPA recommended threshold for emergency workers, but still. A years worth of water is 290 gallons, if I had a third of that in a day I would die.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve traveled a lot by plane, the curvature of the earth is clearly visible.</p>

<p>Gravity works because we&#39;ve been told about it. Do you know what happens when you jump from off a building? Maybe you don&#39;t die. Maybe you finally get out of the matrix. What do you mean that I&#39;m wrong? How do you know that the result of your body slamming on the surface will result to your death? You&#39;ve just been told about that your whole life.</p>

<p>See? That type of thinking works both ways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could totally see motive for lying about it - its the same sort of reason as lying to somebody about God/religion - it just boxes you into a false reality.  If you box people into a false reality and you, the ruler, know the truth, then it is easier for you to dominate them.  </p>

<p>The form of control &amp; power would be like utilizing science that functions from/off of the truth- yet the people don&#39;t know the truth, so they look at the science as &#39;witchcraft&#39;.</p>

<p>The easiest way to understand it would be to think of some indigenous tribe that doesn&#39;t know or understand what microbes are - when they get ill, they believe that they are cursed by a demon or something.  Somebody more wise comes along and uses antibiotics to cure them, but lies about what the medicine is and claims that they are a God / healer, so they now have control over the people.  Now, the tribe believes in magic, and they are put into a false reality and are even further away from progressing into the truth than they were before you showed up.</p>

<p>If we started making space related technological advances that function off of physics/characteristics that are derivative of the earth being flat, yet everybody in the public thinks the earth is round, then the public will never truly understand how the technology was created, because the reality that they believe in is rooted in falsehoods.  We wouldn&#39;t be able to grasp the science correctly and progress, because we were told a detrimental lie that sends us down the wrong path.  The &#39;round earth&#39; would be the equivalent of the &#39;magic&#39; in my previous example.</p>

<p>All of that being said - I do not believe that the earth is flat.  I think that the conspiracy is sort of dumb - but i think its important to understand why somebody in power might lie about something like that, and what the implications/affects would be on the beholders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering that the average phone doesn&#39;t have the broadcasting power to reach a satellite? Yes.  In order to bounce off a satellite, you first have to reach a tower. Then that signal has to be bounced to a tower with enough power to send it up to a satellite.  Line of sight really messes with this, since the curvature means the signals (which travel in a straight line) have to bounce off of two, sometimes three towers before they get in the right area or angle.</p>

<p>Bullshit. We can detect it every day simply by watching the sun, moon and stars. Apart from that there are other simple experiments that can detect it. For example, here is an experiment using nothing more than a sink and some leaves:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KWkial3eiQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KWkial3eiQ</a></p>

<p>Of course you have to be able to cross back and forth over the equator to try this experiment, which is why most people never get the cance to try it for themselves.</p>

The &#39;round earth&#39; would be the equivalent of the &#39;magic&#39; in my previous example.</p>

<p>All of that being said - I do not believe that the earth is flat.  I think that the conspiracy is sort of dumb - but i think its important to understand why somebody in power might lie about something like that, and what the implications/affects would be on the beholders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It works in reverse too - if you believe that the earth is flat (and the world turns out to truly be round), and you approach science and philosophy with that truth in your head, then you will be heading down a path of falsehoods and living in a boxed reality based on nothing - this is why it is important that if you plan to &#39;believe&#39; in something, you should utilize math/science to prove it for yourself, rather than just believe what somebody tells you (test both round AND flat, and determine which one is proved; don&#39;t just pick one arbitrarily).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s something to think about, in response to your question.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a neutral too, but with rise to this new flat earth thing, I&#39;ve spent two years trying to learn about their presented information, to come to my own opinions. And I can see why it&#39;s a compelling theory.</p>

<p>When such a large proportion of individuals have such a strong emotional response to a topic, I am intrigued. Not because I believe it to be true, but because I want to study where that ingrained primal emotion comes from.</p>

<p>If the human race agreed to a spherical earth, where we rotate and travel around the sun, 500 years ago... How could anyone prove it, without having seen it? </p>

<p>Now some would say it was decided earlier than 500 years, but I don&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>Sure, there was theoretical math prior to that, by very intelligent Greek philosophers but it was merely an idea.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the new world finally adopted the idea of a spherical earth until Columbus, when he didn&#39;t &quot;sail off the edge&quot;. But that&#39;s just me...</p>

<p>As a race, we didn&#39;t have &quot;powered&quot; manned flight until the years 1903-1908.</p>

<p>That wasnt the technology needed to get high enough, to actually SEE, if we lived on a spherical ball or not, BUT that&#39;s how recently we even had powered flying machines. </p>

<p>I would argue it wasn&#39;t until AFTER world war II that we even remotely had the technology to get high enough to check out the actual planet. </p>

<p>Some may argue we had the tech earlier than 1945. </p>

<p>Sure, the GERMANS, launched the very first V2 Missle, in 1942.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it was until the 1950&#39;s, that we had the capability to get high enough, with the first launch of something into Space until 1957 with Sputnik.</p>

<p>So, if you follow some timelines and military operations that line up with Antarctic expeditions, and the nuclear tests, of firing the nukes straight up...</p>

<p>It&#39;s plausible through these acts that some people may think  we were trying to figure out... What the fuck we were actually living on / in.</p>

<p>And maybe, just maybe... Hitler was onto something. </p>

<p>...And someone or something else, didn&#39;t like that. </p>

<p>Research Wernher Von Braun, and his history and his works. And then color me surprised when his tombstone reads: Psalms 19:1 - which is: &quot;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.” - Curious for the father of rocket science.</p>

<p>Research Admiral Richard E Byrd, and all his Antarctic expeditions and operations.</p>

<p>Research the high altitude nuclear tests that came after the Antarctic expeditions and the Antarctic treaty that was signed. </p>

<p>The formation and militarization of Space, through the founding of NASA.</p>

<p>Take it for what it is, and a lot more research is needed for anyone truly trying to figure out what all the noise about flat earth is about, but I find it fun.</p>

<p>I mean, I take it with a smile, and find it fun to dig into the wild conspiracies. </p>

<p>If the world were not a sphere, and TPTB found out by getting high enough, and going far enough out over Antarctica to find the firmament, do you think they would tell the masses?</p>

<p>How could anyone take their power seriously, if we are inside the firmament? Something that was believed for thousands of years.</p>

<p>Who built it? 
Are we actually special? </p>

<p>Instead of being in an infinite vastness of nothingness. A spec of sand, in an infinite sea of sand, and you are just a microbe on that spec of sand.</p>

<p>You mean nothing.</p>

<p>But flat earth may change that perspective. </p>

<p>The theory gives people hope. And I feel that at this moment in our reality, hope is something people are grasping tooth and nail for.</p>

<p>Like I said, it&#39;s a fun theory to take a look at, and ask your own questions.</p>

<p>The ones saying &quot;it&#39;s dumb.&quot; Or &quot;You&#39;re an idiot&quot; ... Lost their ability to imagine a long time ago. I&#39;m not saying their wrong, but they should let individuals research and believe what they want to believe.</p>

<p>What is a conspiracy theory if not being able to ask new questions against the presented narrative? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t ask about it here my friend, you&#39;re in the wrong place. :-) </p>

<p>The earth can&#39;t be flat because of the visible stars as viewed from the north vs south hemisphere.</p>

<p>The earth could be concave/a hollowed out spheroid. Not floating through space or moving similar to FE theory. Evidence from the Rectilineator and Tamarak experiments supports this model. </p>

<p>And before anyone says it, the weak rebuttal from Dr. Simanek is not scientifically cohesive or professional at all and has been countered in multiple articles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So for example, how most of the wars in the Middle East have been ordered by the bankers in order to implement a central bank and steal all their resources and was never actually to defend our freedom? That&#39;s more logical than a flat earth theory imo</p>

<p>You have 0 evidence for this and it&#39;s just an opinion. Nobody anywhere has forced FE theory so strongly as to be suspect of derailing other conspiracy theory forums. It&#39;s not even related to most other conspiracies discussed here so that logic doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>
