<p><a href="https://youtu.be/9ScGZCqEyGM">https://youtu.be/9ScGZCqEyGM</a></p>

<p>Edit 3: a better source than the original.</p>

<p>&quot;Controlling Interests</p>

<p>Ownership, Control, and Insurance of The World Trade Center</p>

<p>The World Trade Center complex came under the control of a private owner for the first time only in mid-2001, having been built and managed by the Port Authority as a public resource. The complex was leased to a partnership of Silverstein Properties and Westfield America. 1   2   The new controllers acquired a handsome insurance policy for the complex including a clause that would prove extremely valuable: in the event of a terrorist attack, the partnership could collect the insured value of the property, and be released from their obligations under the 99-year lease. 3  </p>

<p>Ownership Change</p>

<p>Author Don Paul investigated this and related issues for his 2002 book, which contains the following passage detailing financial aspects and ownership changes of the complex preceding the attack.</p>

<p>On April 26 of 2001 the Board of Commissioners for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey awarded Silverstein Properties and mall-owner Westfield America a 99-year-lease on the following assets: The Twin Towers, World Trade Center Buildings 4 and 5, two 9-story office buildings, and 400,000 square feet of retail space.</p>

<p>The partners&#39; winning bid was $3.2 billion for holdings estimated to be worth more than $8 billion. JP Morgan Chase, a prestigious investment-bank that&#39;s the flagship firm of its kind for Rockefeller family interests, advised the Port Authority, another body long influenced by banker and builder David Rockefeller, his age then 85, in the negotiations.</p>

<p>The lead partner and spokesperson for the winning bidders, Larry Silverstein, age 70, already controlled more than 8 million square feet of New York City real estate. WTC 7 and the nearby Equitable Building were prime among these prior holdings. Larry Silverstein also owned Runway 69, a nightclub in Queens that was alleged 9 years ago to be laundering money made through sales of Laotian heroin. 4  </p>

<p>In December 2003, the Port Authority agreed to return all of the $125 million in equity that the consortium headed by Silverstein originally invested to buy the lease on the World Trade Center. The Port Authority rejected a request by the Wall Street Journal to review the transaction. 5   A press report from November 2003 about the same transaction noted that it would allow Silverstein to retain development rights. 6  </p>

<p>The lease deal didn&#39;t close until July 24th, just 6 weeks before the attack. 7  </p>

<p>Insurance Payouts</p>

<p>Don Paul also documented the money flows surrounding the loss of Building 7.</p>

<p>In February of 2002 Silverstein Properties won $861 million from Industrial Risk Insurers to rebuild on the site of WTC 7. Silverstein Properties&#39; estimated investment in WTC 7 was $386 million. So: This building&#39;s collapse resulted in a profit of about $500 million. 8<br/>
The insurance money flows involved in the destruction of the original six World Trade Center buildings were far greater. Silverstein Properties, the majority owner of WTC 7, also had the majority interest in the original World Trade Center complex. Silverstein hired Willis Group Holdings Ltd. to obtain enough coverage for the complex. Willis undertook &quot;frenetic&quot; negotiations to acquire insurance from 25 carriers. The agreements were only temporary contracts when control of the WTC changed hands on July 24. 9  </p>

<p>After the attack, Silverstein Properties commenced litigation against its insurers, claiming it was entitled to twice the insurance policies&#39; value because, according to a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, &quot;the two hijacked airliners that struck the 110-story twin towers Sept. 11 were separate &#39;occurrences&#39; for insurance purposes, entitling him to collect twice on $3.6 billion of policies.&quot; This was reported in the Bloomberg News less than one month after the attack. 10  </p>

<p>The ensuing legal battle between the leaseholders and insurers of the World Trade Center was not about how the 9/11/01 attack on the WTC could be considered two attacks, when the WTC was only destroyed once. Rather it seemed to revolve around whether the beneficiaries thought it was one or two &quot;occurrences.&quot; The proceedings before U.S. District Judge John S. Martin involved a number of battles over the insurers&#39; discovery rights regarding conversations about this issue between insurance beneficiaries and their lawyers. 11   12  </p>

<p>In December 2004, a jury ruled in favor of the insurance holders&#39; double claim. 13  </p>

<p>A Parable</p>

<p>To put these events in perspective, imagine that a person leases an expensive house, and immediately takes out an insurance policy covering the entire value of the house and specifically covering bomb attacks. Six weeks later two bombs go off in the house, separated by an hour. The house burns down, and the lessor immediately sues the insurance company to pay him twice the value of the house, and ultimately wins. The lessor also gets the city to dispose of the wreckage, excavate the site, and help him build a new house on the site.&quot;</p>

<p>911research.wtc7.net/wtc/background/owners.html</p>

<p>&quot;Several months before the attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11/2001 the lease of the buildings was made private and bought by Larry Silverstein, an American businessman, owner of Silverstein Properties.</p>

<p>In an interview for the media he said that he’s been having breakfast and coffee every morning at “Windows On The World” in “World Trade Center”, but on September 11, 2001 he happened to have a dermatologist appointment that morning.</p>

<p>Silverstein’s insurance plan happened to cover terrorist attacks “by chance”. When attacks really took place on 9/11, Silverstein filed a law suit against the insurance company wanting a double payment since there were two planes that crashed in the World Trade Center towers. The court acknowledged his claim therefore Silverstein was paid $4,550,000,000.</p>

<p>Larry Silverstein, the rumored organized crime figure who struck it rich on September 11th, 2001, then used his 9/11 insurance windfall to seize control of Chicago’s Sears Tower, and to rebuild the condemned-for-asbestos World Trade Center with its Orwellian “Freedom Tower.”</p>

<p>He also rebuilt World Trade Center 7, the building that he confessed to demolishing, but which did not stop him from grabbing a $700-million-dollar insurance payout for the “tragic loss” of that building due to an alleged “terrorist attack” that made the 47-story WTC-7 fall straight down in 6.5 seconds from a few tiny office fires.</p>

<p>By grabbing three-quarters-of-a-billion-dollars insurance money on the building he confessed to demolishing himself, Larry Silverstein defined the word “chutzpah” once and for all time.</p>

<p>And now, “Lucky Larry” wants more skyscrapers.</p>

<p>According to Business Week, Silverstein has announced plans to build an 82-story hotel and condominium tower one block north of the World Trade Center. Construction is scheduled to start later this year.</p>

<p>The Business Week article noted that Silverstein leased the twin towers for 99 years six weeks before they were destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks. But the article fails to mention the relevant background:</p>

<p>For the record, the high-vacancy, antiquated-infrastructure Twin Towers were a huge money-loser for the City of New York, which was under court order to do asbestos abatement. The price tag could have reached the double-digit billions – far more than the Towers were worth.&quot;</p>

<p>Edit: P.S. He&#39;s the &quot;pull it&quot; guy.</p>

<p>Edit 2: struck a nerve! They love to focus on small aspects which in and of themselves are not much, but they ignore the hundreds of other coincidences that day that when put together, show us what really happened that day....inside job.</p>

<p>I wear the downvotes from you mainstream puppets like a badge of honor. If anyone wants to debate the physics of the collapse we can go until one of us changes their mind.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081012085011/http://www.observer.com/node/47252">His son, Roger, and his daughter, Lisa, were working for him in temporary offices on the 88th floor of the W.T.C. north tower. Regular meetings with tenants in the weeks immediately following their July 26, 2001, takeover of the building were held each morning at Windows on the World. But on Sept. 11, Roger and Lisa Silverstein were running late. Meanwhile, Mr. Silverstein&#39;s wife of 46 years had laid down the law: The developer could not cancel an appointment with his dermatologist, even to meet with tenants at his most important property. If the attack had happened just a little later, Mr. Silverstein&#39;s children would likely have been trapped at Windows. As it was, Silverstein Properties lost four employees in the attack, two of whom had just recently been hired.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sometimes wonder if he has a history of skin issues such that he sees a dermatologist every six weeks or so, in which case no surprise appointments would be necessary. Or if his wife was suddenly concerned about a nasty rash he doesn&#39;t want to tell us about? AFAIK no-one ever asked him or his dermatologist..</p>

<p>I do not believe his story. I might have believed it more without the embellishment
of the appointment being a surprise to him but I still wouldn&#39;t have believed it.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, it was levied on a building in the heart of New York&#39;s financial district - next to two twin towers that were seen and designed as symbols of American vanguard in the 20st century&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Asbestos abatement is done as tenants renovate their space and not all at once. This is extremely common in NYC construction. You cannot get a building permit for almost anything without testing for asbestos and if found, abating it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to think something is fishy about the whole event but asbestos abatement is super common and likely unrelated. It doesn&#39;t all have to be abated at once (asbestos is only dangerous when disturbed) and sometimes the tenants doing to renovation would pay for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I do.  I have worked with industrial companies in a contracting role and as a supplier rep.  Removing asbestos is very costly and requires shutdowns during abatement many contractors won&#39;t touch it because of the insurance adder and permitting process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it requires shutdowns. It is very costly and would require removing every tenant from the space when abatement was taking place. </p>

<p>Do you really think the twin towers were going to relocate every tenant so they could remediate asbestos, or just wait for tenants to naturally cycle out and remove the asbestos when renovating? Aka how everyone else does it in all of NYC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why abatement includes things like critical barriers around vents, doors, windows (anywhere there&#39;s a chance fibers could get out), and the project area is sealed up tight and kept under negative pressure with huge HEPA filtered vacuums.</p>

<p>We do that same shit for mold abatement and remediation. Don&#39;t think these people don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. Their health is at risk, much more so actually, than any of the tenants. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so heavily regulated.

<p>Just this past month, a former NIST employee of 14 years made his first public appearance speaking out against the official report with Dr. Hulsey: <a href="https://youtu.be/Pb2NOBbD88c?t=2m46s">https://youtu.be/Pb2NOBbD88c?t=2m46s</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If NIST truly believes in the veracity of its WTC investigation, then it should openly share all evidence, data, models, computations, and other relevant information unless specific and compelling reasons are otherwise provided. —Peter Ketcham, NIST 1997-2011</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty excessive for such an improbable event.  Your chances of dying in a car accident are quite a bit higher than the chance that a building will spontaneously pulverize itself, but I imagine you don&#39;t have any second thoughts about getting into a car</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched demolition videos on youtube and have never heard them say &quot;Pull-it&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the Popular Mechanics book Debunking 9/11 Myths: Why Conspiracy Theories Can&#39;t Stand Up to the Facts: </p>

<p>Four demolition and engineering experts tell Popular Mechanics that pull it is not slang for controlled demolition. &quot;I&#39;ve never heard of it,&quot; says Jon Magnusson of Magnusson Klemencic Associates.
Ron Dokell, retired president of Olshan Demolishing Company, says the same thing. Mark Loizeaux of Controlled Demolition, Inc. adds that the only way he can imagine the term being used is in reference to a process where the legs of a structure are precut and attached to cables, and then large machines are used to literally pull the building to the ground.</p>

<p>Brent Blanchard, a demolitions expert with Protec, and contributor to ImplosionWorld.com, weighs in with his expert opinion:</p>

<p>We have never once heard the term &#39;pull it&#39; being used to refer to the explosive demolition of a building, and neither has any blast team we&#39;ve spoken with. The term is used in conventional demolition circles, to describe the specific activity of attaching long cables to a pre-weakened building and maneuvering heavy equipment (excavators, bulldozers etc) to &#39;pull&#39; the frame of the structure over onto its side for further dismantlement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they were going to &quot;pull&quot; Building 7, why did they wait more than six hours to do it? That building remained on fire the entire time, with no attempts by fire and rescue to put out the flames. Yet somehow after all that time the internal fire in Building 7 never burnt the demolition charges, the wires for the explosives, or ignited the thermite hidden throughout the structure? </p>

<p>Seems more likely the 6 hour inferno did in fact weaken the structural integrity of the building, and it collapsed in on itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your example of &quot;one tornado destroyed both of his buildings&quot; is actually the argument the insurers used to try to limit the coverage.</p>

<p>The issue wasn&#39;t covering each building that was destroyed, it was that the buildings were part of a an &quot;umbrella&quot; insurance plan that had a combined limit based on a single &quot;occurrence&quot;.  So the question was whether the two plane crashes at two different locations were part of a single occurrence (one combined act of terrorism) or multiple occurrences.  If a single occurrence, then the limit was $3.55 billion.  If two occurrences, then each occurrence had a limit of $3.55 billion, for a combined claim of $7.1 billion.</p>

<p>The insurers were actually broken into two groups based on different language used, and one group was found to only be liable for one occurrence, the other for two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, if this terror attack had been on a smaller scale. Say, on one street, two lorries get driven into two different buildings that happen to be owned by the same person. The damage is far from negligible, but the buildings remain standing and therefore two separate scene are taped off and inspected, etc. 
I would expect that one lump sum, under an umbrella type coverage, would be large enough for the damages of both scenes regardless of whether or not a single incident happened. Regardless of one or two lorries damaging the owners property, the same amount of damage happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  It was an unprecedented catastrophe.  I think both sides took reasonable and unsurprising positions - large insurance claims are very frequently litigated.

<p>Hypothetically speaking, let&#39;s say that we somehow 100% know for a fact that Silverstein was NOT involved in the attacks. In that situation, any of us here and 99% of the population would have attempted to get the double insurance payout.</p>

<p>I hear you, but 99% of the population will never even have the chance to own a building. Even if we did I guess I&#39;m in that 1% that wouldn&#39;t have had a greedy mindset after the attacks. You&#39;re also assuming he had nothing to do with it which I find extremely unlikely.</p>

<p>I will agree that some of this is speculation, however it seems a lot more likely in my opinion when you add up all the other coincidences that day.

    <div class="md"><p>And why wouldn&#39;t we? If I own a house and a barn, and they both burn down from a suspicious wildfire both structures have value. Why wouldn&#39;t I try to get the value of what I insured both structures for. Even if on paper I have fire insurance for just the property. The fire and its causes are a legally separate issue. If found to be linked then there&#39;s legal avenues to explore that link the two, but otherwise they&#39;re separate issues. </p>

<p>That said, I understand the point that these coincidences by themselves are not suspicious and easily explained, but holistically they seem to point to a larger conspiracy. </p>

<p>I think that he government <em>is</em> withholding information that may answer some questions. I do think the flight over PA was shot down (I&#39;d have done the same thing. The truth is our lives as citizens aren&#39;t nearly as important as the lives of our government officials, sorry but that&#39;s how it is). That said, I think everything else happened as said. At worst the Bush admin knew about it 100% (beyond he infamous document) and let it happen as a pretext to war. </p>

<p>Personally if I saw a chance to demo a loss leading building and have it covered under insurance I would. It&#39;s sleazy and unethical. But if it costs 10 mill to demo and I only have 4.5, but I can do it for 1, and make money I think most of us would regardless of ethics. He&#39;s on the hook for that building anyhow and it&#39;s a environmental hazard as it contains known carcinogens. Still sleezy, but i think most people would.

<p>I think we had a misunderstanding. He saw an opportunity and took it. The specifics of <em>how</em> the building was or may have been demolished is beyond me. I&#39;d be happy to stop at having it condemned. But maybe the insurance company wanted to send someone out, or perhaps they do with that much money as standard practice. I don&#39;t know. He could have had someone wired it for explosive demo (<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sK50So-yYRU">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sK50So-yYRU</a>) (sorry on my phone) or it could have been something like this (<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=i-2Y2MYpl2g">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=i-2Y2MYpl2g</a>) or any number of things. Point is the building cost more in insurance than in reality. So when the opportunity presented itself to cash in on the insurance, he took it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of things.. </p>

<p>Are you aware of fell down only hours after the main towers? There wasn&#39;t time to arrange anything..  let alone the fact that the NIST report explains how the building fell down by itself.  There&#39;s no evidence of controlled demolition, people appeal to it falling in freefall but a) it didn&#39;t and b) the manner in which it collapsed is consistent with a damaged fire-weakened building giving way. </p>

<p>People see conspiracy for a deeper meaning despite all this because they say Silverstein gained financially from it.   But he didn&#39;t.   Court transcripts show Silverstein was only successful in getting $4 billion insurance cover whereas the rebuild value of the site was $7 billion.   In the end the Port Authority doubted he could afford to rebuild the main tower so he had to lose the lease for the as part of a deal. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see a motive to look for complex hidden reasons?   It was a crappy day for Silverstein too..      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you a home owner? Typically when buying a home you get all of your insurances written up prior to getting the financial loan and completing the purchase. Backers want to ensure their loan is going to be OK, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find out if it was required for the loan like flood insurance is for mine. I know that&#39;s really small scale but still applies. </p>

<p>You can file as many claims as you feel like you should or as your lawyers advise. In my dealings with insurance companies, they look for ways to say &quot;No&quot; as much as possible. That&#39;s a lot of money they would fight tooth and nail for if wronged. So is the insurance company in on it to? They were conspirators of &quot;Lucky&quot; and just rolled over and were like, please keep filing me claims and we will keep giving you money? Or was it written into his specific plan? What did arbitrators decide? </p>

<p>Plans change all the time. I planned on being to work on time today but had a flat. Thankfully my work didn&#39;t blow up. Or maybe I would have been hit by a train Final Destination style and am now waiting for my demise. </p>

<p>He might not. I will.</p>

<p>The odds that <em>the house i live in</em> gets damaged by a terror attack is effectively zero.</p>

<p>The odds that a <em>PREVIOUSLY ATTACKED</em> building with massive &quot;value&quot; to terrorists is attacked are quite a lot higher.</p>

<p>Even <em>if</em> the odds are astronomically small: You know what determines the price of insurance? Odds of the thing you&#39;re insuring against happening. Terror attacks being relatively rare makes it cheap to insure against.</p>

<p>you still can&#39;t equate buying auto insurance to terrorist insurance, it&#39;s a dumbass comparison. you probably have a one in a millions chance of one happening, and a very high chance of another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, it wasn&#39;t a one in a million chance. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s use January 1, 2001 as the date that Larry Silverstein begun negotiations to purchase the WTC. </p>

<p>The WTC officially opened on April 4, 1973. </p>

<p>10,134 days elapsed between 4/4/73 &amp; 1/1/01, and in those 10,134 days, 1 terrorist attack was perpetrated against WTC. </p>

<p>So the probability for the World Trade Center being attacked by terrorists was .000098% on any one given day, which equates to 98 TIMES more likely than your pull out of my ass number of 1/1,000,000. </p>

<p>The WTC is a statistical outlier when it comes to buildings attacked by terrorists. To pretend that the WTC wouldn&#39;t have its own set of rules when insuring against it would be asinine. It wasn&#39;t just some casual building in Manhattan. It was the TALLEST BUILDING THE FUCKING WORLD &amp; was a symbol for American hegemony. </p>

<p>To circle back around to the car insurance comparison, the average American gets into 3 car crashes in their driving lifetime. The average driving lifetime is ~55 years. So on any one given day, the average American has a probability of .00015% of getting into a car accident or 3/20075 </p>

<p>So at the time Silverstein entered negotiations to buy the WTC, on any one day, the Average American was a little less than twice as likely to get into a car crash as the WTC was likely to be attacked by terrorists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have none, as there&#39;s probably what, half a dozen people in the world that do have that type of experience? Not that it would be relevant at all. The only thing that is relevant is the commercial leasing and insurance process. </p>

<p>Pre-2001 the only thing that matters is that the building had insurance (100% required), which would have covered a terrorist attack as a matter of course. Attacks of this type were deemed such a remote possibility it would be absurd to include any stipulations relating to damage done by terrorist acts. So there was absolutely nothing unique or special about the insurance policy the group leasing the WTC took out. Realistically it should have paid out more to be honest. The group only got compensation for 1.3x the cap ($3.55B) for a single claim, when in reality they should have gotten the maximum $7.1B, as it was clearly 2 separate acts. </p>

<p>They do now, but only because private insurers did not have the free capital to cover that type of attack, estimated at $40B. When the government created the insurance/terrorism bill after 9/11 which describes what % of these claims they will cover, the clauses became a thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too have a huge amount of experience in commercial property and insurance. But in the UK, terrorism has always been either specifically included or excluded, terrorism cover is often additional and specifically expected by lenders. Then again we have suffered terrorism at the hands of the IRA for 50 years that would often lead to huge property damaged in. I would expect that high profile US buildings would be the same given theyd been subject to attacks before. I would also expect that multi national lenders would have global attitudes to risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention the fact that he could probably make more than that in the long run, and have more influence by actually keeping the building..</p>

<p>I mean, obviously that&#39;s a pretty amazing payout.. you pay $3.2 billion and then make $1.35 billion &quot;profit&quot; in 6 weeks. But at those kinds of figures I doubt you are even thinking &quot;oh yeah I just made 1.35 billion!&quot;, the influence and prestige of owning such a building.. and the rent you will make is gonna be worth so much more.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t even retain the rights to rebuild.. only being allowed to build 3 office buildings, which the rights to 1WTC went back to the port authority. So a lot of that money probably went back into building those three buildings.</p>

<p>With logic, yes. Insuring a building is not evidence of &quot;inside jobs&quot;. Everyone who owns a skyscraper will insure it. I&#39;m sure Donald&#39;s building - worldwide - are insured against terrorist attacks, because it&#39;s worth it (and cheaper) to pay up now, than to leave it to chance. </p>

<p>Even after 9/11, Donald rued that his building was then the tallest in New York. If you create something as large and publicly accessible as a building, you kind of want to take protective measures. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I suggest you look into how the FBI set up the &#39;93 attack as well. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no proof to suggest this. It was done by al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>Blame Bush, Cheney, Obama, and Biden for that. Radical Islam was here long before the 21st century (but definitely propagated by previous governments). </p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to question, it&#39;s another to pass off such questioning as inherent proof. </p>

<p>This we can agree on. People voted for Trump because they hate &quot;parties&quot;.</p>

<p>Dude, they were attacked in 1993.  He added the terrorism insurance months before 9/11 in 2001.   Was he &quot;brain dead&quot; for all those years, or is it more likely he knew the shit was coming?   I think you need to tune your BS detector a little better.</p>

<p>To be fair, that information wasn&#39;t included in the original post.</p>

<p>Anytime a policy is taken out prior to an &#39;accident&#39; is always suspicious. Big policy increase before a house or business fire? Life Insurance on your spouse just before they meet an untimely death? Yea, that&#39;s all suspicious.</p>

<p>My point was, it would be prudent to have such coverage on any building that&#39;s a known terrorist target and that in and of itself isn&#39;t all that suspicious. The timing, however, would be. Does the new coverage coincide with the time this guy took ownership? Or does that policy change predate that?  If it does coincide with the transfer of ownership then it&#39;s less suspicious as new owners often get their own policies for buildings when they purchase.</p>

<p>Yes, good point!  Too many other suspect things going on with it though, and I think his purchase right before the attacks is also suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree, there&#39;s a crap ton of stuff surrounding all of 9/11 that is suspect. I just don&#39;t think having insurance &quot;by chance&quot; is one of them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s better to make an argument consisting of just one strong point, instead of one strong point and a few weak points.  The weak points become targets of the opposition and are easier to argue against. If they can successfully argue against one of your weak points it will help to discredit your entire argument. Talking about suspect &#39;by chance&#39; insurance with out including context of how why and when the coverage was purchased weakens the argument rather than strengthens it. Hopefully that makes sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not by chance because <em>all</em> commercial insurance policies before 2001 covered terrorist acts simply because they didn&#39;t <em>exclude</em> damage from terrorist attacks. Attacks were deemed such a remote possibility that they were covered as a matter of course. Plain and simple. </p>

<p>If this were actually an issue surrounding 9/11, why is no one talking about insurers paying out $510M for the damages to the WTC in 1993? It was insured the exact same way at that point in time, and insurance paid accordingly. This new <em>group</em> of real estate investors, <em>led</em> by Silverstein obviously got new insurance with their new lease. They would never be allowed to make the purchase without it. </p>

<p>The difference is that after 9/11 it was realized that private insurers do not have the free capital to cover the events of modern warfare (read: terrorism.) So now the government covers part of insurance claims relating to this type of damage, and you have to make sure your insurance covers this type of damage outside of normal fire/explosion/smoke/debris damage which is always covered. Insurance plans became more complex because they do not simply look at the <em>type</em> of damage itself post 2001, they look at what <em>caused</em> that type of damage.</p>

<p>That being said, the vast majority of commercial lenders require terrorist acts to be covered in insurance plans post 2001 to insure they get their money no matter what happens. </p>

<p>So yeah, no traction here whatsoever for OP&#39;s claims. </p>

<p>Silverstein’s insurance plan happened to cover terrorist attacks “by chance”. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Larry Silverstein purchased the lease for the twin towers in 2001. The lease was signed July 24, 2001. Silverstein had built WTC7 in 1987, but owning the lease to WTC 1 &amp; 2 (and the smaller buildings on the site) was new. The terms of the lease <em>required</em> Silverstein and his WTC Partners to purchase insurance which included terrorist coverage.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://judicialview.com/ajaxupload/upload_pdf/Business_Valuation/1230750322.pdf">one of the court decisions (PDF):</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>WTCP covenanted by the terms of the leases to insure the buildings against loss from fire and other causes for the lesser of $1.5 billion or “actual replacement cost.” See, e.g., Agreement of Lease: One World Trade Center, § 14.1.1 (requiring insurance “equal to the lesser of (x) an amount sufficient to insure . . . the items of property described in this Subsection, except for the footings and foundations, to the extent of not less than the [actual replacement cost], and (y) One Billion Five Hundred Million and 00/100 Dollars . . . per occurrence”). The leases provide that <strong>there is to be no exclusion for terrorist acts</strong>, so long as such a policy term is available “at commercially reasonable rates.” Id.</p>

<p>who struck it rich on September 11th, 2001,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did he come out ahead because of the attack? Silverstein and his partners don&#39;t just get to keep all the money.</p>

<p>They still had all the obligations from when he bought the lease, including 120 million dollars a year in lease payments, repaying money they borrowed, and, last but not least, the requirement that they pay to rebuild the WTC! </p>

<p>The first insurance payments, for example, were used to pay back a $563 million loan from GMAC and also bought out the retail lease from Westfield America for $124 million.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=33161434&amp;amp;z=07d25976">this court transcript (PDF)</a>, the actual cash value of the WTC main site (not including WTC7) was appraised at $6.497 billion and the replacement cost at $7.183 billion.</p>

<p>Even with the double payout, the insurance was inadequate to cover Silverstein&#39;s obligation to rebuild the WTC. He had to renegotiate with the Port Authority.</p>

<p>Silverstein does not own the lease to the new One World Trade Center (which was once planned to be called Freedom Tower). He had to give that up in his negotiations with the Port Authority. He does own the rights to three buildings at the WTC site (one of which has opened), as well as WTC7, which is a separate property.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/JnLcUxV1dPo?t=1m35s">Here&#39;s</a> the rest of the video footage that shows more of the collapse (note: I used a video that advocates the &quot;inside job&quot; theory to show you it&#39;s not edited to fit my narrative). It&#39;s clear that the building begins collapsing ~7-8 seconds before the roofline collapses.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can also make out windows below the penthouse breaking, indicating that the structural support behind them had begun buckling long before the roofline comes down. Therefore, it&#39;s no surprise the roofline would have come down with little resistance.</p>

<p>Back to the topic though: If the collapses were truly impossible, why couldn&#39;t any of the various insurers prove it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries.

    <div class="md"><p>You should look up Ahmad Shah Massoud. He was bullied by the Clinton administration and the CIA who were funding Pakistan (who was using the money to directly fund al-Qaeda and keep the Afghani Civil War alive). When Bush took office he could only go off of what the Clinton CIA were doing so when 9/11 took place he turned to them for help. Bush, like most people, wanted to invade Afghanistan to fight al-Qaeda in their home territory, however the CIA, who were friends of a friend with al-Qaeda through Pakistan, convinced him it would be a bad idea to do so. They instead suggested invading Iraq as Saddam had huge territorial control and by seizing that power they could hopefully quell the taliban without having to be against their ally in Pakistan.</p>

<p>Had Clinton stopped funding Pakistan or at least supported Massoud equally, 9/11 never would have happened and Afghanistan would be a beacon of peace in not only the Middle East, but the world as evidenced by the fact that Massoud&#39;s homeland, in North Afghanistan where he ruled from, is still today one of the most peaceful and nonviolent places in the Middle East.</p>

<p>First off the computer generated model by NIST regarding to WTC7 show the building collapsing in a manner that obviously based on numerous angles didnt occur. </p>

<p>Then you have two witnesses that were stuck in WTC7 that are on record saying there were multiple small explosions happening while they were stuck inside the building(the controlled blasts were happening throughout the day and was not one uniformed blast).</p>

<p>There is also video of firefighters walking away from WTC7 telling people to get away because the building is coming down.  Around that same time you can hear an obvious loud explosion (obvious because all firefighters whip head around and look back and say did you hear that) right before the WTC7 collapses.</p>

<p>Add to the equation WTC7 was the only other building to collapse in the area around WTC1 &amp; WTC2 one should be left with little doubt as to what occurred.</p>

<p>Oh yeah..... The BBC and CNN both reported WTC7 had collapsed before it actually collapsed which by itself isnt all that odd but when considering the other pieces of information should be enough to make even the largest debunker shake his or her head. </p>

<p>For 2 years, forensic structural engineer Dr. J Leroy Hulsey (Chair of UAF&#39;s Civil and Environmental Engineering Department) and two Ph.D. research assistants have been working on a finite element model of WTC7 which has exposed NIST&#39;s official report: <a href="http://www.WTC7Evaluation.org">www.WTC7Evaluation.org</a></p>

The <strong>VAST</strong> majority of them disagree with the premise that only a &quot;controlled demolition&quot; could bring down the towers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard a couple of the people you mention. They <em>always</em> start their research on the premise that the &quot;official&quot; story is wrong. But their very approach and logic is wrong:</p>

<p>We <em>know</em> the towers collapse. Investigators then <em>follow the evidence</em> to determine the causes. 9/11 &quot;truthers&quot;, like Steve Jones, assume controlled demolition, then look for &quot;holes&quot; in explanations to prove their point. It&#39;s a backwards way of investigating. It makes it hard to argue against since it&#39;s almost impossible to prove a negative.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll (re)-check out the videos you posted, but they always rely on some kind of faulty logic to make their point, like the time of collapse of WTC7 that I pointed out as being misrepresented by some 9/11 &quot;truthers&quot;.</p>

<p>We know that the falling section of Building 7 did not crush the lower section of the building because the top section of Building 7 fell at freefall. It didn&#39;t just fall at something close to freefall. It fell for about 2.5 seconds at a rate that was indistinguishable from freefall. If the falling section of the building had crushed the lower section, the lower section would have pushed back with an equal but opposite force. But that would have slowed the fall. Since the fall was not slowed in the slightest, we can conclude that the force of interaction was zero... in both directions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how collapses work. Building are like 90% air. Air would not cause much resistance. The fact is the structural support below and behind the walls of the building had been compromised long before the final roofline began do descent.

We&#39;re talking about a building here, not Jenga set or a solid block.</p>

<p>Where did you get that? Here&#39;s what really happened.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the east penthouse collapsed, several seconds elapsed, then the west penthouse began to collapse, at nearly the same time the roofline of the building developed a kink near the center, then all support across the entire width of the building was suddenly removed, a vertical swath of windows under the west penthouse were simultaneously blown out, the building suddenly went limp, and (within a fraction of a second) it transitioned from full support to freefall. I am not using the term &quot;freefall&quot; loosely here. I used a video analysis tool to carefully measure the velocity profile of the falling building using CBS video footage from a fixed camera aimed almost squarely at the north wall. A video detailing this measurement is available at YouTube/user/ae911truth. I calibrated my measurements with the heights of two points in the building provided in the NIST Building 7 report released in August 2008, so I know the picture scale is good. My measurements indicate that with sudden onset the building underwent approximately 2.5 seconds of literal freefall. This is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. For an additional 8 stories it encountered minimal resistance, during which it continued to accelerate, but at a rate less than freefall. Only beyond those 16 stories of drop did the falling section of the building interact significantly with the underlying structure and decelerate.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the issue I have with this logic: If they had really conspired to drum up support for the war, why did they conspire to make the hijackers appear to be from Saudi Arabia? Drumming up support would have been waaaay easier if they had just said the hijackers were from Iraq. Or at least a few of them. The fact that they had to twist around what happened to justify going to war with Iraq makes me skeptical that they planned 9/11 in the first place.

<p>It was also a completely unprecedented catastrophe. An unprecedented catastrophe will yield unprecedented results. How many buildings have had as large of aircraft (full of fuel) purposely crash into them?

<p><strong>4  What caused the fires in WTC 7?</strong></p>

<p>Debris from the collapse of WTC 1, which was 370 feet to the south, ignited fires on at least 10 floors in the building at its south and west faces. However, only the fires on some of the lower floors—7 through 9 and 11 through 13—burned out of control. These lower-floor fires—which spread and grew because the water supply to the automatic sprinkler system for these floors had failed—were similar to building fires experienced in other tall buildings. The primary and backup water supply to the sprinkler systems for the lower floors relied on the city&#39;s water supply, whose lines were damaged by the collapse of WTC 1 and WTC 2. These uncontrolled lower-floor fires eventually spread to the northeast part of WTC 7, where the building&#39;s collapse began.</p>

<p><strong>5 How did the fires cause WTC 7 to collapse?</strong></p>

<p>The heat from the uncontrolled fires caused steel floor beams and girders to thermally expand, leading to a chain of events that caused a key structural column to fail. The failure of this structural column then initiated a fire-induced progressive collapse of the entire building.</p>

<li>Fires in high-rise buildings typically have a single point of origin on a single floor, whereas the fires in WTC 7 likely had a single point of origin on multiple (10) floors.</li>

<li>Water was available to fight fires in the other high rise buildings, but the water supply to fight fires in WTC 7 was impaired.</li>

<p>How may times in history had a building collapse resulted in tons of debris falling onto neighboring buildings?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NIST has stated clearly that the damage to WTC7 from falling debris did not play a significant role in the collapse, and moreover, their models show the building would have collapsed regardless. From the NIST WTC7 FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The debris from WTC 1 caused structural damage to the southwest region of WTC 7—severing seven exterior columns—but this structural damage did not initiate the collapse. The fires initiated by the debris, rather than the structural damage that resulted from the impacts, initiated the building&#39;s collapse after the fires grew and spread to the northeast region after several hours. The debris impact caused no damage to the spray-applied fire-resistive material that was applied to the steel columns, girders, and beams except in the immediate vicinity of the severed columns. The debris impact damage did play a secondary role in the last stages of the collapse sequence, where the exterior façade buckled at the lower floors where the impact damage was located. A separate analysis showed that even without the structural damage due to debris impact, WTC 7 would have collapsed in fires similar to those that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001. None of the large pieces of debris from WTC 2 hit WTC 7 because of the large distance between the two buildings.</p>

<p>I have. I suggest you listen to them. They all involve multiple loud explosives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not a logical argument. If you believe the NIST report, the building collapsed due to the failure of one single connection. If it&#39;s possible to collapse a building by failing one connection, then you could do it with a few pounds of thermite, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaJaUt_ujyE">a hydraulic jack</a>, or even a fucking cutting torch.

<p>It&#39;s clear that the building begins collapsing ~7-8 seconds before the roofline collapses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is from the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/faqs-nist-wtc-7-investigation">NIST WTC7 FAQ</a>. It&#39;s a description of the 5.4 seconds of collapse visible in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A49a9pXwDQs">this famous video</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).</p>

<p>Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)</p>

<p>Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ll note stage two acknowledges free fall. This is the important bit that can&#39;t be glossed over or ignored. </p>

<p>During the WTC7 First Draft press conference, high school physics teacher, David Chandler, publicly asked Shyam Sunder, lead NIST investigator, how they could explain the 2.5 seconds of free fall acceleration WTC7 experienced during its collapse. Sunder off-handed dismissed the idea as &quot;impossible.&quot; And if we&#39;re talking about a collapse driven solely by gravity, then he&#39;s right--buildings can&#39;t fall through themselves as though they&#39;re made of air. Intact structure below will resist the fall of the collapsing structure above <em>no matter what</em>. There are no exceptions to this. </p>

<p>Of course, in the final draft of the WTC7 report, NIST was forced to acknowledge there was a period of free fall because it was such an obvious and easily measurable phenomenon. Their explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This analysis showed that the 40 percent longer descent time—compared to the 3.9 second free fall time—was due primarily to Stage 1, which corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns in the lower stories of the north face. During Stage 2, the north face descended essentially in free fall, indicating negligible support from the structure below. This is consistent with the structural analysis model, which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes no sense. It might sound good to a layman, but it&#39;s not actually an explanation as to how eight stories of WTC7 effectively disappeared in an instant, allowing the entire perimeter structure to drop 100 ft in free fall. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a bunch of other glaring inconsistencies in the NIST WTC7 report, but this is really the big one.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem with your explanation. The 8 stories didn&#39;t &quot;disappear in an instant&quot;. I show in the video I posted that the penthouse collapses long before the roofline. Roughly 7-8 seconds by my count. That&#39;s plenty of time for multiple stories worth of supporting structure to buckle and collapse, thus providing very little resistance to the perimeter structure. You can even observe multiple windows suddenly break between the point at which the penthouse collapses and the point at which the roofline begins to descend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eight stories of the perimeter structure did effectively disappear in an instant--otherwise the perimeter structure could not have fallen all at once, symmetrically and at free fall right through itself. I can&#39;t really come up with a different way of explaining it. </p>

<p>If the interior were supporting the exterior structure, and the interior experienced a progressive collapse, then the support for the exterior would have disappeared progressively as well. The collapse of the East Penthouse suggests that the core collapse began on the east side of the building and continued west (over the space of a few seconds), so why the heck didn&#39;t the exterior collapse from east to west?</p>

<p>Think about it. What was holding up the east exterior face of the building after the east portion of the core collapsed? If east face couldn&#39;t stand without the interior structure to support it, then why didn&#39;t it start collapsing before the west face? IMO the both the free fall <em>and</em> the symmetry of the collapse are &quot;smoking guns&quot; for CD. The official explanation absolutely cannot account for either of these aspects of the collapse. Their &quot;very sophisticated&quot; computer models didn&#39;t even vaguely resemble the actual collapse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The inner core columns are separate from the outer structural steel columns.  If the inner core failing completely had pulled the outer structure down along with it, then we can say that there was no freefall.  But the inner core didn&#39;t pull it all down at the same time, the trusses disconnected.  NIST measured the outer structure&#39;s collapse and they ADMITTED freefall of this part of the structure.  Freefall is still only achieved if none of the lower structural steel is supporting the upper lattice of the outside shell.  To claim that the building didn&#39;t reach freefall acceleration is to deny the very NIST report that you support.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can also make out windows below the penthouse breaking, indicating that the structural support behind them had begun buckling long before the roofline comes down. Therefore, it&#39;s no surprise the roofline would have come down with little resistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would the buckling of a few supporting columns holding up the center of the top of the building immediately demolish all structural support of the rest of the building so the entirety of the building can collapse at one time? It is in fact a VERY big surprise the roofline comes down with little to no resistance (remaining level with the ground as well), as that could not have happened without the simultaneous failure of the rest of the structural support of the building, which should not have occured because a few columns near the top center buckled. That was healthy steel structure keeping the building standing a second before it collapsed, where did it go and why did it happen at the almost the exact same time for all of the rest of the supporting steel columns?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Back to the topic though: If &quot;natural&quot; collapses were truly impossible, why couldn&#39;t any of the various insurers prove it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because to go against the official story would put your entire corporation and possibly the lives of some of the administration in immediate risk. Also, it&#39;s very possible that backdoor deals could be conducted to insure complicity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, the building does not come straight down. You can see from the other angles that the roofline caves in towards the middle and the entire building leans back towards where it had sustained direct damage from one of the Twin Towers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The roofline caving towards the middle was drastically skewed by the perspective of the first film, in the clip with the angle of viewing that is level with the roofline you can see that it just BARELY, if at all, caves in towards the middle first, then the outside support fails almost immediately after that (which would not be explained by a progressive collapse, but would be explained by explosive charges placed on the center columns detonating slightly before the charges on the outer columns).</p>

<p>According to the seismographic data, the collapse started about six seconds before the east penthouse fell into the building, so the whole collapse is at least 3 times as long as the 6.5 seconds claimed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you like an example then?</p>

<p>You cherry picked one section from this longer section to try and show that NIST supports your claim that the building was in free fall.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The analyses of the video (both the estimation of the instant the roofline began to descend and the calculated velocity and acceleration of a point on the roofline) revealed three distinct stages characterizing the 5.4 seconds of collapse:
Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).
Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)
Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity
This analysis showed that the 40 percent longer descent time—compared to the 3.9 second free fall time—was due primarily to Stage 1, which corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns in the lower stories of the north face. During Stage 2, the north face descended essentially in free fall, indicating negligible support from the structure below. This is consistent with the structural analysis model, which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above. In Stage 3, the acceleration decreased as the upper portion of the north face encountered increased resistance from the collapsed structure and the debris pile below.</p>

<p>You conveniently ignore stage 1 which is a result of the columns failing as stated in the NIST analysis.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find exactly what I was thinking of but this is close enough. Here Sunder explains why there <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be any free fall in his progressive collapse scenario:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Free-fall time would be an object that has no structural components below it…[but, referring to Building 7]…There was structural resistance that was provided in this particular case. And you had a sequence of structural failures that had to take place and everything was not instantaneous.”</p>

<p>Based on what NIST was saying the time predicted for the collapse to take place and the reality of how long the collapse took matched up.

<p>This is circular reasoning, since they based their model on the observed collapse.</p>

<p>To pose a similar question. Why should I trust you? What credentials do you have? So far all you have done is completely misunderstand the concept of computer modeling, cherry pick data from NIST while simultaneously insinuating they are unreliable, claimed that NIST did not look at a shred of physical evidence (seems unlikely but if you have proof go ahead and source it), and refused to source the quotes that you are providing.

    <div class="md"><p>You are asking extremely simple questions that don&#39;t model the events and then making a leap to controlled demolition backed up by the answers to those two not based in reality questions. Not to mention they were addressed in the report.</p>

<p>The answers to your questions are yes, maybe and maybe.</p>

<p>You used the term &quot;any evidence&quot; lead the reader to a &quot;no&quot; answer but of course they used physical evidence.  NIST&#39;s computer model is based on the blueprints for the building and the evidence that they could gather from video footage of the collapse and events leading to it.</p>

<p>Why did you use the term &quot;significant chance&quot;? To lead the reader to a &quot;no&quot;?  The building didn&#39;t just catch on fire then fall and the chance isn&#39;t significant but it is just something that can happen if the right circumstances are met.  Again they went over what they think happened based on the evidence they could gather and what other things that may have probably happened in the report.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how the first two questions lead to this question but whatever.  When a building totally collapses and there is a demolition crew at the building and city permits for a demolition then there is a 100% chance that explosives where used.

<p>What options? What has been proven to cause rapid, total, vertical skyscraper collapse besides explosives (more precisely: applied energy)? It&#39;s the only known cause, so it&#39;s the only conclusion you can rationally make unless you can rule it out or prove something else. You haven&#39;t and NIST didn&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re exaggerating my words somewhat. I&#39;ve not said anything inconsistent with the NIST report.   The collapse, they state, begins with the NE corner,  then some seconds later from floor 13 and proceeds inwards falling quickly through already weakened flooring.   In just speaking of it from what I can see in the video..  The roof top part in the corner falls noticeably in advance of the rest of the building by some clear seconds.   Goodness knows how much of the structure is compromised in that first uneven collapse.   A structurally compromised building falling in free fall is hardly surprising.   It&#39;s just that conspiracy videos seem to present it as if it went from solid to free call collapse in an instant rather than what clearly happens which is a partial collapae due to failure somewhere followed by everything else tumbling after. </p>

<p>That&#39;s where we disagree. Any intact structure will resist the collapse and thus prevent free fall. In the WTC7 case at least 8 stories of intact structure effectively disappears and evidenced by the 2.25 seconds of free fall that even NIST acknowledged. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter that portions of the building were already collapsing. Even if the entire interior had collapsed into the basement, the perimeter structure still can&#39;t free fall right down through itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t quite right on 2 counts.   First, a building like this is only design to support static loads and a limited amount of dynamic forces due to wind etc.  It&#39;s absolutely not designed to put up even a seconds worth of resistance to an entire floor collapsing on it. </p>

<p>Second, in addition to the above, the joints were already weakened by the fire.  Whatever strength was initially in the building was reduced by the time floor 13 was collapsing. </p>

<p>If you watch the video,  the first to bit collapsing appears to be the &quot;floor 13&quot; girder giving way that NIST refer to.   This collapse proceeds for a couple of seconds, mostly out of view,  before internally compromising the structure enough that the bottom gives out.   Once the lower part of facade buckled even an inch there&#39;s no way it was going to go at anything other than freefall after that.   The girders are design to support a floor and office furniture, not stop several thousand tons of moving metal and concrete. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert, however I tend to think that if the entire supporting structure of a single floor were to give way <em>simultaneously</em>--that is every core and perimeter column buckling more or less at the same time--then the momentum accumulated by the building falling <em>as a single block</em> onto the intact structure below could very well cause a global, symmetrical collapse. </p>

<p>Problem is it&#39;s inconceivable that each of the dozens of supporting perimeter and core columns would give way at more or less the same time due to scattered office fires. Obviously. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nonsense. Even NIST agreed that the falling North Tower block needed to accelerate downwards through an entire floor to generate the momentum to initiate a global collapse. See <a href="http://www.911-strike.com/BazantZhou.htm">Bazant and Zhou</a>. </p>

<p>What&#39;s more buildings have to be able to withstand earthquakes in which the ground might rise and drop more waaaay more than an inch. To say that a drop of one inch in free fall is enough to take out an entire steel framed building is ludicrous--let alone in a symmetrical free fall. </p>

<p>How do you explain heavy building pieces being thrown hundreds of feet with enough force to cause severe structural damage to WTC7 (as most official storytards believe happened)?</p>

<p>Just go up to the start of this thread. It&#39;s easy to follow:</p>

<p>I asked you questions.</p>

<p>You tried to deflect by arguing something completely different.</p>

<p>I repeated my questions.</p>

<p>You have a silly answer.</p>

<p>I shot it down.</p>

<p>You <em>abandoned your argument</em>, and started with the insults.</p>

<p>I accepted  your defeat.</p>

<p>You kept with the insults, although it didn&#39;t work the first time.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t let you get the last word.</p>

<p>You claim there never was an argument, despite already trying to answer it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a pity, really. I&#39;ve posed the same argument to many if you truthers, and all of you run away from it. No one has ever been able to invent an answer to what is such an obvious hole in their conspiracy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll allow you the last word now. </p>

This is an over exaggeration, but if I could personally push what stories I want people to see I could really influence how a lot of people think. If I got all of my information from just one source, I&#39;d have a pretty narrow view, if that same source was actually pushing stories from 5-6 different news sources, I&#39;d &quot;think&quot; I had a pretty well rounded view, but really I have just as narrow of a view as the other guy.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how reddit works.  A lot of us have been here long enough to have already seen the proof posted by OP, we are a conspiracy community, we&#39;ve researched this stuff.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s like, I don&#39;t go to a post about rebuilding a transmission on a mechanics forum and ask for cited sources for each point, a lot of the things in the post will be self evident to the mechanics.  We are not required to bring people up to speed who snobbily dismiss the post by calling it unsourced.  </p>

<p>Truthfully OP and twsmith are both right on a lot of points, but smith is mostly calling out OP on semantics and creating strawmen.  For example, he completely dismissed OPs point that the building was condemned for asbestos.  The building hadn&#39;t actually been condemned at that point, but there were several assessments showing that legally the asbestos in the building HAD to be removed.  He dismissed the whole point because OP used the word &quot;condemned&quot; but the jist of what he was saying was right.  </p>

<p>OP was also right that the office fires were tiny compared to dozens of other cases of steel-framed highrises that suffered far more fire damage yet their structural steel remained completely intact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck it, I&#39;ll take on your bullshit even though conveniently OP set you up by adding unnecessary false claims, disinformation and rumors. </p>

<p>Insurance policy details are irrelevant. Larry was a part of the NWO secret society of scumbags that planned and executed the attacks, he played his smaller part in the operation knowing full well what he was getting out of it, a fortune, and the advanced agenda of the NWO being moved forward. </p>

<p>Larry being in the mob is disinformation bullshit and irrelevant. </p>

<p>The collapse time is irrelevant, again this is just to distract. </p>

<p>Few tiny office fires or blazing inferno doesn&#39;t matter, again more distraction to keep people arguing over minutia details, as in what caused the collapse rather than who planned the collapse. </p>

<p>Who designed the &quot;freedom&quot; tower or whether or not it&#39;s &quot;Orwelian&quot; again, irrelevant. </p>

<p>Did he come out ahead? OF COURSE. If you know anything about real estate and finance (and I own 16 properties) you would know this was a MASSIVE win for Lucky Larry. </p>

<p>No one wanted office space in those overpriced outdated shithole buildings with all the new shiny competition around Manhattan, they were losing money and needed hundreds of millions of dollars in code updates. </p>

<p>NO ONE could have afforded to renovate those buildings and ever make money in a thousand years. To take over those buildings when Larry did was the worst move in real estate history, and you can ask ANY property expert. No one in their right mind would have put together the deal Larry did with all the information that was available. </p>

<p>He got to destroy old buildings no one wanted to rent in, and current renters were leaving, and rebuild new state of the art buildings to earn massive rents off of for his company for the next 100 years. </p>

<p>He put up virtually no funding of his own to acquire those buildings, it was all finance. The bank gave him the loans to repay over decades, the insurance paid the banks off, Lucky Larry reaps the rewards of a real estate empire. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be stupid. </p>

<p>The one day Larry is not at the towers is the day they collapse. Also his children who were also there working at those times everyday were miraculously late for work for the first time. </p>

<p>Anyone who can look at the FACTS, not rumors or disinformation about the Lucky Larry real estate deal and think he&#39;s not involved in the plot is a shill or someone intentionally not willing to look at the facts objectively. </p>

<p>Larry was used to take control of the buildings and allow the necessary people access to the buildings. He has been rewarded incredibly for it, the part he didn&#39;t plan on was ever being accused, he thought his buddies would have done a far better job pinning the attacks on some brown guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing that apparently connects him is, 1. He didn&#39;t die there. 2. He had insurance he was required to have anyway, which paid him a good amount of money he probably would have made anyway that he then had to put back into rebuilding some of the WTC towers and 3. he said two words that are associated with demolition but are also associated with a lot of other professions and can easily be said in a high stress scenario.</p>

<p>There&#39;s pretty much no conclusive evidence that he was related. Yeah there are a lot of fishy parts with 9/11 and probably some parts of the government were related (they sure as hell took advantage of it) but this is just grasping at straws.</p>

They pretended to fight the fire, but the real plan was to detonate explosives that some amount of people had previously planted. Larry, the Marshall, and anyone involved with planting the explosives all swore to secrecy, and not one of them ever broke this pact of secrecy.</p>

<p>The one problem? On camera, the leader of this conspiracy, was recorded giving an order to &quot;pull it,&quot; the official term for demolishing a building.</p>

<p>Come on man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either you believe that. Or you believe Larry Silverstein gave orders to firefighters to get out of a building because they couldn&#39;t contain the fires. Then the building fell because of hot office fires into its own footprint. Firefighters don&#39;t use the term pull it, its not in their vernacular. </p>

<p>A) Larry Silverstein, billionaire mass murderer and key architect behind one of the greatest crimes in US history, which has involved 16 years of cover up and involved at least many dozens of people planting explosives for a controlled demolition, accidentally revealed the whole thing during an interview.</p>

<p>B)Larry Silverstein used language you find to be untraditional during an interview when referring to pulling out the firefighters and abandoning the rescue mission of the building. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>iirc, one major issue with the 9/11 attacks and why the towers fell was that the asbestos covering the steel support beams had already been removed, exposing them to the heat of the burning jet fuel, which weakened them and resulted in the collapse.  People should get a grip when it comes to asbestos - it really doesn&#39;t need to be removed in most cases, and it serves an important function.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoah, this would definitely change my opinion on the whole &quot;thermal expansion&quot; excuse for the collapse.  I&#39;ve always wonders why would the towers react differently than other skyscraper fires?  There are plenty of examples of buildings of similar size and construction being on fire for entire days and not collapsing, but take away all of the fire resistant insulation and now you have a decent excuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it was a conspiracy or inside job. I do have questions however. Say the jet fuel on fire was enough to melt the beams, the beans closest give way first. Then beams farther away. Why did the upper floors collapse straight down? The plane was not in the very center of the building. Heat did not get evenly distributed towards all four sides of the building. How then does it drop in a straight line, shouldn&#39;t one side have collapsed first? Then the opposite side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will correct my previous comment - asbestos abatement was not done prior to the 9/11 attacks at either wtc tower.  The issue was that due to asbestos hysteria in the early 1970&#39;s, asbestos fireproofing had only been applied to the 1st through 64th floors.  I have no idea how that made any sense.  Here&#39;s a link for more info about how asbestos fireproofing was never applied to the 64th floor &amp; up at either tower from the time they were built:
<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/09/14/asbestos-could-have-saved-wtc-lives.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/09/14/asbestos-could-have-saved-wtc-lives.html</a>
My apologies, I was mistaken about the asbestos having been removed prior to 9/11, the reality is that it had never been applied to the floors 65 and up in the first place.
Here&#39;s another article that says more about how and why asbestos fireproofing was not used as it should have been:

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, so you were again just glossing over the fact that you thought it was only one article but there are more than one. Okay then.</p>

<p>And no, I don&#39;t even usually comment on reddit at all and very very very rarely on this sub bc I know it&#39;s generally impossible to even gain anything useful from people so indoctrinated, let alone convince them they could be wrong about something.  I only commented on this particular thread because I had legitimately never heard before that the motivation for hitting the pentagon was to cover up embezzlement of funds within the pentagon.  It seems so ridiculousness and over the top to me given how much money regularly goes missing within the pentagon (kinda like burning down your house over a hole in the wall), not to mention the fact that if someone wasn&#39;t able to embezzle money from the pentagon I seriously doubt their competency in pulling off and covering up this huge conspiracy, that I was honestly hoping to get some kind of a rationalization for this otherwise laughable belief.  Instead I got your weird response of &quot;seems pretty successful to me.&quot;</p>

<p>No I am not having any fun here.  </p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;m no conspiracy theorist(hi from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>), but there were defense contractors who made quite a few buttloads of cash from those two little wars that we fought, one of which we&#39;re still kinda dealing with. It&#39;s not a feat of mental gymnastics to believe money went from defense contractors to shady government officials.</p>

<p>The CIA knew active cells were on US soil but wouldn&#39;t share with the FBI and then they lost track of them. Hence George Tenet&#39;s infamous quote when he saw the planes hitting the towers.</p>

<p>When the FBI got wind of AQ assets in the US it was given to one field office (NYC) and to a rookie agent.</p>

<p>FBI agent Harry Samit arrested Zaccarias Moussauoi but others in the DoJ wouldn&#39;t give him the warrant he needed to get into Moussauoi&#39;s personal belongings and computers because they were all CYA and didn&#39;t want to get done for profiling. Samit, a formal Naval aviator had a hunch they were planning some kind of hijack.</p>

<p>The sprinkler system had shut off and the building burned for hours, completely unfought. There are videos of firefighters watching the building burning and commenting that it was going to collapse, because it had a bulge and was leaning. The structural integrity was completely gone. It looked like it was going to collapse from fire, you just can&#39;t fake shit like that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;just happened&quot; lol.<br/>
Except that it was the first day in history for such an event.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the only investigation that should potentially be done should be to prevent buildings from falling in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that wasn&#39;t even done because the crime scene was <strong>immediately</strong> taken over by the scum that made the crime in the first place.  That in itself is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl85JSvDmsA">extremely suspect. </a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There should be NO investigation into controlled demolition, I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s a possibility that should be explored, that&#39;s how ridiculous it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your opinion doesn&#39;t matter in this.  Explosive residues were found,  numerous and massive explosions were heard and reported.  World-class demolition experts with 30 years of experience are Adamant that it is.  Any investigation shouldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t pre-judge like you do.  We now know this was a crime scene.  The planes were used to cover the crime but they didn&#39;t hit WTC7,  hence &quot;smoking gun&quot;.   It takes way more than a few debris and fires for 40,000 tons of steel to fail.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The North and South towers were not designed to sustain the damage that they did on 9/11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah,  just built to sustain the damage of a slightly smaller boeing.   EVEN THAT was foreseen by the designers.  Yet still there is a consensus that the top section could NOT have destroyed the rest of the building.  This is high school physics: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXRDq9nKJ0U&amp;amp;t=6141">(watch until 01:46:00);</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>it shouldn&#39;t be a surprise to anyone that they fell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is extremely surprizing that these towers fell the way they did.  You have to know more about physics to see that,  and you have to know more about the implications of what happened on that day to see the terrifying motives.  Maybe you should watch NPH on youtube instead of ranting these under-informed views.  There is a huge amount of research on the topic that is already well exposed for all to see.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You cannot protect a building from every single thing that could possibly happen, they were well constructed buildings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that the official narrative doesn&#39;t match what&#39;s visible on the videos and the laws of physics don&#39;t fit what&#39;s on video,  or the narrative at ALL.  9/11 is all a big lie,  to fool people(like you perhaps?)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They weren&#39;t designed to withstand impacts from the planes that ended up hitting them, and even then, everything was theoritical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were designed to withstand the impact of a slightly smaller boeing.  Even then,  that doesn&#39;t explain the collapse,  which shouldn&#39;t have happened according to 3,000 architects and Engineers,  and the laws of physics once you study the details which are available and well exposed in NPH.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The WTC 7 fires were not fought. At all. Not by firefighters or sprinklers. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>WTC7 and even the towers,  were small fires.  Most of WTC7 was completely intact.  There was also numerous videos (AND reports) of MOLTEN STEEL on site.  This cannot be explained neither by planes nore by office fires.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Generally buildings are also not hit by massive chunks of debris from other falling towers. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was negligible,  even NIST admits that.  There aren&#39;t even useful points.  A sure sign that you have <em>NOT</em> watched the videos and analyses of the experts before making your statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know if this was an engineering failure as much as it was an extremely unique and catastrophic scenario.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well experts whose career it is to know these things have already told us what they think, soo...  And I see it makes perfect sense,  once you look closely at the details.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t mind me asking what do you believe happened on that day? What do you think caused the collapse of the towers, mainly WTC 7? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Believe it or not,  at first I didn&#39;t buy MOST of the truther ideas.
I could only believe that WTC7 was a smoking gun, because it so obviously was.  The symmetrical freefall collapse is the ultimate smoking gun.  But I didn&#39;t buy any of the other explanations.  Then I watched NPH on youtube.  And the discrepencies started piling up.  Perhaps the biggest black pill of all.  And then other more specific videos followed.  Papertrail videos were very eye-popping.  Until it was becoming more and more obvious by the day that it was an inside job,  like a big puzzle.<br/>
Once you actually look at the availble evidence,  it is clear that WTC7 was 100% absolutely brought down by thermitic demolition charges,  more specifically high-tech nanothermite,  which was also confirmed in high-tech labs,  found inside the WTC dust,  and of course,  was <strong>NOT</strong> supposed to be there at all.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I was going to dismantle each of your points one by one, but as I read more of your comment I realised you&#39;re too far gone to even talk to about this. You have poor standards of evidence, poor critical thinking skills, and a poor understanding of science. This is why I don&#39;t talk about 9/11 on the internet anymore, thank you for reminding me. </p>

<p>You mention physics, which you clearly don&#39;t have even a small grasp of, because if you did you wouldn&#39;t say what you&#39;re saying. If the laws of physics were violated it would be an open and shut case, 9/11 would be an inside job. There is no consensus anywhere that 9/11 was an inside job. A small fringe of society believes it was. The engineers that believe it was an inside is such a s number, and the majority of them aren&#39;t engineers in relevant fields. There is actually pretty much a consensus going against you.  You link hacky YouTube videos that no one would consider proof other than someone who wants to be convinced it was an inside job. That tells me all I need to know about you. </p>

<p>You mention explosive residue, in your next response you&#39;d probably link me a Steven Jones article that was published on website that no one who respects science takes seriously. You speaking about nano thermite is pretty much the nail in the coffin, it is no different than saying that there was nukes under the towers. Each of them are both ridiculous and do not have any basis in reality or evidence. The only way you could ever reach the conclusions you&#39;ve reached is if you have no objectivity or skepticism. This is the problem with people like yourself, you can be convinced of anything by anyone. </p>

<p>Every single argument you have I heard 5 years ago. Nothing is new, your movement isn&#39;t advancing in the slightest, 9/11 truthers are a dying breed, for obvious reasons. It is people like yourself that alienate a lot of people from conspiracy theories.  </p>

<p>I hope one day you will see why your complete line of thinking is deeply, deeply flawed. I&#39;d also like to thank you for reminding me why I don&#39;t engage online with people like you. There&#39;s no winning, if your standards of evidence are that poor, there is no helping you. Good luck.</p>

<p>Silverstein’s insurance plan happened to cover terrorist attacks “by chance”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost all insurance plans covered acts of terror before 9/11.  Now many of the plans exclude terror unless you are willing to pay extra for removal of the &quot;act of terror exclusion.&quot;  </p>

<p>So I wouldn&#39;t call this &quot;by chance.&quot;  He bought standard insurance on the buildings to cover his (and his investors) investments.  Insurance also covered the towers in the 1993 bombing, again, not by chance, but by industry standard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The price-tag to Silverstein was 3.2 billion for two office towers that were going to need close to another 3 billion in renovations that the clock was fast running out on getting started with to avoid having them condemned and permanently closed as a threat to public safety.</p>

<p>Beyond the asbestos problem there was also a report I have no way of confirming that there was actually an even more serious design flaw with the way the exterior aluminum sheathing on the towers had been directly secured to the structural steel framework with iron bolts that owing to highly reactive nature of the two metals when brought into direct contact were quite literally disintegrating and raising the possibility of the huge sections starting to come away and fall into the streets below. </p>

<p>Something that wasn&#39;t considered at the time they were built just as it wasn&#39;t on many cars that were also built in the 70&#39;s with all kinds of shiny aluminum trim that all prematurely rusted out where they had been directly attached to the cars steel bodies in much the same way, so there is a very good possibility that too may have been true.</p>

<p>In either or both cases it would have created an unrecoverable expense that wouldn&#39;t have raised the value of the property much beyond what Silverstein had already agreed to pay for it  or raise the already inadequate revenues they generated beyond what they were when he and his group of investors put their paltry 100 million down on that purchase and managed to secure the property.</p>

<p>Clearly the best and only option would have been to take the two buildings down in a controlled demolition and build an entirely new structure on the property that would meet all of today&#39;s standards and be a paying proposition were it not for one very important and highly significant little fact...</p>

<p>An application to demolish the two structures in a controlled demolition had already been submitted to the authorities, but had been flatly rejected on the grounds that there were simply too many nearby streets and buildings that all could have been severely damaged due to an inadequate safety zone for the kind of controlled explosions and falling debris that would result from it. </p>

<p>That left the only other option of dismantling and removing them from the site piece by piece in virtually the reverse order that they had been built and which also would have run close to another 3 billion to do.</p>

<p>There is no way that Silverstein could possibly have been unaware of any of those facts, nor for us to believe that he could have swung the deal with only 100 million down if it wasn&#39;t for the hefty liability that was already hanging over them.</p>

<p>Are we to presume that Silverstein &amp; Co. just blindly walked into this no-win situation that abruptly turned into a huge win-win-windfall on 9/11 due to a minor fiddle with the legal jargon on a completely new insurance policy that he also took the time to doubled-down on? The other surrounding facts including the one that allowed Silverstein&#39;s private take over of what was a public property and the first of it&#39;s kind in NYC are also worth knowing and can be found here...</p>

If 9/11 were an inside job, there&#39;s no way he&#39;d be left out of the loop. There&#39;s way too much risk that he&#39;d find out about any conspiracy to stage a terrorist attack, especially considering that at the time the Defense Intelligence Agency reported directly to him. Hell, Rumsfeld was entirely comfortable with distorting intelligence - he founded the Office of Special Plans specifically to manufacture evidence that Iraq was involved with Al-Qaeda. If there were a government conspiracy behind 9/11, Rumsfeld would absolutely have been part of it and wouldn&#39;t have risked his life like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t bullshit you, I don&#39;t give a fig about 9/11 or what could have happened, nor do I have interest in debate in general (I tend to find it silly and filled with posturing &#39;im smart nonsense) This post showed up, I read damn near all the comments and your response to lots of things prompted the way I&#39;m currently viewing your position on this topic in this thread. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all about looking into things critically, and while there may have been some things odd about 9/11, as a whole, I don&#39;t buy the inside job thing. Lots of shady crap happens all over the world every day. That doesn&#39;t make it anymore than just that. Minor occurrences with small ramifications obscuring something pretty simple (at least in my eyes) especially if you&#39;re looking for them. </p>

<p>There is a bloke somewhere in the comments that very accurately details how insurance and this Silverstein guys obligation to his contract and investors etc. Is he a shady dude? Sure. Is he part of some &#39;inside job&#39; for being a shady dude (like many MANY capitalists) I seriously doubt it. There are plenty of times I don&#39;t bother to go into my office for whatever the hell reason. One time one of the elevators broke and could&#39;ve hurt me. It didn&#39;t, but that&#39;s because I was more interested in getting a Bloody Mary than being at work at that time. Coincidences can just be that and should be taken singularly and critically before being applied to a grander wild possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man fair enough. I&#39;m not gonna sit here and make excuses (except this one lol) but I was at work all day trying to answer people and could not possibly have the time to answer everyone in detail so I admit some answers came off as lazy and uneducated. But the fact is that I&#39;m about as educated on the subject as possible, having spent literally hundreds of hours researching the topic. It hits home for me especially hard.</p>

<p>That being said the entire conspiracy relies soley on the physics of the collapse in order to prove it had to be facilitated by people on the inside. I understand people think that because they caught fire this easily explains the collapse. The truth is that it doesn&#39;t. All three buildings fell symmetrically, at near free fall acceleration through the path of most resistance. THIS is the one and only smoking gun. Nothing more nothing less. Not to be condescending by any means but think for a minute about what that means. For a building to fall like that all the resistance below must be removed. The point below impact was uncompromised even by fire so how is it that it did nothing to stop or even slow the collapse? Like in jenga, a structure that has experienced assymetric damage falls over in that direction, it physically can not pile drive itself through more of something that is structurally identical to it. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The buildings should have crushed an equal amount downwards and or then fell off to the side leaving the majority still standing. </p>

<p>As a side note, buildings tend to be built with a structural redundancy factor of about three to five times the actual load for safety. Where did all that resistance go? That is the question that really needs answering.</p>

<p>Here I will leave a couple of extremely good resources in case you ever decide to look deeper than what we are told.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man fair enough. I&#39;m not gonna sit here and make excuses (except this one lol) but I was at work all day and hardly had time to respond properly to everyone so I admit my responses came off lazy and uneducated. However this isn&#39;t the case for me I have spend literally hundreds of hours researching it because it hits especially close to home for me. </p>

<p>The real issue that is the foundation for the truth movement is the speed, and symmetry with which the towers fell. They fall at near free fall (building 7 did hit freefall) acceleration through the path of most resistance, straight through the uncompromised supporting structures below. The implications of this a massive. Not to be condescending by any means but think about it for a minute. For 10% of a building to fall through the other 90% as if there was essentially zero resistance it means that resistance must have been removed. Buildings are usually built with a structural redundancy factor of 3 to 5 times the actual load just to be safe. The point I&#39;m trying to make is simply that it&#39;s not that they collapsed its how. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s been repeatedly reported that Larry Silverstein had insured the Twin Towers a year earlier, and it is more than &quot;coincidental&quot; that this insurance covered terrorist attacks. Further, Silverstein had numerous legal disputes that aimed to increase the payout by arguing that there were two separate attacks. To a first approximation, this was successful and Silverstein managed to claim approximately $4.6 billion.</p>

<p>Rebuttal: What conspiracy theorists don&#39;t mention about this is that the total cost of the towers was significantly in excess of this — the insurance value was way below what it should have been. Most of the legal wrangling after the fact was also due to the insurance contracts being incomplete. The total cost of the attack would be in the region of $7 billion or more, leaving a considerable loss once the relatively measly insurance payout was claimed. With too low an insurance value and less-than-solid contracts, literally none of the insurance-based activities seem to point to the actions of people who knew exactly what was going to happen in advance. If it was an insurance scam, it was the worst ever.[10]</p>

<p>We&#39;ve already noted that the World Trade Center had already been bombed once before in 1993, and that several major terror plots against U.S. landmarks had been uncovered since then. In light of this, an anti-terrorism insurance policy would appear to be an entirely logical purchase. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agree about the easily becoming disillusioned and I&#39;ve had to spend a ton of energy exploring many misdirections in the hope of finding the truth. However I do personally believe he was involved. </p>

<p>For one, would it be more suspicious if his family (son and wife) who both worked with him at the WTC, also happened to be late that day as well? </p>

<p>Or how about the fact that for some reason a higher bidder to purchase the property backed out last minute? </p>

<p>Now I agree that none of these can be considered evidence but that doesn&#39;t mean they arent, if that makes sense. </p>

<p>It is my personal belief that they had to be taken down by some sort of shadow element within our goverment as well as private sector simply because of the physics required for symmetical collapse let alone at near free fall acceleration. So when you&#39;ve come to that conclusion as I have, it only makes sense that the owner of the complex new what was going on. I say this for many reasons, one is simply the odd coincidences surrounding his accuisition of the property as well as statements he has made. Two is because of his high profile connections. For example did you know that Marvin Bush (georges brother) sat on the board of directors for the company in charge of security for the WTC?</p>

<p>I get that none of this is solid evidence and it never will be as long as it stays buried in the corners of the internet. The goal of the truth movement is simply to get enough people asking enough questions and demanding a new independant, unbiased investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Larry Silverstein in a PBS documentary in 2002 called America Rebuilds:</p>

<p>&quot;I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire, and I said, &#39;We&#39;ve had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.&#39; And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse.&quot;</p>

<p>His pull it statement has been taken to mean that he ordered the demolition of Building 7, which could only have happened if it had been rigged in advance, which in turn means the whole thing was an inside plot. However, Silverstein denies this and claims that by pull it he meant to withdraw the firefighters from Building 7. But this doesn&#39;t make sense for several reasons:</p>

<p>a) If he had meant the firefighters, he would have said pull them, not pull it.
b) The firefighters had withdrawn from Building 7 at 11am that day, so it would have made no sense for him to withdraw them if they were not even inside the building.
c) In the same PBS documentary, workers mentioned that they were pulling building 6 when they were bringing it down. That would indicate that pull can be used as a term to demolish a building.
d) The context and sequence in which Silverstein said pull it and then right after And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse indicates a cause-effect relationship between those two terms.
e) The fires in Building 7 were not uncontainable. They were mediocre at best. This is apparent from the photos and videos of the fire in that building. Remember that this was a steel high rise which contained many important government offices that was made of the best materials, not wood. So there was no reason to abandon it or bring it down (unless Silverstein or the perpetrators had a nefarious reason for doing so). And even if the fires were raging on it, so what? Other skyscrapers have burned for longer hours (e.g. Windsor Tower in Madrid, Beijing Cultural Center Tower) but did not have to be brought down. Their structure withstood the flames, so why couldn&#39;t Building 7, especially when it was made of the best materials?</p>

<p>Whatever Silverstein actually meant by pull it, the collapse of Building 7 is a smoking gun no doubt, and could not be explained by any fire hypothesis. It was so inexplicable in fact that the 9/11 Commission didn&#39;t even mention its collapse in its report.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Silverstein seemed to have foreknowledge of 9/11. Weeks before 9/11, he leased the WTC and bought insurance on it that would specifically cover terrorism. This earned him over 4 billion dollars for its destruction. So for him, the deaths of 3,000 people on 9/11 was alucky jackpot event?. So it would seem he had foreknowledge of the event and planned for it accordingly by making sure he profited from it. The WTC was losing money in that it was not renting out all of its offices, and was in need of renovation to clean it of asbestos, which would have been too costly. So instead of losing money, Silverstein profited greatly. In short, it was an insurance scam.</p>

<p>Also, every morning, he usually ate at the restaurant on the top floor of the WTC. But on 9/11, he did not eat there, and his daughter also did not show up at the WTC either. This suggests that he knew something was going to happen.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in this conspiracy theory and what it is insinuating, just pointing to the elephant in the room out there so that people from all or otherwise are aware of the &quot;subtle&quot; or perhaps not so subtle context of this post.</p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t actually believe it matters, it is just that there are more rich jewish new yorkers who are connected in big industries in the USA, maybe due to higher IQ, maybe due to other reasons (not a real evil rule the world conspiracy but in certain cities or industries if jews are overepresented they might help their own) and when you are aware of a meme you tend to find them.</p>

<p>But if I thought this, then people who are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories also would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Former military demolitions guy here.  While an implosion of the WTC is technically possible, it would have represented the tallest building to be imploded to date by far. However to think that this building could have been set up for implosion without anyone inside being aware (we are talking about thousands of man hours and thousands and thousands of pounds of explosives and det cord - the smell alone would have been pretty darn noticeable), <em>and</em> coincide with the impact of a large jetliner (which somehow did not mess with the implosion sequence) is highly improbable.  </p>

<p>And then to expect all of this to be kept secret - without being leaked with so many different kinds of people involved.... Not to mention finding a crew to pilot the plane that would be willing to not just sacrifice so many Americans, but also themselves just to sell a war that a bunch of faceless bigwigs will get rich over.....</p>

<p>But the fact you underestimate the deep state of the most powerful government on earth proves you really don&#39;t understand things that well.</p>

<p>I think you also missed the part where Bush&#39;s brother was linked to the head of security at these buildings, and there was supposedly, indeed, a blackout with the building while it was being remodeled or something. Lasted a few days with no one going in the higher parts. IDK do some research. I can&#39;t say I really care at this point. The government will always be doing things from the shadows. To pretend the strongest airforce on earth cannot retaliate against a plane randomly headed toward a skyscraper is preposterous in itself.</p>

<p>You are right.  There are a lot of things in this world I don&#39;t understand very well.... but explosives isn&#39;t one of those things.  If you are really sure that this was a covert government op and an intentional implosion that coincided with the suicidal hijacking of multiple airliners, then just explain to me the simplest part of the whole deal - the explosives.  How did they make them go off? </p>

<p>(And by the way, planned implosions  <em>never stop</em> at the highest levels.  Matter of fact, they usually start at the bottom and work their way up.  But never mind that, just explain to me how the explosives were initiated and I will say that your theory is plausible.) </p>

<p>Also I am not really sure what your point is about the model but you do realize that the way to validate a model is see if it matches up with reality. All they are doing is saying hey we made this prediction about the collapse and modeled it, and the model matched up with reality. That is evidence to support the model.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Any intact structure will resist the collapse and thus prevent free fall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t quite right on 2 counts.   First, a building like this is only design to support static loads and a limited amount of dynamic forces due to wind etc.  It&#39;s absolutely not designed to put up even a seconds worth of resistance to an entire floor collapsing on it. </p>

<p>Second, in addition to the above, the joints were already weakened by the fire.  Whatever strength was initially in the building was reduced by the time floor 13 was collapsing. </p>

<p>If you watch the video,  the first to bit collapsing appears to be the &quot;floor 13&quot; girder giving way that NIST refer to.   This collapse proceeds for a couple of seconds, mostly out of view,  before internally compromising the structure enough that the bottom gives out.   Once the lower part of facade buckled even an inch there&#39;s no way it was going to go at anything other than freefall after that.   The girders are design to support a floor and office furniture, not stop several thousand tons of moving metal and concrete. </p>
