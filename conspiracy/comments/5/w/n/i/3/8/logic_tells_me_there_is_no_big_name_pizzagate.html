    <div class="md"><p>This is the thing that has always frightened me most about Pizzagate.</p>

<p>At this point it has become a combination of Henry Miller&#39;s &quot;The Crucible&quot; and &quot;Iran Contra&quot;.</p>

<p>We know for a fact that the government maintains contracts with companies like Dyncorp, who have been caught engaging in human trafficking in the past. The government perception on what constitutes punishment for that crime does NOT align with how the public feels about the issue, but the outrage doesn&#39;t sustain itself.</p>

<p>Dyncorp is an <a href="http://www.contractormisconduct.org/">open secret.</a> There are plenty of them out there. This story enveloped it in order to gain legitimacy.</p>

<p>Trafficking through orphanages is also an open secret. Anyone who has ever done a google search on best practices for adopting a child KNOWS that there is a market for young children through second <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1">adoptions.</a></p>

<p>Pizzagate is enveloping that as well.</p>

<p>We also <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/turkey-motion-protecting-child-marriage-draws-debate-161118124734306.html">ally</a> with and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11217772">occupy</a> states who have [practices] that Western culture finds abhorrent. That&#39;s part of foreign policy decision making that most people don&#39;t want too look at. The sausage part where we mix together strategic and moral grey areas.</p>

<p>At this point, because people are willing to ignore the fact that news about ALL of these problems has been there, in the mainstream media, throughout ALL of this in order to feel morally superior to a political opponent over a witch hunt.</p>

<p>And now, a skilled propagandist can turn this outrage into justification for a political purge to make McCarthyism look tame. I am waiting for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives">&quot;Night of the long knives&quot;</a> to happen, performed by a group that will be labeled independent extremists, against people who will later be proven to have been &quot;involved&quot; in pizzagate, by virtue of their association with this story that has been constructed based on speculation about code words and a mans taste in artwork.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and do you know what people in his line of work do?</p>

<p>Answer questions. So again, the discussions on trans rights and weed aren&#39;t originating from Trump, or from Spicer. They are questions being asked in press conferences. So for you to say they are only talking about those things and not pizzagate, thus there will be no arrests, is fucking stupid.</p>
