    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the war. Men and women not needing each other. If you grow up believing that, have a daughter and she will never know how to care about men. And then these same women have sons also. So now you have women that don&#39;t need men and men that need women.</p>

<p>Guess who that gives power to?</p>

<p>This is the god damn problem, the only problem. There has been a war on gender, the only war, and it is destroying society. So get your shit straight. If you are a hard working, in shape, rich guy, then you will pass that on to your child. But mom has a say too.</p>

<p>You know the analogy of having a devil and an angel on your shoulder? That&#39;s your mom and your dad fighting over you. If you feel like you have an internal struggle going on, that&#39;s it. Your DNA is whatever you make it. You are created by your parents, so no matter where you are in life, that&#39;s what your parents wanted for you. If you are lost, broken, and looking for direction, then your parents were not on the same page. If you are a fighter, it&#39;s because your parents fought, and so on. If you are lazy guy, then it&#39;s probably because your mom thought your dad was lazy and held the belief that &quot;all men are so lazy&quot;. Now you are born to be lazy. It&#39;s obvious, just ask each parent to be 100% totally honest with you what they believed in, how they acted, what they talked about. Watch how they describe your personality to a T. </p>

<p>Now you have a blueprint to follow, and you have your parents (DNA) telling you what to do. But that&#39;s the thing, you just tune them out and find you. Or you can play them against each other, or take a side.</p>

<p>The more distorted the couple, the more distorted the kid.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t even get me started on the war on our DNA via radiation in just about everything that is made cheaply. Water supply, GMO foods, cloned meat, pharmaceutical, all their to destroy our DNA. Alter it to a state that leaves the individual in a state of weakness and easily controlled. Then those people have kids, and before you know it, everyone is the same.</p>

<p>I think what we are lied to heavily about DNA. &quot;It&#39;s in your genes&quot; sounds like a loaf of steaming shit to me.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll think more on it tonight, I ran out of brainpower. Ima figure this mess out. Time is great when you have it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tv pushing this fantasy to woman about what they think a man should be like, contrary to what comes natural. Now after a few generations of Disney princesses, all men ain&#39;t shit, because they don&#39;t act fake. And boys watch these same movies/shows and learn fake behavior. So now everyone is beyond fucking lost looking to the same people who fucked them up to fix them. Women get in relationships with guys who act like the books, tv, and female teachers taught them to, thinking &quot;wow he&#39;s perfect!&quot;, and then realize there is something wrong or missing. So they either blame the guy (men are dumb), leave, or cheat with a guy who doesn&#39;t fit the fakester profile. And these women know it, and play the lost guy for his money. So nice of those heartless bitches to do that to guys on purpose. Sellin soul HA.</p>

<p>Ha.</p>

<p>People need some weed or shrooms or something to fix this shit, and fast. That&#39;s why the Feds don&#39;t allow it, just helps you get in touch with your own thoughts. Can&#39;t have all that expensive work undone, that took decades, undone by a plant that takes 5 months to grow and 5 seconds to light up n burn.</p>

<p>Rather poignant statement there.  It seems then that collectively and as a whole we are currently still at the point of tolerating our sufferings.  This fact is exceedingly unfortunate and frustrating for that minority of us who are very near being past the point of tolerating it.</p>

<p>It seems we find ourselves at a point of transition then - just before that juncture where the citizenry finally throw the yolk of tyranny off their collective backs…but before enough of them (us) grow frustrated and suffocated enough to actually <em>do</em> something about it.</p>

<p>Hardly.  Many systems have come and gone.  Many iterations of humanity have come and gone.  Gaia is a veritable petri dish breeding ground zoo experiment for the human species.  Humanity will likely continue on for quite a long after this system is gone and done and over with.</p>

<p>So, again I wonder why the &quot;line of transition&quot; gave the other user chills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Emigrating won&#39;t solve much if anything.  The &quot;we&quot; in &quot;we&#39;re NOT ready&quot; doesn&#39;t refer or apply to &quot;Americans in the United States&quot;.  It goes for &quot;humans in general on planet Earth&quot;.</p>

<p>If we can&#39;t get our shit together here, we won&#39;t be able to get our shit together anywhere.  The forces American citizens are fighting aren&#39;t &quot;American forces&quot; or &quot;American elite&quot;.  No.  The forces are global.  There is nowhere you can go on this planet where you can run and hide and will be free from the manipulative forces living here.</p>

<p>The only way to deal with and address the problems on this planet is to face them unflinchingly and head on.</p>

<p>Ah.  I see.  Thank you for clarifying that.</p>

<p>Yeah.  That&#39;s a pretty fucked up thing, to be sure.  It to a great extent speaks of our general laziness really.  That really sucks if you think about it.</p>

<p>I would rather that we fight as a species <em>against</em> that tendency that may exist in us to sit and &quot;suffer our evils while tolerable&quot;.</p>

<p>We should in fact foster a philosophy of zero tolerance and seek to root out those things in ourselves and our society that engender maladies.</p>

<p>Easier said than done, of course - especially living in a civilization with as many pit falls and vices as this one.</p>
