    <div class="md"><p>The facts are a whole bunch of CHILDREN were killed in this raid. You could say the &quot;terrorist&quot; used them as human shields sure, there are many sick ones who do that. Yet we are ALL one. No matter what race, religion, ideology. When we harm others, it always comes full circle. The wars need to end. Many of these &quot;Al-Qaeda/Isis terrorists&quot; fight because we invaded their homelands and bombed them to shit over the past 16 years. We need to get our country out of the debt hole, and help rebuild the countries we&#39;ve destroyed. </p>

<p>Feel free to go through this mans twitter, there is endless death in Yemen thanks to the UK, Saudi&#39;s, and the US. When will people be held accountable for their actions????

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The facts are that in war people die. We did not start the war with Islamic extremists, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course we did. Wars are not only started by a direct attack or legitimate if the USA declares it so. You will be able to find much evidence that ultimately, the root cause of all of it is oil disputes. A simple history lesson will teach you that for a decade the CIA was supplying radical Islamic terrorists (Mujahideen, Taliban) with weapons and war supplies via Operation Cyclone, for no other reason than because they were fighting &#39;evil Russia&#39;. Now this was 1979-1989. Clearly, our government had no problem with radical Islamic groups back then. Why not? They were the same people with the same beliefs as they hold now. Ah, but they weren&#39;t &#39;terrorists&#39; because they were attacking evil Russia instead of us! Makes sense. Proxy war against Russia by supporting radical Islamic groups.</p>

<p>Then round about 1990 Saddam decides to invade Kuwait over OIL, and guess what...Team America World Police didn&#39;t like that one bit. So we banded together with the UN, leading the charge to impose severe sanctions on Iraq. Another proxy war against Iraq, started by us. Sanctions that did no harm to Saddam or his rich cabal, but instead resulted in the suffering of millions of Muslim civilians who depended on our aid. This right here was probably the main turning point, when the Taliban and later AlQuaeda/Bin Laden decided they wanted to use our own weapons against us. It was definitely cited by Bin Laden in his letter to America as one motive. </p>

<p>One thing is clear from even a small amount of research: They didn&#39;t attack us unprovoked or for the purpose of &#39;taking away our freedumz&#39;. It&#39;s all about oil and money at the root, nothing more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I can tell you for certain we will finish it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is that? By dropping more bombs on them and killing even more civilians for the next 20 years? There is only one way to end it, and that is to stop interfering in foreign affairs where we are not wanted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, you just support people who chant &quot;death to American&quot; in the streets.  I noticed when they do that, it&#39;s not only the 18-21 year old males.  You want to aid and support terrorists who kill women and children in this country.  You want to make people who routinely rape their own children the victims?  Knock yourself out.  I won&#39;t cry for anyone who gets killed in a country that supports terrorism against the United States of American.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In case you hadn&#39;t read what I posted, they are retaliating against us for interfering and causing the death of millions of Muslims long before 9/11 ever happened. Of course, you can make up a story and denounce me as a terrorist supporter all you want and claim i&#39;m supporting death of Americans, but the fact is, this is what Ronald Reagan had to say about the horrible Taliban who want death for Americans. Well, they probably hadn&#39;t started chanting death to Americans yet, because we hadn&#39;t killed millions of Muslims in Iraq yet. Anyway:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To watch the courageous Afghan freedom fighters <strong>(Taliban)</strong> battle modern arsenals <strong>(evil Commies)</strong> with simple hand-held weapons is an inspiration to those who love freedom. Their courage teaches us a great lesson -- that there are things in this world worth defending <strong>(radical Islam)</strong>.</p>

<p>To the Afghan people <strong>(Taliban)</strong>, I say on behalf of all Americans that we admire your heroism, your devotion to freedom, and your relentless struggle against your oppressors. </p>

<p>The Soviet people have known great suffering -- more than other people. They should be able to sympathize with the terrible suffering of the Afghan people. To the Soviet leaders, I urge you in the name of humanity to end the bloodshed so that an independent Afghanistan can again take its place in the community of nations. The West has no designs upon Afghanistan. <strong>(except providing them with weapons and later invading them and putting a US conrolled government in place)</strong> We do not threaten you there or anywhere on the globe. All we seek is the restoration of peace and freedom <strong>(by providing them with machine guns, then later starving the noble people of Iraq to death)</strong> for a noble and brave people whom we remember today. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So maybe instead of implying that <em>i&#39;m</em> trying to support terrorism, you accuse the US Government of it (because it&#39;s a fact). I never gave automatic weapons, grenades, and rocket launchers to the Taliban. We&#39;ve been interfering with Muslim countries for 40 years now. Maybe all they want is for us to leave them alone?</p>

<p>Correction over 40 years. At least 100 years: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The post-revolution government of Iran has regarded the United States and the United Kingdom as Imperialist states, who have a long history of interfering in Iran&#39;s internal affairs. <strong>In 1907, an Anglo-Russian agreement between Russia and Britain divided Iran into spheres of influence, calling into question [clarification needed], although not terminating, Iran&#39;s sovereignty.</strong> In 1953, during the Cold War, British intelligience officials[2] and the administration of the <strong>U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower planned a joint Anglo-American operation to overthrow the elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadeq</strong>.[3][4][5] The Einsenhower administration was concerned that Mossadeq&#39;s nationalist aspirations could lead to an eventual communist takeover of Iran.[6][7][8][9][10][11] The operation was code-named Operation Ajax. At first, the military coup seemed to fail, and Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi fled the country.[12][13] After widespread rioting and with help from the CIA and British intelligence services, Mossadeq was defeated and the Shah returned to power, <strong>ensuring support for Western (chiefly British) oil interests</strong> and ending the perceived threat of communist expansion. General Fazlollah Zahedi, who led the military coup, became prime minister.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;ve been protecting our rights to OIL through violence, imperialism, and intimidation for a century by bullying Muslim countries, supporting terrorists, and killing civilians. But that&#39;s ok...WOULDN&#39;T WANT GAS PRICES TO GO UP!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t think the US government,  under Bush Sr. / Bush Jr.  and Obama&#39;s administrations,  made a few enemies? Don&#39;t be so naive.  Continuous bombings of the middle east have more than likely infuriated several middle eastern nations and its citizens.<br/>
It would be wise to protect our nation from domestic and international threats. And Since &quot;terrorists&quot; can&#39;t attack Obama,  who do you think they&#39;ll go after? Just like Omar Mateen,  they&#39;ll start attacking US citizens.  </p>

Obama, the novel peace prize winner, bombed and killed more people than President Bush.  Obama did very little to end our foreign interventions overseas.  Toppled Libya, tried to topple Syria.  Trump has consistently said he wants to take out ISIS and be done with the Middle East.  He doesn&#39;t want more war and has consistently shot down rumors of wars with Russia.

<p>Exactly. Why don&#39;t you give this some thought: If &quot;might makes right&quot; was taken to it&#39;s logical conclusion, <strong>we would all blow each other off the face of the earth</strong>.  </p>

<p>You need to think about this right here. Do you want to live in a jungle surrounded by cannibalistic animals? Please don&#39;t let them convince you that&#39;s what reality is. Humans are different from the rest of the animals <em>because</em> we can rise above our basic survival instinct to kill or be killed and make a better life for ourselves and those around us.</p>

<p>Listen to my words as I truly say this from the heart, the world is what <strong>we</strong> make of it. Have you been on r/conspiracy long? The elite, NWO, whatever you want to call them, know that <strong>we the people</strong> hold the power. The only thing stopping us from marching against them and demanding peace? Complacency and a lack of unity. Can you sense that they want to divide us, to keep us bickering about what nationality gets what while they continue to hoard, create false scarcity, and make plans to keep us under control?  </p>

<p>I understand that there is a lot to fight for brother, but please, before you decide who to attack make sure you know who you&#39;re fighting for. Don&#39;t let them turn you against your fellow man.</p>

<p>The stockpile is insurance in case we needed to rapidly expand for something like a war. But look at 56B/how much we spend currently and see how much it is comparatively. You may not like the fact that we spend 12x more than other countries, but we&#39;re 12x the military of other countries. Our military superiority is undisputed. It&#39;s best that it stays that way with some key players coming to the table..</p>

<p>I saw that someone, believe it was either cnn or AP, wrote that the spending on the mil budget would include more ships and stuff with a presence emphasized in the strait of hormuz and south china sea area. </p>

<p>This shit is not looking good. We already had Trump say we&#39;re going to start winning wars so the prepping has begun. Now the question is where the false flag will be and what. Iran is coming no doubt but as to how we don&#39;t know yet.</p>

<p>Never happened. There is no wall on the southern border of Mexico and the US didn&#39;t give money to the Mexican government to build a wall. The US gave Mexico 75 million USD to train and equip Mexican border guards.</p>

<p>All of the &quot;Obama gives Mexico millions to build a wall&quot; articles cite this <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/US-Mexico-Border-Wall/2016/09/15/id/748502/">Newsmax article</a>, which only mentions an <strong>invisible</strong> wall:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amid talk of Donald Trump&#39;s plans to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico, Mexico itself has an <strong>invisible wall</strong> along its southern border with Central America as migrants head north.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They also state on what the 75 million USD will be spend:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Times claims the U.S. is sending Mexico $75 million in the form of equipment and training to help shore up its southern border.</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>He isn&#39;t a war criminal. At least not yet. Geeze.
Hillary, Obama, Bush, Cheney, for sure. Trump? May want to give it some time.</p>

<p>Yeah I don&#39;t agree with giving more money to the military, but you are not understanding the move. He is increasing military pay and making good on his promise to bring the military back up after it had some cuts. This is a smart move by Trump because he knows the establishment is trying to undermine him and there is a militant left movement to remove him. They would remove him if they could. Having the military on your side is important if you have an enemy as powerful as the deep state.</p>

<p>Yeah I am not sold on Trump either and I hate some of his recent moves, BUT we can&#39;t be certain he is one and the same with the esablishment yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a lunatic response to my post.</p>

<p>How on Earth does explaining what he is doing qualify as propaganda, specifically when I said I don&#39;t agree with it? Did you miss that? It was only the first line of the paragraph. Ironic you saying I sound like a propaganda peddler when you sound and react like a total shill.</p>

<p>Also notice you are responding to things that you have so removed from context that they aren&#39;t even shaped into a misleading statement, they are just a few words.</p>

<p>No I didn&#39;t say it was okay. You are a dumbass. I said it was a smart move.</p>

<p>Putrid policies? You should list those because you are just a hardcore lefty shill. Most people with common sense can see he is just another politician. Not good, but not the threat that the other politicians are fomenting in the left. The left are the ones being manipulated like crazy into inexplicable rabid hate. Your language shows that you are likely one of those brainwashed into being so upset with Trump that you would disown family and attack people who voted for him. Blindly label them racists, etc.</p>

<p>Hell you misunderstood my entire post so you probably aren&#39;t that hard to lead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, ever since 9/11 there has been a war on terrorism that has not ended.  We have perpetually been at war since we invaded Afghanistan.  Obama, the novel peace prize winner, bombed and killed more people than President Bush.  Obama did very little to end our foreign interventions overseas.  Toppled Libya, tried to topple Syria.  Trump has consistently said he wants to take out ISIS and be done with the Middle East.  He doesn&#39;t want more war and has consistently shot down rumors of wars with Russia.  Apparently Hillary was big on war with Russia.  Thank God she didn&#39;t win or we&#39;d really be at war. </p>
