    <div class="md"><p>Trump addressed Congress last night and talked about the nation we live in.  During his first few weeks as President he has spoken about health, justice, education, freedom, the press and religion.  I&#39;d say that all of these are quite related to the title of this submission.  Talking about these things without mentioning Trump is going to be quite a challenge.

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, your &#39;debit&#39; card also allows transactions to be processed via the CC network that&#39;s on its label (usually Visa or MC). Running the payment as a CC allows them to put a hold on your card and pull further funds as needed, which handing them literal cash would not accomplish. The fact that your card is connected to your own money in a checking or savings account rather than a line of credit extended by a bank doesn&#39;t affect the nature of the transaction in the CC system.</p>

<p>Your credit history is not involved in this transaction even if you do use a credit card.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the US government does NOT pay pensioners.  In the US everyone (except farmers) is supposed to pay 7.65 percent of their gross wages into &#39;The Social Security Fund&#39;.  Employers are supposed to match this payment.  In 1953 the Supreme Court declared that anyone making this payment has no actual entitlement to the monies they and their employers pay into this &#39;fund&#39;, except that they may, upon retirement, be allowed to receive a payment from the fund IF they have worked for a total of ten years (i.e., 40 quarters).  It is a rather modest payment, by the way, averaging about $1,200 per month if I recall correctly.  Housewives (or spouses) who haven&#39;t had at least a 10 year history of working can receive half of what their spouses receive.  My neighbor, a widow, was a nurse for 40 years and makes $2,200 a month.  That pays her mortgage, utilities, car payment and a bag of groceries each week.  Fortunately for her, she contributed 8 percent of her paycheck to a retirement account and has a bit each month from that to cover the rest of the bills.</p>

<p>Lots of people don&#39;t get any social security.  People who die before 66 pay into the fund their whole lives but get none of the money they paid into social security.  You can&#39;t live very well under social security if that is the only thing you get.  You are expected to pay your own medical bills in the US.  When you reach 65 you get a little help.  If you&#39;re expected to die within 6 months you get a free visit to a hospice.  A lot of people here are dirt poor and live like it&#39;s a third world country.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I know a guy who flew helicopters in Vietnam.  His military pension is about $2,400 a week.</p>

<p>Your retirement is not and never has been a legitimate concern of the government - and you&#39;ll find that SS, medicare, Obamacare, the income tax (nearly all taxes, actually) are <em>unambiguously</em> unconstitutional. News flash - the Constitutional is almost wholly a libertarian document, limits the power of the government and almost <em>exclusively</em> prevents the evil policies mentioned above (which are wrapped in BS &quot;feel-good&quot; well-intent.)</p>

<p>I never opted for the government to take a single dollar for my - and especially not any body fucking else&#39;s - retirement.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about Trump, btw... It&#39;s about individual freedom and individual responsibility and <em>until we embrace that as a nation</em> we will continue to flounder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are very intense, but I would like to challenge you on a few facts.</p>

<p>Where in the U.S. Constitution do you think a program like Social Security is prohibited?   </p>

<p>Why shouldn&#39;t we, the People, develop a program of wealth redistribution that helps ensure that elderly people don&#39;t suffer in poverty because they can&#39;t work?  Yes, many can save enough to make this unnecessary, but for any number of reasons, there are many who cannot save enough to retire comfortably.   I am happy to give up a small share of my income to ensure their well-being and prevent tragedy.   Most others are as well.   Consequently, the U.S. Congress passed a law and the President signed it, and now we do it, and that is how are democracy works.   Just because you yourself would rather see a different policy, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s invalid.</p>

<p>&quot;I never opted for the government..&quot;   That&#39;s not how laws work.  We decide on them collectively using the tools of democracy.  You have to abide by those laws to live here as a free person.</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I am very passionate about this... And you challenged me with questions, not facts... And I&#39;m sorry, I find it hilarious that you end your comment with &quot;to live here as a free person&quot; right after stating I should be coerced to forfeit my property for an extremely dubious cause (which... is bankrupt.)</p>

<p>The Constitution was drafted explicitly to limit the power of the Federal Government, which was <em>created by</em> the people. Everyone loves to cite Article 1 Section 8 - exclusively the phrase &quot;provide for the common defense and general Welfare&quot; - to essentially grant unlimited power to congress to pass any law just because the majority of congress voted for that law. This is <em>not</em> how it works and is exactly why we have a Constitution which lists <em>enumerated powers</em> we the people have granted unto congress. I will offer it is a poorly constructed clause, which was vehemently pointed out by Hamilton, <em>however</em> the word &quot;Welfare&quot; had a completely different meaning when the Constitution was drafted: &quot;Exemption from any unusual evil or calamity; the enjoyment of peace and prosperity, or the ordinary blessings of society and civil government (Webster’s American Dictionary of the English Language, 1828).&quot;</p>

<p>So - &quot;why shouldn&#39;t we, the People...&quot;</p>

<p>Jesus, I could write an entire dissertation on this. Number One, and by far the most important, is it infringes on my civil liberties and my own rights to <em>my own personal property.</em> It is disheartening that there are &quot;those who cannot save enough&quot; - but this is not my concern as a sovereign individual... and I&#39;ll tell you what, <em>I</em> could surely use <em>my own</em> money at the moment - so who is it more important to that the confiscated property serves? The man it was taken from and could sorely use it, or the man it was given to who did not work for it? Leftists love the word &quot;fair&quot; ... this doesn&#39;t seem very &quot;fair&quot; to me.</p>

<p>If you are happy to give up a small share of your income, then by all freaking means, do it - just don&#39;t force me to do it, also.</p>

<p>We are <em>not</em> a democracy and the government currently, and has for a while (basically since Roosevelt) operated <em>far</em> outside of its constitutional boundaries.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying &quot;that&#39;s how laws work&quot; - I&#39;m telling you the law is fucking morally corrupt and an illegitimate overreach of the Federal Govt. There are legitimate laws, and then there is govt overreach, and the latter make up nearly 99% of federal law today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good conversation!   Nobody should be downvoting you for clearly stating your ideas.   I disagree with most things you are saying but you earned my upvote!</p>

<p>A few points:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not how it works </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You specifically pointed out why that <em>is</em> how it works.   One of the enumerated powers is to provide for the general welfare.   I&#39;m not sure what kind of econ background you have, but this clause allows us to get together and pool our money to buy public goods.  Things we all want, but none of us can individually afford.   Parks, roads, fire stations, a military, etc.   These public goods make us all wealthier because they make our lives better than they cost to implement.   We <em>want</em> the ability to share out money in this way.</p>

<p>As for whether any particular expenditure is worth more than it costs, well, that&#39;s what the democratic decision-making process is there to determine.   Welfare programs are easily worth it, in my opinion (and many others).  Hence, it was put into practice.</p>

<p>&quot;it infringes on my civil liberties and my own rights to my own personal property&quot;</p>

<p>The taxes you contribute to our collective governing get you more than they cost you.   See above about roads, schools, parks, etc.  If they didn&#39;t, we wouldn&#39;t be doing them.   We don&#39;t get to individually decide what those public goods expenditures are, though.  It has to be a shared decision by definition.   Just because you don&#39;t like (or directly benefit) from some of them doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t contribute.  You benefit from roads near your house that other people helped pay for despite using far less than you, too.  You want this, you just don&#39;t realize it.  </p>

<p>(I&#39;d bet, you also don&#39;t want old people starving to death for reasons not their fault).</p>

<p>The law isn&#39;t morally corrupt.  Your understanding of  governments work is severely limited by a philosophy of self-interest promoted by wealthy people, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m libertarian but I&#39;m not fully a taxation is theft guy. I find SS useful for my needs just so long as it remains solvent. My parents depend on it. I can live with that and live with paying for public school and sewers. To me none of that falls under a reasonable definition of theft. You may disagree. </p>

<p>The <em>real</em> theft that I care about is fiat currency. In the 60s minimum wage was 1.25. We were on the gold standard back then. $1.25 in old silver quarters is now worth near $20. That&#39;s the entire problem, right there. We&#39;re being robbed. Also if money was tied to metals again we wouldn&#39;t have all this deficit spending (where you get into taxation that is clearly theft by anyone&#39;s standards), so you take care of income inequality and national debt in one swoop. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s not wrong morals it&#39;s about perspective. Western law is based on rehabilitation. The Sharia is about prevention. </p>

<p>For example food clothing and shelter are guaranteed in an Islamic State so there is no reason to commit crimes. Then there are harsh penalties on top of that for anyone thinking of committing a crime anyways.</p>

<p>Edit: Also I don&#39;t understand why non-Muslim are so fixated on the age of the Prophet&#39;s wife. Unless you are planning on marrying a 9yo don&#39;t even bring up the topic it&#39;s not a point of argument. Non-Muslims talk about this topic as if it is a major factor in their life.</p>

<p>The REAL problem here is that the corporations has become so massive that it start to blot everything else. They became the always hungry predators, and their hungers for power and profit never stop. </p>

<p>The Global Imperialist (Who you guys call the Globalist) is the biggest incarnation of this thing. It grows when the Soviets (Love them or hate them, they are an opposing force to their plan) being destroyed. And they almost having full control, if it wasnt for the internet (A tool for mass brainwashing backfiring). Now, they are shaking. And this is probably the only chance for a full revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but don&#39;t blame capitalism and free enterprise like the socialists do... The problem is we&#39;ve given the government too much power and companies use that government power to protect themselves with regulation and special favors. </p>

<p>More government control is not the answer, neither are large corporations. But the free enterprise system is an amazing thing that is the very essence of human nature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is: How to stop a free enterprise from turning into that type of corporation? This makes the socialist tries to get rid of the &quot;free enterprise&quot;, since it&#39;s not really free. Yeah you can say that anyone could do it with enough wealth, but how much is &quot;enough&quot;? The piss poor workers at that time surely dont have enough, and the capitalists at the top likely just gonna take even more money to themselves, and make sure the rest dont have enough wealth to topple them. This makes the number of the people that doesnt have &quot;enough&quot; grows. And well, we come to this problem: the 0.0001% has too much, while the rest suffers</p>

<p>Now, how to solve the problem above is a tricky one. The Socialist/Communist wants to change the core of humanity, but that&#39;s gonna take a very long time. The libertarian/anarchist wants to erase the government, but due to our nature, it will lead into 2 scenarios: full blown barbarism, or the corporationist, who just get wiped will regroup and strike back, and without anyway to unite the people, they will take back and re-establish the government again, this time, with even harsher rules and more ways to control us. So a state, a government is still needed, but it has to run by all of us, and has to have a way for all of us to check what they do. I dont have any answer for it, but maybe the internet might be the thing to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly wondering what you&#39;re referring to. I&#39;m reading a book by Hedges now and that is not the impression I get from him in anyway. He was a foreign war correspondent for decades in Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine/Gaza. All his writing is about the horrors of empire/oligarchy and how a militarized country cannabalizes itself morally and economically. He is one of the harshest critics I&#39;ve ever read on global capitalism, US foreign policy, the Democratic and Republican corporate duopoly, Israel, Wall Street, mass consumer culture, war, environmental inaction. He was on the front lines of the Occupy, is a proponent of secessionist movements, mass strikes and divestment from corporations. He even sued Obama over the NDAA. And he has been marginalized and blacked out for speaking truth to power. Dissidents on any side of the spectrum are super important in my opinion</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The food pyramid is a great example of this. It was pushed by the food industry and politician in the 70s.  It was made to sell subsidized crops, not to create better health for Americans. Doctors at the time were heavily against it stating that they didn&#39;t know what it was going to do to the health of Americans. It turned out to be a perfect recipe for type2 diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Fast forward 30-40 years and doctors are now pushing it it be &quot;healthy&quot;  Recently it changed to the food plate, which isn&#39;t much better. </p>

<p>Cut out grains, sugars, and processed oils (vegetable oil). Eat mostly vegetables, fruits, and meat. Don&#39;t be scared of saturated fats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some doctors are also paid shills by food corporations, that use them to vouch for a certain product or some &#39;miracle ingredient&#39; being healthy or worth paying more for.

There&#39;s very few regulations on this too, so consumers just put their faith in the supermarkets and that they&#39;re telling the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doctors have to prescribe it. I don&#39;t see how the statement: &quot;doctors destroy health&quot; is more or less accurate depending on the doctors internal justification for their actions.</p>

<p>My friend went to the VA mid last year because he was having violent thoughts. Got into a politics argument with somebody and got so pissed he was just waiting for the person to give him an excuse to kill him. </p>

<p>So after a single 20 minute visit, after NO physiological tests, the doctor prescribed him 9  (NINE!) different pills. For anger. Based solely on their conversation. </p>

<p>Anger he already controlled on his own. Some of those pills were just too counter the side effects of the other pills.<br/>
(He now smokes weed and doesn&#39;t take any of the pills btw.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna go ahead and say that doctor is evil. You can reserve judgement if you like. I think it&#39;s inexcusable.</p>

<p>There needs to be a recognition of modern science, to save people from the pitfalls they are sold for cheap. However if that were done, people wouldn&#39;t be duped into exposing themselves with all manner of garbage (so they can be studied after).</p>

<p>The last paragraph:</p>

<p>During the debate over the Patriot Act of 2001 then Senator Joe Biden compared this bill to its 2001 counterpart stating &quot;I drafted a terrorism bill after the Oklahoma City bombing. And the bill John Ashcroft sent up was my bill.&quot;[7]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct me if I&#39;m off mark, but I believe Jeffrey is referring to the Green Hilton Memorial Agreement.  It is hypothesized that JFK was assassinated by trying to put the federal reserve out of business by creating a new gold backed currency.  This agreement, whose authenticity i remain agnostic too, gave JFK access to a sufficient horde of gold to make this possible.  This Horde of gold, called the global collateral accounts, (whose authenticity i can neither confirm nor deny), represents a vast sum wealth derived from centuries of economic activity in Asia.
It is surmised that the CIA had knowledge of both Kennedy&#39;s intent and capability to follow through, as well as the banking cabals reptilian will to safeguard its printing press.  When push came to shove within the agency, the Nazi&#39;s (pro federal reserve representatives (because every bankers wet dream is a fascist global government [privatized gains, socialized losses])) leveraged the banking interests against the government. so that the CIA became de facto middleman between the two.  With the CIA&#39;s newfound power over the the government at the backs of the bankers, a new era of politic was ushered in.  An era championed by Cheney, Rumsfeld, Bush, Brzezinski, Clinton and Kissinger.  Their Motto? NWO, and there wasn&#39;t turning back after they killed JFK</p>
