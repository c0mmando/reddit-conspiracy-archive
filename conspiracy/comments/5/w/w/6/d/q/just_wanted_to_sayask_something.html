    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s like a puzzel that falls into place once you get the bigger picture. The number one thing you need to understand is that most people aren&#39;t ready for the truth and need to be lied to. (Like parents lie to their children) The lies stack up and support each other and noone will question them as there is no reason to do so. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>They will be public when they can&#39;t hide their lies anymore. Think NSA spying or the whole 9/11 WMD bullshit. Nobody gives a shit, the indoctrination has run so deep it&#39;s basically what you could call western &quot;culture&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that&#39;s why nothing really comes of it, but take for example, that PhD who has done finite element modelling of the WTC7 fall and has come of the conclusion that there was no way that building should have fallen under those circumstances, and that it would have to had been a controlled demolition.</p>

<p>In my mind, this information isn&#39;t heresay, it should at least warrant further investigation. But I&#39;m guessing it still won&#39;t help? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That information sort of did help in a way, as it brought additional knowledge to more people.  What happens when everyone starts feeling exactly how you feel, when they all start thinking like your post; when we all get fed up and it reaches critical mass?   You can only do so much, keep doing what you do.  The powerful only have the power to suppress info and investigation because we still allow it.  Hopefully that will change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The illusions of consensus and narrative and the realities of control keep the old lies safely tucked away (like JFK). You can scream the truth on the web, but r/conspiracy is it&#39;s own little echo chamber where some truths are accepted as &quot;known.&quot; Today, people are more receptive to truth IRL, though. Partisanship is the toughest hypnotic shackle to break, though. I think that they are going to thin our numbers before too many people get woke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the JFK thing is all but true. JFK was going to gut the CIA. We have two shooters admitted by congress. And just recently, we have exCIA admitting participation, albeit on his death bed. That&#39;s as close to the truth as you will get for that one. The CIA is not going to come out and say, &quot;okay, we shot JFK.&quot;</p>

<p>As far as 9/11 goes, again the story is all. It true. And by true, I mean the people who did it, coming out and providing paperwork and communications showing how the shit was done. </p>

<p>For me, it&#39;s the same story for pi33a but not as compelling of a story, so on and such.</p>

<p>I mean, this is to get people aware and looking. Wake people up. The more people awake, the more likely we find truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The JFK thing, along with the whole &quot;magic bullet&quot; theory, the two admitted shooters, and exCiA admitting to involvement and all this information still leaves the case unsolved? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand, maybe because I&#39;m not from the US, but basically it sounds like there are people in the know about what actually happened but will never reveal or prove the real story? </p>

<p>This sounds to me, along with JFK and 9/11, that there will never be any official reports or investigations to go public about any of these theories? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two advices: (i) never underestimate the potential of government inefficiency, it can alone explain much of the world&#39;s problems without the need of conspiracies, and (ii) don&#39;t rest satisfied with official explanations, there are examples in history that prove that conspiracies can indeed be true and only be revealed decades after. In reddit you will find people who will try hard to convince you of either position and negate completely the other one. I personally don&#39;t think things are that simple, I&#39;ve become very sceptic of almost everyone at this point, but I keep reading, digging.  </p>
