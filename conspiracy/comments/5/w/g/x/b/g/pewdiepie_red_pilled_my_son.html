    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s kinda always been like that. Felix is a great dude. PewDiePie is his persona which is just annoying to most older people.</p>

<p>The reason we never saw it during his Amnesia: The Dark Descent days is because he rarely ever dropped that persona, it was only visible through other videos (I remember watching one where he was talking about marketing and analytics), and it&#39;s only been in the past 2 years that he&#39;s started making Felix videos, and not just PewDiePie videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So pewdiepie is significantly more popular than most people on earth, not just youtube. He has a following of 53 million people where he can technically say anything. The wall street journal finds this scary, and attempted to assassinate his character by skimming through hundreds of his videos and taking &quot;nazi jokes&quot; completely out of context. MSM believes they were successful as pewdiepie had lost an upcoming contract for some type of show with disney. But instead, his subscriber count only grew, and made people like me who were originally indifferent to pewdiepie, rally behind protecting free speech. While simultaneously discrediting mainstream jorunalism.</p>

<p>No he lost an existing contract with Maker (or polaris i forget) and that company is owned by Disney. They went to Disney and from there the executive order passed down for the contract to be cancelled or something of the like. </p>

<p>Are you somehow suggesting that Disney doesn&#39;t have to right to exercise a termination clause likely in PewDiePie&#39;s contract? Do you really think Disney should not retain the right to curate their brand and tailor it to their markets? </p>

<p>Do you have any understanding of the legal systems of the United States of America?</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve been white knighting about Disney refusing to buy a product? You do realize that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing right? In what way do you think you have been &quot;protecting free speech&quot; by trying to make Disney continue to pay PewDiePie.</p>

<p>Disney likes $$$. Not surprising, I do to. Disney has to continue to service it&#39;s loyal worldwide customer base. They had a contracted employee publically make a joke about jews. If the needle moves forecasted Net Income, they may want to course correct. That&#39;s all they did. And PDD is not even close to .01% of their revenue. Easiest business decision they&#39;ve ever made</p>

<p>Wait wait wait.... Seriously? Are you saying it&#39;s bad because it&#39;s meant to give negative reaction? How were you hurt by this personally? So essentially, you&#39;re angry with the MSM because they hurt your feelings and/or made you feel invalidated.</p>

<p>I had to reply again since I honestly just can&#39;t believe this paragraph. I totally get what you&#39;re saying but if the constitution already protects you from freedom of speech... why are do you need the validation from the public who may or may not agree with you.</p>

<p>Your argument boils down to:</p>

<p>You are mad other private entities exercising the right to freedom of speech because you think it&#39;s wrong and without evidence have no legal or ethical ground to stand on. You&#39;re pissing into the wind and proud of it. It&#39;s honestly sad</p>

<p>See, that goes back to your first comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have any understanding of the legal systems of the United States of America?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The constitution only protects us from government censorship of speech. But people have all matter of legal ways to limit somebody&#39;s speech, some acceptable (to me), some not.</p>

<p>I know that if nobody could ever get any platform to let them say shit that isn&#39;t &quot;approved&quot;, then free speech is de facto dead, but I also know that if everybody could say whatever they want on prime time national tv, that would be insanely disruptive and perfectly unfeasible.</p>

<p>There is a balancing act involved, and in my (and a hell of a lot of other people&#39;s) opinion, disney is on the wrong side of that balancing act. Most buy the excuse used, that it was a business decision, but I don&#39;t. It was a business decision, but that&#39;s not an excuse. Disney is still in my view on the wrong side of the balancing act and there should be some sort of negative consequences for that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not one to fall victim to the fallacy that everything has to be full on or full off, I&#39;m not going to full on boycott them, because this isn&#39;t nearly bad enough to warrant that, and because I don&#39;t even consume much of their content. however, in my head, I&#39;m going to remember this, and if I&#39;m ever given a choice to buy something they make money off of vs an alternative version that they don&#39;t make money off of, I take this into account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I give you that that is where r/theredpill got it&#39;s name.

    <div class="md"><p>to me redpill has nothing to do with <a href="/r/trp">/r/trp</a> just like christianity has nothing to do with westboro baptist church.  A square is a rectangle but a rectangle isn&#39;t a square.</p>

<p>the red pill is an ideological difference.  most specifically it is when a liberal ideology turns into a more conservative ideology due to a life experience.</p>

<p>if somebody was against having a gun but then was a victim of a violent crime and decides to purchase a gun and take gun classes, they have been red pilled.</p>

<p>just because people use the term for the past few years to describe a dating ideology that is not about being a &quot;nice guy&quot; and is more about the DENNIS system still fits the definition.  They don&#39;t get to co-op the terminology.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Redpilling someone is essentially about revealing that they were unwittingly indoctrinated in the first place though.  Redpilling is about offering the counter argument to the corrupted official narrative.  It&#39;s all about critical thinking.  You will not find more substantive debate and free exchange of ideas than you will among a group of people that have fundamentally become skeptics.  Yes, there is a prevailing counter narrative that develops, but it&#39;s basically a byproduct of the mainstream narrative.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I know, and it&#39;s been unfortunately taken by the male rights activists too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a joke on &quot;not trusting the mainstream news&quot; which lately has become a&quot;fake news&quot; vs what our president says argument. Mainstream news skills always be taken with a grain of salt, but collectively is still more trustworthy than a single person or internet sight or anything else prone typically point to.</p>

<p>Also you mentioned its your local news?  I find most local news more trustworthy than big news outlets, but for local stuff off course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this PewDiePie had some stupid joke on his video, and then a Jewish reporter for the WSJ went to his sponsors and tried to get them to dump him by making up some absurd like that he was a &quot;neo-nazi&quot; and an &quot;anti-semite.&quot;</p>

<p>All over what was obviously a joke.</p>

<p>We have a long tradition of Jewish comedians in the country - some of the funniest people around, Larry David, Seinfeld, many more too numerous to mention. We also have black comedians like Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy and Dave Chappelle that trade in extremely edgy racial humor.</p>

<p>But as far as I know Jewish reporters don&#39;t go around trying to get them fired for making jokes about White people, Christians, Black people, Asian people, Latinos, LGBT, anyone.</p>

<p>Are Jews off limits to comedians now?</p>

<p>No one had a problem with Eddie Murphy&#39;s &quot;Kill the White People&quot; gimmick for SNL. In fact, &quot;Kill the White People&quot; was an actual pop punk song for a Jewish left wing band back in the 1980s.</p>

<p>PewDiePie isn&#39;t even political as far as I know.</p>

<p>Some people need to learn to take a fucking joke.</p>

Its purposely put there so you can come to conclusion you&#39;ve come to, to make you feel like you&#39;re smarter than other people.  Lots of groups have been using this tactic since JFK. Its like the Moloch worship, a lovely way to breed cognitive dissonance into inquiring minds.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homie you&#39;re talking about a group of pranksters so involved with all of these movements they affected them in every way.  I mean KWT wrote a book about Oswald before Oswald was even out of the military.  Shape shifting reptilians?  RAW.  HAArp, bluebeam?  RAW-taking influence from P.K.Dick ;), You think there aren&#39;t and weren&#39;t co-intel operations in response to the information/satire war that came to a head in the late 60&#39;s?  You&#39;re crazy and you&#39;re still living in that war.  You think the US hasn&#39;t used this sort of information to subvert and create populism and extremism in a non-satirical way since the CIA was formed?  You think Russia hasn&#39;t done the same?  You think the ottomans didn&#39;t have a rich tradition of informational warfare? This goes allllll the way back to the French Revolution holmes, you gotta take a look at the history.    </p>

<p>So about pewdepie.</p>

<p>Do you think the whole massive antisemitic scandal was nothing , no agenda being pushed, no political involvement ,no deliberate propaganda?</p>

<p>Just a few jews in the press that got their knickers in a twist and cost pewdipie millions of dollars?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its worth noting that KWT became a victim as was driven insane by co-intel pro used to discredit him from within his inner circle of subversives.  He gets lumped into the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; which seems completely logical given the full story of his involvement with the early conspiracy/prankster groups he got along with.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Idle-Warriors-Kerry-W-Thornley/dp/0962653403">https://www.amazon.com/Idle-Warriors-Kerry-W-Thornley/dp/0962653403</a><br/>
Wooooo you&#39;re asking for directly non or falsifiable information and I dont usually speak in absolutes so this a hard bargain.  At any given time, any given amount of agenda is being pushed by any number of groups in any possible direction or flow of information.  I think millions of dollars is a stretch, many more important people than him have been marginalized for a multitude of reasons. In this case I don&#39;t think you&#39;re completely wrong, I should clear that up, however I DO think you&#39;re pushing only part of the picture.  At its deepest level of the information war was Pewdepie marginalized by the JDL?  Sure theres a good possibility of that, even benign jokes have destroyed larger careers, however its not like the JDL is a unknown quantity, their movements are fairly public as an advocacy group, none of that is conspiratorial really just social engineering. I do think the Netanyahu thing is a bit of a coincidence, Netanyahu has made his stance with Trump fairly clear and also Cui bono, but its not necessarily a stretch to say its a concerted effort possibly.  You&#39;ll see more of this from prankster groups as they shift focus as well as the true believers of the left as more people catch on.  Say what you will but there are people on Trumps administration that are connected to the right side of the true believers/propagandists when it comes to information warfare and honestly I think thats why most of the main zeitgeist will bite on the Trump as an anti-Semite narrative.  There&#39;s always even different agendas when it comes to the different avenues of information/engineering/propaganda within the SUBJECT of anti or pro Semitic stances alone, that is right and left leaning.  The answer is, Im not exactly sure of the absolute T truth in this situation (to use some philosophy) BUT those those are definitely two of the major narratives being pushed.   </p>

<p>I think this to &#39;accept who you are&#39; movement is childish. Everyone could use some self improvement. Be proud of your actions. What you&#39;ve done. No one should get an advantage or disadvantage simply because of how they&#39;re born. Accomplish something. That&#39;s real pride. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see why Disney dropped him. They are getting more kid friendly over the years, so I can see that. </p>

<p>I guess the problem here may be that the Wall Street journal insinuates he is an anti-semite. Though, It doesn&#39;t look like anything they wrote is technically wrong. The manipulation I guess is the subtle narrative being built around the jokes.</p>

<p>As someone who doesn&#39;t give a shit either way. Don&#39;t know who PewDiePie is. I watched some of his videos defending himself, the guy fucked himself with these jokes if he is getting paid by Disney.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anybody was technically wrong in this situation. The argument for wallstreet journal is a continuous background narrative of anti-Semitism behind satire. The argument for PewDiePie is edgy satire and comedy is his life blood. The argument for Disney is that it doesn&#39;t belong in their media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is &quot;are jokes that are taken out of context and are anti-Semitic, still anti-Semitic in context?&quot; As well as &quot;is pewdiepie anti-Semitic for making these jokes?&quot; That&#39;s up to you to decide. I think there is a grain of truth in <em>some</em> jokes. Some jokes are just jokes. I like offensive humor because I see it as making fun of harmful stereotypes. But that&#39;s me. Then the deb ate goes into whether we as a society should joke about certain things and it devolved from there. </p>

<p>The truth is this one guy saw an opportunity for sensationalist yellow journalism and took it. The editor saw it and thought &quot;hey, this might generate a lot of views.&quot; I&#39;m willing to bet that&#39;s how other organizations saw it. I&#39;m just as willing to bet more than one editor choose the writer specifically because they can (knowingly or that&#39;s just how they are) farm that outrage for page views. IMHO that&#39;s why it&#39;s important when sharing outrage clickbate like this that people use an archive to deny the host those views in order to encourage better quality. </p>

<p>I think if I were Disney I would have done the same thing. Joke or not I wouldn&#39;t want a family brand to be associated with blue comics or edgy acts. The edgiest id want to be is the marvel and Star Wars stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The jokes were not directed at jews, the anti-semitic quotes were used because they are so universally denounced and were used in such a way that the jokes only worked if everyone, including the comedian, accepted that such positions are not something normal people would hold of their own volition. Had he picked a PETA quote it wouldn&#39;t have landed since it is not universally accepted that eating meat is unethical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PewDiePie isn&#39;t a comedian. He might think he is, but he doesn&#39;t know how to write a joke. (Surely he is rich enough to hire a writer if he&#39;s serious about this.) Lots of comedians make jokes about Jews and other minorities and get away with it, because they know how to write a joke. South Park is a good examples of this, or people like Sacha Baron Cohen, the WSJ isn&#39;t running &quot;hit pieces&quot; on them, as shocking as they can be. Good jokes have structure, they have subtext, they make a point. There is no joke here, no point, just a rich white guy paying two poor, non-native speakers to spread a hateful message they probably didn&#39;t even fully understand (pretty sure one of them was quoted saying exactly that).</p>

<p>Try imagining someone doing this &quot;joke&quot; on you, hiring you to hold up a sign saying &quot;death to jews&quot; in a language you don&#39;t understand. Funny! It&#39;s not all that different to having a Chinese takeout menu tattooed on you by an unscrupulous tattoo artist. You <em>are</em> the joke. The only point he actually made is that you can pay people to do anything, which is not only not very funny but not remotely an original observation.</p>

<p>The other problem is anti-semitism is not in fact universally denounced. I&#39;m not sure why you think it is when this very website is home to a lot of them; you&#39;ve been here years, you know the worst Reddit has to offer. A lot of &quot;normal&quot; people hold anti-semitic views. Many of them are spending time lately <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/26/us/jewish-cemetery-vandalism-philadelphia/">vandalizing Jewish graves</a>, while others are just working for the President of the United States. No big deal, not like there are anti-semites literally at the highest level in the country, empowering previously lowkey anti-semites to go out and desecrate graves. Alt-right is all over this guy, precisely because of his part in normalizing this kind of crap. If alt-right people are applauding you, you&#39;re either a giant bigot or you fucked up somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disney also has the added problem of having been founded by a notorious anti-semite. Anything with even a whiff of anti-semitism is something they, as a brand, need to distance themselves from, even if said whiff is an illusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this issue is that when a comedian makes 7-ish jokes in  thousands of hours of video in which he&#39;s making a couple jokes a minute, it&#39;s dishonest to make this out to be some sort of pattern, particularly when one of which is in a video titled &quot;Stop putting nazi imagery in my videogame&quot; or something along those lines.</p>

<p>Ben Fritz, the journalist who wrote the WSJ article has, himself, made more anti-semitic (and anti-black) jokes on his own twitter feed than Felix Kjellberg--whose actual job is making jokes--has on his channel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, just trying to form my own opinion here. I figured WSJ was being manipulative considering the video has the ominous music and the short cuts of his videos.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not surprised that there would be a report on the top YouTube star when something significant happens, but it seems a lot of people are angry that WSJ caused it. YouTube is one part of the internet that I doing really participate in</p>

<p>Did Disney drop him before or after the report? I&#39;m confused on this part, I couldn&#39;t find clarity on if WSJ reported it or just reporting on it. Did the journalist go witch-hunting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Kjellberg, pressure by the WSJ was put on several of his sponsors (not just disney) prior to even being contacted about the article (including pressure against Youtube to demonetize his channel, which would take his annual compensation from 8 figures to 0). Sort of a &quot;Nice house you got there, be a real shame if something happened to it&quot; deal. The sponsors and business partners contacting him was how he says he even found out an article was being written.</p>

<p>As far as &quot;why&quot; they did this, that&#39;s not really clear. It&#39;s been hypothesized that this was an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1ulkykn7jc">attack by the WSJ</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC5LyaCdpEI&amp;amp;t=5s">on youtube itself</a> (as a media outlet that&#39;s nominally outside the control of normal media influence--and a growing one--sinking the #1 star is a good way for old media to let new media know it can put them in their place whenever it feels like it) or that a journalist was just looking for a scalp in the interests of self-promotion, <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2015/07/23/sexist-scientist-tim-hunt-the-real-story">as has happened in the past</a>.</p>

Republicans are still standing around waiting to see if they&#39;ll impeach Trump and fully take over the government or if they should just pretend to like him because populism is on the rise and they&#39;re too out of touch to know what people actually want.</p>

<p>The Democrats are hoping they can just do what the Republicans do and be obstinant children for his entire term and then be rewarded by voters for it. They will do the same exact thing as the Republicans did, whine about what the president is doing, promise to reverse all of it, but when they eventually get into power again they&#39;re either not going to do shit or not have any real, practical plans for replacing the things they&#39;re repealing.</p>

<p>I wonder if that is true or if it was Trump which really made you/us think that.</p>

<p>We had already had our Trump in Italy (much of Trump&#39;s political campaign was copy-pasted from him), and people who voted for him were saying the same exact thing (better him than the poor opposition).</p>

<p>Or maybe he just choose the perfect moment. It is rather interesting the same exact sentences are being made tohugh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in political purgatory. I can&#39;t find any happen medium. Especially after the massive censoring going on on the Donald. If you research most of the information or news story they post, it is outdated. Some sources are months old and they try to play it off like it is current. Additionally, Trump&#39;s position on Marijuana is perplexing. I was also a little disappointed with him backing out of the correspondents dinner. Historically they are giant roasts of our presidents and politicians, but I think is withdrawal only perpetuates the massive divide in our political system. So it is a combination of many factors. On the other hand I have no sympathy for the libs. I think they are just as bad in many respects; especially with the media.</p>

<p>Also yes there are plenty of people who blindly support politicians, on every side in every country.  It&#39;s just the way people are, it shouldn&#39;t detract you from the candidate themselves.  The KKK came out in support of Hillary, does that mean you shouldn&#39;t vote for her?  No.  There are plenty of good reasons to oppose her but that isn&#39;t one.

Even if you never actually go after marijuana producers, just by saying that you will you are hurting their business.  People will be much less willing to invest money if it might get confiscated by the feds at any point.  Just like saying you will veto any bill about (insert good thing here) can be a bad thing even if you never actually veto any of them, because the thread will prevent those bills from being passed to begin with.

<p>The otherside however have gone from being reliable to just as bad, which is now causing this backlash because whilst everyone in the middle realised it was coming from the right, are now having to understand that it&#39;s coming from the left as well.</p>

<p>The left however are less used to this, and have adopted the incredibly poor tactic of, if you don&#39;t agree with everything we say, you&#39;re against us and we hate you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem pewdie ran into was that Disney decided they didn&#39;t want him. It&#39;s just a fact of life that large companies like that tend to shy away from controversial things\figures. Is it ironic due to Walt hating jews? sure thing, but walt is dead and now it&#39;s all about making the share holders money. was it their right to cut ties with him? sure. Did he cross the lines of good taste? some might be inclined to say that. Others feel he did nothing wrong. At the end of the day it is what it is and that&#39;s life. </p>

<p>from what I&#39;ve followed of pizzagate on voat\4chan\8chan is that people thought podesta looked like a pedophile and when the wiki leaks doc came along someone decided that the emails about comet were double speak code and that there was obviously something going on despite  the lack of a witness or victims. The only thing at this point in my mind is there is a whole bunch of conjecture the smells of a witch hunt to me where people are making up the facts to fit a story they&#39;ve already decided was true. </p>

<p>Yea... I dunno how people even come to some of the conclusions they reach. It is like they don&#39;t understand that weird people go around doing weird art-type stuff. I know the people who run a couple of the instagrams theyve used as &quot;Proof&quot;. The minute I saw that and saw how they just went searching to confirm what  they believed was clear</p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly certain that pizzagate also started on 4chan. Which means it is almost certainly a troll. Do you remember like eon8 and stuff like that? The internet has gotten people good before. </p>

<p>I agree with you on pewdiepie. I doubt they felt &quot;threatened&quot; by him, as people say. Disney cannot be tied in with Walts beliefs anyway, cause like you said, he is dead. Then there is the fact that Disney&#39;s entire image is being wholesome and whatnot. That is their thing for the most part. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>for me pizzagate really went absurd when they connected a pizza joint in brooklyn that hillary visited or did a fund raiser at or maybe commented on how she liked their pizza. on their instagram there was some art stuff that included pentagrams and what not as well as pictures of kids.... eating pizza. In their minds this was proof enough that it was part of a bigger network. I however live in brooklyn and there is something they missed out on, a lot of the folks working at pizza joints tend to be metal kids\hipsters in bands. Metal kids tend to use pentagrams in their band art work because it&#39;s &quot;METAL&quot; I pointed out to them the pizza place across the street from me who also had similar art work and kinda trolled them saying that I found another one with virtually the same types of things in their Instagram. I was immediately shot down because there was no connection to Hillary or Podesta and was told I needed to follow the money. because podesta looks &quot;weird&quot; thus must be a pedophile thus lets make the facts fit that narrative. </p>

<p>For them this was proof, 
<a href="https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/13628152_544154115768868_701736393_n.jpg">https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/13628152_544154115768868_701736393_n.jpg</a></p>

<p>and this was proof.

<p>I&#39;m not sure how much of this an 11-year-old could understand, but it seems like he at least put effort into looking at multiple sources. I think that&#39;s definitely praise-worthy, considering his age. It&#39;s a mature thing to do. Obviously, he won&#39;t have the same insight into the situation that you and I have. I&#39;m sure we both have experience discerning fact from fiction and opinion, and under that lens this post may not seem great, but everyone has to start critically thinking <em>sometime</em>. It looks like he&#39;s heading in the right direction, and he&#39;s probably not there yet, but I think this post is hardly &quot;indoctrination.&quot;</p>

If in this situation everyone was on the opposite side. The right attacking a left figure. Would you now be so willing to defend this is this rightist figure was spouting to thousands of impressionable children how all right based media is propaganda and are lies to push their motive. How would that make you feel? Would you still feel that this child came to his own logical conclusion of a highly controversial topic which he does not understand ( I wonder how many 11 year olds understand the political climate in America, and the history of anti Semitic behaviour).

<p>They are all generally compatible. JIDF and hasbara are the same thing, CTR and ShareBlue are the same thing (actually funded by the same people, ShareBlue is just CTR post-Clinton campaign) and Soros is basically the grandfather of &quot;progressive astroturf.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me add a little more context here. When the PewDiePie news broke, I asked my son what&#39;s up withe PewDiePie drama, knowing that he was a fan. He went on to tell me that it was a joke taken out of context. I told him to do some research before forming his own opinion on the matter. And then I completely forgot about the conversation and never brought it up again. This morning he came at me with the stuff I wrote above. Apparently he did do some research and the most important thing he took from it was that if MSM lied or blew something like this out of proportion, what else do they lie about. He&#39;s a smart, logical kid. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s also important to point out that I am like an anomaly in the conspiracy theorist &quot;demographic&quot;. Middle aged, college educated, White, lesbian. The fact that I am woke also speaks volumes for our times. </p>

<p>Maybe you should teach him that the &quot;MSM&quot; isn&#39;t a single entity, but a catch all term for many many many news outlets. The vast majority of those news outlets didn&#39;t even report on this stupid PewdiePie drama.</p>

<p>Maybe you should teach him that just because CNN is bad at reporting on things, that doesn&#39;t mean that NPR is bad at reporting things. Just for instance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While that piece covers some valid points, they also try to make it seem that IF those companies really do own that much of the media (they kind of ended up saying, &quot;so, these guys might ACTUALLY own all of the major television news media outlets that people watch and listen to without hesitation, but look, rush Limbaugh and NPR aren&#39;t under those guys!&quot;) there is no real problem because they compare the situation to market domination parallels in beer, commercial airplanes, and cars.

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the MSM is operating at a complete loss at the moment.  They are losing viewership and ratings just to constantly push the outright lies to us.  &quot;They don&#39;t usually lie to us&quot;?

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason I&#39;m still subbed is because I genuinely fear this growing group of people who are so anti-establishment (which I agree with very much to a certain extent), yet who are also vehemently against progressive ideals. While this post is ridiculous, I have a 15 year old brother who spends a lot of time on youtube/reddit who has very much been repeating a lot of alt-right rhetoric. Our parents are immigrants, I&#39;m queer, my other brother is an artist and he&#39;s been verbalizing some really intense political ideology that sort of goes against all of us adult members of the family. I find it interesting. I think the pendulum has certainly swung in a more liberal direction in the past few years, but not even to make actual change and certainly enough to make more conservative and/or alt-righters afraid, and I&#39;m nervous it will swing back the other way even stronger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really is scary. I know im going to be called an alarmist, but this is exactly the kind of propoganda Hitler jumped on to aid his rise of fascism. </p>

<p>They&#39;re capturing the vague feelings of resentment and distrust toward the &#39;powers that be&#39;, and they&#39;re putting faces on those targets. The people are smart enough to sense something is wrong, but they&#39;re not smart enough to figure out what. This is why it&#39;s so easy for them to fall into the dangerous trap of hate if there&#39;s a movement that can direct their fear for them. This is literally what Hitlers rise to power was built on, and I seriously believe we&#39;re starting to see similiar things happen.</p>

r/EnoughTrumpSpam, r/TinyhandsInc, r/Fat_Donald, r/BadDonald, r/DonaldTrumpSucks.</p>

<p>Considering it in that respect, keeping up with the narrative is an important tool to be able to navigate the social sphere and how people might think.  It lets you formulate conversational redpills and arguments, research approaches that you can take to back up your claims, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I look at it like this. I don&#39;t trust everything the media says. I trust them to inform of what&#39;s going on but not to inform me of what conclusions i should reach or believe. If there was a school shooting that happened then i would turn to the news to get an idea of what happened. After that, i take to the Internet to research exactly how it happened and what the news got wrong. But honestly, it seems i get all my news from the web now or from word of mouth since i don&#39;t use FB or any other social media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But in all seriousness, I think the underlying issues is that Pewdiepie was a casual kid-friendly (for the most part) YouTuber. Now, he sort of red pilled himself to try to fit in with Filthy Frank, Idubbbz, H3H3 etc. So, to sort of stop the red-pilling I suggest you just filter what he watches? Or possibly let him know that what they are saying is all satire and that you should not take it seriously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His opinion isn&#39;t monumental, but he is regarded as probably the most popular YouTuber. His target audience is basically gamers, but I believe the majority of his viewers are under 18. </p>

<p>He recently started to make videos that are more &quot;honest&quot; with himself, and wanted to use his influence to combat racism. The media ran with it but takes tiny clips or pictures with no context from these videos to make him seem anti-semitic. I think even the NYT is running with these false accusations.  </p>

<p>Part of the reason it&#39;s getting a lot of traction as well is because he had a deal in the works to have a TV show with Disney, and Disney had to pull out of the deal because of the anti-Semitic claims whether they were true or not. </p>

<p>&quot;You shouldn&#39;t trust &#39;the media&#39; (as if that&#39;s a single entity without widely varying opinions, agendas, and methodologies) but you should totally trust some millionaire gaming YouTuber&#39;s political opinions.&quot;</p>

<p>There is a difference between a youtuber like pewdiepie and media. </p>

<p>You dont go to pewdiepie for news, so you dont have to trust him. </p>

Look at all the young people myself included who go/went to college and amass crippling debt for an increasingly small chance of a payoff, because their parents and teachers said so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was really young, my father and I stopped along side of the road as a tractor trailer was burning on the highway. We watched from the over pass as it burned for a half hour. We could see the whole thing. It was a lone auto involved in the accident and no one was injured. We know this because we spoke to a few police officers who were just hanging around. That night we get home and pop on the news. Sure enough, they run the story. Only in this &quot;story&quot; a few cars were involved (even though they showed footage of the ONE truck burning) and people were hurt. I was quite confused so I changed to a different news channel and waited for their &quot;story&quot;. Same truck burning, only this time no other cars were involved but the driver was dead. I was 7 years old. I have never fully trusted anything the news has told me since then. That shit opened my eyes WIDE. They lied to sensationalize a very boring story. For no real reason other than to keep people watching. Fuck the news. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between not trusting main stream media and not watching it entirely. If you isolate where you get your news from (watching MSNBC instead of Fox News and vice versa) then you&#39;re simply trusting a different organization with the same goal of sensationalizing what you hear to keep you watching. IIrc PewDiePie made a video talking about how the MSM has lied, and chances are if your son says that he doesn&#39;t trust the media, it&#39;s because he watched that video and trusts PewDiePie. However, this is just my take based on this post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read the excellent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2015-steve-bannon/">Bloomberg</a> article from 2015, you&#39;ll see the range in his tactics.  He plants articles in top publications that are designed to push core narratives that are presented in a concentrated manner on his site.  This is a &quot;don&#39;t trust the MSM&quot; narrative aimed at ruling up the Gen Z audience to prep for 2020.  WSJ editors are very receptive to GOP side of the aisle, and that is Bannon&#39;s aisle now.  All it takes is one friendly journalist there, who can easily sell it to the more traditional leadership because it&#39;s a story of a new media failure.  </p>

<p>I of course have no proof of this, however, if I were &quot;America&#39;s most dangerous political operative&quot;, I would have absolutely planted that story, with the intention of turning PewDiePie&#39;s massive Gen Z audience against the media early.  Maybe he&#39;s not that good though.</p>

<p>They are completely aware of everything on youtube. The know about Pie and the &quot;fake news&quot; against him, as they say it.</p>

<p>They get outraged as dumb advertising policies regarding youtube and follow all those hot political topics regarding free speech around their favorite youtube stars.</p>

<p>Today I am standing in line at the grocery store with him after picking him up from school. So he see the tabloids and other magazines and instantly says &quot;tonight, find out about JfKs unborn baby with Marilyn Monroe, was he cheating on Jackie, poor poor Jackie, tonight on Fake News Live Broadcast&quot; </p>

<p>I just said &quot;wow dude, pretty good improve man&quot; then he points so a half naked woman and asks &quot;how do parents explain this to their kids?&quot;, to which I replied &quot;there is nothing wrong with the human body, its a beautiful thing, don&#39;t be to immature&quot;, I mean, he is 10 and still thinks kissing is gross, which it is. </p>

<p>Anyway, I knew more then adults thought when I was 10 and I didnt have the internet. These guys growing up, for better or worst have access to so much more eye opening examples about how the world is functioning. </p>

<p>Are you somehow suggesting that Disney doesn&#39;t have to right to exercise a termination clause likely in PewDiePie&#39;s contract? Do you really think Disney should not retain the right to curate their brand and tailor it to their markets? </p>

<p>Do you have any understanding of the legal systems of the United States of America?</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve been white knighting about Disney refusing to buy a product? You do realize that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing right? In what way do you think you have been &quot;protecting free speech&quot; by trying to make Disney continue to pay PewDiePie.</p>

<p>You people are a joke and this sub is a joke. I never thought <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would fall so far to forget what freedom of speech does. </p>

<p>I totally get what you&#39;re saying but if the constitution already protects you from freedom of speech</p>

<p>See, that goes back to your first comment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The constitution only protects us from government censorship of speech. But people have all matter of legal ways to limit somebody&#39;s speech, some acceptable (to me), some not.</p>

<p>I know that if nobody could ever get any platform to let them say shit that isn&#39;t &quot;approved&quot;, then free speech is de facto dead, but I also know that if everybody could say whatever they want on prime time national tv, that would be insanely disruptive and perfectly unfeasible.</p>

<p>There is a balancing act involved, and in my (and a hell of a lot of other people&#39;s) opinion, disney is on the wrong side of that balancing act. Most buy the excuse used, that it was a business decision, but I don&#39;t. It was a business decision, but that&#39;s not an excuse. Disney is still in my view on the wrong side of the balancing act and there should be some sort of negative consequences for that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not one to fall victim to the fallacy that everything has to be full on or full off, I&#39;m not going to full on boycott them, because this isn&#39;t nearly bad enough to warrant that, and because I don&#39;t even consume much of their content. however, in my head, I&#39;m going to remember this, and if I&#39;m ever given a choice to buy something they make money off of vs an alternative version that they don&#39;t make money off of, I take this into account.</p>

<p>Yea... I dunno how people even come to some of the conclusions they reach. It is like they don&#39;t understand that weird people go around doing weird art-type stuff. I know the people who run a couple of the instagrams theyve used as &quot;Proof&quot;. The minute I saw that and saw how they just went searching to confirm what  they believed was clear</p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly certain that pizzagate also started on 4chan. Which means it is almost certainly a troll. Do you remember like eon8 and stuff like that? The internet has gotten people good before. </p>

<p>I agree with you on pewdiepie. I doubt they felt &quot;threatened&quot; by him, as people say. Disney cannot be tied in with Walts beliefs anyway, cause like you said, he is dead. Then there is the fact that Disney&#39;s entire image is being wholesome and whatnot. That is their thing for the most part. </p>
