    <div class="md"><p>That has been the case so far, but nobody can honestly predict what will happen this time. It&#39;s hard to avoid falling into the trap of cynicism after getting burned so many times. But, the truth is that the future is always determined by actions taken in the present.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t shake the feeling that something is genuinely different this time. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean better or worse. However, there is something inspiring about hearing the POTUS publicly talk about rampant dishonesty in the media and so many other common sense topics which were practically taboo in previous administrations.  </p>

<p>I think Trump may actually know what he is doing. Strategically placed controversy one after another has the establishment media constantly on their toes to avoid falling in traps, which they sometimes do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>4-5... Trump isn&#39;t as atypical as people want to believe in our corptocracy he is helping the corporations and banks gain more power... He is a stooge not a revolutionary... Also not an anti-christ just a loud orange businessmen helping businesses (that honestly don&#39;t need help ex. ExxonMobil)... Leaning to 5 because everything is fucked but that&#39;s not do to Trump he is a Puppet in a long line of puppets... I love all of this though because the chaos of kek is so apparent! I use to love debating and political discourse and now I&#39;m in the background with popcorn ROFL... It&#39;s gonna be a great few years.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is trying to create an incentive as well as using the threat of financial retaliation or punitive taxation to try and reverse the flow of business and investment out of the country and back into it, instead. </p>

<p>He needs a carrot and a stick to get that and the real economy, (the everyday one of ordinary people confidently making and spending their money), back into motion. </p>

<p>What exists at the moment is an economy that only exists on paper and that is fuelled strictly by financial manipulation that enhances bottom lines and generates profits primarily by acquisitions followed by plant closures and down-sizing for huge write-offs that are sucking the life out of that real everyday economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok since you asked , In my honest opinion and keep in mind I am an older male and have seen damn near everything and been through damn near everything one could imagine from the good to bad . I honestly don&#39;t think Trump or any other president has had a direct effect on my life. Taxes always go up , the economy always hfluctuates, USA has been at war for  222 years of its 239 years in existence ,and the elites have always had control. Now I am not the smartest man on the planet and I do NOT support Trump ,but I do know the political landscape and problems do not stem from Trumps short time in office and to blame him for all the problems our nation faces would be very irresponsible , the &quot;division&quot; we face as a nation now is all fabricated by a group of people who are really really upset they didn&#39;t get their way and once people realize they are being played by the highest bidder well then maybe they wouldn&#39;t cry anti christ and whatever else they are claiming </p>

I never care about politics, few years ago you could have put a gun to my head and asked me to name the secretary of education and I wouldn&#39;t have been able to, much less know wtf they were doing.

<li> This election cycle has pulled in so many new people into the political spectrum.  With massive amounts of red pills being handed out, I don&#39;t think our government will be able to run the way it has.  The main thing that has worried me about Trump is the rich bankers in his cabinet.  I am hoping that was done so he would have expert advise when abolishing the federal reserve and setting up a different system.  I do not see him as a money and power hungry individual.<br/></li>

<p>The real magic with Media Matters has been infiltration of the comment sections. Generally speaking, real people determine the upvoted content due to sheer numbers, but only a small fraction of voters contribute to the discussion. This is where the propaganda gold can be found. Most people are not yet wise to the possibility that thousands of fake astroturf accounts are participating on Reddit and Facebook as though they are regular folks. If they could inject paid shills into your conversations at the grocery store, they would do it in a heartbeat. </p>

<p>This election, albeit on a larger scale, reminds me of Jesse Ventura being successfully elected Gov. of MN. Everyone was raging, except those of us who voted for him.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t vote for Trump, I voted 3rd party, but I&#39;m getting the same sense of satisfaction seeing the DNC scurry around like headless chickens.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also less sure of anything to date.</p>

<p>Trump has no agenda, politcally. He&#39;s just not excited about political ideas. This makes him vulnerable to influence from other people&#39;s agendas. That&#39;s the complete opposite of Ventura. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read what I wrote man. I have no evidence and neither does anyone else. But would you be surprised that power hungry people with no conscience rise to power and must satisfy their urge to dominate and control others? I think that&#39;s definitely the type of person that works that hard to get that type of power. This need for power and control might lead more decadent elites to buy and abuse children. In some countries, its legal to purchase children and adults. That&#39;s all we need to know to fight this.</p>

<p>Look at the motivations of these people, not the &#39;he said she said&#39; noise flying around, trying to pin down an exact date and time or someone&#39;s travel itinerary compared to Bill Clinton&#39;s. It&#39;s all distraction and noise because you&#39;ll never &quot;prove&quot; these people did it. But the fact that, in some countries elites are legally allowed to purchase children or anyone is appalling. We don&#39;t need specifics to fight that. We could support lawyers who fight child abuse. We could crowdsource a legal fund to defend victims. All of this can be done without a shred of specific &quot;evidence&quot;. Besides the evidence people come up with here isn&#39;t compelling. What&#39;s compelling is the legal loopholes and the obvious conspiracy to silence victims and hide abusers. </p>

<p>He has already completed more campaign promises in his first month than any president (in my life) has in their entire term. I mean seriously Obama was the worst, campaign one thing and DO NONE OF IT. Well, I guess he did implement a health Care act. (What a disaster that is)</p>

<p>My small business alone paid $200000 last year for his &quot;HEALTH TAX&quot;, my employees were forced to pay monthly payments, but wait, no health care providers cover his fucking programs any where in our area. NOT A SINGLE ONE!! Let&#39;s just say, even all the Obama supporters that work for me got pretty pissed off. </p>

<p>Oh and all 50+ legal immigrants that work in my companies. Are stoked Trump is kicking out illegals. Their families have spent decades getting nationalized, busting their asses. And we are just gonna give ILLEGALS rights and welfare, that these people earned. Hell no!</p>

<p>God bless you President Trump. Keep pissing off the snowflakes (heaven forbid the globalists get the world war they want, with these pussies crying all the time), fuck the legacy media, fuck globalism, and build that god damn wall! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which campaign promises? The TPP? Most illegals coming into America work in industries Americans don&#39;t won&#39;t to work in, for wages most Americans refuse to accept, agriculture being the largest employer of illegals. In the past, after massive ICE sweeps in lots of different states, many farmers couldn&#39;t find the help they needed to bring in the crops, and nearly collapsed. With regard to how much money you were paying for health care.</p>

<p>Small businesses should be exempt, but large multi-nationals should be so heavily taxed that it limits their growth in a manner that prevents them from becoming world eaters. Imho, this should be the main purpose of taxes- to prevent the private sector from acquiring more power than the government.Obviously, the exact opposite has happened in this country. Shit is ass backwards. Small businesses are treated like big businesses while the biggest and most powerful companies are treated like young startups without a dime to their name. </p>

There are already signs that he&#39;s too heavily influenced both by the media and those around him. He passes off other people&#39;s ideas as his own sure, but I think he can be &#39;fed&#39; these ideas too readily which causes him to make mistakes. </p>

Things are fucked, Trump is indeed doing bad shit (like a 1 would agree with) but then again he&#39;s just doing the exact same as every other president. Only this time it&#39;s out in the open, which leads me onto my next point of Trump being the beginning of the revolution (as a 10 would agree with). The guy at the top of the thread said it well, Trump isn&#39;t exactly leading the revolution a la Sanders/Che Guevara, but he&#39;s acted as the catalyst. His antics out in the open has forced more people to politically educate themselves and despite how the revolution has <em>only just</em> begun, at least now it <em>has</em>. </p>

<p>Trump might not be a good president, he may be a puppet, and he may be beholden to terrible interests out of his control. The office of president is fucked.</p>

<p>However, I get a lot of comfort out of seeing how much the media and social media are terrified of him. That makes me think he&#39;s actually working against them, possibly in our favour. Which could be really good. He hijacked the GOP and beat those goons at their own game, which also fills me with a lot of hope.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s offset by how effective the brainwashing seems to be though. Most people I talk to (Canada/Southern Ontario) seems to think Trump is a genocidal Hitler-ish figure and doesn&#39;t seem open to any other possibilities. </p>

<p>I remain blindly optimistic, but it&#39;s hard.</p>

<li>Could be either or.</li>

<p>Trump could be a puppet and we&#39;re all getting worked hard or really is just doing his own thing and using his fame as his advantage. At the very least he is pissing off the mainstay cabal and that alone is worth his run. I don&#39;t really care at the end of the day, I look at very few presidents in positive light. I say this being an non-American. </p>

<p>My views are probably similar to those die hard patriots of the south though, so I completely understand why they like Trump. </p>

<li> I voted for him, but I&#39;m not Republican or conservative.  While I think he&#39;s an outsider to the tptb, he still has a bunch of weird creepy shit going on and I have no doubt he&#39;s just part of some other group that wants power.  If you believe Pizzagate is real, it&#39;s hard to look past his 666 foot tower, his greek pagan/mystery religion art and idols in his penthouse, his numerous creepy pedo references and pictures regarding his daughter, or his son-in-laws ownership of the 666 building in New York.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think he was a better choice than Hillary for sure, but I don&#39;t give him a pass on anything, even moreso after this recent insinuation of an upcoming marijuana crackdown from the White House.  I just try to read articles from both camps to stay level as to wtf is even going on anymore.</p>

<p>Trump is a flawed character but he is also a very smart tactician and courageous (otherwise he wouldn&#39;t have taken on  the establishment in the first place). </p>

<p>No doubt there are powers that wish to control him and are perhaps largely succeeding. BUT....a bull in a china shop may end up knocking over a few things that really needed knocking over - and the alternatives range between downright evil or too weak to muster a real challenge to the prevailing war-based orthodoxy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2</p>

<p>Trump is a narcissist and effectively a sociopath. He doesn&#39;t have any real beliefs (he offered the VP slot to Kasich, then Pence, with his son promising to put Kasich in charge of &quot;foreign and domestic policy&quot;). When picking a Supreme Court candidate, his aides emphasized their personal backgrounds and how great each choice would make him look, because he didn&#39;t really care how they would rule.</p>

<p>He&#39;s been pro-abortion when it was convenient (New York socialite) and anti-abortion when it was convenient (GOP primary). He is perfectly comfortable making promises that he cannot or will not keep (&quot;best LGBT president ever,&quot; marijuana is a states&#39; rights issue, everyone will get healthcare, I will negotiate drug prices).</p>

<p>Ultimately, he just cares about personal enrichment, and doesn&#39;t really care what happens to other people. He&#39;s effectively a sociopath (as in he knows what is &quot;right&quot; -- his tweet &quot;Ivanka always pushes me to do the right thing&quot;) but he usually doesn&#39;t listen to that voice. Instead he cons people, fucks over small contractors that do work for him, and dehumanizes others. </p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s hard to hate him. I mean, he&#39;s an awful person who should not have power, but this is pathological. It&#39;s not like he wants to fuck over people. He ran for President in order to negotiate a better deal for The Apprentice, for chrissakes. He spouts off from the id, saying simple beliefs regurgitated from Fox News or other media. It&#39;s his enablers who I really despise--the ones that know better but avert their eyes because he gives them power.</p>

<p>I said this day 1 when I started supporting Trump for presidency. Trump will not bring change at the government level but I hypothesized that Trump win would result in revolt by the people. Saw some decent protests but now Antifa is out in full force and more people are realizing that Trump is not the answer (neither is any Democratic candidate).</p>

<p>Hopefully within this year we will see a huge revolt against Trump but also against the current system.</p>

<p>I voted for Trump but I&#39;m very concerned now.  I do believe we will see a major revolution in the public but are also witnessing one going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always known Trump was part of a Secret Society and that society was in direct battle with the Secret Society that has been in control of the US since JFK (Globalists)</p>

<p>What I didnt anticipate was Trump being a Zionist and that is why im questioning my support.</p>

<p>I know the old power structure was corrupt and was pretty sure the new one would be corrupt as well I was just hopinh theyd be less corrupt.  The problem I have now is I&#39;m unsure who is more dangerous. The Globalist or the Zionists.</p>

<p>One thing I was confident of and has partially come true and something im happy about is Trump either directly or indirectly would expose many things as it pertains to our country.  Media, Deep State, Racism, global power structures etc.  Have all started to be exposed and for that I&#39;m happy he was elected.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that Trump is less evil than the forces that are against him, but he&#39;s putting some evil things (back) in motion, too.</p>

<p>It does almost feel like some sort of prophesy is being played out, and that it needed to be him to set it in motion.  What he&#39;s already done is nothing short of astonishing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the MSM recovers, and this might (should) ultimately lead to the formation of a true third party in the US.</p>

<p>Or a total police state.</p>

Clinton would have been no different. Except now the &quot;right&quot; get to pretend things are going to be alright for the next few years as we slip further away from what America really is/meant to be.

<p>I think Trump is exposing a lot and playing a martyr. Bernie was the good cop. Trump is the bad cop. Similar ends, polar opposite means. </p>

<p>He is playing all the nasty cards to force the country to deal with the mess it made and wrote into law since we lost our collective shit since 9/11. </p>

<p>His cabinet is packed full of corrupt fuckwads, and I don&#39;t know if it is to expose them and then crucify them or he&#39;s just letting it all out in hopes of recoil and the country pulling it&#39;s collective head out of its ass. </p>

<p>Two things that justify Trump&#39;s existence -- 
Stopped TPP and moved away from WW3 w Russia. </p>

<p>What we had high hopes for --
Pedogate justice, 
draining the swamp/ taking $ out of politics, 
making things better for 99%, including minorities 
These are fair to dismal. </p>

<p>What we feared and have not been disappointed--
Environmentally catastrophic choices
Banking/WallStreet free for all corruption
More 1%  welfare while raising taxes on poor
Corporate porkfests all around- Pharma, Oil...
ACA repeal
Immigration atrocities 
Stupid wall instead of immigration</p>

<p>Unforseen, but can&#39;t be surprised--
Defense porkfest above normal pork levels
Increased military in ME (we know it&#39;s CIA =ISIS, duh!)
Increased surveillance and abuse of 1st Amendment 
Cutting safety net programs </p>

<p>It&#39;s really bad, the only good is the NWO may have been derailed, but Trump is not without tremendous cost. And frankly, some of his handiwork will serve NWO if they manage to reorganize. </p>

<p>Not AntiChrist, that guy will be more suave-- like Obama. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that the power of prophecy lay in people&#39;s ability to make them appear to come true.</p>

<p>A common feature to a lot of mythological beings is that they somehow &#39;glow&#39; or &#39;shine&#39; or possess some variation like a halo. This is, of course, transferring the qualities of the star onto a personage that represents said star, like Lucifer, but many people have tried to find some other explanation. One attempt I can (sort of) remember from the nineties had to do with the ingestion of colloidal silver and/or gold by a relatively advanced mountain tribe (living on high, in heaven) who became known as the Fallen Angels due to the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=argyria+pictures&amp;amp;t=ffsb&amp;amp;iar=images&amp;amp;iax=1&amp;amp;ia=images">discolouration of their skin.</a> Another explanation is that these people with a &quot;glow&quot; were actually very sunburnt. Whatever the origin, the Shining Ones trope regularly shows up in modern conspiracy circles as the Illuminati (quick mention to Hollywood <em>stars</em> who are <em>celebrated</em> for their work on the light-reflecting screen). I find it odd that a community that is so quick to find importance in the smallest of details, that so often talks about hidden symbols, has failed to recognise the objective fact that Donald Trump glows bright fucking orange. At the very least, I expected someone to link Trump to <em>El Dorado</em> but nope, not even a mention of the golden king in his glittering city of legend.</p>

<p>I think this goes unmentioned for several reasons with the main one being that it&#39;s seen as just plain petty to point out how stupid he looks (which begs the question of why nobody has pointed it out to him and why it&#39;s okay to nitpick every little flaw in other candidates). More importantly, people have been largely compartmetalised, often agains their will, so that there are now fundamentalist atheists who reject <em>everything</em> to do with religion as fantasy to the same degree that their theist counterparts reject secularism. The problem here is that it doesn&#39;t matter if you do or do not believe in a deity, the majority of people across the world absolutely do. People who believe in the unerring truth of the Bible also believe that it&#39;s prophecies will one day come true. They believe that if they do not behave in a certain way then a very real, very powerful, and very invisible god will punish them for all eternity. They also believe that Jesus is due back any minute for the Second Coming (got news for ya, believers have been expecting the Second Coming any day now for over a thousand years) and that they will be rewarded with a place in Heaven when he gets here. </p>

<p>Atheists are not the target demographic. They&#39;re not interested. They&#39;ve been conditioned not to be interested. The believers, on the other hand, have been promised that Jesus will come and save them before destroying all their enemies in the fires of Armageddon... but that&#39;s just not going to happen until the Antichrist shows his diabolical face. The Antichrist is not Satan incarnate, he is the False Messiah that the &#39;real&#39; Saviour must defeat before all the faithful are taken bodily to Heaven and the non-believers are punished by God&#39;s wrath. </p>

<p>Trump is the shiny Antichrist, that could very well cause a chain of events that sees Jerusalem burn before Pence steps in and bravely brings order to a chaotic White House and imposes Christian Paradise on America. To the athiest this is nonsense undeserving of attention but to believers it is one of the promises of their faith. People talk about Project Blue Beam but don&#39;t seem to pay heed to the idea that prophecies can be made to come true without the need for holograms... but why go for holograms when you can make prophecy come true by turning the Middle East into a sea of fire?</p>

Trump is not the antichrist he is just another puppet.</p>

<p>Someone like Jared Kushner would more likely be your antichrist, Ivanka Trump husband and senior advisor to trump. He purchased 666 5th Ave building for 1.8 billion in Manhattan in 2007 and moved his head office there. Also their son looks exactly like that kid in the Denver airport mural, it&#39;s creepy.</p>
