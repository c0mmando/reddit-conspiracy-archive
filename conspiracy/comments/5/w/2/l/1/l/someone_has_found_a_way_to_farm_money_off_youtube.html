       Can someone explain to how this video is one of the most popular videos on Youtube? CHALLENGE: You can't use the following argument or anything that even sounds close to it.

       It literally feels like someone has managed to gather a child sweatshop version for Youtube, but this time they've got all their bases covered. There's is no SITE, at all, that can discredit them without the same argument popping up. It is insane how genius these people are, but maybe it's just harmless. It extends into so many accounts, but the theme always revolves around videos children would watch SPECIFICALLY. It's like they already knew they would make videos that could be SPECIFICALLY defended using irrational behavior from children.

       Of course, even with 1 million parents looped the video 1000 times a day, it would not add up anything close to video numbers. That's not how Youtube works, or else [everyone] would be able to acquire an insane amount of views on any video.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that I've heard this argument perfectly copy-pasted across so many sites is what baffles me. Since when did every person have the same anecdote?

       Yes, and according to Quora, Reddit, Youtube, random blogs, everyone posts the EXACT same story. All these Internet people have said the same thing, but I'm the outlier here for whatever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are their parents who do this? Yes! Of course, but the amount of numbers suggest this is a heavy trend that is across multiple cultures and regions for absolutely no reason. Since when was looping a Youtube video the only way to be a "lazy parent"?

       Without using the argument from what I'd guess is the h3h3 sub, I'd have to say that the inflated view count could be related to its distribution rights... it might reach a wider audience because of it's Russian origins... maybe it is allowed worldwide where other professional entertainment is region blocked.

       I'm pretty sure the video exceeds the amount of people who can read/understand Russian on this planet. There's a specific reason why every top video on Youtube is generally a music video.

       In Russia the State only allows this video as approved entertainment for comrades under 5. This forces parents to play the video over and over for their children as there is nothing else. Putin himself owns the rights and gets a royalty for every click. Please like and share this so we can stop Putin from continuing these actions

       For anyone who isn't part of this and slightly cares, there's no hope with this conspiracy. Whoever is doing this is way too widespread, I just hope the money is used for luxury items and not something nefarious.

       I just took a look. Cute show. Good animation, and even with the language barrier, I still found it a bit funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       But your frustration in the view count made me more interested. The h3h3 comment was probably just a nice tongue-in-cheek comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I went to the good ol' ruskie Wikipedia to check out this children's show.
       <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B0_%D0%B8_%D0%9C%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%8C">
        https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Маша_и_Медведь
       </a>
       (thank goodness for google translate).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections "Distribution, Popularity and Ratings, Owners and Income and Awards" may help explain the massive amounts of views those videos have. Unlike many other publishers, X-Media and QuizGroup seem to have released this extremely popular Russian animation for free, and even put it on pirate media sites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eastern Europe, Russian speaking countries, have approx 300m in population. Then, take into account that this show is also popular in Italy, Indonesia, United Kingdom, Germany, Malaysia, Australia and apparently the United States. Then throw in the fact that they made this show available on YouTube in 2013, and the amount of views they're receiving isn't too hard to imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some good information here about the publisher's success found from a wiki footnote as well:

       Yes, and according to Quora, Reddit, Youtube, random blogs, everyone posts the EXACT same story. All these Internet people have said the same thing, but I'm the outlier here for whatever reason.
      </p>

       Are their parents who do this? Yes! Of course, but the amount of numbers suggest this is a heavy trend that is across multiple cultures and regions for absolutely no reason. Since when was looping a Youtube video the only way to be a "lazy parent"?
