        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So this flat earth thing came up a couple years ago and I could tell from the get go it wasn&#39;t organic and that it wasn&#39;t a true movement because it&#39;s extremely quick popularity was artificial. I watched a few videos and entertained the thought of it being true, but in the end it was it&#39;s prevalence online at the time that made me not believe it. </p>

<p>Later on but still in that time frame some celebrities (mostly hip hop artists) started mentioning it and I thought either they got duped as well or this is a bigger operation than I thought.</p>

<p>Fast forward to now and here it is again attempting to pick up speed. What is this guys? Is it a distraction? Is it a hardcore cointelpro to discredit free thinkers. It&#39;s scary when a fake idea like this can get so much traction so fast in the mainstream.</p>

<p>Edit: I just want to say that I do believe there is something weird about Nasa images and the shape of the earth. I&#39;m not here to kill any ideas and some aspects of flat earth might have truth, but personally I can tell that the way it got out there so quick and got into the mainstream is too suspicious to believe it wholesale.</p>

<p>Keep an open mind, but not so much that your brains fall out</p>

<p>There are people who will jump on board just about any conspiracy theory if it&#39;s presented the right way.</p>

<p>Confirmation bias is a curious thing, if someone presents a fascinating alternative theory on a subject most people consider mundane common knowledge, those without both feet firmly planted in reality (or at least one) may be swept away by said theory and support it without researching it objectively.</p>

<p>It is possible the flat earth theory was planted, or at least pushed by certain organizations with the intent of distracting and undermining communities like this sub-reddit. It does seem to flare up from time to time, like a bad case of herpes, around the same time big stories are breaking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am very good at debunking FEers if you will allow me to try.</p>

<p>Stars prove earth is round.  People in the UK look in the sky and only see North Star and other northern stars.  People in Australia can&#39;t see those stars, they see Southern Cross and other nearby south stars.  Time lapse photography of those stars show rotation of the earth around a point near our axis</p>

<p>NO flat earth scenario explains the star placement and time lapse arching.</p>

<p>No, I think flat earth is a psyop invented by whoever came before Egypt and we just broke out of <em>that</em> mental prison a few centuries ago. </p>

1) The earth looks flat.  A lot of people simply can&#39;t think big enough to comprehend the idea that it might not be how it looks.  Hence denial of evidence
2) ZOMG CONSPIRAZIEZ!!!  Seriously, the type of material is no different to any conspiracy theory.  Completely ignore stacks and stacks of evidence, because you should &#39;question what you&#39;re told&#39;, yet they swallow without question random youtube videos and blogs.  Just love the idea of a conspiracy, so following this process they go into denial of evidence (and also abandon critical thinking).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any &quot;free-thinker&quot; keeps an open mind about such things and does a little research on all the suppressed history and information to see if there actually are any legitimate claims that effectively counter and call the globe theory into question as well as more closely examining the implications of the globe theory itself insofar as how reasonable or logical it actually is. </p>

<p>A &quot;free-thinker&quot; also isn&#39;t obliged to believe either proposition or rule out the possibility that the real truth may very well be something else altogether and that the argument being presented as an either/or situation isn&#39;t as cut and dried as either side is willing to admit especially when they take the approach that if any of their opponents claims can be proven to be false then their theory must be true by default.</p>

<p>We are never taught anything about the actual history of the debate surrounding this issue just as we are never taught about the history of the debate over Newton&#39;s model or how many brilliant thinkers of his own day, many of which were as smart or smarter than Newton, that totally disagreed with it and gave some extraordinarily good arguments about why they did.</p>

<p>As for being discredited, any &quot;free-thinker&quot; doesn&#39;t give a damn about what anyone else thinks, what matters is what they themselves think about anything and being able to follow any particular idea wherever it happens to lead them in their own mind free from any of the barriers that the limited and restricted thinking of others seeks to impose on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I&#39;ll admit it - I&#39;m an ex-flat earther. </p>

<p>For about a month I was looking into this theory, and trying to prove it wrong or right. The flat earth people raise some very interesting points. There is a complete lack of counter arguments, which is why the theory has taken hold.</p>

<p>AND IT DOESN&#39;T HELP WHEN OTHER CONSPIRACY GUYS SHUT YOU DOWN LIKE YOU ARE NUTS JUST FOR BRINGING IT UP. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I just didn&#39;t buy the sunset argument, and once I realized sunsets can only happen the way they do if we are living on a sphere, the whole theory fell apart. </p>

<p>If any flat earth people want to pm me or respond to this to ask about what I think of all the flat earth arguments, please feel free. I&#39;m not going to be a douche about it, but I&#39;ll happily explain why none of your arguments hold any water. </p>

<p>They now are saying that the earth is pear shaped. That the Earth apparently has a considerable pot belly. When did this happen? Because all images shot from space, of earth previously been perfectly round? </p>

<p>People have taken cameras, attached them to hot air balloons and from these, we can see where the sun isshining a spotlight on the earth. This should not happen, unless the sun is much closer and smaller than we were taught.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that flat Earth and Moon Landing Hoax videos on YouTube are being connected. Alot of the older Moon Landing Hoax videos that mentioned nothing about flat Earth have been re-uploaded and conflated.</p>

<p>The evidence we didn&#39;t go to the moon is mounting and gaining traction. Also in the last few years NASA admitted all of the original video and telemetry data from Apollo was lost. Some kids &quot;stole&quot; moon rocks from Johnson Space Center, Ron Howard recently did a big &quot;restoration&quot; of the Moon video (they had to clean it up for today&#39;s higher resolution displays.), the fact that they can&#39;t even pass through the Van Allen belt with Orion. (interesting choice for the name of the new ship) It&#39;s becoming pretty obvious we didn&#39;t go. </p>

<p>So along comes this flat earth bullshit to make moon hoaxers look nuts. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same with Antarctica stories. Flat Earther&#39;s have muddied the waters there as well and I frequently see those on YouTube together. </p>
