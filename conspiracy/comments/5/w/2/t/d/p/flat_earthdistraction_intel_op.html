       So this flat earth thing came up a couple years ago and I could tell from the get go it wasn't organic and that it wasn't a true movement because it's extremely quick popularity was artificial. I watched a few videos and entertained the thought of it being true, but in the end it was it's prevalence online at the time that made me not believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later on but still in that time frame some celebrities (mostly hip hop artists) started mentioning it and I thought either they got duped as well or this is a bigger operation than I thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward to now and here it is again attempting to pick up speed. What is this guys? Is it a distraction? Is it a hardcore cointelpro to discredit free thinkers. It's scary when a fake idea like this can get so much traction so fast in the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I just want to say that I do believe there is something weird about Nasa images and the shape of the earth. I'm not here to kill any ideas and some aspects of flat earth might have truth, but personally I can tell that the way it got out there so quick and got into the mainstream is too suspicious to believe it wholesale.

       I don't know whether Flat Earth is somehow a government psy op, but I can see the potential of it being used to keep people away from the idea of a concave earth.

       No problem. Any time you have a conspiracy there are usually three sides.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         You have the 'official story'
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Then you have the limited hangout/controlled opposition
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         And then you have the third and final idea, which is usually disliked by both truthers and non-truthers alike.

       I recall this quote quite often, which has been attributed to a handful of people over the years (this version in particular towards Carl Sagan):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Keep an open mind, but not so much that your brains fall out
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There are people who will jump on board just about any conspiracy theory if it's presented the right way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Confirmation bias is a curious thing, if someone presents a fascinating alternative theory on a subject most people consider mundane common knowledge, those without both feet firmly planted in reality (or at least one) may be swept away by said theory and support it without researching it objectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible the flat earth theory was planted, or at least pushed by certain organizations with the intent of distracting and undermining communities like this sub-reddit. It does seem to flare up from time to time, like a bad case of herpes, around the same time big stories are breaking.

       FE is not a distraction, it's truth.  How about instead of asking the shill night crew, wouldn't your time have more value if you were actually researching FE right now instead?  I'm not telling you that so you waste time.  I'm telling that for the love of your soul.  If you are seriously wanting to learn, then I'll reply with the best videos on the subject.

       Sve za Srbstvo, Srbstvo ni za sta! Prava Srbska istorija!4 months ago
+reversecourse MARTIAL LAW, GUN CONTROLL, FEMA CAMPS, TRUMPS FAKE ASSASSINATION , WW3 AND OBAMAS 3RD term. IS COMING! All of these shootings are fake, so the ELITE can bring in NWO and Martial Law and other stuff that i metioned! Very soon guys! Wake up!  Trump will win the elections, but he will fake his death 11/26/2016, this will bring World War 3. 11/26/2016 = war starts. 5/23/2017 = nuclear exchange! 7/2/2017= conclusion of the war!
      </p>
      <p>
       all of your President are freemasons and they all work for ELITE = Zionists! who made Illuminati in 1776! Elections are rigged, and our votes never counted. Presidents are selected, not elected ! "POWER TO THE PEOPLE" Nwo goal: achieved.....﻿

       I'm not sure I understand you.  So, you have joined the dots and realize FE or this isn't a topic I should jump on?   FE is the biggest of them all, cause once everyone gets FE the entire yarn ball of deception will break apart and fall onto the flat floor below.

       Tell you what, since you are a regular here along with a couple others in this thread.  Let's have a discussion about proof, I'll present oh, say 200ish points proving the Earth is flat, and you can do the same for your ball, it will take me just a sec to get you those proofs, oh, wait, someone already made a video on it, here ya go:

       I am very good at debunking FEers if you will allow me to try.

       Stars prove earth is round.  People in the UK look in the sky and only see North Star and other northern stars.  People in Australia can't see those stars, they see Southern Cross and other nearby south stars.  Time lapse photography of those stars show rotation of the earth around a point near our axis
      </p>
      <p>
       NO flat earth scenario explains the star placement and time lapse arching.

       No, time lapse shows the stars rotating around us, just like the sun and moon, and since we are on the topic of stars, how is it that Polaris never move with us spinning at xx,xxx mph? It's always in the same place.  Explain that.

       I think it's there to distract us. There is probably some kind of civilization beneath us (Hollow Earth) that's involved.There's probably another one around our solar system that would enjoy the idea of the human beings believing that we live in a fenced location, whether it's never leaving Earth (our current situation in the mainstream) or believing in a flat plane created by our "ancestors".

       No, I think flat earth is a psyop invented by whoever came before Egypt and we just broke out of
       <em>

       I think it's two things:-
       <br/>
       1) The earth looks flat.  A lot of people simply can't think big enough to comprehend the idea that it might not be how it looks.  Hence denial of evidence
2) ZOMG CONSPIRAZIEZ!!!  Seriously, the type of material is no different to any conspiracy theory.  Completely ignore stacks and stacks of evidence, because you should 'question what you're told', yet they swallow without question random youtube videos and blogs.  Just love the idea of a conspiracy, so following this process they go into denial of evidence (and also abandon critical thinking).

       weird thing about it is, when someone grabs onto it - they are very strong to hold it and will not listen to news against it.  Maybe those are shills I've dealt with but I get the impression that the people were real.

       The flat earth argument was popular in the 70's. It is to practice debating a losing argument with little to no proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       In debate club in high school I won the pro debate on "is Santa real?" using a similar argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is really nuts about this latest incarnation is there seems to be skews of people who actually believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And man are they dumb. They run the gamut of bad arguing skills. Ad hominem attacks to red herrings and straw man fallacies.

       Any "free-thinker" keeps an open mind about such things and does a little research on all the suppressed history and information to see if there actually are any legitimate claims that effectively counter and call the globe theory into question as well as more closely examining the implications of the globe theory itself insofar as how reasonable or logical it actually is.
      </p>
      <p>
       A "free-thinker" also isn't obliged to believe either proposition or rule out the possibility that the real truth may very well be something else altogether and that the argument being presented as an either/or situation isn't as cut and dried as either side is willing to admit especially when they take the approach that if any of their opponents claims can be proven to be false then their theory must be true by default.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are never taught anything about the actual history of the debate surrounding this issue just as we are never taught about the history of the debate over Newton's model or how many brilliant thinkers of his own day, many of which were as smart or smarter than Newton, that totally disagreed with it and gave some extraordinarily good arguments about why they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for being discredited, any "free-thinker" doesn't give a damn about what anyone else thinks, what matters is what they themselves think about anything and being able to follow any particular idea wherever it happens to lead them in their own mind free from any of the barriers that the limited and restricted thinking of others seeks to impose on that.

       Okay, I'll admit it - I'm an ex-flat earther.
      </p>
      <p>
       For about a month I was looking into this theory, and trying to prove it wrong or right. The flat earth people raise some very interesting points. There is a complete lack of counter arguments, which is why the theory has taken hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND IT DOESN'T HELP WHEN OTHER CONSPIRACY GUYS SHUT YOU DOWN LIKE YOU ARE NUTS JUST FOR BRINGING IT UP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, I just didn't buy the sunset argument, and once I realized sunsets can only happen the way they do if we are living on a sphere, the whole theory fell apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any flat earth people want to pm me or respond to this to ask about what I think of all the flat earth arguments, please feel free. I'm not going to be a douche about it, but I'll happily explain why none of your arguments hold any water.

       Listen, I don't know anything for sure except that many of NASA's images of earth have dramatically changed over the years, suggesting deception/photoshopping.
      </p>
      <p>
       They now are saying that the earth is pear shaped. That the Earth apparently has a considerable pot belly. When did this happen? Because all images shot from space, of earth previously been perfectly round?
      </p>
      <p>
       People have taken cameras, attached them to hot air balloons and from these, we can see where the sun isshining a spotlight on the earth. This should not happen, unless the sun is much closer and smaller than we were taught.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno, there's tons of evidence out there, if you can accept that space agencies like NASA that is filled with Freemasons and satanists might be getting a kick out of lying to us.

       I'm not sure. I doesn't seem organic, but then the question is who are all the flat earthers? I've never met one in person that I know, and it's not even a funny idea to take on.

       I have a friend who is a flat earther. He is the type of person who wants to believe in the most outlandish stuff. It pretty much all he goes on about now. The psy op was a huge success in my opinion, I saw first had what it can do to a layman critical thinker. It pretty much a giant waste of time, you can get tons of Adsense revenue for the vids though. It's a snowball effect

       I've noticed that flat Earth and Moon Landing Hoax videos on YouTube are being connected. Alot of the older Moon Landing Hoax videos that mentioned nothing about flat Earth have been re-uploaded and conflated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence we didn't go to the moon is mounting and gaining traction. Also in the last few years NASA admitted all of the original video and telemetry data from Apollo was lost. Some kids "stole" moon rocks from Johnson Space Center, Ron Howard recently did a big "restoration" of the Moon video (they had to clean it up for today's higher resolution displays.), the fact that they can't even pass through the Van Allen belt with Orion. (interesting choice for the name of the new ship) It's becoming pretty obvious we didn't go.
      </p>
      <p>
       So along comes this flat earth bullshit to make moon hoaxers look nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same with Antarctica stories. Flat Earther's have muddied the waters there as well and I frequently see those on YouTube together.
