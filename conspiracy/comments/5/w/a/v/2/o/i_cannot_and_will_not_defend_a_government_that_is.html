    <div class="md"><p>Are you aware that a lot of the same neoconservative foreign policy apparatus dating back to at least the GWB administration remained in place under Obama and <a href="http://fpif.org/hillary-clinton-neocons/">also strongly preferred Hillary over Trump?</a>  Who are the most vocal conservative critics of Trump?  The hawkish neoconservative faction.</p>

<p>The fact that neoconservative hawks oppose Trump so strongly is enough for a lot of people to give him a chance.  It suggests that the people who support perpetual war and ever-increasing foreign/domestic surveillance are no longer in the driver&#39;s seat, and for many people that outweighs Trump&#39;s highly publicized flaws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would a stateless society be missing as to cause others to view it as weak? And you are associating technological advancement with government (consenting hierarchies, like paying workers an agreed upon wage for an agreed upon task, are fine) by saying a stateless society would be easier to conquer, which insinuates a lack of defense technology. Advancement of defensive technology falls under technological advancement.</p>

<p>There would be no nuclear codes because there would be no one person with that power. Unless people think it&#39;s a great idea and decide to fund somebody in a position to make that decision, which they wouldn&#39;t. If somebody was given that power, that would cause others to want it and would end up fueling the desire of others to gain that power. It&#39;d be another terrific example of how regulation can do the exact opposite of what it&#39;s intentions are. Hence the decision to be stateless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the only historical example of what you&#39;re advocating. Other revolutions like the one you advocate just ended up making things worse than they were before (USSR). </p>

<p>A stateless society, in my opinion, is impossible regardless. There are too many low IQ and conditioned people who would not know what to do or how to act without someone in authority telling them what to do, and too many high IQ people who would immediately see the overturning of the previous order as a way to manipulate the masses and seize power and wealth for themselves. This might be a symptom of hierarchal structure, but those people are not going to simply disappear once the old authorities are done away with. Animal Farm does a great job of describing this phenomenon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Chinese. They outnumber us easily. I don&#39;t know how a stateless military would function, (who would be in charge of nuclear codes, drones, etc without some form of hierarchy in place), but I think it&#39;s likely that an explicitly hierarchal military would be easier to manage and coordinate than a collectivist one, simply because decisions and orders are made and carried out incredibly more quickly in authoritarian structures than democratic ones. In addition, assuming they still wanted our resources but viewed the population as unable to be subjugated, they&#39;d have incentive to use weapons of mass destruction and just wipe America off the map rather than allow it to continue to exist and in doing so prove statelessness to be a valid option for societies. </p>

<p>This is, of course, assuming that the stateless society would be free of internal problems and power struggles. It&#39;d likely have racial conflicts, religious conflicts, etc. and be incredibly divided and chaotic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seriously think that if the U.S. rolled into Afghanistan with tanks and trained soldiers, they&#39;d be able to defend themselves without an organized army?</p>

<p>Oh wait...16 years of war and counting, and I don&#39;t think anyone would consider that war &quot;won&quot;. The U.S. has the largest, most well-funded army in the history of the world, and still the Taliban exist and even thrive in some areas. Of course, it didn&#39;t help that we trained and armed them in the 1980s when they were known as the Mujahideen, but still; drones, bunker busters, depleted uranium shells, white phosphorus and torture and they STILL haven&#39;t quit? </p>

<p>I think we&#39;d do fine defending our homes against the Chinese, or anyone else. Guerilla warfare is and always has been effective against invaders, and we&#39;re better armed in America than damn near anyone is.  </p>

Living in happiness and pursuing spiritual fulfillment?
If yes:
Is the state mandating that you spend your Sunday afternoon on reddit, complaining about the nature of the state?
Disavowing yourself of the notion that there are individual entities collected under a &quot;state&quot; will bear more fruit than projecting anger outwards towards a philosophical construct.
Start the revolution in your heart brother, the rest will follow.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! This mentality is what changes the world. It&#39;s what changes ones&#39; understanding of reality and often times leads towards genuine enlightenment. Allegiance to country is nuts, as we&#39;ve all come to learn, particularly as of late. The only real &#39;country&#39; one should identify with is one&#39;s own literal being. It shouldn&#39;t be some legal construct, or anything that exists outside one&#39;s own self. That understanding can lead to a powerful ego death. Release the shackles of the mind and become your own country by seeing through the limitations of the illusory self, which seems to have to deeply bought into the idea of an external country being the dictator of one&#39;a experience. But people are awakening, I sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, yes there is. You hijack the party the way the TEA party did. The TEA party was ultra-grass roots, spread through talk radio and the Internet. It was the original anti-Wall Street, anti-government movement before Occupy. The TEA party worked its ass off to primary incumbent politicians and flooded the ranks of the GOP with newbies who wanted to fix DC. Guess what? They were able to shake off the political, media, and deep state establishment to elect a complete political outsider (TRUMP). Don&#39;t forget, that was the first time in American history where a person not working in public service found a way to become president. Especially important when everyone in the MSM and political establishment was against him. </p>

<p>Now, I think Trump is a terrible president, but it shows that it is possible. Civilized, organized, incorruptible citizens can change this shit. The TEA party hijacked the GOP in 6 years. </p>

<p>The TEA party, the progressive base, the former middle class, and the independents make up a vast majority of the voting public. We see the government cutting programs for average folk, advocating for a reduction in benefits, and cutting taxes for the rich... The rest of the budget gets shifted to corporate subsidies, the military industry, and the government bureaucracy. Everyone fucking hates this shit except the oligarchs and corporate elite who have all the wealth being siphoned off towards them. This can stop. It wasn&#39;t always like this. We can have capitalism and a social safety net. The economy can grow, have competitive free enterprise, and allow reforms to help the common man. We need politicians who aren&#39;t sucking the tits of corporate lobbyists and accepting the sweet sweet dark cash of corporate america. </p>

<p>An I quit day.</p>

<p>we need to effectively come together a populace ans communicate our intent for the future.</p>

<p>We pick a day and just everyone stops participating.</p>

<p>We have enough housing already so all we need to do is overcome social stigma and literally &quot;forget&quot; about traditional society.</p>

<p>Start planting gardens and being self sufficient and then bring in your neighbors to help build a community based on the resources at your disposal.</p>

<p>We just stop working and start SHARING.</p>

<p>I am my Brothers keeper.</p>

<p>Move forward with love, compassion, understanding and always eek to educate through personal conversation.</p>

<p>Stop waving banners.</p>

<p>Stop picking teams.</p>

<p>Go outside and live.</p>

<p>They&#39;ll have a really hard time monitoring public conversation if we just go back to town hall type meetings.</p>

Yes they were absolutely terrible presidents. but so is Trump.</p>

<p>The defence that &quot;democrats/Obama/Hillary was doing it&quot; is fucking absurd, just because the school bully is stealing peoples lunch money doesn&#39;t mean the new kid should as well.

<p>Trump lied dozens of times during his campaing and blatantly broke his biggest promises within his first few weeks of office, how the fuck can any Trump fan defend this?</p>

<p>I was actually excited for when he said he would &#39;drain the swamp&#39; and &#39;take down wall street&#39;. But then he completely betrayed my trust when he hired a cabinet that rivaled Nixon as most corrupt cabinet. Not to mention that three of his personal hires have resigned within the first month for having their Russian ties exposed to the media, and now Trump is banning media that critiques him.</p>

<p>But please tell us why we should be constantly praising our lord and savior D_T rather than constantly critiquing him as we did Obama and Hillary?</p>

<p>His cabinet picks are the globalists. They profited from it, they will continue to profit from it. How many former Goldman Sachs executives are within the sanctum? </p>

<p>Gorsuch is a fine legal mind...but his predisposition is tilted strongly towards big business (globalists as you call them). His position on the court will always be tainted by the fact he was nominated by Trump after the Senate shirked their duty. </p>

<p>The establishment on both sides can go fuck themselves for the corruption, manipulation and self-dealing. However, for the next century or more, Donald Trump is going to set the bar for corruption. Not surprising since he is Roy Cohn&#39;s protege. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Insider:a person who is a member of a group, organization, society, etc.</p>

<p>DeVos is a member of the Republican Party </p>

<p>Devos is married to Dick DeVos, the former CEO of multi-level marketing company Amway.</p>

<p>Since 1982, DeVos has participated in the Michigan Republican Party. She served as a local precinct delegate for the Michigan Republican Party, having been elected for 16 consecutive two-year terms since 1986.[37] She was a Republican National Committeewoman for Michigan between 1992 and 1997,[38] and served as chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party from 1996 to 2000.[39][40] </p>

<p>DeVos personally raised more than $150,000 for the 2004 Bush re-election campaign,[43] and hosted a Republican fundraiser at her home in October 2008 that was headlined by President George W. Bush.[44] During the Bush Administration she spent two years as the finance chairperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and worked closely with the Administration on &quot;various projects.&quot;[45] The DeVos family has been active in Republican politics for decades, particularly as donors to candidates and the party, giving more than $17 million to political candidates and committees since 1989.[26][46]</p>

<p>Please research John King Jr and Arne Duncan, the last two sec of educations as well as the previous three before them and you&#39;d find out that they pale in comparison to the amount of political shit that Devos has been through. </p>

<p>Find me one good thing Devos has done so far, or one solid plan that teachers and America can get behind. </p>

<p>Oh wait! Devos&#39;s only statement so far has been about how she wants to cut free lunches from school, how inspirational, I&#39;m so glad we got an outsider to finally help out all the poor families struggling to pay the $5 lunches that the school shits out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;DeVos has never attended, worked in nor sent her children to public schools. She has no government experience and no experience running or managing a bureaucracy or large organization. Instead, DeVos has spent much of her adulthood donating millions to politicians so that she can in turn lobby them to support her favorite pet cause: vouchers that give money to conservative religious schools with zero strings attached.</p>

<p>To those who argue that maybe an outsider’s perspective is what is needed in Washington, that only works when we are talking about a proven leader who has a track record of effectiveness –such as a military general with strategic prowess, a transformational CEO or a superintendent who successfully improved a major school system. DeVos fails to meet these criteria.&quot;</p>

<p>If you really think the person who will completely fix the school systems is someone who has never spent a day, or has any idea how the public school system works then you&#39;re in for a welcome surprise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you support our president because some people you hate also hate them? I&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s some of the dumbest shit I&#39;ve read.</p>

<p>&quot;Obama, Clinton, Bush and Nixon all hated Adolf Hitler, it kind of makes you wonder if he&#39;s just on the wrong side and he&#39;s being bullied&quot;  No way am I comparing Trump to Hitler, I&#39;m just pointing out how absurd that argument is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The enemy of the enemy is my friend. And besides, it&#39;s not the only reason I support him. For example, I totally support his treatment of the media, I like most of his cabinet picks, and I love his Supreme Court nomination.

    <div class="md"><p>I still think that the whole &#39;enemy of my enemy is my friend&#39; shit is complete nonsense, if that&#39;s the case ISIS, Putin, Hitler and Stalin are all our friends to people who dislike our government. </p>

<p>And you must not be one of those people who were hyped on him taking down Wall Street, or draining the swamp, or whenever he trashed Hillary and Ted Cruz for having Wall street ties because he filled his entire cabinet up with Goldman Sachs execs and CEO&#39;s, Steve Bannon, Betsy Devos (I know he personally didn&#39;t pick her but Mike Pense and every Repubican did) and the CEO of Exxon. Can you seriously name me one good cabinet pick and a reason why? He literally hired the same people who were backing Hillary so it&#39;s not like Hillary would have been any worse/better. </p>

<p>Also I hate Obama and Hillary as much, if not more, than you do so please spare me the lecture. That&#39;s the one thing I dislike most about Trump supporters, they back Trump and support him because &#39;Hillary and Obama would have been worse&#39; or &#39;Obama was Hitler, at least Trump isn&#39;t nearly as bad as Obama&#39;</p>

<p>Shit is so annoying, this is a conspiracy sub and we&#39;ve always been critical of every politician and president, Trump is no different and he&#39;s gone on the record and lied multiple times. I can bring up 20 times he&#39;s blatantly lied or stretched the truth during his press conferences so that he can push his agenda and his thoughts. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also say his treatment of the media is seriously dangerous. I know there&#39;s a lot of propaganda and shit out there and the media is bad, but do you seriously think the people of the US should get their information from the government and the government only? </p>

<p>Combine the fact that he constantly lies and stretches the truth during his conferences with the combination that he bans any media agency that&#39;s critical of him or fact checks him and we have a dangerously misinformed American public. I know the media is bad, save the lecture, but telling the public &#39;Don&#39;t trust the media, only trust me and Breitbart and infowars!&#39;</p>

<p>I hated Obama, but at least he wasn&#39;t nearly as thin skinned as Trump and we didn&#39;t have him whining on Twitter every day of the week, also I don&#39;t like the fact that Trump criticized Obama for golfing constantly and then Trump breaks the record for quickest president to hit the green. </p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t be held back by the fact that some of us voted for him, or if he is better or worse than Hillary or Obama. He&#39;s our president now and we should be actively critiquing every breath he takes, just as we did Obama and Hillary. There is literally nothing to be gained by being a fan or defending the president, it will only hold us back as a nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a really, really naive statement. It means a lot. That is the entire point of having accounts so you can be attached to a great number of things, one of which is the bs you&#39;ve said in the past. I can only assume you have spouted nonsense and been called out and been banned from subs for breaking the rules and then you go and make a new account. The mass majority of long time redditors have maybe 1 or 2 accounts. The cover of your book is a reason to judge you in, and of itself. Sorry.</p>

<p>Sure thing! Expanding social programs and benefits is unsustainable, but his solution to that is that the wealthy top 1% should no longer command and own the majority of the income/wealth <strong>going forward</strong>. If we realize that as country we are spending $$ TRILLIONS in government subsidies PER YEAR to corporations, and BILLIONS in over-expensive mediocre health care (that only boost wealth at the top)... perhaps some of that money can be used for education, cheaper/better health care, programs that help poor people regain agency over their lives after being crushed by the system, etc. etc. etc. Some of the criticisms lobbied against Sanders are some outdated red scare threats that we would turn into the next Venezuela... This is patently shortsighted, as all Bernie was asking is that we prioritize the government to serve education, life, justice, equality, and fairness VERSUS individualistic corporate interests that are tearing this country apart.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It is NOT correct on every issue. Our government entitlements and spending are unsustainable on a purely mathematical basis, but the solution is NOT to destroy government (so that corporations can run shit instead... which is what the GOP wants to do). Promoting victimhood versus personal accountability is not ALWAYS the answer, but the opposite side claiming that all is fine and dandy and that actual victims should &quot;stop complaining&quot; is regressive anti-human bullshit (and out of touch with the realities of those victims).</p>

<p>In the end, the left and the right can join together against the corrupt old order that fucked us all (except those at the top). Trump is just another corporate tool, and we should all see that clearly by now, after his first month. It is a worker versus oligarch battle, but the Tea Party has been successful in turning this into a Culture War of whites against &quot;evil foreigners&quot;. This is why so many people on the left are quick to compare this to what happened in Germany throughout the 1930&#39;s.  </p>

<p>Fine... let me be MORE specific. Government should not promote corporate cartels and oligopolies, that stand AGAINST the idea of competitive free markets. They have been picking winners and losers for decades, and we are all worse for it. They have crushed small businesses with regulations, fees, taxes, etc. so the middle class has been crushed. Make no mistake... when Trump says cut regulations, he meant cutting Dodd-Frank for his banker buddies, or cutting the EPA for his Big Oil buddies.  </p>

<p>That you are being lazy in your critical thinking is perhaps what is confusing to you. The fact that some humans can prioritize profits over human life (see pharmaceutical cartels, for example) is a prime example of a sociopath.

<p>I&#39;m speaking about the Paul Ryans and the Trumps of the world who are ignorant puppets hoping corporations given free reign is the end-all-be-all solution to the world.

<blockquote>

<p>Republicans gutting public funding for schools in poor black neighborhoods are stopping them from fishing. Police racially profiling blacks and a justice system biased against blacks, latinos, and women in MANY states are stopping MANY from fishing. The costs of government subsidized health care, housing, child care, etc. are stopping MANY from fishing. Up until not long ago, segments of our population weren&#39;t even invited to the fishing pond. If one oligarch is taking 95% of the fishes, perhaps the issue is that there aren&#39;t enough fishes to go around for the other 9 hungry people? But you see that as the natural order of things I assume... right? Fuck those 9 hungry people for not being tenacious enough to buy the pond right? </p>

<p>No one is stopping black people from having prosperity and peace? many will disagree with you in the face of racial profiling across economics and justice. No one is stopping women from raising through the ranks or having authority over their bodies? many will disagree with you in the face of ass-backwards religious bigots yearning for the times when women were happy staying at home serving their husbands. Do you catch my drift? Just because your skin color (I&#39;m guessing white at this point) or economic conditions has allowed you to freely fish in any pond you have wanted, DOES NOT mean your same level of privileges apply to others. It&#39;s baffling that white people can&#39;t spend a minute trying to put themselves in the shoes of a poor black boy born in a depressed area. Since you know how to fish so well, would you like to volunteer to go try and fish your way to prosperity as a young black in a black neighborhood in Alabama? </p>

<p>2016 was an indictment on the old corrupt status quo, which was able to placate the Bernie Progressive movement (even though we are taking over at the grass-roots level). No young progressive (sided with Bernie in 80-20 margins) wants the return of the old corrupt status quo.</p>

<p>History says that mistreating and race-baiting against minorities is WRONG. Show me otherwise. History says that propping up those who have been ignored/beaten/impoverished is GOOD. Show me otherwise. History says that an ultra-nationalist and isolationist future of &quot;fuck you, I got mine!&quot; or &quot;Fuck you, the X country of the past was THE GREAT NATION&quot; brings chaos and destruction with very little long-term benefits.

<p>You are correct... &quot;things that happened&quot; included slavery for black people, and it was WRONG! &quot;things that happened&quot; included women not having any voice in our society, and it was WRONG! Those things, among many others, were CORRECTED (not reinforced). &quot;Things that happened&quot; include docile and servile people falling behind a &quot;strong&quot; nationalistic demagogue, duped by fears of Jews and foreigners into committing genocide as a nation, and it was WRONG!. We as America stepped in to correct all of those, and we will have to step in once again to right the ship towards a future that is good for humanity (not just your less-informed side).</p>

<p>Republicans (and yes, Corporate old order Democrats also) licking balls of their donors gets them more campaign contributions. Donors get the legislation they want. I guess it can be a pleasurable experience for both (just not for the rest of Americans). Catch my drift?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the only historical example of what you&#39;re advocating. Other revolutions like the one you advocate just ended up making things worse than they were before (USSR). </p>

<p>A stateless society, in my opinion, is impossible regardless. There are too many low IQ and conditioned people who would not know what to do or how to act without someone in authority telling them what to do, and too many high IQ people who would immediately see the overturning of the previous order as a way to manipulate the masses and seize power and wealth for themselves. This might be a symptom of hierarchal structure, but those people are not going to simply disappear once the old authorities are done away with. Animal Farm does a great job of describing this phenomenon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, yes there is. You hijack the party the way the TEA party did. The TEA party was ultra-grass roots, spread through talk radio and the Internet. It was the original anti-Wall Street, anti-government movement before Occupy. The TEA party worked its ass off to primary incumbent politicians and flooded the ranks of the GOP with newbies who wanted to fix DC. Guess what? They were able to shake off the political, media, and deep state establishment to elect a complete political outsider (TRUMP). Don&#39;t forget, that was the first time in American history where a person not working in public service found a way to become president. Especially important when everyone in the MSM and political establishment was against him. </p>

<p>Now, I think Trump is a terrible president, but it shows that it is possible. Civilized, organized, incorruptible citizens can change this shit. The TEA party hijacked the GOP in 6 years. </p>

<p>The TEA party, the progressive base, the former middle class, and the independents make up a vast majority of the voting public. We see the government cutting programs for average folk, advocating for a reduction in benefits, and cutting taxes for the rich... The rest of the budget gets shifted to corporate subsidies, the military industry, and the government bureaucracy. Everyone fucking hates this shit except the oligarchs and corporate elite who have all the wealth being siphoned off towards them. This can stop. It wasn&#39;t always like this. We can have capitalism and a social safety net. The economy can grow, have competitive free enterprise, and allow reforms to help the common man. We need politicians who aren&#39;t sucking the tits of corporate lobbyists and accepting the sweet sweet dark cash of corporate america. </p>

<p>intense or irrational dislike or fear of people from other countries.</p>

<p>I&#39;m intensely pro-American, but PRO an America that is inclusive, just, fair, promotes community, promotes working with a good uncorrupted government, and one that looks to a future of more equality and team work. I am intensely AGAINST a nation built on fear of foreigners, individualistic &quot;fuck you I got mine&quot; attitudes of the past, being run to the ground by fascist (read: corporate) demagogues abusing people&#39;s misinformed insecurities, and against the disintegration of structures that promote social justice.  </p>
