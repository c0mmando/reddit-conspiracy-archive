    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again, 
no one <em>really</em> likes Trumps personality or how he handles himself, but the presidential election is not supposed to be a popularity contest that&#39;s based on how nice you are- it&#39;s based on wtf you can do in office. Now I have no idea if Trump is going to get anything done but I do know Hillary would have had no problem letting the country burn because we&#39;ve seen her in positions of power and it hasn&#39;t turned out well.</p>

<p>So from what I can tell, more people were afraid of Hillary in office than Trump, despite what our <em>lovely &amp; oh-so-accurate</em> news media was reporting, and here we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean maybe. My worry is that the Republican party is historically pro-police and military, and it seems like the most rabid part of Trump&#39;s base is as well. So to them, increasing the military and expanding the police state is right and good and necessary.</p>

It&#39;s an illusion
 He talks about killing big government programs while increasing the military. Obama increased big government but decreased the size of the military or at least tried to make it look that way. both side slowly ratchet up on either side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump embodies a collective conciousness, if you have noticed the true injustices of today&#39;s world then you are part of a movement for change. 
Only a person with his particular attributes could have pulled it off. I don&#39;t think his motivation is necessarily identical to the collective but being egotistical has helped in the progression of events. 
His personal shortcomings are a distraction focussed on by the MSM to.. ad nauseum.... divide and concor. 
Trump is not the leader of this concious wave, just a very suitable tool. 
I believe the critical mass has been reached and there is no stopping it now. 
Things will get worse before they get better, but humanity will prevail against all those who have aligned themselves so clearly with an evil agenda that pervades every aspect of life at present. An evil which is unsustainable due to a very simple reason.

    <div class="md"><p>Apathy plays a huge part. Nearly half of eligible voters didn&#39;t even show up to vote. </p>

<p>Basically, an old cranky bigot goes up against a corrupt career politician. Since HRC wasn&#39;t a very good candidate but used her connections to steal the DNC nomination, not many liberals wanted to vote for her. Trump just shouts a bunch of lies that fit with a feverish minority&#39;s racism and general ignorance, and those fanatics <em>do</em> show up to vote. </p>

<p>Plus, you&#39;ve got Cambridge Analytica and CTR manipulating social media, and the water is muddied beyond most people&#39;s ability to see the truth. So you get a total shit show where people are voting or not voting based on emotion rather than any kind of logic. </p>

<p>Want to be POTUS? Target people&#39;s insecurities and biases. Lie. Cheat. Shout so much bad stuff about your opponent that rationality and logic are swept aside in a &quot;my team vs. your team&quot; mud slinging contest. It also helps to find a good scapegoat for people&#39;s dissatisfaction with their lives, and stoke their fears with that scapegoat - like &quot;terrorists&quot;. </p>
