       Trump spoke to congress tonight and regardless what was said, all I have seen from the MSM was how presidential he was. I am disclosing that I am very against Trump as I'm not trying to hide my feelings about him and the establishment. So if the mainstream media is so untrustworthy, why do they seem to be praising Trump right now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Honeslty, I am starting to think that media outlets who are "against trump" may be full of shit. They are obviously bullshit. I hate trump but now I believe he is a huge part of dictating the mainstream media.

       That's crazy. CNN and Trump have been at each other's throats for months. I think they are responding to polling. Most people (nearly 80%) are reporting to have viewed the speech favorably. Railing against a speech that everyone liked doesn't go over very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't the answer be that Trump actually gave a decent speech? Why so much fear?

       Not really a conspiracy. But maybe because he did seem 'presidential'. He didn't talk using his normal speaking habits. He didn't say over the top controversial things. It was just not all everyday government oration filled with (probably false) promises.

       I get that but there is some reason they are choosing to do what they do. Someone is directing the media to start supporting trump suddenly although they could just say he was reading a speech written by someone else and told not to deviate.

       I think it was because his speech was well-written tonight and he didn't say anything stupid for once. There wasn't much to criticize IMO, other than whether he can get it all done.

       Nor should he - it's not his strength. He's not a 'trained politician' like Obama was.

      <p>
       Let's just hope this is a move towards more moderate approaches by all. I think Trump is settling down and realizing that if he gets the rest of government on board with his plans instead of EOs, things go much better. I think he may still learn to do this better.

       I am starting to feel like this was the plan all along. Get him in office as an anti-hero against MSM and then having him change into someone the media realizes they adore. Making them even more sales for admitting they were wrong. Even if I am wrong I feel conned.

       Maybe, but I would imagine they would just use that against him and they did. Now they are saying he is presidential. It doesn't really make sense. I want to know what's really going on and I bet you do too.

       I think all the back and forth is a tool of throwing people off of their emotional compass as a way to keep the population in a perpetual state of emotionally heightened confussion. If your population subconsciously doesn't know what is fact or fiction it's easier to sell them on "Big lies."

       You're right. This is all bullshit. I really think the speech tonight said nothing but we support isreal (I am not anti isreal but want America to stay out of it) and that we are going towards war with Iran. Everything else was kind if bullshit and even immigration stuff was just a distraction from oil in Iran. MSM owners probably have a lot to profit from this so they are In the same bed. I am so disappointed.

       if he said we're with isreal and we're going to war with iran, that meams WW3--no wonder if the media and its CIA handlers are ecstatic in that case, they get their war with russia after all through the back door.

       they can't keep this war with Trump up forever. He already barred the worst of them from a briefing last week - there is no law saying the President must allow CNN and NBC full WH press credentials. At some point, they risk severing the relationship, and they have been taking it too far as of late. The media needs to attack Trump on real issues or the public will continue to punish these outlets' bottom line.

       Right, there's nothing diplomatic or thoughtful about the man. His body language was completely uncomfortable with having to read the teleprompter and not responding to some of the negative reactions. I can't believe I'm even typing this, but GWBush was more presidential in his recent interview.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand the press embracing that moment with the military widow either. That's straight political pandering.  I'm not saying other politicians don't do that, but I don't think he was more "human" or "presidential" for that moment, especially with the controversy surrounding the raid and the military officials speaking out against his "reforms".
