<p>The current 5.0&#39;s and 5.7 may signal elevated proton levels within the solar wind streams during CH63&#39;s passing. 
The last two passings of CH66 (CH52 / CH41) had low level proton ywilds which appear to have ramped up their game this passing. 
This leaves me to believe that the recent 5.0 and 5.7 in west fukushima could be indications of a new seismic swarm in west fukushima in the 7.0 range as CH66 passes. 
There is also potential for 5.5 range NZ quakes, and 7.0 Tonga quakes as the week progresses. With elevated quakes showing in Chile 5.5 range and Alaska 5.5 range. </p>

<p>Hoping to see higher proton yeilds, as these past two cycles were fast yet non complex which I feel lead to non conclusive testing. </p>

<p>Just throwing this out there as usual-

<p>Would be weird if on 3/11 we had another massive quake. The region hasn&#39;t made for a large event in some time. So lets see how she holds shall we. ;)</p>

<p>New update
<strong>auroras in today</strong> <a href="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png">1</a> <a href="http://www.solarham.net/archive/chasers1.jpg">2</a></p>

<p>March 2, 2017 @ 10:00 UTC
Moderate Geomagnetic Storm Observed (UPDATED)
As expected, a high speed solar wind stream arrived past Earth within the past 24 hours and is currently responsible for Moderate (G2) geomagnetic storming at higher latitudes. Additional periods of storming will remain possible over the next day or so while the stream is geoeffective. Sky watchers at high latitudes should be alert for visible aurora.
UPDATE: The solar wind remains high above 700 km/s and this is helping to prolong the ongoing geomagnetic disturbance. A minor (G1) geomagnetic storm watch will remain in place for the next several hours. Attached image below is courtesy of Ronn and Marketa Murray (The Aurora Chasers) and was captured last night up in Alaska. Beautiful and thanks for sharing!</p>

NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIGHTS: Today, G1-class geomagnetic storms  are in progress as Earth moves through a stream of fast-moving solar wind. As a result, bright auroras are circling both of Earth&#39;s poles. Taichi Nakamura photographed the Southern Lights from Crystals beach, Otago, New Zealand:</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>&quot;I enjoyed this joyful view while sitting with one of my favorite Cabbage trees at the beach,&quot; says Nakamura.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the other end of the Earth, Northern Lights exploded over the frosty terrain of Tromsø, Norway. Bernt Olsen captured the outburst:</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>&quot;Great impact tonight,&quot; says Olsen. &quot;We saw coronas overhead and lots of fast moving auroras.&quot;</p>

<p>The solar wind is flowing from a large canyon-shaped hole in the sun&#39;s atmosphere and is expected to influence Earth for the next two days. Polar sky watchers should remain alert for auroras on Mar. 2nd as NOAA forecasters estimate a 60% chance of continued geomagnetic storms. Free: Aurora alerts.</p>

<p>Winds 709km/s now. Peak 750. </p>

<p>Third midrange quake in series. 1/02/2017 1:17pm
5.3 magnitude earthquake</p>

<p>Today about 6 hours ago at 14:53 
March 02, 2017 UTC</p>

<p>Location:
Epicenter at 32.625, 132.144 
42.2 km from Saiki (26.2 miles)</p>

<p>Shikoku, Japan</p>

<p>Depth: 49 km</p>

<p><strong>Update March 3rd</strong> (spaceweather.com)-
THE SOLAR WIND CONTINUES TO BLOW:
 Solar wind speeds are topping 700 km/s on March 3rd as Earth continues its 3-day journey through a stream of gaseous material flowing from a hole in the sun&#39;s atmosphere. This is sparking geomagnetic storms and beautiful auroras around the Arctic Circle.  Rayann Elzein took this picture last night from Inari, Finland:</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>&quot;The solar wind continues!&quot; says Elzein. &quot;Auroras were visible on the evening of March 2nd as soon as the sky became dark. Very strong auroras filled the sky. I quickly lost count of all the bright bands and fast coronas that appeared above us.&quot;</p>

<p>The display Elzein witnessed took place during a relatively minor G1-class magnetic storm. One night earlier, March 1st, an even stronger G2-class storm occurred, &quot;and the auroras were epic,&quot; reports M-P Markkanen, who photographed the lights spilling over a 1356m high mountain called Otertinden in Storfjord, Norway:</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>&quot;I spent most of the night admiring this dramatic mountain under the storming auroras, which danced on and off all night long with several crazy coronas!&quot; says Markkanen.</p>

<p>Arctic sky watchers should be alert for more auroras tonight.  NOAA forecasters estimate a 40% chance of polar geomagnetic storms on March 3rd as the solar wind continues to blow. Free: Aurora alerts.</p>

<p>To users. 
This is a <a href="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/station-a-index.png">7 day projection</a> which shosw the significant increases of wind we are tracking...</p>

<p>Current speed 683.1</p>

<p>Want to see 325 +/- holding. </p>

<p>Projection march 5th - 6th.  For 7.0 event-
<strong>Primary region East Fukushima</strong>
<strong>35 km offshore 20km Depth</strong></p>

<p>This should be slightly north of the daichi reactors. Cant upload a map atm-
On cell phone-</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>
There is an aditional sunspot region. (looks like beta dao) following ch66. While unlikely to produce a cme&#39; the refion is flaring up a bit. </p>

<p>This passing region may keep winds at a high 480 km/s on the 5th.  </p>

<p><em>It may have no effect at all though...</em></p>

<p>Could produce quaking at a later date then estimated (7th-8th). Although we have some good signs that winds will have a sharp rise and fall. </p>

<p>This is great news for testing this theory-</p>

<p>Primarily winds do this (rise / fall) in quick succession. So hoping to see a good size quake when we reach the control 325 speeds. </p>

<p><strong>Should be an interesting week in terms of earthquakes. Likely regions to see activity.</strong></p>

<p>Chile (5.5 range) 45%</p>

<p>Phillipines 5.0 - 6.5 range 45%</p>

<p>Nz 5.0-6.0 range 45%</p>

<p><strong>Japan 5.0 - 7.0 range 77%</strong></p>

<p>West india 5.5 range 35%</p>

<p>Alaska 4.5-5.5 range 35%</p>

<p>California / oregon 4.0-50 range 25%</p>

<p><em>(note Japan is due for the big one)</em> yet phillipines/ nz could easily fall culprit to this activity (based on past testing). More then likely it is Japans turn this cycle. </p>

<p>Strangelets (unlikely) 10%</p>

<p>Italy 4.5 range</p>

<p>Northeast england 5.0</p>

<p>South east africa 4.5 </p>

<p>Tonga may also see a 7.0 quake / aftershock. </p>

<p><em>Probably my last update until the 5th unless notable solar activity occures.</em></p>

<p><strong>update 3/10/2017 8:36pm</strong> <strong>Solar winds now 389km/s</strong></p>

<p>Japan has stayed significantly silent with a 5.0 in past 36 hours, meanwhile: Another 5.0 (4.9) has just recently struck chile as the speeds decreased. </p>

<p>Last update at 530 pm 3.10.2017 showed a 404.8 km/s so we have lost 15km/s per a 3 hour interval. To reach the target speed of 325 (with 4 hours holding) we need to see 4-6 more intervals at this curve. This is a 18 hour countdown until we reach that zone... (i.e. -15km/s per 3 hours = assessed curve... 18 hours 90km/s loss) 389 - 90 km/s = 299km/s...</p>

<p>The additional time is to reaching a holding pattern. (constant low to restabilize earths traditional wind speed patterns). </p>

<p>So initial update T minus 18 hours until estimated impact.
 Likely 2:30pm 3.11.2017 +/- 25 hours. </p>

<p><strong>Quake assessed is a 7.0+ east fukushima / iwate prefecture. 35 km offshore 20 km depth.</strong></p>

<p>Godspeed reddit-</p>

<p><strong>Final update 9:50 pm 3.11.2017 (pac time)</strong>
The ace satellite now showing a significant disturbance of the bz componet.  (protons) so were super close (by my opinion) to a massive quake!</p>

<p>Hoping before midnight...</p>

<p>Stay safe!
<strong>Final note</strong></p>

<p>Massive schumann resonance taking place now.

<p><strong>Update</strong>
3.12.17</p>

<p>A day late and a buck short. We had a slightly elevated wind stream last night which seemed to maintain an above average wind curve. I.e. we were holding at an elevated speed of 400-415 km/s. </p>

<p>Its now 3:00pm 3.12.17 - <strong>winds now 360 km/s</strong>.</p>

<p>If winds remain to drop over the next few hours we should see this quake guarenteed between now and noon tonorrow. </p>

<p><em>note it truly is hard to assess the wind speeds from a week earlier</em> 
Sorry were running a little late on our little experiment. </p>

<p><strong>soon</strong></p>

<p><strong>we want to see holding 325km/s for a brief period of time</strong> </p>

<p>(i.e. 2-6 hours).</p>

<p>Good news (or bad really)... Bz componet had a large breach last night as documented above with a large incident via schumann resonance. 
So were likely to see a quake! Just playing the waiting game for the levels to lower to our general e.q. window. 
Thanks all. </p>

<p><em>again sorry were running late</em>. Truly hoped to see this manifest last night. </p>

<p><strong>Update 3.12.17 @8:10pm</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://m.imgur.com/gjpCPR8">Users report magnetosphere acting up at this time</a></p>

<p><a href="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png">winds now holding stable 350km/s</a></p>

<p>We should see a huge quake within hours now. 8 -10 tops. (likely much sooner).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Id have to read the article and assess it. The earths axis is really subject to the suns position in our galaxy and the geomagnetic and gravitational fields of the sun.

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion the 5.5 range is the predicted high point this passing. (for nz). I&#39;d push for up to 6.0 range quakes only if solar winds reach a height surpassing 780km/s.  </p>

<p>If we see 780km/s
Then I&#39;d reassess them to be 6.0 - 7.0 range. Yet this coronal hole will probably lack this with an estimated 550 - 700 km/s wind stream. In short: You should be ok :)</p>

<p>I guess they don&#39;t like when you actually know and practice physics..</p>

<p>There are some good threads there with some quite reputable users. Such as the earthquake threads and solar observers. Ive been an active user on those threads for some six years now. My helio observations wouldn&#39;t be as meaningful without those resources that the community provides. Can&#39;t watch 24/7 so its nice to have a forum where we croud source the activity taking place. 
Otherwise id miss a vast amount of significant changes. (cme&#39;s, etc)...</p>

<p>Learn alot there, as well ... As we source most space weather articles as they come. So it can be a useful community if you A. Take everything with a huge grain of salt, and B. Use the information that proves worthy for future consideration. </p>

<p>Essentially aside from reading those are the only threads I post on now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theorhetically, personal observations and theory. </p>

<p>Ive been tracking earthquakes in attribution to extreme solarwind velocity shifts for some time now.
While originally my focus was stimulated by cme activity. My research is now focusing on coronal hole wind streams. There is some simularities, yet the winds themselves always seemed to dominate the bz componet which increases when masses of protons bombard earth. (during earths largest seismic incidents). </p>

<p>Essentially the best tests seemed to cordinate massive proton seeding in the cme model. Yet the coronal holes (while following the extreme vectors / timeline) seem to lack the caustic proton feature leading to inconclusive results. </p>

<p>So its exciting for me, to see the alpha beta sunspots accompaning the ch66 as the region passes. Seeing the recent 5 0 and 5 7 in fukushima as ch63 passed gives me hope that there will be a more conclusive test this passing. (i.e. more protons).</p>

<p>If so, you should submit your findings to university researchers, get them to peer review your work and have it published in a reputable scientific journal.</p>

The white and red lines seperating as they are (seem to cordinate with these events). No I personally don&#39;t know why. Yet thats one of the indocations I look for. Typically (from observation) the longer and woder the spread. The larger the seismic risk. Yet the basic magnitude assessments are always made weeks in advance by myself based on the coronal hole (or sunspot) complexity. Assessing the potential windspeeds.
So I am under the impression. We have a good test coming towards us. Call me optimistic... Or a nutter- (we will see).
Thanks for reading all:)</p>
