        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Background:  My ex-boyfriend is incarcerated.  I won&#39;t get into details because I don&#39;t want to reveal his identity. But I will copy and paste an email reply he sent me through the Corrlinks email program.  </p>

<p>Please help me figure out what he is talking about.</p>

<p>&quot;I really shouldn&#39;t have even put either one of them out there about it. It&#39;s not my place to do that. If they&#39;d have done that about me to you, not only would I vehemently deny it, but I&#39;d be really pissed about it and confront them. Because that&#39;s not something that&#39;s done and it&#39;s horrible etiquette. I really shouldn&#39;t talk about it AT ALL. And that was what we agreed on, remember? And please don&#39;t be under the impression that it&#39;s something only the three of us share because that&#39;s far from the case. Andrew VanWynGarden from MGMT, Eminem, Matt Damon, every single member of the band Bright Eyes led by Conor Oberst, Stephanie Meyer of Twilight fame (her whole book series is a metaphor about it I recently realized, much like Harry Potter and Star Wars) and strangers that I pass on the street. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people suffer the affliction, if it could so be called. Gift? Curse?</p>

<p>Ha, you say aliens? A theory I&#39;ve considered, though I doubt I ever said as much out loud. &quot;Sons Of Man&quot; as the Bible put it...the half-breeds, born of relations between the Annunaki and the people of Earth....have you ever listened to &quot;Firewall&quot; by Bright Eyes (the band with a highly intentional name)? I think that guy who spoke on that intro is on track...but I digress. It&#39;s nothing I can/should describe anyway. Just take my word for it? It&#39;s no big deal. </p>

<p>You want to do your own research on what I was talking about? I highly doubt you&#39;ll find anything of fact in the abscesses of the internet where idiots jump to crazy conclusions and make no sense and abuse the word. But here&#39;s some things that can get you on the right path, though please refrain from asking me about it much further.</p>

<p>*Check out (Man how did they spell it) &quot;Syco Vision&quot; by Suicidal Tendencies, and read the words along with it. Seriously, that&#39;s a very good one, even if it&#39;s not your kind of music, to get a grip on this. I love that term now, &quot;Psycho Vision.&quot;
*Wikipedia &quot;The Force&quot; from Star Wars 
*The Dark Gifts of the Vampires by Anne Rice (an exquisite example of a perfectly camouflaged metaphor with beautiful and haunting stories and writing style), the abilities that Lestat and the ancients developed by the end of &quot;Queen of the Damned.&quot; Wish I was an effing vampire.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more that I can&#39;t think of right now. But let&#39;s drop it after this...draw your own conclusions and if it&#39;s so pressing I&#39;ll discuss it with you when I&#39;m free. Though it would be better left alone, in my opinion. What do you have on your agenda today? Any trips to <em>omitted</em> to see my half-inch hair within the next 5 months?&quot;</p>

<p>If you resonate with this group please let me know.  I need to know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any idea what he is talking about....at all?</p>

<p>I&#39;m intrigued because of his knowledge of Bright Eyes. I&#39;ve been following Conor&#39;s music since the early 2000&#39;s because of how it deeply resonated with me. I&#39;m interested, does your ex hail from the same place Conor (Bright Eyes) is from or has he been a fan of Bright Eyes in your time knowing him? What about Suicidal Tendencies, or is his knowledge of this music out of character? And how does this tie in with two girls you went to school with?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as Bright Eyes, yes I think he&#39;s been a fan always.  And suicidal tendencies - they have been ever present in his life.  He said the two girls we went to school with share this gift/curse he has . </p>

<p>The only commonality is that they all had fucked up childhoods and they share really high IQs - and they are all extremely misunderstood and misinterpreted.  </p>

<p>&quot; In regard to [said girl]. </p>

<p>She and I have something very deep in common that is profound and exotic and rare and that I would never deign to share in mixed company, even were I talking about my own affiliation with this circumstance, because I wouldn&#39;t put her business out there about it. She has never been anything but kind and sweet to me and I am aware of the extremely difficult life that she&#39;s had; coming from a boy with a past like mine, it&#39;s pretty significant for me to say she has known horrors that I pray I never experience that should only be reserved for the seventh circle of Hell. She gave me outspoken support for my relationship with you in a time when I was getting it from all angles about &quot;settling down&quot; again and &quot;softening&quot; and all of that immature nonsense that people try to say when they know you&#39;ve found such happiness in one person that your need for they themselves could diminish greatly in the near future. For what it&#39;s worth, I have never fostered romantic prospects with her, never kissed her, never so much as touched her skin, though I do remember telling you I was going to try one time because I wanted to piss you off. But that&#39;s not how I look at her. I also offered to beat the hell out of <em>omitted</em> whatshisface, the cockeyed kid she screwed that like almost had her taken advantage of or whatever happened, but she laughed it off graciously, which is pretty mature of her because she knows that I would have pummeled that kid into a coma for screwing with her. For all I know she is no longer the young women I once knew; I have now been incarcerated for several times longer than I knew her anyways. But please understand that she and I do have a deep connection that I cannot and will not explain, though she may not be as joyful about it as I am. I was just glad to find someone who was on the same page that I am. I am not &quot;obsessed&quot; with her and you have no reason to be creeped out, <em>omitted</em>. She and I grew close and learned a lot about each other, but there was never any romantic/sexual connotation to any conversation that I ever had with her. <em>omitted</em> is the girl for me.</p>

<p>I only want you to be happy, <em>omitted</em>. And I think that I can be a big part of you finding that happiness...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those interested, the spoken words he is referring to in the Bright Eyes song are below:</p>

<p>&quot;If there is no such thing as time, you&#39;re already there, and you&#39;re controlling this cycle. You say, &quot;Man, look what we found here, Einstein, &quot; or whoever you&#39;re talking to, Tesla - whoever you&#39;re talking to. Problems of the future can be solved by mankind because you create them. And you have to believe in the future, it&#39;s what we have to do. We progress, we always progress - we try to. So the Sumerian tablets, they say the same thing like Genesis said, that there were chariots of fire that came into the sky. And these beings got out of them, and they walked like a man but they had reptilian features. They had snake-like eyes, a tail, and, uh, scales, right? And they were - they were here, and they made slaves out of the people. And where they landed in is what the Bible calls the Garden of Eden. They were trying to inbreed with the people here. The women would die, the babies would abort. But after two thousand years they started taking, the babies started being born and living. And they had tails, they had a few reptilian features. They could phase shift from one dimension to another dimension, and the people who know say it&#39;s from the fourth dimension - the next dimension. Space is expanding; there are spirits coming from the center, right? We&#39;re going counterclockwise. There&#39;s supposed to be eight other universes going counterclockwise, and that&#39;s called Superuniverse, you know? And love&#39;s always been the message. It&#39;s just - circumstances happen, right? People freak out, just flat flip out, you know? Well, that&#39;s where Hitler came from, Hitler came from that way. He was an outspoken, charismatic yeller. And, and all these people said, &quot;Hey, we&#39;ll use this guy, hey, look at all these people listening to this guy.&quot; You know what I mean? And so that&#39;s just what the trip&#39;s like, that. You know? It still exists, and their bloodline goes back - back into Sumerian times. You know, they didn&#39;t call it reptilian, they didn&#39;t call it that. But they did, because they called him Satan, they called him the Devil, and it&#39;s the same damn trip. It&#39;s a negative force, coming in on a positive force, because it&#39;s a third dimension, right? And for it to solidify or to crystallize, it has to have both elements, right? And you have to keep it in balance, or it will, it will, one of them will destroy the other...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh gotcha. I&#39;d say from what I read, that it probably has something to do with the way children cope with a traumatic experience. When something like that shatters your world very young, the entire way you look at the world has to change to incorporate the trauma. And you have to find a way to keep living. </p>

<p>Almost all the people I&#39;ve known that experienced horrible shit (i.e. Rape, murder of mother,  etc.) very young typically found their happiness afterward by helping others and trying to make them happy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We label people as crazy or psycho because we believe they are deranged. But in truth the normal people are the one who are sick. This world is inverted but no one can see it except the &#39;crazies&#39;. Notice how 70% of people believe the government lies and yet no one does anything about it, they have been beaten and drugged into submission. That&#39;s why it&#39;s always crazy people that are the ones to blow up or shoot politicians. </p>

<p>Society also seems to think that this is it and everything else is science fiction but it&#39;s not. The write Graham Hancock proved human history is a lie and yet the establishment labels it pseudoscience. The ancient alien theory is a bullshit lie to detract from the truth. </p>

<p>Humans are capable of more than they know, we are all connected through some weird spider web of conscience and this reality is subject to change based on the energy we exert into it. </p>

<p>As a former skeptic, I know this all seems hard to believe when someone just tells you, that&#39;s why you have to seek the answers and do your own research using acceptance, knowledge and understanding. </p>

<p>To accept something means to be at piece with it and allows you to further delve into the subject. </p>

<p>To know something is to love it. To love something means you respect it and can draw on this knowledge at anytime allowing you to delve further into truth.</p>

<p>To understand something is to have compassion for it. When you have compassion for something you can better decide on what is right and true for all things. </p>

<p>Eventually you will come to point where even the things you once thought were absolutely good are actually harmful and the things you you thought were bad have some good effects. This is the dilemma of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </p>

<p>God speed.</p>
