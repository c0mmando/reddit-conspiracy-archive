<p>They&#39;re not even trying to hide the vote manipulation any more. This is dumb.</p>

<p>Also note that in the time the post went from 8k upvotes to 12k the subreddit only gained 200 subscribers, which is a pretty good analogue for how many people actually liked the post and wanted to see more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s a satirical sub and there&#39;s tons of pro-political figure or pro-dictator subreddits where you get banned for &quot;not playing along&quot;. There&#39;s even a popular Star Wars sub for people who act like they love The Empire and Darth Vader, and you WILL get banned for saying &quot;I don&#39;t think Skywalker was all that bad though&quot;. (Empiredidnothingwrong is the sub).</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the famous Pyongyang sub for Kim Jong-Il and North Korea.</p>

<p>Do you really think they are super serious when they imitate Trump&#39;s twitter-writing style? I&#39;ve seen multiple users there clearly say &quot;haha we memed a horrible dude in as president lololol&quot; especially when he was elected. I really hate the sub though so I don&#39;t know much else about it other than the posts that reach All. I would never filter it out though because I don&#39;t want to put myself in a media bubble where I&#39;m just surrounded by opinions I like.</p>

<p>Sure, t_d is now seemingly posting news or other stuff that&#39;s banned from elsewhere on reddit, but even still I automatically assume it&#39;s 50% hyperbole or flat out a lie. &quot;Omg this democrat politician did this horrible thing lelel&quot; - article says some drunk hobo in an alleyway rambled about a dream he had about &quot;a democrat saying something horrible and green cats with rainbow death I am jesus!!!&quot;. They know it&#39;s a lie but they know it pushes people&#39;s buttons.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a question, that&#39;s an insult disguised as one. You just phrased it like that so you could go round all your favourite trump hate subs acting like a martyr saying you got banned &quot;just for asking a question&quot;.</p>

<p>Grow up. Talk to people with differing opinions and make your own, and try not to be a massive bigot.

<p>You already know the answer. You literally write about it in the second part of the comment. Reddit has a clear agenda they are trying to push and they&#39;re desperate to get rid of people who oppose it. They&#39;re censoring r/the_donald however they can and if they had any excuse to simply remove them from the site they would be banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very common on reddit and has been for many years, and is not necessarily a sign of vote manipulation. Anytime a post from a tiny subreddit gets a decent amount of traction it often gets more upvotes than it has subscribers because millions of people are seeing it instead of hundreds to thousands. This is easily verifiable with a few minutes of research. Posts like this detract from the credibility of r/conspiracy as a whole</p>

I&#39;ve got a list of around a dozen submissions that have a suspicious amount of upvotes (over 10k upvotes, usually low sub count, other submissions in this same sub average less than ~100 upvotes), and that&#39;s just what I&#39;ve seen.
