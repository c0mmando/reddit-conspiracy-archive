    <div class="md"><p>It was 3 hours, for a sinister reason. They ended up banning all the offshoot subreddits that people made for continued investigation as well. </p>

<p>People were doxxing left and right, but in the days prior the mods had been warned. They were diligent in removing PII posts quickly.  But that wasn&#39;t the reason, only the excuse. </p>

<p>The reason was the NY Post&#39;s original fake news article about pizzagate. Its mentioning of the sub caused even more people to look at it.  What they found obviously wasn&#39;t fake but a real citizen investigation. TPTB couldn&#39;t have that now could they?</p>

<p>I Always thought the term &quot;witchhunt&quot; that they posted on the banned page was a stupid jab at the occult element involved.</p>

<p>I vividly recall the fake news invention that began to counter pizzagate. There are people now who like to say it didn&#39;t begin there but anyone watching at the time couldn&#39;t have escaped that fact if they tried.</p>

<p>So yes, it did happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was mainly going by memory and after looking I couldn&#39;t find anything about the stickied post so I may have been wrong on tht but <a href="https://archive.is/eGgQE">this</a> is the mod post from whn the sub got banned that includes the Admin message telling them they were being banned for still posting personal info and doxxing even after multiple warnings. And the official reason given was witch hunting, which falls in line with that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>they gave r/pizzagate about 20 minutes warning of shutdown. The &quot;doxxing&quot; specifically was reposting instragram messages and images from the public accounts of a few suspected individuals. So if you think of doxxing in terms of identifying anonymous people or posting private information about them then no, it didn&#39;t happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s utterly wrong. The mods were very severely treating doxxing. They had a sticky for a long time reminding everyone it was forbidden, and to please help avoid giving them a pretext to get the sub banned. There wasn&#39;t any doxxing going on there for weeks. <a href="http://archive.is/MrsGu">This was</a> the top post when the sub got banned.</p>
