       Sorry if this has been posted before. In popular subs the mod team are surely paid social media experts. Whereas these new independent subs are just dudes who are like,"Yeah!"
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just send the "yeah!" dudes messages like "hey btw dis da gov. be our puppet or well kill u" because those "yeah" guys would in turn go right online and say "hey I was contacted by an entity and given a narrative for which I refused." which would flat out prove pizzagate real right there.

       Dunno why PG went, but AltRight was trying to pay 5k for info on a picture of a man. That is doxxing. All they had to do was say send all info to police, and there is a reward for successful prosecution.

       The only people that could possibly have put that message there are the Reddit admins. I was a mod here for a few years and have seen the admins warn
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       several times for doxing. There's no wuestion that they would do that and anything contrary that you may hear from pizzagaters is simply sour grapes.

       they gave r/pizzagate about 20 minutes warning of shutdown. The "doxxing" specifically was reposting instragram messages and images from the public accounts of a few suspected individuals. So if you think of doxxing in terms of identifying anonymous people or posting private information about them then no, it didn't happen.

       It was 3 hours, for a sinister reason. They ended up banning all the offshoot subreddits that people made for continued investigation as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       People were doxxing left and right, but in the days prior the mods had been warned. They were diligent in removing PII posts quickly.  But that wasn't the reason, only the excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason was the NY Post's original fake news article about pizzagate. Its mentioning of the sub caused even more people to look at it.  What they found obviously wasn't fake but a real citizen investigation. TPTB couldn't have that now could they?

       Sorry, i just remembered logging on to the subreddit that day and there being 20 minutes but the warning must have gone out before that. I recall all the spinoffs getting shutdown. there are actually a few small and quiet places still left.
      </p>
      <p>
       I Always thought the term "witchhunt" that they posted on the banned page was a stupid jab at the occult element involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       I vividly recall the fake news invention that began to counter pizzagate. There are people now who like to say it didn't begin there but anyone watching at the time couldn't have escaped that fact if they tried.

       It's utterly wrong. The mods were very severely treating doxxing. They had a sticky for a long time reminding everyone it was forbidden, and to please help avoid giving them a pretext to get the sub banned. There wasn't any doxxing going on there for weeks.

       Some users doxxed some ppl, yes. Whether those misbehaving users were actually plants... impossible to say for sure, but it does seem likely. Perfect way to shut down a sub if you can't pwn the mods.
