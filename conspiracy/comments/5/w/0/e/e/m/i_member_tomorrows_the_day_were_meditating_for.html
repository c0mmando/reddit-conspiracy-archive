<p>This idea of &quot;power of intention&quot; &quot;mind over matter&quot; stems from a belief that God isnt above us, he&#39;s inside of us, deep in our subconscious. It&#39;s a principle of Buddhism and Taoism and a number of other cultures, and makes more sense if you&#39;ve researched the pineal gland and DMT.</p>

<p>Regardless, real or not, accurate or not, tomorrow&#39;s the day were trying to mentally meme change into the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just meant sticking to video games in terms of your commentary. As they say in the world of literature, &quot;write what you know.&quot; Obviously you doubt the power of intention and the existence of a God. Doubt and knowledge are not the same. Doubt is intrinsic to faith (as we are more prone to question ideas which we hold important), so I would argue that you are on the right track in that sense. Just try not to fulfill the vision of ignorance - &quot;people who ridicule that which they cannot understand.&quot; You are certainly entitled to your own beliefs, but try to recognize them as such; likewise, try to respect the beliefs of others - and recognize that they are only beliefs.</p>

<p>The clown-baby thing was just a reference to Dennis Reynolds, in homage to the OP. In case you didn&#39;t know, clown-baby was the fighting name that the gang gave to Charlie (in It&#39;s Always Sunny).</p>

<p>Anyway, here&#39;s hoping that you recognize your own experience as being dynamic, rather than a static process. Your tone suggests that you are between 14 and 25 years of age - I promise you that our perceptions change as we age. I encourage you to be open to that. Peace!</p>

<p>Disagree. modern religion has numbed peoples minds and is truly one of the biggest problems of our time. I will not respect people who legit think they can change the world by asking some imaginary being to change things for them. It is absurd. Change starts with you, not with some imaginary man in the sky. You want to help bust pizzagate? Start to help investigating. </p>

<p>Imagine all the private investigators looking into pizzagate just prayed for human trafficking to end? How do you think that would go over?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, though I understand your point. As a person who has already lost 3 TWTR accts to PG nonsense, I do agree that the pedos want us using the least effective means possible to affect change. Still, the powers of individual and (especially) collective human intent (regardless of your cosmology) have been scientifically proven to be more effective than will alone. If you have ever competed in any sport at a higher level, then you are probably already acquainted with the concept of visualization. The shit works in some mystical way that I cannot explain. It is an important part of the training process for athletes.</p>

<p>&quot;Scientism,&quot; or the idea that our modern concepts of science are the building blocks of reality is an incredibly flawed paradigm. First off, there is really very little that is actually <em>known</em> about Earth and its history. Consensus does not equal reality, as shown through the struggles of Galileo and Copernicus. It is merely a &quot;common knowledge&quot; that is used to ridicule those who hold different ideas. The experiential and emergent natures of reality dictate that <em>all</em> theories will eventually be disproved, as understanding of the universe continues to evolve. I argue that the tenets of quantum theory necessitate the existence of some greater consciousness, or some recognition about the powers of observation (and intention) upon reality. Some examples of this include the wave-particle paradox of light, the theory of quantum entanglement, as well as the old quantum axiom that &quot;nothing exists until it is observed.&quot;</p>

<p>Another thing that must be noted, particularly with regards to &quot;scientism,&quot; is that your views are <em>exactly</em> what the old-money Rothschild crew has been trying to sell to the Western public for almost a century now. As sensible as the theory of human evolution may seem at first glance, I do not know of a single &quot;missing link&quot; that is constituted of more than 33% of a complete skeleton. This is a big detail. We have <em>complete</em> skeletons from creatures millions of years ago, but not a single (complete) one to support the human evolution theory??? Add to this the question of genetics; how did great apes evolve forward through time and <em>lose</em> genetic material??? Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, while the great apes have 24. Further, the &quot;science&quot; of evolution does little to explain the emergence of language within humanity (and its absence within the rest of the animal kingdom).</p>

<p>Anyhow, my whole point is that true skepticism leaves us with many more questions than truths. I would encourage you to adopt a questioning attitude, rather than the &quot;scientism,&quot; which is essentially a concenus-based system which is no more based in reality than any religion in operation today. That feeds power to the elite&#39;s institutions and their monopoly on information. Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Couldn&#39;t agree more. I just think the fallacy in poking fun of the meditation/prayer idea is that you&#39;re making an assumption those who are participating aren&#39;t already participating in investigating, red pilling, and overall word-of-mouth awareness. </p>

<p>When something like meditation, or even prayer can help the mind on a personal level, it&#39;s not necessarily a bad practice, especially for those heavily involved in investigating some of the stuff implicated in Pedogate. I know I&#39;ve had to take breaks just because it can be an overwhelming and frustrating item to investigate. </p>

<p>Keep an open mind, allow people to do what can help them on a personal and collective level. That is all that I ask. Instigating against a 25 minute collective movement isn&#39;t very productive, but I can also understand why you disagree with it&#39;s ability to &quot;produce results&quot; as it relates to criminals being brought to justice.</p>

Now I&#39;m not trying to guilt you; if you at least hope that justice is brought to these criminals that would be more than enough. You don&#39;t need to sit or wash your mind of thought.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes synchronized meditation is at 11:11am on Saturday. Here is how it is done.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>STEP 1: Go into a quite place and relax for a few minutes. </p></li>
<li><p>STEP 2: Clear your mind of all distractions.</p></li>
<li><p>STEP 3: Through your mind&#39;s eye using your imagination picture John Podesta being arrested. Picture him in hand cuffs and being led away to a police car wearing a bullet proof vest.</p></li>
<li><p>STEP 4: Hold the scene for a few minutes and then draw another picture. This time envision John Podesta wearing an orange jumpsuit and standing in court before a judge.</p></li>
<li><p>STEP 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 this time with James Alefantis, Anthony Weiner, and Hillary Clinton.</p></li>
<li><p>STEP 6: View through your minds eye Comet Ping Pong Pizza closed down and surrounded with police tape. Police are carrying computers and other evidence out in boxes.</p></li>
<li><p>STEP 7: Picture Televisions and news papers carrying these stories. Coverage is around the clock and the nation is in shock.</p></li>
<li><p>STEP 8: Finally calm yourself and clear away all images thus ending the meditation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If enough people do this and picture these events in their minds then it will manifest itself in our reality. This is the power of co-creation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks to the OP for reposting this. </p>

<p>Working with with Mageant (the OP of the original thread) I created  <a href="http://meditatechange.net/2-25-2017">MeditateChange.net</a> to coordinate this event. We have a guided meditation video for tomorrow now posted.</p>

<p>If you have Facebook please follow the event <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/384820181885898/">here</a>. It will help us track numbers. Like our page and follow (see first) to keep up with upcoming news and meditations.</p>

<p>We need your help. If you can, please spread the word far and wide. Facebook groups, Twitter, comment sections, other reddit subs, etc. If people can reach out to David Seaman and other influential social media people that&#39;d be amazing. I&#39;d love to try and get David Wilcock to pick us up. </p>

<p>Thank you friends. Let&#39;s make a difference :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got a yoga class tomorrow which includes a period of meditation, just to confirm OP how do u propose we &quot;meditate&quot; exactly, meditation as I understand it is to clear your mind, so meditating on pizzagate now would u assume that it would be more affective with a clear mind or a focus on pedos being arrested, like picturing the biggest bust on live news?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I frequently meditate an I also believe in karma. I know regardless of what happens these people will get exactly what they deserve. Additionally you and  I may never see that and it&#39;s okay. What we as people need to do is realize you cannot rely on someone else to arrest these people. The judges, the cops, everyone level is involved. I am not being critical of the meditation I will be meditating but I am not asking the supreme soul for anything instead asking what I&#39;ll be mediating on what I can do to make a difference. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you so much for posting this over on this side of the pond..... it is so beautiful to see all of (((us))) together bound by our unwavering demand of justice for the innocent victims of pizzagate and judgement for those who did and do them harm..</p>

<p>really, has it ever been seen before?</p>

<p>non-christian, christian, judaism, kekism, atheism, agnosticism, theists, deists, the undecided, the disinterested........ </p>

<p>i&#39;d wager that never before has the world known this type of unity and one-accord voice crying out for justice judgement and liberty from every corner of difference to meet in the middle +for the children and +for truth..</p>

<p>we are so strong in our one voice.</p>

<p>And here&#39;s the copy paste</p>

<p>I am organizing a synchronized mass meditation/prayer for the mass arrests of the DC pedophiles (see pizagate). This will happen on Saturday February 25th 11:11am - 11:33am (22 minutes) EST (16:11 UTC). Visualize the criminals being arrested leading to fair and public trials. The intention should not be for revenge but for saving the children and the healing of humanity.</p>

<p>If you are unsure about what effect this can have please read about the science that proves the power of the mind:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is almost exactly the same thing wiccians and other pagans do. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying not to, at all.We might disagree, but I can&#39;t say to not try to manifest a better world with less suffering. </p>

<p>It is borderline occult/magic/ritual though. As an anti theist watching the recent religious resurgence and actual witchunts brewing, I MUST point this out. </p>

<p>In that vein, try to remain positive, not negative. Think of a better future, not hatred. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>christian, checking in,</p>

<p>-miraculously freed from commitments at <em>exactly</em> 11:11
-so went into praying and crying to the Lord for all we need
-with no alarm set, raised head in conclusion at <em>exactly</em> 11:33</p>

<p>we are all stronger now in our united purpose to bring down global satanic elite crimes against the innocent little children of this world</p>

<p>now that we&#39;ve united with our voice of one-accord, time to <em>know</em> our voice has been heard by the one who answers our prayers/hopes/needs in our fight to bring down pizzagate giants.. we are david now</p>

<p>we&#39;re everyone... followers of Kek, followers of Christ, followers of None, followers of the Unknown, the Unsure, the Disenfranchised, the Disinterested.  Atheism, Judaism, Pacifism, Anarchism, Secularism, Scientists, Seekers, Believers.  The wealthy, the poor, the the people in between, shitposters, trashtalkers, heroes of free speech.. we&#39;re all standing as one in this.. one voice.. one purpose.</p>

<p>let&#39;s bring &#39;em down, people!</p>
