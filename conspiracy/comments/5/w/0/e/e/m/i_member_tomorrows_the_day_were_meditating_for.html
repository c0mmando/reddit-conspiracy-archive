       About a week ago I saw a post here organizing group meditation with the intention of pedophiles and Pizzgate-perpetrators being brought to justice. It's tomorrow, Saturday the 25th, in the morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       This idea of "power of intention" "mind over matter" stems from a belief that God isnt above us, he's inside of us, deep in our subconscious. It's a principle of Buddhism and Taoism and a number of other cultures, and makes more sense if you've researched the pineal gland and DMT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, real or not, accurate or not, tomorrow's the day were trying to mentally meme change into the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers

       I just meant sticking to video games in terms of your commentary. As they say in the world of literature, "write what you know." Obviously you doubt the power of intention and the existence of a God. Doubt and knowledge are not the same. Doubt is intrinsic to faith (as we are more prone to question ideas which we hold important), so I would argue that you are on the right track in that sense. Just try not to fulfill the vision of ignorance - "people who ridicule that which they cannot understand." You are certainly entitled to your own beliefs, but try to recognize them as such; likewise, try to respect the beliefs of others - and recognize that they are only beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The clown-baby thing was just a reference to Dennis Reynolds, in homage to the OP. In case you didn't know, clown-baby was the fighting name that the gang gave to Charlie (in It's Always Sunny).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, here's hoping that you recognize your own experience as being dynamic, rather than a static process. Your tone suggests that you are between 14 and 25 years of age - I promise you that our perceptions change as we age. I encourage you to be open to that. Peace!

       Disagree. modern religion has numbed peoples minds and is truly one of the biggest problems of our time. I will not respect people who legit think they can change the world by asking some imaginary being to change things for them. It is absurd. Change starts with you, not with some imaginary man in the sky. You want to help bust pizzagate? Start to help investigating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine all the private investigators looking into pizzagate just prayed for human trafficking to end? How do you think that would go over?

       I disagree, though I understand your point. As a person who has already lost 3 TWTR accts to PG nonsense, I do agree that the pedos want us using the least effective means possible to affect change. Still, the powers of individual and (especially) collective human intent (regardless of your cosmology) have been scientifically proven to be more effective than will alone. If you have ever competed in any sport at a higher level, then you are probably already acquainted with the concept of visualization. The shit works in some mystical way that I cannot explain. It is an important part of the training process for athletes.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Scientism," or the idea that our modern concepts of science are the building blocks of reality is an incredibly flawed paradigm. First off, there is really very little that is actually
       <em>
        known
       </em>
       about Earth and its history. Consensus does not equal reality, as shown through the struggles of Galileo and Copernicus. It is merely a "common knowledge" that is used to ridicule those who hold different ideas. The experiential and emergent natures of reality dictate that
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       theories will eventually be disproved, as understanding of the universe continues to evolve. I argue that the tenets of quantum theory necessitate the existence of some greater consciousness, or some recognition about the powers of observation (and intention) upon reality. Some examples of this include the wave-particle paradox of light, the theory of quantum entanglement, as well as the old quantum axiom that "nothing exists until it is observed."
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing that must be noted, particularly with regards to "scientism," is that your views are
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what the old-money Rothschild crew has been trying to sell to the Western public for almost a century now. As sensible as the theory of human evolution may seem at first glance, I do not know of a single "missing link" that is constituted of more than 33% of a complete skeleton. This is a big detail. We have
       <em>
        complete
       </em>
       skeletons from creatures millions of years ago, but not a single (complete) one to support the human evolution theory??? Add to this the question of genetics; how did great apes evolve forward through time and
       <em>
        lose
       </em>
       genetic material??? Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, while the great apes have 24. Further, the "science" of evolution does little to explain the emergence of language within humanity (and its absence within the rest of the animal kingdom).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, my whole point is that true skepticism leaves us with many more questions than truths. I would encourage you to adopt a questioning attitude, rather than the "scientism," which is essentially a concenus-based system which is no more based in reality than any religion in operation today. That feeds power to the elite's institutions and their monopoly on information. Cheers!

       That's quite the leap there from my comment. How do you figure i know how the universe operates?
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont know and neither do you. When there is even a smidget of evidence that suggests "thinking real hard" can change the physical world then i will reconsider. Until then have fun pretending to have superpowers.

       People can be into whatever they like. Doesn't mean I can't call out bullshit when I see it. I never once said people aren't allowed to pray. Pray all you want. Then when a bust happens you can feel like you made a contribution when the reality is you didn't do jack shit.

       I agree. Couldn't agree more. I just think the fallacy in poking fun of the meditation/prayer idea is that you're making an assumption those who are participating aren't already participating in investigating, red pilling, and overall word-of-mouth awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       When something like meditation, or even prayer can help the mind on a personal level, it's not necessarily a bad practice, especially for those heavily involved in investigating some of the stuff implicated in Pedogate. I know I've had to take breaks just because it can be an overwhelming and frustrating item to investigate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep an open mind, allow people to do what can help them on a personal and collective level. That is all that I ask. Instigating against a 25 minute collective movement isn't very productive, but I can also understand why you disagree with it's ability to "produce results" as it relates to criminals being brought to justice.

       Okay I don't necessarily think that this meditation stuff works. BUT that being said, what harm does it to try? I've been hoping and praying that Podesta all the way up to the R0ths child's (changes so that my comment doesn't get deleted, edited etc) get taken down. Now I'm not trying to guilt you; if you at least hope that justice is brought to these criminals that would be more than enough. You don't need to sit or wash your mind of thought. You just need hope, determination and that's more than enough.

       started fasting at noon specifically as an added fist in the air against the witches... who else thinks its uncanny they decide to promote this so hard after the meditation/prayer caught on?

       Yes synchronized meditation is at 11:11am on Saturday. Here is how it is done.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 1: Go into a quite place and relax for a few minutes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 2: Clear your mind of all distractions.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 3: Through your mind's eye using your imagination picture John Podesta being arrested. Picture him in hand cuffs and being led away to a police car wearing a bullet proof vest.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 4: Hold the scene for a few minutes and then draw another picture. This time envision John Podesta wearing an orange jumpsuit and standing in court before a judge.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 this time with James Alefantis, Anthony Weiner, and Hillary Clinton.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 6: View through your minds eye Comet Ping Pong Pizza closed down and surrounded with police tape. Police are carrying computers and other evidence out in boxes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 7: Picture Televisions and news papers carrying these stories. Coverage is around the clock and the nation is in shock.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         STEP 8: Finally calm yourself and clear away all images thus ending the meditation.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If enough people do this and picture these events in their minds then it will manifest itself in our reality. This is the power of co-creation.

       Step 9: Have a good late morning dump.  Clears away all issues, opens all the bowels to health and happiness.  Only then you are open to a medium rare steak and baked potato dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 10: Masturbate furiously.  Just because you are alive and human.

       Most meditation guides say never to eat meat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meat contains residual fear and suffering of the animal. When you eat meat you ingest that negative energy which is bad for the soul.

       These are lenses through which we view reality. Not something that we are. I recognize the importance of of the etherial. A hardline materialist denies their true potential.

       Notice the amount of backlash that has been unprecedented in posts such as this. I have seen many meditation posts here over the years and only have these recent ones been overly attacked and ridiculed. Hopefully it is because we juat have a larger userbase. Unfortunately I don't think the entirety of our user base is genuine in intent.

       it's because this operation is going to make a difference.. our global diversified unity.. our one voice for the truth +for the children.. shills and demons hate that stuff.. if they aren't upset tho, we aren't doing our part.

       Working with with Mageant (the OP of the original thread) I created

       to coordinate this event. We have a guided meditation video for tomorrow now posted.

       . It will help us track numbers. Like our page and follow (see first) to keep up with upcoming news and meditations.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need your help. If you can, please spread the word far and wide. Facebook groups, Twitter, comment sections, other reddit subs, etc. If people can reach out to David Seaman and other influential social media people that'd be amazing. I'd love to try and get David Wilcock to pick us up.

       I've got a yoga class tomorrow which includes a period of meditation, just to confirm OP how do u propose we "meditate" exactly, meditation as I understand it is to clear your mind, so meditating on pizzagate now would u assume that it would be more affective with a clear mind or a focus on pedos being arrested, like picturing the biggest bust on live news?

       I frequently meditate an I also believe in karma. I know regardless of what happens these people will get exactly what they deserve. Additionally you and  I may never see that and it's okay. What we as people need to do is realize you cannot rely on someone else to arrest these people. The judges, the cops, everyone level is involved. I am not being critical of the meditation I will be meditating but I am not asking the supreme soul for anything instead asking what I'll be mediating on what I can do to make a difference.

       My focus for the time we meditate will be on the children and the victims.   I will focus on the screaming from the infamous shower video.  The reason I choose this is because its visceral and not faked.  It's a kid being harmed and I want to focus on that in order to stop it.   I will play that video in my mind over and over and concentrate on the victim and the justice that will be served from that single moment in time.   It's powerful and thusly my thoughts about it will resonate as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a good person and I don't hurt people.   I'm almost 50 now and I've never hurt a human soul in a manner like that video.   My focus will be to stop those videos from happening and to ensure the people that make them are "seen".    That's all I care about.

       Same here. I didn't have the balls to watch those videos (there already is enough evidence for PG that I don't need to be further convinced anyway) so I will be taking the "picturing neocons in orange jumpsuits" route.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's important to remember however, that the main reason we're doing this is to stop the suffering of those children and not just to put a few hated neocons behind bars.

       You guys are forgetting that we also have to breathe in unison.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think and picture these images, but you have to also focus your attention on your breathing as you inhale and exhale. Think of the sensations of the air leaving and entering your lungs and nostrils. It will be difficult to keep your focus there, but your attention will slowly start to focus on the breathing, and you will settle into a comfortable rhythm.

       thank you so much for posting this over on this side of the pond..... it is so beautiful to see all of (((us))) together bound by our unwavering demand of justice for the innocent victims of pizzagate and judgement for those who did and do them harm..

       really, has it ever been seen before?

       we are so strong in our one voice.

       the haters and shills on this thread are reverting back to their old ways i see...
      </p>
      <p>
       what happened to all those deep-shill tactics from earlier this week?
      </p>
      <p>
       must be the fact that everyone who truly cares about the truth and hates that innocents are being destroyed, have now drawn together in unity over this.. haters just hate that so much..

      <p>
       getting easier to tell these days who is on which side of that thin, red line.

       That "gibberish" is scientific studies that confirm that group meditation can positively change reality.

       If you truly think a bunch of scientific studies is "gibberish" then nothing will convince you otherwise.

       It's kind of amusing, in an "I can imagine people thinking this" sort of way, but when you think about it as groups of people placidly sitting around trying to think about a brighter future
       <em>
        without taking action to achieve it
       </em>
       , you start to wonder if these sideshows are nothing but "bread" and circuses for the people.

       And here's the copy paste
      </p>
      <p>
       I am organizing a synchronized mass meditation/prayer for the mass arrests of the DC pedophiles (see pizagate). This will happen on Saturday February 25th 11:11am - 11:33am (22 minutes) EST (16:11 UTC). Visualize the criminals being arrested leading to fair and public trials. The intention should not be for revenge but for saving the children and the healing of humanity.

       This is almost exactly the same thing wiccians and other pagans do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying not to, at all.We might disagree, but I can't say to not try to manifest a better world with less suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is borderline occult/magic/ritual though. As an anti theist watching the recent religious resurgence and actual witchunts brewing, I MUST point this out.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that vein, try to remain positive, not negative. Think of a better future, not hatred.

       we're everyone... followers of Kek, followers of Christ, followers of None, followers of the Unknown, the Unsure, the Disenfranchised, the Disinterested.  Atheism, Judaism, Pacifism, Anarchism, Secularism, Scientists, Seekers, Believers.  The wealthy, the poor, the the people in between, shitposters, trashtalkers, heroes of free speech.. we're all standing as one in this.. one voice.. one purpose.
