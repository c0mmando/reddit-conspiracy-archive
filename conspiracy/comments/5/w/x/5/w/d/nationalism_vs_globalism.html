       Has this been the only real conflict all along? Has every war been secretly fought to further a global government, or to destroy a nationalist leader standing in its way, or to accomplish both at once? Has every leader praised by history those that worked towards Globalism and every leader demonized those who pursued Nationalist interests? Is this the simple key to understanding modern world history up to the most current events of today?

       Yeah, sorta.  Those two -isms are control mechanisms used to divide and conquer.  Too much of either one is destructive.  People are waking up and realizing this, and starting to notice the 3rd pillar that uses both of these isms to control the world.  They don't care if the world is global or national, they'll figure out a way to manipulate both situations.  The real conflict is control vs. freedom, or perhaps order vs. chaos.     That said I can totally see that the globalist agenda has been pushed way too far, and the nationalist one is reactionary, and seems very necessary to fight back against the globalist control.

       Globalism is a form of nationalism. It's merely Nationalism combined with manifest destiny, crony capitalism, and colonialism. Hitler's third reich was much more a "Globalist" pursuit than a nationalist one. The opposite of globalism is anarchism/libertarianism, not nationalism. Similarly, the opposite of nationalism is also anarchism/libertarianism.

       Good comment and discussion point.  I can sort of see how anarchism/libertarianism can be considered opposing ideologies, just not realistic and/or maybe too individualistic to actually serve as useful opposition to globalism/nationalism.   People will want to instinctively unite and form tribes, government, armies, etc.  in order to conquer and control others for their own benefit.   People are just like that, trapped in that domination mindset.   Anarchists, libertarians, and individualists will always be conquered because the tribe will always win over the individual, at least they always have throughout history.    I think we need to figure out a more effective way to combat the controlling forces, not sure if those ideologies will do it.

       If we are going to defeat them, we must unite behind all of the things they collectively oppose: liberty, equality, and non-authoritarianism.

       yeah, ok.  Liberty and anti-authoritarianism I can get behind.  Equality not so much, as it's currently being used as an authoritarian weapon.  People aren't naturally "equal", and trying to enforce equality (including notions of equal opportunity, equal rights, etc.) requires government, administration, law, which means authoritarianism.  Maybe you can help me think through that problem, I appreciate your responses.

       Let me rephrase:  who will make sure there are equal rights and protections?  Who will make sure people do not form their own tribes/groups that engage in favoritism for their own group benefit?

       It doesn't sound like what you propose is at all possible if you actually do value liberty, free will, anti-authoritarianism, freedom of association, sovereignty, etc.

       There's plenty of hypothetical solutions for handling the logistics, but an updated version of the Bill of Rights, with "do no harm" and "liberty" as its guiding principles would have to be at the core of it.

       I have trouble imagining anything other "authoritarian government" being able to "handle the logistics."

       I want to agree, and mostly agree with these, but the terms are so subjective in regards to "Rights," and are already interpreted in different ways and are used as weapons. For example: pathological altruism.  People who want to "provide civil rights" to particular group by overzealously trying to help them end up hurting themselves, or hurting their own in-group.

       Well, from my perspective, defining the eventual structure is counter-productive, because it creates division from the get-go based on hypotheticals. What's more important is identifying that neither side currently embroiled in the battle for political supremacy has our (and by our I mean just about every American's) best interests at heart. Helping either of them hurts all of us, so we are best served by weakening and exposing them both as they attack each other.

       The ultimate source of the great conflict in the world is spiritual.  It's Satan vs the Heavenly Father.  And it's the children of the Heavenly Father (Adam and the Israelites, NOT the "jews") vs the children of Satan (ie, the "jews").
      </p>
      <p>
       The drive for a totalitarian one-world government is Satan's plan -- as prophesied in the books of the Bible, especially the books of Daniel and Revelation.   And it is ethnic jews leading this globalist "New World Order" conspiracy -- running the Illuminati, the communist movement, international banking, Freemasonry, Hollywood, the Establishment media, etc.

       I would argue that the EU is doomed at worst, already showing signs of failure at best.  It's a perfect example of globalist one-world-government gone wrong, and why we should never have such a consolidation of power.   It's good thing the countries are able to opt-out peacefully.

       Freemasonry is controlled by jews.   The religion of 'Judaism', codified in the Babylonian Talmud and the Kabbalah, forms the basis for the doctrines, rituals, and symbols of Masonry. The secret god of both Freemasonry and Judaism is Satan/Lucifer.

       That actually goes back to the Venetians. Again, not "The Jews" exclusively. Look at the history of the Black Guelphs, and how they transitioned into England and the House of Orange in Holland.

       To deny the obvious fact that jews control Hollywood (or international banking) is utterly ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only part of your comment I partially agree with is statement about the Khazars.  The people calling themsleves "jews" are NOT the real descendants of the Israelites.  They descend from the Khazars, Edomites (Esau), and Canaanites.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true biological descendants of the Israelites are the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, and kindred European peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that you find these Khazars/Edomites (who call themselves "jews") in power everywhere and leading the NWO conspiracy.

       As I alluded to in the comments to this post, the religion of Judaism is Satanism.  The jews are a "synagogue of Satan" (Revelation 2:9).  The jews have been given a Satanic "battle plan" for world domination.  They have "super human" intelligence helping them.  That doesn't mean they are invincible.  They are not.

       Yes.  The jews are actually literal children of Satan.  That sounds like hyperbole.  But it's supported by the Biblical text.  In Genesis 3:15, the Creator talks about Satan having "seed" or offspring in the earth.

       I have seen evidence that the Khazars are descended from the Edomites (Esau, who married Canaanites).  Not all jews are descended from the Khazars (only the Ashkenazi jews, or about 90-95% of jews).  The other 5-10% of jews are the Sephardic jews, who descend from the Edomites.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is significant because the Edomites are descended from Canaanites (including the Amalekites, etc).  The Heavenly Father commanded the Israelites to completely exterminate these Canaanite tribes before entering the promised land.  The reason was because these people are inherently evil.  They are of a Satanic bloodline, ultimately going back to Cain, who was the son of Satan.

       No problem.  And here is another good article (by same author) on the ancestry of the jews:
       <a href="https://israelect.com/ChurchOfTrueIsrael/comparet/who-are-jews.html">
        https://israelect.com/ChurchOfTrueIsrael/comparet/who-are-jews.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another amazing (and hugely important) fact is that the true descendants of the Israelites are the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, and kindred European peoples.  The reason that the elite jews (pushing the Marxist and globalist/NWO agendas) are trying to annihilate the white/Eruopean peoples is because it is a Satanic agenda to try to destroy the TRUE "chosen people of God".

       It's certain that you can't deny that the media and large swaths of western government are run by "jews" or people that have labeled themselves jews. There's overlap where real actual jews are also part of the same cabal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that when most people say (or any variation thereof), "it's the jews", they are referring to these self-labeled jews, not true-blood jews. Real semites. People like those in Naturei Karta. It's good that you make the distinction though.

       Did you read the article I cited earlier?  I already know that Freemasonry is a jewish creation.  It's not Freemasons who are at the top of the ruling hierarchy.  They are just one front group and tool of the rulers at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what Albert Pike said about the origins of Freemasonary (and the Illuminati):
      </p>
      <p>
       "All truly dogmatic religions have issued from the Kabalah and return to it; everything scientific and grand in the religious dreams of all the Illuminati, Jacob Boeheme, Swedenborg, Saint Martin, and others, is borrowed from the Kabalah: all Masonic associations owe to it their Secrets and their Symbols." (Morals and Dogma, p 744)

       What this guy's talking about goes wayyyyyyyy further back than "the British", lonnnnng before Freemasonry.  I mean, it's even in biblical passages like Revelations 3:9  (I'm not even Christian btw):

       Yeah. The British are the head of Mystery Babylon right now. Remember Daniel's vision of the 4 kingdoms? The final kingdom is Rome. It dies, and later is revived, and it looks like the British Empire is what Daniel was referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The British are basically Roman Collegia, that went to Venice (Black Guelphs), then England and the Netherlands (House of Orange).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's even Red Dragons (like the one in Revelation) on a lot of heraldry. The Welsh flag, the King Arthur legend, lots of red dragons.

        While nationalism might not be the final frontier for the current tide of populism, it seems that it may be the first step in ridding the world of the disease called globalism. Maybe once the world returns to national sovereignty, it will then further decentralize power within each nation’s border. It’s hard to say what the ideal size for a social system would be, but it does seem that one international system of politics and law is far too standardized to meet the diverse needs of the planet. Plus, it delegates far too much power to a very small group of individuals, which can be incredibly dangerous.

       I think the two are intertwined. What happens when a nationalist wins and sustains it? They then want to go global. Its really just about power.

       What are the signs of failure?

       I'll just be honest and say that I don't think there's some NWO conspiracy or a TBTB, kind of thing, and I also think it's impossible for a One World Government based on my travels and experiences.
