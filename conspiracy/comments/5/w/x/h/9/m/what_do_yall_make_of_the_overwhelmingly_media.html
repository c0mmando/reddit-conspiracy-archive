       Pretty much every media outlet and every talking head (with a few exceptions) have lauded President Trump's speech last night...everyone from Van Jones to Katy Tur to Scott Pelley...everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you make of all this? I'm fairly surprised, as Trump's positions haven't changed, only his rhetoric. The universal positive reaction kind of creeps me out, to be honest...

       im implying rhetoric is a powerful tool that makes any message acceptable, especially in group think situations. Jury is still out on genocide for me.

       Once again, America has shown that they are still willing to sit dreamy-eyed and be wooed by a carefully crafted speech, written by a political propagandist.

      <p>
       The speech was filled with platitudes and self-contradictory statements.

       You know what this probably means though? The war for minds during the election was fought in the_donald. It has since been co-opted. The attention of free thinkers and those that like to live outside the narrative being pushed have since migrated here. So, I imagine we are next up for a mod shuffle. At which time, I wonder where we go?

       I don't know, I think it's good to keep traction on 9/11 and I think that people like yourself (of which there a quite a few) won't allow tunnel vision to set in. That's what makes this sub great.

       JFK and 9/11 thats what they want us beating the drum on. Has anyone else seen an increase of 9/11 posts? I know the U. of Alaska released a review of the collapse of WTC7, but 9/11 seemed to literally be every 3rd post

       Not even close, it has been remarked on a great deal. Someone is going to great lengths to blow smoke and rainbows up our asses. I don't think anyone is sure why though. Some think it is to bury PG, but I don't know.

       I think they did it to try to gather in some of us that don't trust the media one bit. They tell us what we want to hear for awhile, get us nodding along to what they say again, and then they turn the boat back to the narrative they really want us to believe.
      </p>

       They are trying to recapture our minds so they can manipulate us again.

       Feels like either a ceasefire was arranged between Trump and the press... or the press realized that the jig is up and they need to cater their reports to the winning side... cause the losers won't stop losing.

       Just like the election their internal polling probably shows that the public feels that the press is being unfair to Trump. They are probably trying to save what is left of their audience.

       I'm not sure what is up... 2 days ago I saw a poll on MSNBC that said that 100% of Republicans believed the wall wouldn't stop any illegal drugs from coming into America... 100%... such obvious horseshit. I expected CNN to pull a similar stunt last night with their polls... bust out laughing when I saw the numbers they reported... Overwhelmingly positive about Trump, his speech and they direction he wants USA to head in. I dunno what happened... I feel like the lying took it's toll on the newscasters... some of the big named guys have been looking like newscasters from 1989 Batman when Smilex precursors were in the wild... fuckin' haggard.

       I have no idea what media you are watching - virtually the entire mainstream media is calling Trump "racist" because of his remarks on illegal immigration.

      <p>
       They are even comparing him to ... wait for it ... THE NAZIS.

       Isn't he also sidelining/firing people the msm don't like? Reading this makes me think maybe he cut a deal with them and is now reshuffling his cabinet/shadow cabinet accordingly.

       You will know we have a legitimate government again when a plausible explanation of the JFK coup and 911 are presented along with arrests for treason. There is malicious entity controlling the US and Trump is no different than Lyndon Johnson or any other politician that doesn't demand our government be returned to a democratic republic. Cynthia McKinney is the only politician I have any respect for at all. Glen Greenwald may be the only msm pundit with an opinion worth listening to. The energy corporations owners and the central bank owners have all the governments and medias under their control. We are kept penniless except for money they own or bitcoin and our votes count for nothing. May as well face it and demand better. Call bullshit as loudly as you can.

       IDK, MSNBC was completely trashing the speech. They made all kinds of excuses as to why the speech was bad. Bill Maher, some lady comedian, and Chuck Shumer showed up as guests to trash it. They couldn't find anything in particular to trash Donald on so they just made stuff up.

       When Van Jones the Soros puppet says something positive about Trump it has me wondering if they struck a deal.  The questions asked in Press Briefings will let us know.
