<p>What do you make of all this? I&#39;m fairly surprised, as Trump&#39;s positions haven&#39;t changed, only his rhetoric. The universal positive reaction kind of creeps me out, to be honest...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what this probably means though? The war for minds during the election was fought in the_donald. It has since been co-opted. The attention of free thinkers and those that like to live outside the narrative being pushed have since migrated here. So, I imagine we are next up for a mod shuffle.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what is up... 2 days ago I saw a poll on MSNBC that said that 100% of Republicans believed the wall wouldn&#39;t stop any illegal drugs from coming into America... 100%... such obvious horseshit. I expected CNN to pull a similar stunt last night with their polls... bust out laughing when I saw the numbers they reported... Overwhelmingly positive about Trump, his speech and they direction he wants USA to head in. I dunno what happened... I feel like the lying took it&#39;s toll on the newscasters... some of the big named guys have been looking like newscasters from 1989 Batman when Smilex precursors were in the wild... fuckin&#39; haggard. </p>

Cynthia McKinney is the only politician I have any respect for at all. Glen Greenwald may be the only msm pundit with an opinion worth listening to. The energy corporations owners and the central bank owners have all the governments and medias under their control.
