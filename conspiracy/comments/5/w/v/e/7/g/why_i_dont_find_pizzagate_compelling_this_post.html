        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">13</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-03-01 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/VirulentThoughts.html">VirulentThoughts</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this. I doubt many pizzagate truthers are going to be swayed by my argument, but I hope to at least generate some more critical discussion about the subject.</p>

<p>This is the thing that has always frightened me most about Pizzagate:</p>

<p>At this point Pizzagate has become a combination of Arthur Miller&#39;s &quot;The Crucible&quot; and &quot;Iran Contra&quot;.</p>

<p>We know for a fact that the government maintains contracts with companies like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/02/foreign-contractors-hired-dancing-boys">Dyncorp</a>, who have been caught engaging in human trafficking in the past. The government perception on what constitutes punishment for that crime does NOT align with how the public feels about the issue, but the outrage doesn&#39;t sustain itself.</p>

<p>Dyncorp is an <a href="http://www.contractormisconduct.org/contractors/59/dyncorp-international-inc">open secret.</a> There are <a href="http://www.contractormisconduct.org/">plenty</a> of them out there. This story enveloped it in order to gain legitimacy.</p>

<p>Trafficking through orphanages is also an open secret. Anyone who has ever done a search on best practices for adopting a child KNOWS that there is a market for young children through second <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1">adoptions.</a> The practice of <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/09/11/221373061/series-reveals-underground-market-for-re-homing-adoptees">rehoming</a> children for money has been talked about in the media previously.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is enveloping that as well.</p>

<p>We also <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/turkey-motion-protecting-child-marriage-draws-debate-161118124734306.html">ally</a> with and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11217772">occupy</a> states who have practices that Western culture finds abhorrent. That&#39;s part of foreign policy decision making that most people don&#39;t want too look at. The sausage part where we mix together strategic and moral grey areas.</p>

<p>Not least of all, there is the convenient temporal alignment of Inauguration Day and the end of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5udzlh/january_was_national_human_trafficking_awareness/ddtc3wp/">National Human Trafficking Awareness Month</a> and it can be spun to look like Trump is immediately cleaning up the low level street scum of Pizzagate by pounding the propaganda outlets with stories of these arrests to support them.</p>

<p>At this point, people are willing to ignore the fact that news about ALL of these problems has been there, in the mainstream media, throughout ALL of this in order to feel morally superior to a political opponent over a witch hunt.</p>

<p>And now, a skilled propagandist can turn this outrage into justification for a political purge to make McCarthyism look tame. I am waiting for a <a href="http://time.com/4558127/turkey-erdogan-crackdown-kurdish-coup/">mass arrest</a> to happen, and a collection of &quot;physical evidence&quot; to suddenly manifest itself in support of the claims, despite no hard evidence after 5 months of internet sleuths digging.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be duped by people repackaging scandals to better fit their brand. All of these questionable elements of American society are exposed to people who are willing to look at them and they don&#39;t require a conspiracy in the government and media to accomplish. The media has been telling you these stories for years and you ignored them until they aligned with your politics.</p>

<p>I disagree that that is what you are saying.</p>

<p>What you are saying, and have been saying for months, is that you are in favor of investigating one particular group of people for human trafficking because you have a political grudge against members of that group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s primarily the statement of the handkerchief being &quot;containing a pizza related map&quot; that sets off the alarm bells. A map printed on a handkerchief? Sure, that makes sense in an odd design kind of way. Or maybe printed on a serviette? Sure! A pizza on a handkerchief? Sure!  </p>

<p>But... a pizza-map? Wtf? </p>

<p>Also, unless is has Gucci or something printed on the label, why would the realtor even bother calling Podesta, or why mention the map in the first place? <em>&quot;Hey John.. you forgot your handkerchief? Want it back?&quot;</em> </p>

<p>The pizza-related map statement (I think) is pretty much what started the whole pizzagate/pedogate thing in the first place. Ergo the name pizzagate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I guess I can see it that way.</p>

<p>One could argue though that Podesta is (or was) a high level VIP, powerful person. The owner of the restaurant may be trying to garner favour with him, by going out of their way to give him his handkerchief back, just like really good customer service? I know if I ran a pizza shop where Millionaires ate regularly I would go out of my way to keep their custom.</p>

<p>The pizza-mapkerchief led peeps to look at Podesta, then Comet Ping-Pong, then the instagrams, then Tony Podesta, and on and on and on. The trail has led so far away from Comet Ping Pong that CPP is literally a distraction to the greater issue.</p>

<p>Even if we all ignore all of our own personal confirmation biases (or at least try to) there is so many hinky connections with these people the handkerchief eventually becomes meaningless evidence because everything else is so overwhelming. </p>

<p>It&#39;s because people start blaming &quot;Trumpets&quot; and Pizzagate believers in their titles. Or in their post.</p>

<p>If your post is good and has meaningful content, it will be upvoted and make the front page. If your post is already crying about downvotes before you even submit it, then I&#39;ll just downvote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.</p>

<p>When pizzagate started, it was about finding evidence about a very specific group of people engaged in a specific activity.</p>

<p>When the evidence to support that hypothesis didn&#39;t materialize, pizzagate mutated and grew, instead of dying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this speaks to @OPs post:  You <strong>wanted</strong> to ignore the evidence that those specific groups were unrelated to these charges, and were willing to believe the &quot;guilt by suspicion&quot; of the fictional story.</p>

<p>This is what is meant by &quot;cognisant dissonance&quot;:  you intellectually knew that the charges against these specific people were unreasonable, but <strong>wanted</strong> them to be true because of your cultural distrust and hatred for them and the groups they represent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This! Thank you! I am an activist survivor of child abuse and somehow I felt extreme distaste for the entire PG &quot;investigation&quot;. As if child abuse could be a partisan activity! I never liked Hillary but the licentious glee with which people pursued their &quot;clues&quot; sickened me. Accusing everyone who asked for evidence of victims (or any concrete evidence at all) of participating in the conspiracy! Now, Trump is being given credit for investigations that began long before he ascended to Presidency. Clearly, no one was interested enough in the possible children at risk to investigate it in a way that didn&#39;t alert the &quot;criminals.&quot; Great effort was made to tie political and social enemies to the scandal with no regard to possible consequences of a possible investigation being disrupted. Of course their is pedophilia among the elite- depravity knows no class distinctions. But as we see in Hollywood, D.C., and even English aristocracy, these cases are notoriously difficult to prosecute. Look what happened with Jeff Epstein. Protecting the victims had much less importance than pursuing the criminals, like someone more interested in revenge than protection and justice. As it was all focused on one political party, I never, ever felt any relief or hope that the world was waking up to the reality of what children suffer. It was all like those elaborate online puzzles people play deciphering clues and could bear no fruit for an actual investigation. No one has ever been convicted in this manner. </p>
