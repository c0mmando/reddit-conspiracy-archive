        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off, please don&#39;t bother with, &quot;see a doctor&quot;, &quot;you&#39;re schizo&quot;, and on and on. No, I&#39;m not. I&#39;ve been to two psychiatrists and both say I&#39;m cool, so none of that trolling please. </p>

<p>This is a follow up from this thread: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5wcdqx/so_if_i_know_or_a_95_sure_that_the_ciansa_are/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5wcdqx/so_if_i_know_or_a_95_sure_that_the_ciansa_are/</a> </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take the events of yesterday as an example, and I&#39;ll make this it&#39;s own post. These are just the kind of &quot;average weird&quot; events anymore in these days while I await my passport to arrive so I can leave this nation, and if it&#39;s blocked again, it&#39;s going to end badly for a lot of evil folks:</p>

<p>I wake up to my normal bad dreams.</p>

<p>See my wife of 16 years off to work, the one I can no longer trust as I&#39;ve caught her doing suspicious things several times... strange.</p>

<p>I get ready for the day while the little &quot;click&quot; sounds, verified by others, attempt to control/taunt/fuck with me. I&#39;ve found a few of the devices that make these sounds, and when I did, the clicks from those areas stopped. Little metal things, and when measuring the areas the sounds come from, very strong magnetic waves are found. </p>

<p>I check my bank, broke as a joke as they&#39;ve destroyed my business spreading vicious rumor to all clients and so on. </p>

<p>I check my email, oh look, one of the assholes who I know is a part of it, is trying to rope me in on some money making scam project, no. The tiny balls on this fucker, who has no past, seems to be in with the CIA or the NSA, is trying to fuck with me again. When I met him and his buddies a few years back, is when all the weird shit started in my life.</p>

<p>At 11:30am est., I take my dog out for a walk to the store, it&#39;s about four or five normal blocks away.</p>

<p>There is an abnormal amount of traffic around my house for this time of day, foot and vehicle.</p>

<p>On the corner of my block is a woman with a baby stroller. Across the small road is a man cutting down a large tree. Now, I&#39;m not sure about you, but if someone were having massive limbs falling to the ground, I&#39;d keep my baby away from the tree more than 10 yards or so... she waves to some trucks passing by.</p>

<p>I keep my dog in the middle of the road, away from weird lady, and falling trees, and go to the next corner where I see cars full of people in brand new construction outfits, and three women on the opposite corner, in brand new construction outfits, all around middle age&#39;ish, all too pretty to be construction workers, and there isn&#39;t any major construction going on around us. These women have their phones out, laughing, having fun, taking photos or video of me.... okay... welp, just another god damn day in the twilight zone. If I hadn&#39;t had my dog with me, I would have ran over there and started stabbing. See, I&#39;ve reached a level of no fucks where I have more of a thirst for their deaths, than I do for answers to &quot;who and why&quot;.</p>

<p>I continue down the road, cars, well, mostly minivans with &quot;construction worker moms&quot; passing me, most have little symbols on the back of their cars, on bumper or window stickers.</p>

<p>While going to the store I saw two Hispanic girls running up and down the road. Shouldn&#39;t they be in school? Strange, or maybe not.</p>

<p>I get to the store, get some food and whatever, and proceed back home. There are now loads of those minivans with &quot;white christian soccer mom types&quot; wearing brand new construction vests driving all around me, smiling at me, most vehicles with various symbols on the back. </p>

<p>I get in an alley way and a Hispanic man and his little dog are walking. I get &quot;that feeling&quot;, this guy is here for me, this isn&#39;t an organic situation, so I pull out my knife to kill him. He books it.</p>

<p>I am now at the park, almost home, a van full of people, all looking at me, are pulling in, and a young man behind me, holding some type of hoverboard looking thing (are those real now?) is behind me. I reach for my weapon, just in case. They all back off. I get home.</p>

<p>Later I go out to get some medicine. I leave the house, same corner where those ladies were taking a pic of me, a white jeep is driving by, guy in a brand new construction outfit sees my truck and talks into his collar. I give chase. Pit maneuver, and either go in for the kill, or beat him until he answers questions, is the plan. Too many innocents around me. He books it, drives frantically., strange, why is he so nervous of seemingly me? I&#39;m just driving behind him casually. It&#39;s because he knows he&#39;s fucked. He takes a very strange and out of the way route to a Chinese food restaurant where he quickly gets out and runs inside. Getting into a public place, smart, or it would have been his ass. I got a photo of the jeep and the license plate, as suggested by you folks.</p>

<p>I get back home, and the clicks start again, wife hears them too.</p>

<p>Welcome to a day in the horrible hell&#39;ish, life-destroying twilight zone I now call reality.</p>

<p>These events have been verified by my wife and others, and the devices found in my house, so, unless we&#39;re all crazy, and seeing the same things at the same time, than these events are real.</p>

<p>And, for the hundredth time, I&#39;ve already seen two doctors and both say I&#39;m normal mentally. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve stated you don&#39;t like your wife anymore, etc etc etc. If life is that much of a hell for you here, why not go into hiding?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am trying to move!!!!!! They keep blocking my passport! :(</p>

<p>Oh, I love my wife dearly, deeply, but the core trust is no longer there, and will never return, meaning the end of the marriage once I leave. It is extremely painful and I curse the CIA/NSA/LIEDOS with every fiber of my being. My hatred is pure, it fuels me, but I keep careful, am cautious.</p>

<p>Do you know that I have actually cried a few times recently? Me! Crying! Hahahahaha, how absurd, isn&#39;t it? First time since I was a child I believe. That&#39;s the type of pain, sorrow, and confusion they create in this world, and they need to be removed from this planet to improve our species, but that&#39;s a debate for another thread.</p>

<p>I have no money to move easily as you suggest. I literally am 15 days late on rent every time. It never used to be like this... it&#39;s so horrible, I&#39;m so sorry everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I lost my head I tell you man I was done with my gf my family. After 17 days of hospital stay I returned to the world and got back to my life. It was scary. You can repair the damage. You can get the trust back. Don&#39;t throw your life away because you lost your mind. You wife will wait for a bit but not forever please don&#39;t ruin your life. It will be something you cannot get back. Even tho it seems like your marriage or life is done your not yourself. Your head is playing tricks on you. No one is watching you. It&#39;s just you. And only you can make this better. I&#39;m not into god but damn bro you need serious GOD like help!</p>

<p>Metallic rods of incredible strength that shocked me when I put them into these magnetic fields. I don&#39;t know much about magnets, but didn&#39;t know that they could cause shock. </p>

<p>Other metallic things, like one was a battery for a motherboard, or something like that, strange too, as someone had installed in into my room, then painted over it. REALLY weird as the entire house just had a remodel before I moved in. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t fully understand it. Magnets, how do they work? ;)</p>

<p>Data involving the bizarre devices and metals I have found has a value, and I don&#39;t hold many cards as it is.</p>

<p>Heh, you know, it&#39;s funny when that heater repair man came over. I was chilling on the couch, being nice, but for some odd reason he was scared out of his mind. I haven&#39;t seen a person that terrified since helping that car accident victim a while back. Pin-point pupils, nervous as all hell. Strange.</p>

<p>I caught him looking for one of the devices I found and kind of hid away. There was no reason to look where he was, there was no &quot;panel&quot; in that place, heh. Oh, silly people, did you think that I was going to keep that there when a stranger was entering my home? Buahahahaha, while I&#39;m not Mr. Bond, or whatever, I&#39;m smart enough to foresee some of these... attempts and outwit them, sometimes. </p>

<p>That device is now being held by someone many miles away from me, with instructions upon my death.</p>

<p>I had to be very careful as I am constantly monitored. Heh, I&#39;m being monitored in ways that I never knew existed, or so I am guessing, tech that isn&#39;t available to the public, or so I kind of think, not 100% sure about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy again.  Listen to yourself dude. You&#39;re paranoid. Why, I say, WHY the hell would a 3 letter agency dedicate so much time, planning, resources, and man power dedicated to fucking with you?  You&#39;re not special. You don&#39;t have special powers or have insider information that &quot;they&quot; want to &quot;get&quot; you for.

    <div class="md"><p>Paranoia, sure, for defensive purposes.</p>

<p>Again, and boy it&#39;s annoying having to pound this into your guy&#39;s thick skulls, these events, many events, and devices are verified by other people too. Think about that, ffs people.</p>

<p>It is a very good question, one I&#39;ve pondered for a long ass time. Why would a three letter agency, you know, like the connection to the NSA server from my home network verified by Wireshark, and the CIA (supposedly) that has been mentioned to me by several people now, and whoever else, spend the god damn time, money, life-hours, resources and blah blah, to fuck with me, instead of doing whatever they are supposed to be doing.</p>

<p>Nope, I try to be as &quot;not special&quot; as possible for like 6 months now, hoping that they&#39;ll get bored, or whatever, and go away. Nope, they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I never claimed special powers or info, don&#39;t play that bullshit with me.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have an explanation. Maybe I pissed someone off long ago, and they have the money/power to just have me endlessly fucked with until my eventual suicide or w/e.</p>

<p>Listen, if no one else saw these things too, and the devices, and the docs said I was bonkers, I would have killed myself a long time ago to end the hell that would be from a warped mind. That isn&#39;t the case, there is still a small chance that I can escape this nation, unfortunately, and live a new normal life, so I keep going, but I&#39;m exhausted from it, and now would be very happy to see them dead, if that&#39;s how this has to end.</p>

<p>I guess we&#39;ll see! It will be best if I get the mother fucking passport, quickly. It&#39;s already a week late.</p>

<p>Hey, if I do end up a dead mother fucker, I&#39;m taking out at least three with me. Your people, if you are in on this, Mr. Botted account, know the score.

<p>I plan on moving to another country ASAP. Funny that, my passport was denied the first time due to some warrant that didn&#39;t exist.

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, shitty web code, and some code to speak to satellites, nothing amazing.</p>

<p>A couple of video games.</p>

<p>Some AI hackery shit in my youth.</p>

<p>Nothing amazing, I never applied myself enough, normally out of boredom and laziness. :\</p>

<p>Yes, I appreciate the help. I have tried many paths of thought, everything from the far out there, like I died in that car crash in PA, and I&#39;m in a &quot;minimum&quot; version of hell, though I wouldn&#39;t think I&#39;d go to hell! Who knows though, maybe some uptight assholes are running &quot;the show&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve thought that maybe it was the Bush Jr face on the monkey ass thing in the video game that thousands played and never caught. (lul) So they found out and put me on the shit list.</p>

<p>Maybe I said something on the web that I cannot even recall and it was so bad that &quot;they&quot; put me on the shit list. (Doubtful though, yeah I&#39;ll open my big flap, but within reason, though less so lately with all of this lack of fucks being given now.)</p>

<p>Maybe it could have been some of the drugs from back in the day, but I never sold or made them, just personal &quot;responsible&quot; usage as I&#39;m not a fan of alcohol. Seems pretty god damn stupid though.</p>

<p>Maybe some of the places I shouldn&#39;t have seen while visiting parts of the web I probably shouldn&#39;t have been on, though I wiped my computers. (Freaked me out majorly.)</p>

<p>This stuff all happened <strong>FOREVER</strong> ago, like two plus years ago. Why keep bothering me? lol, it&#39;s fucking stupid.</p>

<p>BTW, they are incompetent. Shockingly stupid at times, and other times, quite clever indeed. I cannot win as I am only one man, one brain, with no money, now no family (thanks to them), and no connections (again, they had a big hand in that one). Sooooo why keep after me? What&#39;s the goal? No, I&#39;m not going to kill myself when I know I have an enemy to destroy. You fuckers are just going to have to man up and blow my brains out already, or it&#39;s going to get real nasty here right quick, <strong>OR</strong> give me that passport and I&#39;ll be on my way. </p>

<p>I have been extremely cautious not to have innocent people hurt, though they don&#39;t seem to care. During the car chase the other night (yeah, a thing that happens now), I let off once they got to a populated area. I will not attack them with a weapon unless I am extremely sure that &quot;something isn&#39;t right&quot; and they&#39;re paying too much attention to me, in a place where they shouldn&#39;t be. Strange thing is that a lot of these idiots don&#39;t seem like pros, they seem like every day people who are, for some inexplicable reason, paying attention to me, following me where they shouldn&#39;t, talking in mics around me, fucking with me in the stores, weird shit like that. It is truly bizarre. </p>

<p>I stay at home now, hiding away, attempting to not have violence rule the outcome. I don&#39;t want trouble, never did, but they want trouble, and I cannot explain why... fuck it&#39;s so annoying. Do you know how many times they&#39;ve made my wife cry? How much sorrow and horribleness they&#39;ve brought into our lives when we were just this happy little married couple? The fuck is wrong with these scum bags?</p>

<p>Sorry, kind of venting, thank you for being nice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you looked &quot;interesting&quot; at some point.
I think that they expect to fully be able to manipulate anyone, and when someone seems though on this aspect, after some successful tests (of resistance), they may take a longwhile interest.
So they may be doing that to learn something from someone who belongs to a type of human biology/mind/mindset they haven&#39;t finished studying yet.
That is, if you are fair in what you say, actually i&#39;d expect it either from someone fair or by someone completely sold, it&#39;d be funny if i was talking to CIA ahah. But i&#39;m assuming not for this message.
Anyway if that&#39;s for real there&#39;s little help to be found in this world sadly. As for what i think can be true of their general purpose, &quot;&quot;&quot;they&quot;&quot;&quot; (not talking about CIA) consider life a learning/testing experience instead of a living one. So you may be someone that lives very fully but thinks little of the world outside of himself with some interesting traits that makes the experiment worthwhile. In the end their purpose, on this train of thought, for their own learning, may be to just break you in the end.
This is all speculation, but i think the best way you got to fight is to troll them in an extreme way. That&#39;s the only middle way between boing down and charging a shotgun that i know of.
When you see someone that it&#39;s part of it, instead of ignoring, talk openly to him like a friend, but with the intent of pushing insecurity at the end. Look his reactions. Get to know them. Push more fear into them than they do into you. And do it with a big, satisfacted smile on your face when not a laugh.
If you suspect someone doing this is an MK slave, hold no mercy. Push a conversation, try to go political, then randomly talk about those faggots that gave their children into the hidden mafia, talk about how some families truly are just born losers that can&#39;t be helped. Push an unfair bias that should &quot;explore&quot; their subconscious should that be the real case. Find way to out them to you and put a big smile on. It&#39;s not like i have no compassion for those guys (when that&#39;s the real case), but we should all be ready to shot down the hungry bear when it points towards us. Only keypoint for doing this is to retain a solid plausible deniality that you weren&#39;t trying to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings later. Communicate your real intentions only with your smile or laugh. A &quot;positive poker face&quot; so to speak, although you must truly retain fun to make it work optimally i think. The example i used isn&#39;t really usable as it doesn&#39;t entail a social plausible deniability, but i think you get the purpose of the strategy.
The way out of an impossible situation is to stop being defending but on the aggressive side. Trolling is a pacific way of aggression that can be used to clash non phisically and it can hurt and break masks just the same. Actually, the CIA is doing that to you atm. It doesn&#39;t take long to shot you down and you know it. The reason they don&#39;t is because you aren&#39;t their enemy, you are their experiment. I&#39;m sorry you are in for the game.
To sum it up: Never think about it to defend, find way to have plausible deniality about just being friendly when talking to this people, and when you know you have to do something about it, troll them to death. You must retain a positive idea of life for this to &quot;work out&quot; (i can&#39;t know exactly when do they consider the experiment over or if your prize is freedom or death, though.)
Also, if you are open minded, try read this. <a href="http://www.illuminati-news.com/00363.html">http://www.illuminati-news.com/00363.html</a>
It was one of the best leaks/lies from the above. Now if you can consider it abstractly as the guy says, looking purely at the message, i think you&#39;ll gain some insight. And even if the guy was a fake, he still got the highest mental vibration i ever felt from someone. The best &quot;lie-flow&quot; if that was the case. That&#39;s still very useful you if later choose to troll them for real. May help you in other areas too.
I&#39;m sorry you get the rough treatment, but since if they so choose there&#39;s no way you can win the fight, give it up, stop thinking about it and get the most fun you can from the process. I understand you have family and duties etc, but this is not something you decided so, don&#39;t feel too bad for any kind of reaction you elect to adopt. Just keep it positive. Those that are doing this to you have been rotting on the inside for a lot or are ignorantly oblivious and sold. Use some compassion despite if you choose to shot the hungry bear or let him have his dinner. Either way don&#39;t feel bad about it.
The most important thing is to use this positivity to push fear into those fuckers. And intelligence. You are going to a doctor you know is lying on a very ethic stuff, don&#39;t just go. Bring a microphone, register the conversation, then when he says &quot;CIa, it&#39;s CIA&quot;, say well you should come testify so we can get them in jail, then record it all, put it with his name on the internet and archive it, then contact good alternative medias to spread the story. Real audios are very hard to prove wrong. Use tech to your advantage.
This is all speculation and a kind of brainstorming, i don&#39;t mean to give you solutions, just the ideas i can see fit for crafting your owns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As i said the i provided the link not to make you a &quot;believer&quot; of something, the message may not be that relevant for you, but the writing and mental coping skills of the guy/liar/whatever he is will enhance anyone&#39;s game if you can extrapolate. Can&#39;t say more than this, the real point of his entire discussion is that ultimately there&#39;s no &quot;elevator&quot; for understanding, we will have to walk faster if we want to get it earlier. Hard topic to explain if not impossible, or no more possible than me moving your feet with my mind... And yes, i noticed all the wrong dates the first time reading it aswell. I told you, the value is not face value of what he says, but how he says it, how his emotional mastery basically flows in his messages. If you can &quot;crack his code&quot; you will get ahead. LARPing is a good way to learn this mastery. 
Can you picture reality as a hellish box which only foster happyness for the sake of later pain, that god is an evil monster and yet be able to spin all this in your mind and come up for a reason it&#39;s a good thing for you? if you have this power, it doesn&#39;t really matter what its true or what you believe. Basically is about making your thought more powerful than the external reality. One of the two will definitely crumble sooner or later, all resources are limited. And if you can put your hands on a free-energy mental battery, i urge you to. If you can love this game, you can also win it. </p>

<p>MK slaves are just basically living scripts. They got scripts for fucking and when and how to, same for killing, annoying people, etc.
Their &quot;inside&quot; in the spiritual sense is completely removed. They are faces with a processor behind that is entirely property of someone else. (This btw is one of the few real meanings of &quot;lizard people&quot; i know of; basically our brain is composed of 3 parts, the lizard one being our old ancestry and our superior parts concerning emotional and spiritual awareness. Those were removed in this people, or to better say, they were &quot;quarantined&quot; for lack of better term)</p>

<p>See, the hatred part is what probably keep you chained to them. As i said for you to win the &quot;trolling battle&quot; it requires you honestly don&#39;t think much about it, and when you do is to have some fun with them. &quot;Outgrow&quot; them.</p>

<p>When 2 people have an emotional battle where both care and both feel hurt and want to hurt the other side, what is the ultimate &quot;win&quot; you can individually obtain? to stop caring. To just stop thinking about it and accept that person has to be gone from your thoughts. What benefit you the most is exactly what hurts the other party the most, because you have framed your interactions as a competition.</p>

<p>Until you play the game of hatred they will win, because its their game, and they are great at it. Emotionally you are playing their game. You must &quot;eject&quot; from this, craft your own game which is not based on who destroys the other the best, but of what is more to your benefit.</p>

<p>It is to your benefit to destroy them if it means it fucks you up? no? then they will profit from this intent.
It is to your benefit to worry about them all day? no.
It is to your benefit to hate them? no.
Is it to your benefit to stop caring about what&#39;s not in your power to change (or would cost you too much of your resources to make sense) and find ways to just ignore it, or if you happen to think about it, to just entertain the thought of all this fuckery like a little funny petty thing that lastly doesn&#39;t stand a chance against the power of your mind to choose better thoughts? i believe so.
The problem is that &quot;they&quot; have no real body you can hit. Hating them is exactly like punching the air. You will only meet puppets and never the master. He got plenty more and he will be happy you lastly fell for it.</p>

<p>Even if all this said you still had this big hatred for the master, you will need to circumnavigate the hatred for the puppets to get to hurt the master. Getting mad at the puppets is part of his fun, not yours. Also getting mad at him is part of his fun and not yours, to be honest. </p>

<p>Are they really worth your thoughts? Why you think Jesus never got mad and when killed went all &quot;forgive them for they know not what they do?&quot; Because he had total emotional mastery and a total grip on his thoughts and he knew that hate was never going to make for a good time. They couldn&#39;t touch his emotional state even by crucifying him. That&#39;s what an unstoppable mind looks like to me. By all means, i wouldn&#39;t suggest anyone to go full Jesus since its just not going to work for most people. But you can definitely learn from him, because facing an impossible challenge, coping skills are extremely more useful than fighting ones. Taking again from Jesus, did he &quot;lose&quot;? how could he? he was not playing anyone else game. It&#39;s not bad to LARP yourself if it serves your game, or create a better one for you, or serves your understanding.
If you understand the thought-reality thing, LARPing is a form of generating/crafting reality.</p>

<p>You know the thing they say for new speakers, &quot;just think them all naked&quot;? that&#39;s LARPing. Does it have a positive effect on you? yes. Does it really help some people? absolutely. Can you fabricate a fantasy story and still teach something of value through it? that&#39;s what fables are for.</p>

<p>Think beyond context, it&#39;s about the logic. Thought-Reality. You need to get on their levels and take your responsability in co-creating your reality. Fighting a giant fire with fire is a sure way to be sure your life burns down. Craft an hydrant for your mind. A thought that serves to remove their relevance from your life. A thought that makes it secondary and funny to you.</p>

<p>Do you think &quot;spirit&quot; &quot;soul&quot; &quot;television&quot; were real things before someone created them into their mind? everything LARPed his way into this world. If you can see it like this, it will get easier. Craft a narrative for yourself that they can&#39;t break and where they are ultimately just serving you.</p>

<p>Fuck that. You are sick, and you are talking about hurting people who are in on it. The only person in on it is you. Your mind is out of control and working against you. There is no possible way two mental health professionals gave you a clean bill of health unless you hid some of your story from them. You need to get over the idea that people who don&#39;t buy your story are trolling you or are close-minded. I believe in strange things that nobody has seen, my mind is more open than yours because it is not broken. Your story is not new, or uncommon. Your story is word-for-word the same tale that many who suffer from paranoid schizophrenia or related disorders tell. The way your life fell apart, and your business went under, they are telling clues that the problem you face is not &quot;them&quot;, it is in fact &quot;you&quot;. I&#39;m not trying to troll you, I&#39;m trying to shake you up and force you to consider the alternative... it&#39;s in your head and you need to save yourself from yourself before it&#39;s too late. </p>

<p>It&#39;s because you are promising to harm someone if this doesn&#39;t stop. That is why people are trying to convince you that you are in fact sick. You openly admit that &quot;someone&quot; is going to pay for what is happening to you. Stop threatening to harm random people and you will be back in your schizophrenic echo chamber where you want to be. Otherwise, don&#39;t be surprised by the negative reaction you are getting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since I&#39;m on my phone and it&#39;s not easy to copy and paste what I said but basically I messaged OP because if he is serious I (mental health or not) I was intrigued- plus I work in a pretty <em>different</em> (the Mecca of that really wealthy &quot;church&quot; that Tom Cruise is all about) area and I&#39;ll just say I completely understand the paranoid feeling when you have people straight-up following you home. Not in a threatening way necessarily in my case, just in &quot;why the fuck are you still behind my car for the 3rd time this week way&quot;, my fiancés had them do it to him so, that shit does happen.</p>

<p>Anyway I also happen to very interested in the ME (yea I know booo it&#39;s stupid but whatever it&#39;s interesting) and we were trying to figure out if there were in any common factors with us who felt that in a big way. There are a few (premature/low birth weight, ADD, etc) and one that was really interesting was being in a GATE program or trial as a kid. The ones where you&#39;re stuck in a room for hours doing annoying IQ-type tests and shit designed like games and that sort of thing. </p>

<p>As it just so happens OP was in one those programs too.</p>

<p>So that conversation led to some interesting 4chan threads about MK Ultra and I can find the links if anyone&#39;s interested.</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5wmrvn/possible_link_between_gate_program_and_mandela/">https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5wmrvn/possible_link_between_gate_program_and_mandela/</a></p>

<p>So yea OP for what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt for now lol and as to my second question, there&#39;s nothing you can think that would make you a target or anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I mean, I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t the occasional asshole there too lol it just seems like a lot of the people who were sick of the hostility (and the constant Trump/Hillary battle) who actually want to talk shit out whatever it is, moved over there, so they <em>might not jump down your throat</em> as badly. I comment more here (I just have to sometimes, the BS is too strong) but they&#39;ve got some interesting reads to be sure.</p>

<p>Congri-gate? You couldn&#39;t resist could you? Lol not really I mean, a few people (I&#39;ll have to find the links) have done some ME surveys and whatnot trying to figure out any connections between the people experiencing it and the Gate/study thing was just one of the big ones. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what to make of it without going wayyyy down the rabbit-hole and saying it&#39;s possible there are people who &quot;they&quot; have been following specifically as a control or experimental group their whole lives who they&#39;re fucking with or something. 
I thought that and decided if this is the case then I&#39;m just guna say I must be a fucking x-man, I haven&#39;t discovered my powers but &quot;they&quot; know and are keeping tabs- it helps that not feel so creepy lol... but this is all just my wacky brain and that I totally want superpowers ;) </p>

<p>So I know you&#39;ve said your wife&#39;s been targeted or whatever too, what sort of ways? Do you think it&#39;s just her connection to you or could it still just be some fucked up cult who decided to follow your family around? I mean that shit happens too... Oddly enough that&#39;s one of those things that a lot of mk ultra victims reported, there&#39;s a Highersidechats episode I listened to the other day and this woman Mary D Jones talks about her therapy sessions with people who&#39;ve been harassed and stalked in various ways. It&#39;s interesting and at the very least should make you feel better that this happens to other people too <a href="https://youtu.be/X-4_6SFbZok">https://youtu.be/X-4_6SFbZok</a> </p>

<p>And, for the hundredth time, I&#39;ve already seen two doctors and both say I&#39;m normal mentally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As i said the i provided the link not to make you a &quot;believer&quot; of something, the message may not be that relevant for you, but the writing and mental coping skills of the guy/liar/whatever he is will enhance anyone&#39;s game if you can extrapolate. Can&#39;t say more than this, the real point of his entire discussion is that ultimately there&#39;s no &quot;elevator&quot; for understanding, we will have to walk faster if we want to get it earlier. Hard topic to explain if not impossible, or no more possible than me moving your feet with my mind... And yes, i noticed all the wrong dates the first time reading it aswell. I told you, the value is not face value of what he says, but how he says it, how his emotional mastery basically flows in his messages. If you can &quot;crack his code&quot; you will get ahead. LARPing is a good way to learn this mastery. 
Can you picture reality as a hellish box which only foster happyness for the sake of later pain, that god is an evil monster and yet be able to spin all this in your mind and come up for a reason it&#39;s a good thing for you? if you have this power, it doesn&#39;t really matter what its true or what you believe. Basically is about making your thought more powerful than the external reality. One of the two will definitely crumble sooner or later, all resources are limited. And if you can put your hands on a free-energy mental battery, i urge you to. If you can love this game, you can also win it. </p>

<p>MK slaves are just basically living scripts. They got scripts for fucking and when and how to, same for killing, annoying people, etc.
Their &quot;inside&quot; in the spiritual sense is completely removed. They are faces with a processor behind that is entirely property of someone else. (This btw is one of the few real meanings of &quot;lizard people&quot; i know of; basically our brain is composed of 3 parts, the lizard one being our old ancestry and our superior parts concerning emotional and spiritual awareness. Those were removed in this people, or to better say, they were &quot;quarantined&quot; for lack of better term)</p>

<p>See, the hatred part is what probably keep you chained to them. As i said for you to win the &quot;trolling battle&quot; it requires you honestly don&#39;t think much about it, and when you do is to have some fun with them. &quot;Outgrow&quot; them.</p>

<p>When 2 people have an emotional battle where both care and both feel hurt and want to hurt the other side, what is the ultimate &quot;win&quot; you can individually obtain? to stop caring. To just stop thinking about it and accept that person has to be gone from your thoughts. What benefit you the most is exactly what hurts the other party the most, because you have framed your interactions as a competition.</p>

<p>Until you play the game of hatred they will win, because its their game, and they are great at it. Emotionally you are playing their game. You must &quot;eject&quot; from this, craft your own game which is not based on who destroys the other the best, but of what is more to your benefit.</p>

<p>It is to your benefit to destroy them if it means it fucks you up? no? then they will profit from this intent.
It is to your benefit to worry about them all day? no.
It is to your benefit to hate them? no.
Is it to your benefit to stop caring about what&#39;s not in your power to change (or would cost you too much of your resources to make sense) and find ways to just ignore it, or if you happen to think about it, to just entertain the thought of all this fuckery like a little funny petty thing that lastly doesn&#39;t stand a chance against the power of your mind to choose better thoughts? i believe so.
The problem is that &quot;they&quot; have no real body you can hit. Hating them is exactly like punching the air. You will only meet puppets and never the master. He got plenty more and he will be happy you lastly fell for it.</p>

<p>Even if all this said you still had this big hatred for the master, you will need to circumnavigate the hatred for the puppets to get to hurt the master. Getting mad at the puppets is part of his fun, not yours. Also getting mad at him is part of his fun and not yours, to be honest. </p>

<p>Are they really worth your thoughts? Why you think Jesus never got mad and when killed went all &quot;forgive them for they know not what they do?&quot; Because he had total emotional mastery and a total grip on his thoughts and he knew that hate was never going to make for a good time. They couldn&#39;t touch his emotional state even by crucifying him. That&#39;s what an unstoppable mind looks like to me. By all means, i wouldn&#39;t suggest anyone to go full Jesus since its just not going to work for most people. But you can definitely learn from him, because facing an impossible challenge, coping skills are extremely more useful than fighting ones. Taking again from Jesus, did he &quot;lose&quot;? how could he? he was not playing anyone else game. It&#39;s not bad to LARP yourself if it serves your game, or create a better one for you, or serves your understanding.
If you understand the thought-reality thing, LARPing is a form of generating/crafting reality.</p>

<p>You know the thing they say for new speakers, &quot;just think them all naked&quot;? that&#39;s LARPing. Does it have a positive effect on you? yes. Does it really help some people? absolutely. Can you fabricate a fantasy story and still teach something of value through it? that&#39;s what fables are for.</p>

<p>Think beyond context, it&#39;s about the logic. Thought-Reality. You need to get on their levels and take your responsability in co-creating your reality. Fighting a giant fire with fire is a sure way to be sure your life burns down. Craft an hydrant for your mind. A thought that serves to remove their relevance from your life. A thought that makes it secondary and funny to you.</p>

<p>Do you think &quot;spirit&quot; &quot;soul&quot; &quot;television&quot; were real things before someone created them into their mind? everything LARPed his way into this world. If you can see it like this, it will get easier. Craft a narrative for yourself that they can&#39;t break and where they are ultimately just serving you.</p>
