       Keep being skeptical of Trump.  People that do so are necessary.  Ask a Trump supporter (hi) about it, and most will say that he needs to be held accountable.  Bannon even said as much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most of us feel like he should get a bit further into his term before we assume one way or the other.  Things are a real mess, that's not going to be an easy clean-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, again, please keep being suspicious.  You don't have to like him.  You just have to want him to do the right thing for this country.  And hold him accountable if he fails.

       Umm when he becomes president i would expect the legalization of weed especially as a fuel source. Force pay freeze for central bankers and all bankers for that matter. End the fake war on terror and reform the public education system. Thats just a start.

       I'm sorry, but I really can't figure out how
       <em>
        you're
       </em>
       the one that seems to be getting frustrated by u/maga_lyagushka replies. What they're asking of you is perfectly clear and not that difficult considering your feelings towards Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       All they wanted to know was, in your words, Trump's first 10 actions as president and
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       those actions made you think Trump is a fraud. It's a normal question in these kind of conversations and you're not going to be able to change anyone's mind about our President if you won't sincerely answer a legitimate question about your views.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Your username proves its impossible to have a real conversation since you are so biased
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And dude. Dismissing someone based on their username alone is just as bad as calling someone a shill, refusing to continue a conversation with someone with a young account, or assuming that everyone who has ever posted in the_donald isn't worth talking to at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       This conversation isn't "impossible" because of u/maga_lyagushka. It's impossible because instead of answering their questions, you get defensive and start being insulting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that they're even asking to hear your point of view and talk about it rather than calling you a shill and refusing to hear your opinion shows that yeah, it's a real conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so fucking frustrating that the
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       thing this entire country needs right now (understanding and
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       communication from BOTH sides without throwing fits) is the thing that most people are avoiding like the plague. Everyone has somehow lost their ability to actually
       <em>
        listen
       </em>
       to what people are saying, to not take debate personally, and to put themselves in someone else's shoes and see things from a different point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to get people to change their minds is to be patient and explain. If you are actually worried about Trump, or the future of our country, talking to people who already share your opinion is useless. If you really do give a shit, engage actual Trump supporters in conversation, stop calling them Russian shills, and stop dismissing people because of their usernames or where they post.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just to be clear, everything I just said has
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to do with the candidate I voted for

       Easy way to tell:
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they discussing Trump's serious conflicts of interest, such as his close relationship with the Israeli Likud party or the fact that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is related by blood to a foreign intelligence agency, Mossad?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are they making up absurd likes like "Trump pees on Russian hookers in Moscow?"
      </p>
      <p>
       You can tell because the real Trump scandal - his foreign ties to Israel - is NEVER brought up by the Democrats.

       Great point. I spent a lot of time during the campaign pointing out Clinton's many flaws - not because I support the Orange One, but because we were hearing all kinds of MSM Trump trash but Clinton was being sugar-coated. They were/are both complete disasters; we could pick any American out of a phone book at random and have a better President.
