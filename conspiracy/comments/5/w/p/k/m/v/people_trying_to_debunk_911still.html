        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I see a surge in 9/11 posts and it reminded me of a post I made 2 years ago...</p>

<p>I see that &#39;debunkers&#39; only have 4 or so elements to use in their rationale of how the Twin Towers came down...</p>

<ul>
<li>Impact of a plane hitting the building to weaken the structure (only for WTC1 &amp; WTC2, not WTC7)</li>
<li>A portion of jet fuel &amp; office room material for fire combustion to weaken the structure</li>
<li>Gravity to bring the building down</li>
<li>Air Compression to blow out windows and other stuff on lower floors as it came down</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, we have the following elements (with picture/video/eyewitness evidence) to infer a much more realistic reason as to how the Twin Towers came down...</p>

<ul>
<li>Explosions in the lower floors</li>
<li>Squibs</li>
<li>Ejecta</li>
<li>Diagonal cuts</li>
<li>Thermite residue</li>
<li>Molten steel</li>
<li>Molten concrete</li>
<li>Pulverization</li>
<li>Victims vaporized</li>
<li>Free-fall speed</li>
<li>Symmetric fall</li>
</ul>

<p>These elements fit exactly with a controlled demolition... not a natural gravity collapse with the help from some jet fuel &amp; office room materials.</p>

<p>As time goes by it gets more and more ridiculous that there has not been another investigation into this event... which again makes it more obvious it&#39;s a lie and they know it. That said, we finally have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKN4qilUOfs">one group taking on the investigation</a></p>

<p>I recommend this link to see what I am talking about: <a href="http://www.luogocomune.net/site/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=167">September 11 - The New Pearl Harbor</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched September Clues years ago when I first got into the whole 9/11 conspiracy. The &#39;no planes theory&#39; is very controversial even on this sub... but there are definite issues with many of the video clips of the impacts.</p>

<p>The way the planes slide into the building like butter... no crumple, or slow down whatsoever... and how at one angle the nose of the plane seems to punch through another side entact is ridiculous. The discrepancies go on and on...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason that the no plane theories are so controversial, is that almost all of the initial 9/11 alternative theories immediately denied it or did not mention it. Loose Change, Alex Jones, The French Connection, 9/11 Psy-opera, etc... I still think it is the best explanation that I have seen to describe the event.</p>

I think people, even selfish and cowardly ones, would rather go along with this if they knew people were not really being killed in the event.

    <div class="md"><p>Knee-jerk uninformed reaction to posts making it to front page. I checked alot of post/comment histories of the debunkers....never a single post or comment to this sub. I&#39;m very new here, but I&#39;ve been researching this for years. All in all this is still good traction, considering Alaska University final report comes out in.....May? Also..the advertising campaign is obviously a planned addition. I would expect them to ramp up efforts going into final stretch. This is going to go mainstream no matter what. Either by true curiosity by uninformed masses or outrage by close-minded debunkers. The conflict over the ad campaign will be impossible to ignore. Look for something on it as early as next week, specifically well planned debunking pieces. I guarantee they are already working on them.</p>
