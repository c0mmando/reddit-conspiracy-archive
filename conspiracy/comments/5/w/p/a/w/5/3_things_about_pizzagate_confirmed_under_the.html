<p>1) David Seaman</p>

<p>David works for BitGold/Goldmoney.  Goldmoney even <a href="http://community.goldmoney.com/discussion/2581/david-seaman-bitgold-goldmoney">sent David to the Superbowl for winning a sales contest there</a>.  Goldmoney is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldMoney">funded by Soros</a>. Video of conversations with David and the CEO and CSO of <em>Soros</em>-backed Goldmoney <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OkgcsnLVek">1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDcHQYpwJJc">2</a>.</p>

<p>2) Comet Ping Pong Pizza</p>

<p>Soros has given money to Comet Pizza.  It would be impossible to know exactly how much because of the myriad of ways Soros <em>can</em> pay, but we do know that <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bkvaw/soros_has_been_linked_to_comet_ping_pong/">he gave money to Comet Pizza through American Bridge PAC</a>.</p>

<p>3) <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/AuCX/pizza-hut-699-any-deal-conspiracy-theorist">Pizza Hut Conspiracy Theorist Commercial</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/yum-brands-inc-yum-axalta-coating-systems-ltd-axta-and-pdc-energy-inc-pdce-george-soros-and-steven-cohen-initiated-stakes-in-these-companies-339398/">Soros is a primary shareholder of Yum!Brands</a>, which owns Pizza Hut.</p>

<p>Did he fool you? If Soros is paying him, his &quot;donations&quot; from his &quot;fans&quot; is a ruse. Do you really believe Alex Jones makes his fortune from crappy supplements that are way overpriced? Controlled opposition is well financed by very wealthy powers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, how does the motives work? Why destroy him when he is capturing an audience? Why shut down all of his revenue streams? He has now responded in a very calm manner and is taking time away - that doesn&#39;t make sense if he is a provacateur. </p>

<p>His downfall does not make sense if he is an asset. As far as funding goes, almost all elements of the media are connected to big money. I don&#39;t blame Seaman for going out and getting himself a job to pay himself a wage. Almost all of us work for &#39;the man&#39; in some element.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones has never been partisan. He went after Clinton. He went after Bush. He went after Obama. The reason he isn&#39;t going after Trump is because he honestly believes that Trump is fighting the great beast in Washington - he&#39;s taking on &#39;the establishment&#39;. Considering the media is their mouthpiece, it&#39;s hard to not consider that as truth. The media is rabid and beyond reasonable at this time.</p>

<p>Maybe Alex is being duped but I think he&#39;s a genuine guy. He&#39;s just far too interested in things he cannot control and his &#39;sources&#39; often feed him bullshit to keep him honest and a useful asset for them. If you understand how the intelligence/insider/leak stuff works, it makes more sense that you treat it like a game of telephone rather than trivial pursuit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what ridiculous shit are you talking about?</p>

<p>David made one huge mistake - he trusted a source and didn&#39;t put a caveat on his prediction that there were be pizzagate arrests soon. Instead, Sandusky&#39;s son was arrested and he looked like a fool for misconstruing the context of the arrest (not pizzagate related at all).</p>

<p>However, he was only passing on what his source told him. This is a well known aspect of the intelligence/leak/source community - they are never 100% honest. Sometimes they feed their own narrative and use their assets for their own benefit, and sometimes they tell them good info from behind the curtain. David got tricked by some of the bad info and went public with it and it blew up in his face.</p>

<p>So I understand why people are pointing fingers, but this was inevitable. Any person who is connected to an &#39;inside source&#39; is going to be fed bullshit that benefits their source at some point. David forgot this and should have simply added &#39;my source tells me&#39; and this would have not been as bad. His source would have probably been pissed with him tho.... It&#39;s complicated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And him saying he&#39;d do anything to sell a story?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s a journalist. That&#39;s like a basketball players saying &#39;I would do anything to get a rebound on the basketball court&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>not like your posts have much common sense to them? soros is a fucker that needs to be jailed but there are kinda thousands of others like him that we need to focus on too, can we not focus on them all? you have to know how money works, a little money in a big company isn&#39;t going to hand soros influence on the whole system of that company. I&#39;m not saying he doesnt have an effort to silence pizzagate. I&#39;m purely pointing out that we have to be realists about the claims we make because we also get more done that way as well.</p>
