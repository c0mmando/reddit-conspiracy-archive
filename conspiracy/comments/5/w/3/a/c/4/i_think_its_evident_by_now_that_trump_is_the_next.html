<p>We will go to war with someone with the way Trump has been; you&#39;re thinking Russia and you&#39;re wrong. </p>

<p>Trump <em>does</em> have legitimate ties to Russia and the Russians have backed off big time since he took office.</p>

<p>Perhaps they&#39;ll divvy up China and the Middle East and allow Israel to become Greater Israel. </p>

<p>Perhaps this is all just Chapter 1 of &quot;Disclosure&quot; and the world leaders are drinking from the same well. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s gonna do what Hitler couldn&#39;t do, and that&#39;s create a real alliance with Russia. </p>

<p>You think it&#39;s gonna be the French and German militaries who take part in the future genocides of Islamic immigrants into Europe? </p>

<p>Wrong. </p>

<p>The Nazis came to America from within NASA and have spread their ideaology among the western leaders. Trump is every bit as brutal, genocidal, and charismatic as Hitler was. </p>

<p>That makes him incredibly dangerous. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>know your history </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Why?</p>

<p>Because America 2017 is not Germany 1933. Germany back then was ethnically homogeneous. Basically everyone was white and spoke German.</p>

<p>The US is mixed ethnicity and people are split up along every kind of line you can imagine. Everyone thinks differently and has their own cherished opinion of how things should be done.</p>

<p>In 1933, Hitler was welcomed with open arms. Can&#39;t think of a more opposite example than the way Trump has been received.</p>

<p>Hitler had the media and state apparatus firmly behind him. With Trump it&#39;s pretty much the opposite. In 1933, there had never been a Hitler before. In 2017, Trump gets compared to Hitler at every opportunity.</p>

<p>If you knew your history, you&#39;d know what you&#39;re saying is not accurate.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to rebut anything I&#39;ve said, feel free to do so. I&#39;m more interested in a discussion than an argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;d say it&#39;s at least very probable..</p>

<p>the OP is speculating wildly on the the finer details, but possible. things are definitely pointing towards a very serious conflict manufactured by the trump administration.</p>

<p>you would have to imagine that all the whistleblowing/leaks, that have exposed the previous administrations, has reached such a level that the various scandals can now only serve as either- one of the greatest spectacles of an empire about to collapse, or a perfect smokescreen to keep everyone fascinated while you prepare for a major conflict with a new puppet at the helm (trump)</p>

<p>to suggest trump is anything but a buffoon is ludicrous, so you can bet he&#39;s being manipulated.. </p>

<p>Yes, yes he&#39;s increasing the nuke and military size because Russia wants desperately to invest in their nukes and military to try and keep up. For sure he approved the keystone pipeline so Russian oil would have greater influence in the world. For sure his disdain for Iran is because he favors Russia&#39;s alliance with Iran. Incredibly dangerous indeed. /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yea, i guess so.</p>

<p>when you discover that a system of government exists in theory, that would effectively remove, or at the very least manage, scarcity to the point that virtually everyone on the planet has an excellent standard of living without compromising our environment , you then start getting a better picture of what might be happening. </p>

<p>someone obviously loves those ivory towers too much to let go of 
&quot;all they&#39;ve achieved&quot; or frightened of the trouble we/they might have 
integrating into a new system.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s amazing how many people make this comparison like they&#39;ve stumbled upon some sort of obscure revelation. Every single person who consumes too much MSM thinks this. Why? Because this is the exact narrative MSM pushes! I actually heard someone IRL say &quot;everything he&#39;s doing in mirroring the rise of Hitler. The signs are everywhere if you know where to look.&quot; Non-fake news flash: the MSM is not some esoteric Kabbalah text whose true meaning only an observant few can divine. It&#39;s literally the mainstream opinion propaganda machine. And if every single commentator is shouting this exact narrative from the rooftops, then you can pretty much write it off as not true based off that fact alone.</p>
