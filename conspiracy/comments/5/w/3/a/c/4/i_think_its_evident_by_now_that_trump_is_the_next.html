       The first 55 days of 2017 have been really intense.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will go to war with someone with the way Trump has been; you're thinking Russia and you're wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       have legitimate ties to Russia and the Russians have backed off big time since he took office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps they'll divvy up China and the Middle East and allow Israel to become Greater Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps this is all just Chapter 1 of "Disclosure" and the world leaders are drinking from the same well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's gonna do what Hitler couldn't do, and that's create a real alliance with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think it's gonna be the French and German militaries who take part in the future genocides of Islamic immigrants into Europe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazis came to America from within NASA and have spread their ideaology among the western leaders. Trump is every bit as brutal, genocidal, and charismatic as Hitler was.
      </p>
      <p>
       That makes him incredibly dangerous.

       You are talking about future events which haven't happened. It is literally impossible for what you are saying to be deemed accurate as it is no more than conjecture based around assumptions and assertions you make; "Trump
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       have legitimate ties to Russia", "Trump's gonna do what Hitler couldn't do, and that's create a real alliance with Russia.". Care to provide evidence of either of these statements?

       You are dreaming, not stating facts or even making informed predictions.

      <p>
       No. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because America 2017 is not Germany 1933. Germany back then was ethnically homogeneous. Basically everyone was white and spoke German.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is mixed ethnicity and people are split up along every kind of line you can imagine. Everyone thinks differently and has their own cherished opinion of how things should be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1933, Hitler was welcomed with open arms. Can't think of a more opposite example than the way Trump has been received.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler had the media and state apparatus firmly behind him. With Trump it's pretty much the opposite. In 1933, there had never been a Hitler before. In 2017, Trump gets compared to Hitler at every opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you knew your history, you'd know what you're saying is not accurate.

       If you'd like to rebut anything I've said, feel free to do so. I'm more interested in a discussion than an argument.

       i'd say it's at least very probable..
      </p>
      <p>
       the OP is speculating wildly on the the finer details, but possible. things are definitely pointing towards a very serious conflict manufactured by the trump administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       you would have to imagine that all the whistleblowing/leaks, that have exposed the previous administrations, has reached such a level that the various scandals can now only serve as either- one of the greatest spectacles of an empire about to collapse, or a perfect smokescreen to keep everyone fascinated while you prepare for a major conflict with a new puppet at the helm (trump)
      </p>
      <p>
       to suggest trump is anything but a buffoon is ludicrous, so you can bet he's being manipulated..

       people are skeptical of any one in power including trump but I don't know if I would go so far as to say trump is hitler. Maybe he's doing things people don't like but there are a ton of problems growing in our country and the existing strategies for solving them we're not working or not working fast enough. This post is just sensational garbage.

       Trump isn't just instantly fixing problems we have had for a long time so he is hitler? I don't even like trump I think he's kind of an idiot but givin the choice between him or hellory Clinton I would take the yuge orange baboon every time. Honestly aside from a few things I don't really disagree with the things he's been doing so maybe he's alright. I would have liked to see Ron Paul or sanders as president but things didn't work out that way.

       Right but the way the presidential election works is there are 2 names on the ballot and one of those people will be the potus. I know you might not like either name of the ballot but that's your choices if you think you could get people to collectively write in a candidate enough to become president you are mad.

       You dont have to pick those names tho. I voted a write in knowing they wouldnt win. 
Voting for the lesser evil is wrong. Thats why we are here.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you think they would allow a wildcard as one of those 2 names? 
Clinton didnt get picked because this presidential term big shit will happen and she didnt want to stain her name worst than it already is

       This is also how i see things. Take the private prisons, Why would Obama sell them off then Trump buy them back within such a short time period? Does it have to do with Obama and DEA recently scheduling weed and cbd oil, probably

       almost every one of your points is wrong, you either ono read Huff Po  and are blind, or you are trolling.
He didn't ban muslims, he brought in Extreme vetting for 7 countries, there are 54 "muslim" countries in the world...
 He allowed Ice raids on Illegal immigrants, in other words he let them   do their job.

       Yes, yes he's increasing the nuke and military size because Russia wants desperately to invest in their nukes and military to try and keep up. For sure he approved the keystone pipeline so Russian oil would have greater influence in the world. For sure his disdain for Iran is because he favors Russia's alliance with Iran. Incredibly dangerous indeed. /s

       Hitler? Hitler was a fucking genius like it or not. Trump is nowhere close to being any kind of intellectual for good or bad.

       i agree..  the current rhetoric, and actions, seems to be policy embedded in fascism..

       it gets really interesting when you consider that fascism is the only way to keep order if you are desperately trying to keep to the current crumbling, flawed, economic model..

       when you discover that a system of government exists in theory, that would effectively remove, or at the very least manage, scarcity to the point that virtually everyone on the planet has an excellent standard of living without compromising our environment , you then start getting a better picture of what might be happening.

       It's amazing how many people make this comparison like they've stumbled upon some sort of obscure revelation. Every single person who consumes too much MSM thinks this. Why? Because this is the exact narrative MSM pushes! I actually heard someone IRL say "everything he's doing in mirroring the rise of Hitler. The signs are everywhere if you know where to look." Non-fake news flash: the MSM is not some esoteric Kabbalah text whose true meaning only an observant few can divine. It's literally the mainstream opinion propaganda machine. And if every single commentator is shouting this exact narrative from the rooftops, then you can pretty much write it off as not true based off that fact alone.
