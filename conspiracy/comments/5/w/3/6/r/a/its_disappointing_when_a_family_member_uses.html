       I was discussing with my father the other day about the clear bias in googles algorithms in relation to a variety of subjects. That's when he recommended using snopes to "fact" check these sort of subject due to their critical and unbiased approach. He told me it is what he uses when these sort of controversial subjects come up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have any of you had similar experiences with family or examples of snopes being biased?

       after seeing things such as this it has made me sceptical of their stance. That's why I asked at the end of my post if anyone had more examples of this or their opinion on it.

       I always liked Snopes. Until the 2016 primaries and election. They defended Hillary Clinton every step of the way during her campaign. They always had an explanation or rebuttal for any dirt that landed at her feet.
       <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/17/fact-checking-snopes-websites-political-fact-checker-is-just-a-failed-liberal-blogger/">
        It was blatant cheerleading
       </a>
       . I lost all respect for them as arbiters of truth when they showed their political leanings so clearly.

       That Daily Caller article is garbage, though.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Before writing for Snopes, Lacapria wrote for Inquisitr, a blog that — oddly enough — is known for publishing fake quotes and even downright hoaxes as much as anything else.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy">
        association fallacy
       </a>
       . Briefly writing for a site that sometimes publishes hoaxes =/= publishing hoaxes.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Her columns apparently failed to impress her readership, oftentimes failing to get more than 10-20 shares.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What does this have to do with anything?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        She wrote a “fact check” article about Jimmy Carter’s unilateral ban of Iranian nationals from entering the country that looks more like an opinion column arguing against Donald Trump’s proposed Muslim ban.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "It looks like an opinion column to me" isn't proof of anything, and is also an opinion itself.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Lacapria claimed Clinton only meant to refer to the 2011 invasion of Libya (but not the 2012 Benghazi attack) but offered little fact-based evidence to support her claim.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So a
       <a href="http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-benghazi-msnbc/">
        full video with context

       is "little fact-based evidence"?

       I like snopes. Yes the owners are dems and they get money from some Soros investment arm but their posts are verifiable by clicking through on the posts as far as I know.

       Can you give some examples of clear bias in googles results?
How do you know it is bias and not just a result of certain things being more or less popular than other things online...

       OP, use the search bar. There are plenty of documented instances that reveal Snopes' extreme bias towards the official narrative. Here are a few:

        article

       debunking WaPo's claim, just not immediately. As someone who visits the site pretty regularly, I've noticed they usually take a while to debunk new stories, so this isn't really out of the ordinary.

       (Besides, why would it be a priority to them to debunk something WaPo retracted?)

       How did Snopes lie? The Daily Caller claimed there were no American flags whatsoever at the DNC. That turned out to be false.

       The DNC quickly added flags on Day 2 and beyond because of the withering criticism they received on Day 1. Good luck finding that story on Snopes, though, who continues to lie about it until this day.

       Snopes built up a lot of goodwill over the years by debunking actual email hoaxes, but then they sold out to the establishment. They exist now solely to protect the narrative, and they get away with it because of the reputation the "old" Snopes built up.
      </p>

       As always folks, review the evidence yourself and draw your own conclusions. Don't let literal prostitutes do your thinking for you.

       Yes and I always say "follow the money" and you'll find the motive.

       Do the research yourself. Look up the people involved and how they make money, then look up their parent company and their executive boards and primary investors.
