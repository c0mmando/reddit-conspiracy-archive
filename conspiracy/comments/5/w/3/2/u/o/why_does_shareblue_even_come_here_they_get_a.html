       This is the most skeptical sub on all of Reddit and suddenly the most upvoted posts are all CTR MSM talking points?  It's transparent and fake as fuck on the rest of Reddit but here it just looks astonishingy stupid.

       Go create another random anti-Trump subreddit with no users or interaction and artificially puff up some astroturf uninspired meme.

       is the last major subreddit (over 100K subscribers) that allows uncensored discussion. The establishment absolutely can't stand that they can't control the narrative here.

       But Republican shills can change your mind if they offer enough shekels. You think shilling is free? $14 million is the new share blue budget. They're not the only shill agency, so a few million here, a few million there, meanwhile the drama attracts more users. People feel good that they're part of a cause, which indoctrinates them, earning more loyal users. People's main political affiliation is money, if I paid you a few million dollars would you promote ideas that run counter to your principles?

       There's far more evidence of subreddits and shills protecting pro-DNC narratives than there is of Republican or general right-leaning shilling on Reddit. Everything from Correct the Record/ShareBlue issuing literal press releases about their activity on Reddit to the abrupt shut down of

       Watching conspiracy websites for 13 years now I can tell you that there is an influx of people trying to influence the narrative when a conspiracy theorist is attacked or promoted on Television. They do not want to lose one of their sheep just because they became curious and went online. Alex Jones was talked about on Colbert in a segment. Next week the sheep go back to their lovely places and the shills get another order.

       I remember when that place was cheerleading for Bernie and every other post was about how the Clintons are criminal. This was way before pizzagate too. I still can't believe how much that place has changed.

       After Clinton won the primaries they basically banned all the Bernie people. The expected to sail to victory but when Trump won they realized their real audience moved on and the only handles left were CTR people who stopped posting once their checks ran out.

       I fucking hate trump, and have been warning you fucking fools that's he's not your champion, it's not even more of the same. It's worse in almost every way( anti lobbying and rejection of TTP are ok) and like I've been saying, Ya'll are the newbies here. ( this account was began after I received threatening messages in November) This place was thriving long before trump announced his entry into the race. Full of criticism about Obama, the police state, surveillance, etc, along with many other topics.

      <p>
       This IS the best place in the entire world to speak about holding the administration accountable for their lies. Yes, the media has lied, sensationalized things... Still miles better than only listening to The "official" pressers.
