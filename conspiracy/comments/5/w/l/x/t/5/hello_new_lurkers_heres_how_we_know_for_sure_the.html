        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are two possibilities about why the towers collapsed. One, provided by NIST, is that some floor joists sagged down and caused the building to pull itself downward because of gravity working against the weight of the building.</p>

<p>This would mean that each floor would fall downward at first and  then slide off  to the side of the ever increasing  gauge of the steel frame of the lower floors.</p>

<p>steel core that failed <a href="http://imgur.com/uIe69tK">http://imgur.com/uIe69tK</a></p>

<p>Never mind the 200 plus upright steel and aluminum members spaced around the exterior on each floor which are not as apparent.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the frame at street level that was  completely crushed.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/rGhfRjg">http://imgur.com/rGhfRjg</a></p>

<p>Physics would demand that the weakened floors would collapse to the side of the remaining undamaged floors leaving the lower floors as a stub of the original building. That didn&#39;t happen though.</p>

<p>As an experiment you may take any two objects that are similar to each other and stack them.  Now make the top one fall through the lower one.</p>

<p>The top one will never fall through the lower one because the top one must follow the path of least resistance as the laws of physics demand.  it will invariably fall to the side of the lower one. The only way the top object could ever fall through the lower object is if both objects were shattered at the beginning of the collapses as might be done by explosives.</p>

<p>Even If  the physical law  that demands  falling in the direction of least resistance as opposed to falling in the direction of most resistance were somehow suspended on that special day, then gravity provides no lateral force to move any one floor out from under the one above it.</p>

<p>At ground level, if the building didn&#39;t have to fall in the direction of least resistance,    the floors would stack up in the order they were standing in and you would see layers of crushed  floors as the pile of debris.</p>

<p>The other way the buildings could collapse is with the use of explosives.</p>

<p>If explosives were used the building would be turned into shredded material called shrapnel. What you would see on the ground then would be shreds of material haphazardly distributed.</p>

<p>Now all that must be done to prove a purposeful demolition  is to prove that there were not layers of floors on the ground or a section of building fallen beside the undamaged floors but shredded material, or shrapnel.</p>

<p>That would leave no doubt that the buildings had been brought down on purpose by people with the power to do that stealthily and then also have  the power to hide the evidence that they did it.</p>

<p>Take a look at the forensic evidence and decide which kind of debris existed and which did not.</p>

<p>First a demonstration. Here are examples of gravity caused collapses. In this case  because of  earthquakes.</p>

<p>Here is the actual forensic evidence at the WTC  left by the collapses.</p>

<p>Layers, or shrapnel?</p>

<p>I think we can unanimously agree that the debris consisted of shrapnel.</p>

<p>The only conclusion possible is that the buildings were destroyed by explosive force and that  the government and its associated actors created the attack of 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole &quot;oh, yeah pancake theory...that makes sense&quot; was fucking retarded too.  Plane hits the top of the building, but the bottom falls out?  yeah OK.   I did meet a bunch of defense contractors back in 2004 who told me they all knew it was BS, but had different theories as to why it was necessary in order to keep our economy afloat, secure Israel&#39;s interests in the ME, etc., so there are a lot of people who just support the BS in order to keep our standard of living.   I mean, fuck all that, but at least they were honest about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have recently become convinced that the attacks of 9/11 were carried out with foreknowledge or orchestrated by powerful forces within the US government.</p>

<p>I do not find your argument compelling. This is meant to be constructive as the truth is my only concern. The perspective of someone like myself coming from skeptical background to acceptance should be relevant to you at least as a single datapoint if not as representative sample.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are two possibilities about why the towers collapsed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You start with a false dichotomy. There are numerous possible scenarios that can plausibly be considered from the &quot;official story&quot; to traditional demolition techniques or even a tactical nuke. They aren&#39;t all equally plausible but we wouldn&#39;t really know if we don&#39;t even consider them.</p>

<p>As this is essentially the crux of your argument you&#39;ve invalidated it already. You want to force us into a certain conclusion by invalidating what you claim to be the only other option but there are in fact many options.</p>

<p>But have you even disproven the official story? I submit that you have not done so convincingly. I believe there are three main points you attempt to leverage to make your point.</p>

<p>1- it is impossible for the building to have fallen straight down instead of over</p>

<p>2- the nature of the debris indicates that it was blown apart by explosives</p>

<p>3- the distribution of debris indicates that it exploded rather than collapsing.</p>

<p>I believe you fail on every point. </p>

<p>1- you use a ridiculously patronizing and oversimplified example to try to prove it to be logically impossible to fall. The towers are not built from Jenga blocks and are in fact fairly distinct from most other buildings in their construction so it seems pretty silly to think the analogy would hold and I don&#39;t think any of your comparisons are of similar construction and circumstances which severely limits their relevance.</p>

<p>2- in a controlled demolition the minimum possible amount of explosives is used to get the building to collapse into its footprint. The goal is not to explode the whole building but to precisely remove the structural elements that inhibit the building&#39;s collapse.  In either scenario it seems plausible that one could find &quot;shrapnel&quot; but if you have large amounts it would result from the forces of the collapse in either case.</p>

<p>3- again, a controlled demolition is a collapse. We can see that it collapsed downward. The debris distribution could very well be the same in either case and I see no reason to assume that in either case it would have to end up a certain way at the bottom as it is a fairly chaotic system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I have studied statics and kinematics at a graduate level (aerospace) focusing on computational fluid dynamics.  Ive also experience with FEA (finite element analysis.)</p>

<p>Bridges arent really comparable to buildings since they are subject to large gravity loads which all needs to be transmitted to a foundation which is usually not directly beneath it.  </p>

<p>If a particular beam is crucial for transmitting forces is removed <em>and has no redundancy,</em> then sure, the bridge will fail, regardless of the bridges factor of safety. </p>

<p>What does this have to do with a building with many redundancies falling with gravitational acceleration for approximately 2.5 seconds have to do with a game (poly bridge) whose chief purpose is usually to minimize weight and redundancies?</p>

<p>it all fell ridiculously fast unless every single bolt and weld disintegrated at once.  You know what? That is in no way explainable unless the buildings were professionally demolished. Seems extremely obvious but  the repetition of the ridiculous by experts in media makes people accept he ridiculous because the &#39;experts&#39; have already examined the facts so the public doesn&#39;t feel a need to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was simple. The rapid collapse of floor upon floor would compress the large volume of air inside of the building. What would happen to this compressed air if it did not escape? The pressure would build until it exploded, can you explain to me how air was able to exit the building fast enough to avoid the compression from happening?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw the supposed air jets escaping far below the event horizon in the towers. I have no opinion on  the reason for their existence.</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying the  air tightness of the building is somehow the reason that the shrapnel formed. 
How much  air pressure would it take to shred a pound of steel?</p>

<p>Air would have had  to be highly compressed to cause such shredding and as a result it would have had to slow the process of collapse   It didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Consider the speed of the fall for a moment.</p>

<p>At 1/2 second each  for one floor to crush the one under it (far too fast in real life),  you&#39;d be looking at 55 seconds for each  collapse to take place. not something on the order of 11 seconds. </p>

<p>There was no significant air pressure build up. There wasn&#39;t time for it to build up. It would have  had to build up tremendously to cause even one ton of  steel to shred and that would have slowed the collapses.</p>

<p>The reason  they fell so much faster  than  the strength of the steel and the air pressure would have allowed is that there was no consecutive crushing of floors  and no concomitant   build up of air pressure. There were timed explosions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again I&#39;m not attempting to be argumentative, rather I just to see your argument more complete if anything. I am not a scientist, only a mechanical engineer.</p>

<p><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.560.3179&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf">This is the academic paper I am using as a source for the properties of steel at high temperature.</a></p>

<p>At 1000 degrees celsius, the temperature that jet fuel burns, steel roughly the same elasticity as room temperature plastic. Much easier to break, warp, or tear.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/911NutPhysics1.HTM">This is my source for the volume of the world trade center.</a></p>

<p>The article states the volume of the world trade center at around 1.65 million cubic meters, with building materials and furniture occupying around 200 thousand cubic meters.</p>

<p>That leaves 1.45 million cubic meters of air to compress during the rapid collapse. Some of the air nearest the jets impact would be super heated as well, increasing the air pressure at those areas.</p>

<p>The building collapsed over a period around 9 seconds. Assuming that even half of the air escaped upward without compression, you have 725,000 cubic meters of air compressing downward. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.fema.gov/pdf/plan/prevent/rms/155/e155_unit_vi.pdf">This is my source for pressure resulting from explosive blasts.</a></p>

<p>I am not able to give a proper explanation for this area, I studied the material but couldn&#39;t understand it very well. I do believe that the resulting air being caught in the collapse of the world trade center would create explosive force comparable to some explosives.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m just trying to bring a variable into this discussion that I do not often see.  I feel as though the build up of air pressure from rapid compression could cause an explosion. Not to discredit your own theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The worry about the high temperature is unfounded. The most affected floor in each building can be shown to have been no more than 200 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>On the crashed 78th  floor of the South tower, Fire Chief Orio Palmer talked on his radio describing conditions for some minutes. </p>

<p>He couldn&#39;t have done that in a  temprerature above 200 F. degrees. and even at that temperature he would have been screaming in pain, not coherently describing his surroundings. On the equivalent floor of the North Tower Edna Cintron was photographed for some minutes holding on to the steel frame of the building. If it had been even 200 degrees F. she would have been frying her arms . You can&#39;t even hold onto your car in the summer sun and certainly not if it is a  steel weakening temperature. Conclusion the frame of the North Tower was no more than 200 degrees F. </p>

<p>North Tower frame. was less than 200. F

<p>Just as insurance here is the science involved, showing that even  in impossibly favorable conditions the hottest the steel frame could possibly have become is 536 degrees F.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a temperature regularly exceeded by a standard pizza oven which will never be weakened or melted by that amount of heat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two points in response to that. If it is your assertion that the debris was &quot;mostly shrapnel&quot; it would stand to reason that a good amount of that shrapnel would have had to come from the collapse itself because controlled demolitions do not function by just exploding the whole building. </p>

<p>And what I&#39;m saying is that your shrapnel argument does successfully rule out the many other options apart from a conventional demolition scenario as you seem to be arguing toward. You say at one point that there can be no doubt; that&#39;s a very high bar you have set for yourself and I don&#39;t think I am wrong to doubt. And I do think energetic systems are capable of creating small bits of metal without the use of explosives. </p>

<p>The buildings were  fatally flawed and had to come down.  This took a multi billion  dollar liability and turned it into a multi billion dollar profit for the  Henry Kissinger, Peter G.

<p>The shrapnel landed almost flush to the ground. Where did all of that material disappear to?</p>

<p>The buildings fell so fast that there was no time at all available for each floor to hit the one below and press it down. That happening  over 100 times, takes time in my estimation, how about yours? Explosion is the only way to eliminate that  necessary time. You know, exactly  like it looked.</p>

<p>I accept the the &quot;inside job&quot; hypothesis as likely but do not consider the &quot;controlled demolition&quot; hypothesis to be proven much less beyond any doubt. The &quot;follow the money argument&quot; seems to be much more compelling to me especially when the character and history of the people involved is taken into account. I know you are responding to multiple people but I hope you can see we are on the same side. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>...and leave only shrapnel...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to zero in on this for a moment. You are saying that the WTC was reduced to 100% shrapnel and that this is proof that explosives were used as in a conventional controlled demolition. Therefore you are claiming that in a controlled demolition 100% of the material of the building is blasted into tiny bits <em>by the explosives</em> used to demolish the building. Do I have you right?</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly all I can say is I don&#39;t think that&#39;s how controlled demolition works. The goal is to <em>allow a collapse to occur</em> by systematically removing structural elements with explosives. He targeted and strategic use of explosives would suggest a less than complete &quot;shrapnelization&quot; would be caused by the explosions themselves and if that was the end result that a percentage (I say a large percentage) would be a result of the collapse and ensuing energetic collisions of falling components of the building.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that it wasn&#39;t a controlled demolition. It may have been. I <em>am</em> saying I don&#39;t think your argument is sound and does not prove what you are attempting to prove. But I&#39;m happy to be proven wrong if that&#39;s where this takes us so I would really appreciate a response to the specific issue I raised above.</p>

<p>100 percent is a bit extreme the aluminum fascia for instance, standing unfastened from the building was the main reason the buildings were demolished. the faces falling off of the buildings would be expensive in terms of lawsuits  and an international embarrassment for out engineering and building trades.</p>

<p>We cannot know which of the government&#39;s arsenal was used but it was meant not to look like a demolition, but it did.</p>

<p>The problem for your point of view would be the much enlarged size of the debrsi pile where all of the material just rained down and stacked up.</p>

<p>The  reduced  amount of twisted shredded material that actually  was left  can only be the result of energy not available in gravity or  the residual  heat and the  weight.</p>

<p>It went all the way to the ground and did not have the characteristics of just material bombardment. </p>

<p>That would have resulted in a very large debris pile which simply wasn&#39;t here. </p>

<p>It had all of the characteristics of explosive force though. Does that address your concern?</p>

<p><em>UNLESS</em> </p>

<p>The buildings were SO strong that a plane flying into them would do nothing at all. As we know it&#39;s been boasted before, by I believe the architect of the trade center, that these buildings could in fact withstand the force of a jet impact and that it would have little/no effect on any controlled demolition happening at ground level. That&#39;s really the only way I could see it all happening. </p>

<p>That actually made no sense at all but after his paid experts repeated that &#39;information&#39;   on the radio back then, millions of women took up smoking.</p>

<p>Propaganda works but a very few of us are immune and look at the facts for ourselves rather than taking anything repeated by people in media as the final truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are now misrepresenting my argument. I did not ask why they would cover up actually bringing down the towers. I asked why they would cover up the method in which they did it. What would they blow it up, hit it with airplanes, then try to convince everyone it was just airplanes? The obvious and easiest way to do it is blow it up, and blame terrorists for blowing it up. This is Occam&#39;s razor. Your theory makes absolutely no sense as to why they would do it that way. Why would they take so many extra steps that could go wrong? Please tell me the logical reason they don&#39;t want people thinking a bomb did it?</p>

<p>This would have to be carried out by intelligent people, and I just don&#39;t believe anyone would get behind a plan like this.</p>

<p>Intelligence of the perpetrators is a non-sequitur.  You presented an argument from incredulity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would they even bother with the airplanes?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are engaging in a priori reasoning. The conclusion should be arrived after examination of the  evidence, not before. But to speculate, perhaps using airplanes and blaming people from the middle east made people not seriously investigate the collapse. It was a diversion that covered tracts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why wouldn&#39;t they just blow the building up and blame terrorist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, then you have to do a real investigation.  How was it wired? What kind of demolition charges were used?  Who placed them, and how?  Who funded the project?   This would be a lot harder to conceal. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So much can go wrong with the highjacking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You assume that it was a real highjacking.  Lets not focus on WTC here, but the Pentagon.  The Pentagon was not hit by a commercial airliner.  Yet it was blamed.  Obviously something else was used and different type of air-vehicles than commercial jets.</p>

<p>The best thing to answer the type of questions you pose is to become active and demand a real and independent investigation. </p>

<p>Another argument from incredulity.  </p>

<p>How about this: the entity that attacked the Pentagon is not the same as the entity covering it up with the claim of an airliner? </p>

<p>How about this... &#39;Hey guys, you know how we have been trying to occupy the middle east for a while, but it has been a tough sell to the American people.  Let us simulate a hijacking of airliners that we blame on Muslims.  To really cement the approval of the American people for military action, we have to destroy some lives and some landmarks.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course you continue to commit to a priori reasoning, and don&#39;t want to formulate a posteriori conclusions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pentagon has a pretty good lock on what is recorded there. Joe Sixpack can&#39;t just roll up and take a lot of video without raising suspicion.</p>

<p>One of my less accepted ideas about it , and I&#39;m not so sure myself, is that a video was taken from a helicopter but the pilot, knowing that he could be found out because there was a record of who was flying there at the time, made  this video obscure enough in order to disguise his identity </p>

<p>He may have gone so far in hiding his identity that he made the entire video look fraudulent. I think that under some subterfuge this is at the heart a real video, just changed to hide the pilot who took it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the handing in of building plans for a building as tall as the WTC in the center of the most valuable real estate of the world there also need to be a demolition plan handed in at the same time. What if the building was damaged beyond repair due to eg. a earthquake. It can withstand earthquakes but not all. Ok, so the building is damaged and about to fall over on prime real estate, company buildings etc. What kind of plan is there to destroy such a building. This is quite common in high rise building. I really don&#39;t get why people are not looking into this. This is also why someone as Silverstein could say &quot;We made the choice to pull it&quot; because everything is thought of and planned out.

    <div class="md"><p>OK, why would the plan be enacted with three thousand people still in the buildings? It&#39;s a distinction without a difference. It&#39;s still a crime by the powers that be with suppression of the evidence afterwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to take all of the laws of physics together. You can&#39;t just pick and choose which ones you choose to focus on. </p>

<p>&quot;Physics would demand that the weakened floors would collapse to the side of the remaining undamaged floors leaving the lower floors as a stub of the original building. That didn&#39;t happen though.&quot; </p>

<p>Gravity pulls downwards. There just isn&#39;t any other way for it to be. If something falls it&#39;s going to fall straight down. If it has enough force to break through any potential support then it will do so. If not then it&#39;ll stop falling. That&#39;s Newtonian physics.</p>

<p>A building is concrete and steel. It cannot follow the path of least resistance. Water will follow the path of least resistance because it&#39;s malleable and will flow around resistance as it is also being pulled downwards by gravity. Concrete and steel cannot flow around resistance to fall sideways as you describe. </p>

<p>For further proof that this whole idea doesn&#39;t work out in the real world, you probably should look up some info on friction as well. Concrete and steel sliding on concrete and steel is pretty difficult. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fine to construct thought experiments as long as they&#39;re firmly based in reality. After all, Einstein did most of his planning using thought experiments. Of course, he tested his through mathematics. You can&#39;t just make stuff up and &quot;believe&quot; it to be true. Physics isn&#39;t like a religion...</p>

<p>At least he&#39;s honest about it being fiction. </p>

<p>BTW, I&#39;m not supporting the narrative. I&#39;m just saying that your explanation that the collapsing towers should have somehow followed the path of least resistance is bullshit. </p>

<p>Hey, at least your not trying to sell the bullshit that the towers were brought down by a nuke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll bite. How is it possible that falling objects don&#39;t follow the path of least resistance. First though understand that an object (the tower top) was not falling as a single unit weighing hundreds of tons. They instead consisted of fragments that weighed a maximum of the weight of each beam. </p>

<p>The weight was distributed and  did indeed have to follow the path of least resistance. You will never force any piece of matter to fall in the direction of most resistance it can&#39;t be done.</p>

<p>Once a collision occurred  in a straight down direction under gravity alone,  the remaining  momentum  of each fragmented building  object would be conserved by transferring the downward motion  into  bouncing or sliding motion  which which would  either carry the  fragment towards the side of the material below or  dissipate its energy and stack up where the collision occurred.  repetition of this would cause a peaked stack of debris near the center of that debris field  which would augment the tendency to bounce and roll off the stack of previous debris and still cause the majority of material to translate its excess energy to the sides  in relation to the center of the falling material. Thus the fact would remain that the material would have 100% fallen in the direction of least resistance  until all if  its gravitational energy had dissipated.  .</p>

<p>The &#39;severed&#39; tops pf the buildings would have fallen to the sides of the undamaged portion if the collapses had been caused by gravity because that was the direction of least resistance.  </p>

<p>Controlled demolition does not require that any law of physics be broken but the narrative requires three different anomalous  violations of physical law. The first is the change in direction of the top of the South Tower as it began to tilt and suddenly changed its trajectory as it was tilting to fall straight down. This violated conservation of momentum unless you understand that as the  top of the South Tower tilted it was converted to millions of smaller pieces in mid air (blown up)  when it had collided with nothing.  If it had not been pulverized in mid air it would have conserved momentum by continuing to tilt and consequently have fallen as I said in the direction of least resistance which was in the free air, not through  the undamaged 70 plus floors that were  then not even directly beneath the falling debris.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like your description of what happened in the seconds after this photo was taken that somehow caused the tilting top to not continue to tilt over and thus   conserve momentum.  Once the  tilting motion began it must continue until it encountered a force greater than the one it wielded at that moment.</p>

<p>It   inexplicably, according to the narrative, shed its momentum and fell in the direction of most resistance. That&#39;s  a  feat that&#39;s  impossible under the laws of physics unless in the case of a demolition. </p>

<p>Under circumstances of a demolition all movement is  easily accounted for. The debris pile is also the expected one, consisting of shrapnel rather than layers of at least the lowest of the undamaged floors.</p>

<p>The forensic record contained in the photography of the debris  completely supports  controlled demolition as the cause of collapse and at the same time rules out gravity as the cause.</p>

<p>The narrative requires 3 violations of physics, controlled demolition requires none. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you didn&#39;t get very far until you started putting your own spin on the situation. </p>

<p>&quot;First though understand that an object (the tower top) was not falling as a single unit weighing hundreds of tons. They instead consisted of fragments that weighed a maximum of the weight of each beam.&quot;</p>

<p>The ENTIRE top of each building began falling as the support beneath collapsed. That is clearly what is seen on all of the video evidence from that day.</p>

<p>According to your example everything that had been firmly bolted together in the top of the building suddenly and miraculously came apart? How convenient for your fictional narrative...</p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t the rest of the building suddenly and miraculously be fragmented as well? After all, the top of the building is exactly the same as the lower part.</p>

<p>If you skip the step of breaking the building apart as pieces impact one another that totally changes how things work in the real World.</p>

<p>Maybe you should work a nuke into your theory. It wouldn&#39;t be all that big of a stretch of the imagination. All you need to do is stack that bullshit a little higher. Should be easy for someone with your talent. </p>

<p>Have you ever thought about going into politics? I hear Donald Trump is looking for a new press secretary. Extreme bullshit on the fly and in front of cameras. That is taking bullshit to its highest form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The picture showed the top of the South Tower in a state of transition from solid building into particulate matter and steel.</p>

<p>Looking at the video will show how quickly it happened. It&#39;s between when  the tilting stopped and the falling straight down started.</p>

<p>A 30 story segment of building  was  tilting in  a huge arch towards falling beside the lower part of the same building and a second later that formerly solid chunk of building   was millions of particles and beams taking much smaller arks , following its conservation of momentum, making it appear that it changed direction having hit absolutely nothing, defying physical law,  in mid air to cause that except for the demolition of the building during  that moment. and 
for seconds before.</p>

<p>Millions of bolted and welded connections from 110 stories up all the way to street level  came apart in an instant resulting in a very near free fall decent. </p>

<p>So your question to me is exactly the same one that I pose to you. </p>

<p>Demonstration,</p>

<p>If you stack any two  objects that are similar to each other  atop one another, the  only possible way to get the upper one to collapse through the lower one, is to  first shatter them both. That&#39;s what you saw.</p>

<p>I have no idea how the  millions of fasteners  in each building, respectively,  failed in a single moment  but it absolutely wasn&#39;t because of bin Laden. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I gotta give you credit for persistence and, of course, creativity. </p>

<p>There&#39;s only a fragment  of that whole post that I saw as being important. </p>

<p>&quot;defying physical law&quot;</p>

<p>So it wasn&#39;t the terrorists. I get that. </p>

<p>Apparently, according to you, it wasn&#39;t the Government, or aliens, or the real JFK assassin or anything else remotely reasonable. </p>

<p>It was a force that breaks physical laws in order instantly dissolve the bonds between various components of the building.</p>

<p>That&#39;s some white hot smoking to the stratosphere bullshit there. That&#39;s way way further out there than anything Donald Trump is capable of tossing out there. That&#39;s some real talent. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the furthest out there thing I&#39;ve ever read on any conspiracy site or seen presented in any of the various documentaries that have been made.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of us misunderstands the purpose of a conspiracy forum. I&#39;ve got the crazy idea that such sites were trying to find the truth. Maybe I&#39;m wrong. Maybe such sites are just places to throw out the most whacko, ten step beyond, fantasy theories possible. </p>

<p>Your theory makes Flat Earth look kinda reasonable. </p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t have any proof of the terrorists.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in the camp that believes it was done by a small faction within the Government along with the the help of selected individuals outside of the Government. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a question for you. 
Where was George HW Bush that day? </p>

<p>Did you know that old HW Bush is probably the only person alive that heard about the death of President Kennedy that can&#39;t tell you where they were that day?</p>

<p>Yes, conspiracies exists. </p>

<p>Fortunately, those theories and everything else in the world are firmly bound by the laws of physics. </p>

<p>Perhaps you should start a new sub to discuss whatever fantasies you&#39;re into.</p>

<p>Pretty much nnything goes around here...</p>

<p>As long as it&#39;s legal to discuss and doesn&#39;t insult too many sensibilities of morality there can be a sub for it on Reddit. </p>

<p>Even furries are welcome...</p>
