       Fuck ideaology. If you want to understand brainwashing just dig into the root of the trendiest beliefs today. Most people don't seem to get that communism, leftism, socialism is not ok. Sure you might mean well, people of the world should unite against war oppression etc. But we have all the evidence that the social movement of the 60s was infiltrated and co-opted by COINTELPRO. That means your well meaning social justice group is pushed to become an aggressive over emotional communist front. This is done to discredit you. You may rightfully stand against Trump but the real question is 'as what?' What ideaology are you actually bringing to the table? The world is not going to become a better place because you hate something and you're willing to become divisive. Remember 'Be the change you want to see in the world' etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub used to be pretty good about calling out the bullshit on the left and the right, now it seems we're just blaming leaders while condoning rather harmful ideaology. The right has largely shut up after the nightmare of Bush and the Tea Party movements and now the left has become this reactive, cajoling force. People don't seem to realize that the elite will switch idealogical positions faster than a channel surfing baby boomer. The left can be played and the right can be played. We need a bit more wisdom to find the middle ground in this. The traditional counter-cultural movement cannot be trusted, it was infiltrated a long, long time ago. You must reject the herd. The people we are fighting are not stupid.

       I just find it interesting that you think it's perfectly fine to advocate for a totalitarian ideology that is responsible for the murder of millions of people in the 20th century and you face no consequences for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if someone were to advocate for the related ideology - fascism, which was just a reaction to communism (and killed far less people) - people would freak out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just goes to show you that the Communists basically won - they killed far more people than the fascists ever could, and even though communism eventually failed due to its own horrible brutality - still people advocate for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would think they would be ashamed of themselves for promoting such a disgusting, anti-human murderous ideology, but nevertheless they do it without shame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironic.

       i wouldn't call socialism a totalitarian ideology,  from my limited understanding of communism, a true communist state never existed... the u.s.s.r never transitioned into true communism... look im not going to start busting down doors forcing people to live the way i think is best/advocate for an approach like that , that why i said i think it could work, but we are not ready for it.. because were too violent, hateful, stupid, greedy, distrustful etc... to have a real socialist/communist state... and couldn't it be argued that facism .. if a reaction to communism would be the opposite(kind of like punk was a reaction to disco/ the extreme musicianship of the super bands of the era) ... i dont see how they are related,  i don't know/presume to know the answers to all the worlds problems, i just have an opinion, and in mine.. socialism could work =)

       interesting stuff(seriously)... i still don't believe that just because some dudes messed up its execution, socialism can never work, and i dont think it inherently is a totalitarian philosophy... i blame people.. is there a fallacy for making a generalization based off of only a few examples?

       They didn't mess up the execution - they abused the powers of the state using communism and socialism as excuses to do it.  Lenin and Stalin knew what they were doing.  It is referred to as a totalitarian philosophy because almost every single instance of socialism and communism in government ends up with overarching government control of its citizenship and abuse of power in one way or another.  Any government that requires a massive centralization of power should never be trusted.

       i just fell into a rhetorical rabit hole.. so it sounds like maybe by pointing out my use of the 'no true scotsman fallacy' your commiting the 'fallacy fallacy' ... and maybe the guy i was originally conversing with was using the 'converse accident fallacy' ... but im no logician, how do you feel about socialism?

       I wouldn't say I've committed a fallacy, I just pointed out that you are widening the goal posts when it comes to what you define as communism just because the biggest examples of communism happened to be the worst, and by admitting this you hurt your own argument that we have never had a 'true' communist or socialist government, which is inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for socialism itself, it's a very attractive government
       <em>
        on paper
       </em>
       , or within small groups of people where socialism can be effective - for example, hunter-gatherer groups were almost completely socialist in nature, or you can look at the top 1% who regularly practice socialism amongst each other.  For the average person, though, socialism invariably ends up stifling competition that drives advances in technology and quality of life, gives more power to big centralized governments, the stronger better and faster workers inevitably end up carrying the load for the less equipped of society, and socialism itself relies on theft of personal wealth and property by the state, such brings to mind the old Thatcher quote: "The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money".  There's a lot more to the argument but that's my $0.02

       i can definitely see your side of the argument, and agree with most of it... i think maybe my original comment might of been too vague.. 'i think socialism could work were just not ready for it' because were not evolved enough as a species. but that might be another logical fallacy, the idealist phallacy maybe =)
      </p>
      <p>
       do you think there is anything to be done about the trend of  increasing centralized government, im not necessarily against it.. it just seems like we dont have the representation we ought to(maybe ranked choice voting would be a good start). i mean in my limited understanding. we started as small family groups then larger one, than settled down to make villages, then city's then city states, it seems kind of inevitable to me, and doesn't have to be bad.

       lol,  it could too, i guess it depends on what you value. for me.. nazism isnt something id want/think beneficial for humanity, socialism(in my opinion) is... unless you meant that nazism is the same as socialism, which in that case i disagree.

       The CIA has always run the "non-Soviet left." They didn't want people to side with the USSR, so they invented a "lifestyle left" via publications like Playboy magazine and Rolling Stone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA promoted feminism, Black Power, sexual liberation, racial integration, and pushed cultural Marxism.
      </p>
      <p>
       This had the effect of keeping people from demanding a bigger slice of the economy because they were too busy bitching about racism, sexism, the patriarchy, homophobia, etc.

       That makes a lot of sense.  I've always wondered if communism is the natural evolution of the left, where is the real communism? They played both ends against the middle,  like you said. What aheadfuck.

       I agree that socialism is a bad idea, however, appropriate social programs can exist within a capitalistic democratic republic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firefighters, Public Schools, etc., etc. I'm sure you've seen the examples a hundred times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to live in a country where those who are more fortunate have the moral sense to ensure that those who are struggling are helped and taken care of, instead of it being necessary for the government to set and maintain social programs to ensure that everyone does their fair part. But a lot of us are selfish assholes who wouldn't help a dying man in the street.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until we fix that, social services (democratic socialism) is the only way to go so that everyone has an equal right to life (and is good health too much to ask for?), liberty, and the ability to pursue their own happiness.

       Ok but can humanity do any better? I argue against extremism but also absolute pragmatism. Ever heard of Zizeck? He argues that it's a bit like caffeine free diet coke. It's essence is completely changed and it tastes like shit but it allows you to pretend.

       Can humanity do any better? I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until we face some form of extraterrestrial threat (meteor, asteroid, aliens), and have a reason to consider the whole of humanity as "us" and the threat as "it/them", I don't think we'll make a leap towards working for the betterment of all humanity any time soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, we will always be relying on those that
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       the problem to try to find a way to fix the problem. That's much more difficult.
