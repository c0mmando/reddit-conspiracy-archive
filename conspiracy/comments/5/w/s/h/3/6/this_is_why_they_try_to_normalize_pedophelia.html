<p>Here are some jems:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>jaywalking =&gt; willingness to commit crime</p>

<p>IS the same as</p>

<p>child porn =&gt; willingness to commit crime.</p>

<p>If any crime committed shows you&#39;re willing to commit crimes, then you need to be careful around anyone that speeds, smokes weed, jay walks, or murders, all the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and comparing smoking weed with using CP:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I smoke weed which means I break the law. Better lock me up. I might go out and rape a bunch of kids. Don&#39;t know when I might stop!</p>

<p>Right? That&#39;s the logic if I&#39;m understanding you properly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>what&#39;s really amazing is the downvoting of totally reasonable comments such as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A normal person can also have consensual sex with other adults. A pedo cannot do this, a child cannot give consent so any activity with them is tantamount to assault/rape... the fact is if they were caught looking at kiddie porn, they have proven they are willing to break the law edit because people can&#39;t reason (in regards to fulfilling their sexual desire for children), and it is impossible to know where they draw the line</p>

<p>if those hacked files do contain CP on them, the only way to prove it is to look at them. in which case you are breaking the law.</p>

<p>So if someone gives you the password and says they are CP, you are breaking the law if you look at them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then how do you intend to prove anything illegal? </p>

<p>And it&#39;s a philosophical argument. Everyone is willing to break the law if the consequence vs reward isn&#39;t high enough. Police barely enforce jay walking. They also don&#39;t really enforce viewing CP unless your on all the sites all the time for a long period of time. Anyone can get redirected to a site. People just don&#39;t want to watch that shit because they aren&#39;t pedos. Owning and distributing it is another matter altogether.</p>

<p>And law enforcement are kinda exempt from those laws since they have to do investigations. You are not exempt from them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is mild about watching CP?</p>

<p>If you get off on watching a child be abused, then you do not belong in society! That&#39;s it. There&#39;s is nothing about jay walking that is philosophically on the same level as watching/owning/distributing CP.</p>

<p>I have nothing to back this up atm, but I bet you pedophiles who use CP are more likely to abuse children. It makes common sense, criminals in one area are more likely to be criminals in other areas (and this is more along the lines of crimes that have victims, not pot-smoking or jay walking, which are hardly &quot;crimes&quot; in the proper sense of the word). Don&#39;t be semantic or complicate this issue, it is quite clear cut. </p>

<p>Even if you do not think my logic holds up, there is nothing comparable about CP and jay walking/weed smoking, which was the point of this post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i said milder not mild, i think semantics do matter since that&#39;s not what i said. given a choice between cp and child abuse cp is less dangerous obviously, similar statistics where porn is avaliable in countries/places, sexual assualt and rape go down. pretty simple if people can just get themselves off they aren&#39;t as hormonal.
i think it&#39;s just important we don&#39;t prejudge before they have done something more serious because they have done something similar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think OP fails to realize some fundamentals about the issue.</p>

<p>Yes, pedo is bad. We can all agree.</p>

<p>Should it be illegal to view fake CP? What about CP should make it illegal to even see? Protecting pedophile politicians?</p>

<p>Why does possession of CP result in greater sentences than the people making it?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t eliminate the bad part of human nature and it is a complex issue.</p>

<p>The problem, as relevant to r/conspiracy is that the CIA is aiding and abetting a variety of pedophile rings, studying smaller, naturally occurring networks, and then combining them and funneling their resources.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is basically illegal for you to catch them in the act.</p>

<p>As a censorship issue, it is protecting the pedophiles.</p>

<p>As a legal issue, it is given more serious weight than the people who are doing the abusing.</p>
