       The problem is, we don't really have good replacments. We have... Google, reddit, facebook, youtube.  And all four of them have shown that they censor information and suppress opposing viewpoints/information.  We also already know Schmidt is involved in presidential campaign and census analytics, we know Zuckerman is interested in getting into politics, and im sure Alexis is too.

       Yeah, but lest we find a quick replacement,  we need the Internet to assist us in giving the final blows (whether it be to organize to meet in public, or leak, spread/share information).

       If they get desperate, they will likely kill the Internet in some way which would really set back any progress in nailing their coffins.

       I feel like this net neutrality issue has been politicized much like the affordable care act, or the right to work.   The ACA is no where near "affordable" and supporting the "right to work" is actually against worker's rights...
      </p>
      <p>
       So.... is "going after" "net neutrality" supporting of the people's free and censored/blocked internet, or is it supporting the censorship and control of the internet?

       Totally get the point, we get tons of doublespeak today(you brought up my favorite: right to work).  I think what we have to do is inspect the insides of everything and come out with a position on it.  The ACA, we knew it would end up being pretty expensive for a lot of people especially when the best part of it was left up to states to decide.  Right to work, you can simply see what the true meaning of that is just reading a tiny bit about it.  With net neutrality, I've inspected and for me its something I really want to keep.  I can't justify giving corporations the right completely block parts of the internet from its users if it so chooses too.  Can you imagine if to get to alt-news sites you had to pay an extra fee, or have the speed throttled so its unusable?  This would give corporations a whole new way to control the masses and make finding the truth even harder for normal people.  I can also see the commodification of websites even further, for example, to access youtube you will have to by the Google™ internet package extra.  I just can't see giving these corporations that much power and having them use it for good.

       i don't see why we can't consider this a country of sorts, idk about any of you, but i feel i reside more in my head than say, my arm, or my torso. when we are all discussing something, it resonates in a way that is not dissimilar to people having a conversation in physicality. We discuss things online as though we were talking amongst if not true friends, comfortable acquaintances. We speak boldly our views,  make offhand jokes, and try to sort through the murk, We do this, together, Without the membership fees and chains that comes with the unions, without the special jackets, emblazoned with silk thread, in shapes of ancient ties. We come together, here.. in this space, differing religions, genders, sexualities, colors, we come together and dominate this "space."
      </p>
      <p>
       if we were all on one continent, we would be unstoppable and that is how they have forced our tempered compliance. We now have this. And in ten years time, we have changed the world, perhaps it is time to change our definition of "citizen."

       From my understanding we can work around the nodes you mention. We can make new nodes. There is no way they can completely shut off the internet, especially in a "first world" country. There's also the "dark web."
      </p>
      <p>
       They would shut down the internet. Immediately pissing off pretty much every nerd in the world. All the "hackers" would come out of the wood work and act as ISPs. That would happen literally overnight. What will take time is educating the super newbs in the "new" format. As far as actual content is concerned, we would probably have a better internet than exists now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you're too young, but remember back in the day, like late 90's early 2k when you could find really useful "fringe" stuff on accident because search results were actually honest, and not just trying to sell you crap. It would be even better than that, with faster bandwidth because we would still have the updated tech.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don think an internet shut down will even be attempted, let alone actually be accomplished, short of all out global war an civil unrest. Precisely because a potential consequence of doing so would probably cause global war and civil unrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are just going to try and dumb the internet down so it's like flipping though channels on late night tv without cable. When you've made it past the learning curves though, that situation is irrelevant to you.

        I really don think an internet shut down will even be attempted, let alone actually be accomplished, short of all out global war an civil unrest. Precisely because a potential consequence of doing so would probably cause global war and civil unrest.

       Already used as a response to/punishment for civil unrest in Cameroon. Certainly could happen elsewhere, but would be a desperation move and probably fail if used preemptively to suppress information or prevent civil unrest.

       I think they are going to stage a false flag "cyber terrorism" attack to justify internet regulation. Maybe from Russia? Something like this....

       They already have the public acclimated to the Russian hacker idea, and Trump has even come out in support of censoring the web. (And he sounded like a fucking retard when he said it)...

       Yea I suppose. It can't just be a cyber attack on the treasury. There would have to be real damage as well. Otherwise the general public won't see it as a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if they attack the electric and water grids, maybe break an already weakened dam or two, that's something people will feel.

       Now you're getting the idea. There will most definitely be a false flag. Anyone seen the movie "live free die hard"?. It's a great propaganda movie starring Bruce Willis, about how everything is essentially now controlled with computers. In this film, a group of rogue hackers are able to wreak havoc on DC. I believe they even use the term "domestic cyber terrorist" in the movie. That came about in 2007, they usually try to prime and program the population with films before these things Happen, providing you with a familiarity with the subject, and more likely to get your support for the Internet regulation to stop this "cyber Terrorism", you recall seeing in an action film years ago...

       Which if executed correctly, would be an amazing thing.  Plugging in every American directly into the political system.  Open transparency on politicians, using live streams and other technology to spread news and information about the political process.  What a powerful tool that would be!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       However, we should know better.  If Facebook were controlled much like a jury in America (tax-paying, law abiding citizens formulating their own independent opinion on something using facts) then a system like that might actually work.   Won't be the case though.  The system would only become corrupt and Facebook as a government propaganda machine would be far more effective and controlling than our current propaganda mouthpiece, the main stream media via TV and radio.

       4chan has identified ISIS training grounds with google maps and sent the coordinates to the Russian military. This lead directly to Russian air strikes. Yes you're right, it is 4chan.

       As a non-American I think this guy suffers from the everpresent belief that everyone around the world is interested in the US. People wouldn't fly there to join in some rioting, people are concerned with their own personal lives, and aren't constantly watching the USA.

       After the recent 2016 election process (from primaries to inauguration).........  it sure feels like it.  Obviously not "everyone", because any generalizing statement like that is wrong.   The_Donald is full of non-Americans who are following Trump because they feel the same political movement is necessary in their country.  Like most times in History, the rest of the world follows the West.   Like it or hate it, that's the way it is.    We may be leading the world into the shitter, but we're leading them none the less.

       I'm British so I don't need lecturing on the rest of the world following the West. I think many Americans have this weird erroneous belief that they "lead the world" or some such, I think it's because they do have a large country and as such many never actually leave it. I have visited the US and reporting on foreign countries there is very lacklustre compared with many other places.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is often in world news stories because they do impact many places through conflict and such (creating ISIS by destroying Iraq, and the following European Migrant Crisis etc) but not because they are some beacon of progress to follow. Russia and China are not following America's lead.

       China and Russia have both had continuous spectrum of civilisations for thousands of years, even if the US completely vanished - those countries would continue to exist. Economically the world would have to adjust, but to say that huge countries around the world are relying on the US is simply not true.

       another good post about this. The government is essentially powerless. If they try to "fuck us into the stone age", as you put it, it would create a power vacuum. Other world powers such as China or Russia would try to take over the US. The government can't attack us otherwise, for fear that everyone could carry a gun. The moment they decide to try anything major, the whole country will be against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't destroy infrastructure, and they can't attack us en masse for fear of resistance from other countries. And they can't subjugate us, because the moment they do, someone will be shot. This is why we have the second amendment, and why so many of us fight to defend it. And why false flag events like Sandy Hook and Aurora happen, the globalists are capitalizing on past tragedy in order to weaken us, and force us to submit our rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       They already tried with Clinton's assault weapon ban and it didn't work. They just tried to put another Clinton in, and it didn't work. That won't happen, because the moment they do, all pressure to enforce our constitutional rights is lost. I imagine that something major is going to happen in the near future, one last attempt. Whatever it is, we'll all have to stand strong. Stay informed, build and enforce our emergency food and water supplies, and be active in the democratic process.

       In my opinion, karma exists. It might not, but it keeps me wanting to be a good person. I try to not let outside influences bring me down - haven't voluntarily listened to a commercial in years, and the music played on the radio is unbearable.

       There seems to be a push to take away creativity and individuality. For some reason a group of people (?) want a majority of the population addicted to drugs that make them dependent and dangerously vulnerable.

       I was 5 when I had 2 head injuries, my mom was sold drugs to help her control kids because she had more than she could handle. She admitted it when I was coerced to apply for benefits. I feel like any parental figure is a drill sergeant telling me to dig a hole and the other one to fill it, eventually I just keep going on when I live inside my head. Of course I live with people who have narcissistic tendencies. Also repression? I get more of a push/pull when religion is brought up since I refuse to keep a label. I don't identify with anything because why does this exist? Why is everyone I talk to only help me enough to get by like a beggar, but only if I stay silent. I've been through a job workforce program for over 8 years before I realized they didn't want to help place me. Doesn't help my mood when there's a death in the family, uncle who was helping ill grandma was also siphoning money from her. I wasn't allowed to go the the funeral because being at Grandma's is only for my sister and her, since I can't go. I've let go of the idea that my sister is a certain archetype but she hasn't seem to let go of any of her ideas of me. But to watch my family die and to be left without an opportunistic person just sucks. The nightmares I've gone through suggest I'm an easy target, no other explanation other than I'm supposed to be a slave type. Oh and karma? Only thing I could think of is being part of a major bloodline. Does my empathy levels make waves on their end? I'm pissed at all the misery we perpetuate on each other. I was brought up to believe we had "free agency" but that's sketchy to rebrand free will. Like how we rename rocky mountain oysters.

       Many people are encouraged for years to be a "slave type". It sucks that is what is wanted in the future, for citizens. I've seen people hoodwinked into programs that pretend to help, and I hope that you are just now finding your way.

       For far too long they have controlled the narrative.  Finally people are waking up.  So many people I know are turned off by the MSM left or right.  We gotta just hang in there.  Each one reach one.

       The fun fact about it is, is that the American people have always had the power over our government, its written down right in the constitution. Now, we really haven't had any reason to do anything against them, and if we did nothing better would be to come, because we don't have any way to replace them.

       It's funny how "getting redpilled" means embracing the government on this sub. And Hillary Clinton and the Dems are the Big Bad we alll need to be looking at while Republicans control the Executive, Supreme Court, Congress, and most state governments.

       Every action has a comparable and opposing reaction. They have been dividing us for centuries, and the consequences of that are catching up with them. Divide and conquer isn't going to work much longer. The revolution is coming. Things are still going to get worse before they get better though.

       The internet has changed everything. We are rebelling against our systems of control. Religion is on the decline in first world countries. The oligarchies are being exposed, and the upcoming generation has more empathy, and is more open minded than ever. When the old guard passes, change will be swift.

       As much as I'd love to believe that--I'll believe it when I see it. The internet is def. a new variable for sure. People from the 60s thought the same thing, my gen. as well and to be fair we have made some real progress in some areas, not so much in others. Don't be shocked when it doesn't happen quite as fast as you'd hoped or in quite the same way you've imagined.

       Open minded needs to include all people, not just the ones that agree. There is vicious bashing happening, and much of it is fake. Young people are being goaded to hate while yelling about being open minded.

       Religion isn't always a system of control, it can be good as well. It's just that it's easy to take advantage of. My church actively encourages people to keep food storage, prepare, and runs its own canneries, farms, storehouses, and cattle ranches.

       And also encourages you to avoid addicting or manipulative substances like alcohol, drugs, and to maintain a healthy life style.

       Never in modern history has the establishment been this strong. America was on the brink of a revolution, but then the establishment pulled off the Trump trick, and the awaking that was brewing was not only killed, but the establishment no longer needs to worry about the few remaining free thinkers, because the hoards zombified shills are on guard to attack them all in an instant, and then assist in putting those half awakening back to sleep with sweet lies the likes of "Never in modern history has the establishment been this weak and exposed". It's sad to see that We The People have lost.

They are freer than ever to fuck the citizen up the rectum with no lube and get away with it, because the stupid sheeple worship the God Emperor so hard core, he can fuck them over any way he wants, and they'll still seek to justify getting fucked. In other words - we're screwed like we've never been before!

       On what basis is the Establishment exposed and weak? They seem alive and well with their new man Trump.  Do ppl here actually think Trump will expose the high level pedos in government? No, he will do what has always been done, use this knowledge as blackmail. Trump promised to lock Hillary up when he came into the office. One of his first announcements was to say that he will not actually pursue criminal charges. The Clintons were at Trump's wedding for fucks sake.

       I would love for this to be true, but the people in power are still handing out big money to those who help the establishment. Obama for instance just got a 60 million (a milestone btw) for a book deal from Penguin. Sounds like a big payoff to me. Is it just me, or does anyone else here think that a president shouldn't be getting millions for a book deal, let alone any book deal such as this, especially right out of the gate of leaving the white house (sounds like a bribe to me). It's not as if Obama is going to tell us anything important in the book. It's going to be full of bullshit.
