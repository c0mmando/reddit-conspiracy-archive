<p>Nah, though.  Not this time.  I think the partisan show takes priority.  If the official CIA narrative held that the President was a respectable person, your prediction would work better.  Since the official narrative is that he&#39;s a Russkie buffoon, only partisan theater predicts who claps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Partisanship is a weird phenomenon that people think only applies to the other side.  So even if the Republicans all thought it was partisanship, they&#39;d still clap rather than being upset by it.  Better still, if they thought it was partisanship, they&#39;d clap even if they were corrupt.  They might clap to conceal corruption too, as ac-phil pointed out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except it wasn&#39;t cracking down on corruption. It was his weak-ass attempt to &quot;drain the swamp&quot; EO, but he put lobbyist into every position of power they wanted. He has the most Goldman Sachs former employees on his staff, he has De Vos who literally paid her way into her position, ect. He is the most corrupt president since Nixon and more than half the USA knows it. It is like a wolf talking about getting the best protection ever for the sheep, and then the sheep clapping while the wolves eat their fill whenever they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of those picks had heavy influence from the Republicans too. Trump is an impostor in their party, but it benefits them both to play nice. With that said, I think the Republican party isn&#39;t a huge fan of President Trump - they would much have rather won with a true Republican lifer (Trump was a democrat for over 20 years before going independent in 2008). He has to have had given the Republicans a few bones to chew on, and i&#39;m sure a bunch of cabinet picks were things that he doesn&#39;t care so much about. I think Trump was most concerned with the security side - his military guys, his AG, his judges... he wants legal backing and he wants protection for some reason, and that&#39;s why I think the drain the swap thing could end up having teeth down the road. I get that he did not go completely eccentric with his picks, but remember that these people can be replaced quite often. Obama went through cabinet members like crazy; it was constantly a revolving door of people in that inner circle. So maybe if these people suck and people rage, Trump will fire them? I think he will be willing to listen to people - just not the media.</p>
