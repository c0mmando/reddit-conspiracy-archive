<p>Agree, but how much longer?  There were a lot of people who voted for Obama for the same reasons, he sold that &quot;hope and change,&quot; people who didn&#39;t see the Chicago tribal influence bought his outsiderness as well.   Even after 8 years of the same ol bullshit, people still believe he was a good president who was just doing what he could.  It&#39;s getting harder and harder to see Trump as something different, harder and harder to hold on to any hope.</p>

Trump doesnt need anymore money, I got a feeling he was kicked out or not allowed to join the secret societies so hes sticking his fingers up to them. If he does sell out hes got the world to answer too because everyone is waiting for his move to save humanity and if he doesnt the people will.</p>

We are all so beautiful, talented, creative, and THEY try to hold us ALL down. We all have a beautiful spark of light in us from the creator. There is evil in this world that LOVES to feed on our fear and negativity. Don&#39;t let them. Write on the walls, graffiti should be everywhere. Spread a message of love. You are much more powerful than you could ever imagine. When we come together we are a force that cannot be reckoned with.

    <div class="md"><p>Well said brother. Love is the uniting energy that binds us all. When you come from a place of the heart it can solve any problem and melt any divisions. The powers that be want us divided and fighting amongst ourselved. The only way they survive is through manipulation and division. But I strongly believe that people are waking up to the divine truth that they are here for a purpose. Some much larger then themselves and part of something so great that it is hard to describe. Each person is on their own journey yet part of the collective. And as we experience what we go through life it leads us closer to that truth. People are waking up and it&#39;s a great time to be alive. </p>

<p>I do agree with the notion that Trump is an &quot;outsider&quot;. That&#39;s not to say he isn&#39;t a greedy corporate billionaire who has fucked people over for huge amounts of money. He&#39;s an outsider to the class of the ruling elite. He wasn&#39;t privy to the &quot;plan&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>The_Donald had an AMA with one of Trumps&#39; right hand man</p>

<p>Question: Is President Trump aware of the deep state ties to Antifa, other liberal terrorist organizations, and George Soro? Does he plan to address Soros directly and his funding of domestic terrorism?</p>

<p>Answer:We are well aware of liberals and the destruction they are capable of. We are also well aware of George Soros and his influence, particularly financially, with America&#39;s biggest social problems. Even more importantly, Soros knows that we know and is already attempting to hide his financial network from us to avoid whats coming his way. His son has taken over US operations while he attempts to rally Europe behind Anti-Trumpism. It wont work - the money flow will soon cease as will his power to influence our great nation. Until then, keep his name in the headlines so he feels the heat. Berkeley is partially a reaction to our most recent moves.</p>

<p>One of the best AMAs Trump related</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">n/a</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Metabro.html">Metabro</a> 2017-02-28</p>
    <div class="md"><ol>
<li> On judging the value of regulations based solely on their numbers.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>Regulations are not bad or good.  Just like a hammer or other tool (say a gun) is not inherently bad or good.  </p>

<p>When people tell you that you have too many tools as a reason to not buy the one you need for the task at hand, they are trying to keep you from completing the task at hand.  </p>

<p>For instance, the tea party Koch&#39;s say &quot;regulation bad&quot; like they are speaking to cave children.  Then they go and fight for fines on solar.  Why?  Because they understand that regulation is one of the tools in their tool shed that can be changed in order to shape their world as they see fit.  </p>

<p>They tell the average person to drop their tool, that it&#39;s worthless, that too many is &quot;bad.&quot;  Why?  Because it makes it so they are the only ones shaping the world.  </p>

<p>Regulations should be looked at individually rather than as a whole.  If you see one that isn&#39;t needed anymore or that isn&#39;t working it needs to be changed.  But anytime you hear someone say that the way we should decide whether to go through with some new regulation is by counting how many we have then you are getting had.  </p>

<ol>
<li> Climate change and why we should not wait.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>Evidence for climate change is not like evidence for water on Mars.  I&#39;ll explain why that distinction is important.  </p>

<p>The evidence for water on Mars is collected by a small range of scientists.  These scientists are not basing their science on that of zoologists or other fields of science.  </p>

<p>With climate change scientists across the board are seeing the change.  Vastly different fields are finding evidence that backs up the science of thousands of other scientists that have never communicated.  </p>

<p>The work that needs to be done along with the evidence collecting work, is putting all of the work together.  Scientists in separate fields need to look at work that they normally wouldn&#39;t in order to help us have a bigger picture of the effects and how to stop them.  </p>

<p>That being said, we don&#39;t need to wait for evidence to begun acting.  If it were anything else we could wait and see.  But since it involves world health and world economies, and the very life of our species, we need to not roll the dice and wait.  We need to not take chances.  Not only because every new bit of science corroborates the idea that green house emissions will cause a green house effect, but because the risk of being wrong is too high.  </p>

<p>We can act now and find out we were wrong about climate change being a hoax.  Nothing lost.  The world still exists in that scenario.  </p>

<p>We can also not act and find out that it was a hoax.  Which is what you are hoping.  </p>

<p>But not acting, and finding out the hard way would be, of course the biggest mistake.  We can&#39;t make that mistake, so we have to act.   </p>

<p>Not just because scientists are showing us evidence, but just in the off chance that thousands of scientists that don&#39;t know each other aren&#39;t part of a hoax (where they get paid no hush money, never get invited to extravagant parties, hardly ever get laid for their troubles, etc, etc.).</p>

<ol>
<li> As far as personal insults are concerned.  I will retract my comparison of Trump to anyone in the Madison family.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>But I will give a more objective description of Trump:</p>

<p>He is our first orange president.  This is to be celebrated.  </p>

<p>He is our first president to have tan lines around his eyes.  </p>

<p>He is our first president in over two hundred years to have long hair.  </p>

<p>His hairdo is oddly not unkempt, but coiffed in a meticulous comb-over that is not the fashion for any other human being.   </p>

<p>His hair is thin a whispy and strawberry blonde, verging on red.  </p>

<p>His is overweight, and out of shape.  </p>

<p>His shoulders are narrower than his waist.  </p>

<p>His lips are pouty.  </p>

<p>His neck is thin accept for the fat that hangs under his chin.</p>

<p>False.  Central control of money through central and fractional reserve banking are the disease.  The cure is to have free market based money systems.  Markets can then satisfy demands of people worldwide with money that retains its value.  Examples are precious metals and Bitcoin or other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>I believe in the separation of money and state in the same way I believe in the separation of church and state.  Then we won&#39;t have massive wealth continuously siphoned off of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  Communities of people can still decide boundaries of behavior for private economic actors.  For example, it might be decided to limit pollution emissions.  This would be enforced upon actors in that locale.  I believe the &quot;unrestricted&quot; here means fair competition among private actors where some actors are not advantaged by regulatory bureaucracy or by being a monopoly.</p>

<p>So then the drive for the states to decide is just a tactic to stop specific regulations from going through.  </p>

<p>The push toward that, in all instances, ignores the fact that communities are for the most part larger than a state or county today.  </p>

<p>Wikipedia describes it as &quot;The free market is a summary description of all voluntary exchanges that take place in a given economic environment. Free markets are characterized by a spontaneous and decentralized order of arrangements through which individuals make economic decisions.&quot;</p>

<p>In this case all exchanges are voluntary, decentralized, and spontaneous and individuals are making economic decisions.  I&#39;d say that qualifies, wouldn&#39;t you?</p>

How would ending fiat-money necessarily mean a fascist state?  </p>

It&#39;s an authoritarian centralized government that nationalizes industries deem critical for the state to function and uses violence to suppress dissent. Mussolini used nationalism to whip up support for his fascist state but the tool used to delude the public is not important to the cause.  </p>

<p>In the US the DNC uses Cultural Marxism to create a fervent base and they want centralized government control. Not merely of our country but of <em>all</em> countries. The post-modern Democrats are the most fascist party in American history.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s aspects of truth in your statement, but you&#39;re throwing out the baby with the bathwater.</p>

<p>It seems to me that you equate government with authority, but that&#39;s really only as true as you allow it to be. I agree that any authority outside of yourself is to be questioned at all times and rejected if it aims to subjugate you or your loved ones. But to claim that government has no use and needs to be rejected strikes me as a pretty naive suggestion.</p>

<p>How would you go about building and maintaining critical infrastructure? Who is to pay for it and how would the bill be divided amongst the population? Who is to have the power to investigate, prosecute and jail harmful criminals? Who is keeping you from exerting your free will anyway?</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m not saying &quot;Don&#39;t worry, everything&#39;s fine, nothing to see here!&quot;, not by a long-shot. Current governments around the world are corrupt beyond compare and will need to be broken, but my point is, we will still need to rebuild them if we want to prosper. The point is, we will have to ensure full transparency and a circular system of oversight to avoid falling into the same traps of authority, corruption, and oppression that we have found ourselves in.</p>

<p>Government has its place in society as an organizing and resource allocating tool, but it&#39;s currently gone way out of hand and needs to be rebuilt from the ground up with vastly fewer oppressive powers.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my view at least. May well be that you&#39;re right after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nationalism in context with globalism is not a synonym for patriotism. it is an economic philosophy. the nationalism you&#39;re thinking about is political/identity nationalism. economi nationalusm is not inherently racist, but political nationalism is.</p>

<p>you can absolutely be a nationalist without being a racist, it just depends on the type you are. political nationalism is actually pushed and propagandized for very hard in this country, but the pushers--the govt, the schools, the sports teams, the MSM etc--purposefully refuse to call it what it is. </p>

<p>the 99% is almost always nationalistic economically, even if they shy away from the word because it has been conflated with racist based anti-immigration sentiments since the 1880s. </p>

<p>nationalist economic policy benefits workers and smaller businesses that cannot compete with large ones in terms of global rescource pricing and wages. it hurts large global businesses that rely on selling things made on the cheap abroad for larger profits back home, because it internalizes the externality of their offshoring through tariffs etc.</p>

<p>the history and conotation of nationalism has been interwined with populism and immigration, and highly propagandized in the motherland of global capitalism that is our country in order to kill it:</p>

<p>1860-1870--the west closes. all the land is now somebodies, if you don&#39;t have any, you aren&#39;t likely to get any now. unions and workers start making head way in their fights against their employers</p>

<p>1873--the panic of 1873 occurs, causing a global depression that lasts until 1879 (this was the great depression until the 1930s great depression changed it to the long depression).</p>

<p>1880-1890--native workers demand better conditions. a new flood of poor, unskilled europeans show up, filling every job left &quot;open&quot; by strikers. native born workers begin to hate them for being scabs. all gains made by workers in the previous decades are lost. </p>

<p>propaganda extolling america&#39;s open borders policy and its open arms policy of welcoming of immigrants begins being seen for the 1st time, capped off with the statute of liberty in 1886.</p>

<p>european nations use america&#39;s open border policy  at this time to &quot;solve&quot; their over populated, poor people problem.</p>

<p>most immigrants are actively recruited by US steel, glass, and coal companies, who used them to &quot;solve&quot; their union, strikes, and &quot;high&quot; wages problem.</p>

<p>1893--the panic of 1893 occurs, depression lasts until 1897.</p>

<p>booker t. washington, a black man, pleads for the borders to be closed because cheap white unskilled FOB immigrants are taking the only jobs open to blacks, relegating them to lay about ne&#39;er do wells.</p>

<p>the populist party is founded to take the country back from the robber barron capitalists and close the borders to protect native workers and their power to organize effectively against their employers for better wages, hours, and working conditions. the official name of the populist party is the people&#39;s party.</p>

<p>1890-1900--populist party begins having limited success with getting the govt to close the borders. </p>

<p>the infamous chinese exclusion act gets passed to bar cheap, unskilled chinese immigrants, forever equating anti-immigration and populism with racism. the chinese exclusion act will be used as cudgel against all those calling for restricted imigration in the name of native workers from now on.</p>

<p>1921--the 3% quota immigration act passed limiting european immigration. millions of europeans wanted to immigrate in the aftermath of WW1. the policy has been condemned ever since as being racist and unfair to eastern europeans. </p>

<p>1924--statute of liberty raised from just NYC statue, to a national monument. as FDR said, &quot;there are no coincidences in politics.&quot;</p>

<p>1933--populism is rebranded by foes as political nationalism, linking it to the nazis and the facists. in the US political nationalism was and is an oxymoron. </p>

<p>political nationalism began in the late 1800s in europe as a movement by various ethnic/lingual minorities in countries throughout europe, but mostly eastern europe, to get their own countries based on their ethnic idenity. political nationalism is inherently racist and bigotted, by the very minorities demanding it as much as by the ethnic majorities inspiring them.</p>

<p>populists were pro-worker/pro-farmer economic nationalists. they were also fierce advocates for democracry and fierce foes of ploitical/govt corruption. they had absolutely no interest in creating little sub-nations for every ethinic group in the US (which even in the late 1800s included just about every group in the world). </p>

<p>the facists in the US in the 1930s were literally all east coast WASP blue bloods like prescott bush. that&#39;s some powerful propaganda reality shifting right there. even the racist, political/identity nationalistic screeds were almost all written by ivy leaguers and in evrey case arguing for the supremacy of the anglo-saxon. the populists and working class were low anglo-saxon members.</p>

<p>immigration takes a back seat from the 1930s to 1946, then the drum beat for open immigration policy starts peeking up, but from 1945-1970 unions are too strong. even migrant workers under cesar chavez effectively unionize.</p>

<p>1970-1980--the neocon and neoliberal globalists start having greater and greater successes against unions, and a new statue of liberty imigration propaganda push kicks off again right in step with the 3rd way DLC democrat identity politics coup, which killed economics as the issue of the left, and replaced it with bourgeois identity sympathizing.</p>

<p>1980--reagan wins in a landslide (the dems had lost labor to reagan, because blue color workers didn&#39;t have the upper middle class luxury of making sure everyone received the dignity and respect they deserved. but joke was on them, reagan fucked them over in the end).</p>

<p>1980-1990--unions are in full retreat, rust belt keeps rusting. amnesty for current undocumented peoples already living here through the immigration act of 1986, which focused a large part on cracking down on those employing undocumented workers. </p>

<p>the bill was attacked for discriminating against hispanics because potentially employers might refuse to hire any of them for fear they were illegal, so the fear of racism and discrimination was used to try to kill a bill that would help all workers, native and undocumented, by combatting the black labor market directly.</p>

<p>1990-2000--the NAFTA-WTO-GATTS-401k bataan death march of labor. all criticism labeled evil, naive nationalism. ross perot gets 19% on an anti-NAFTA 3rd party bid. is labeled a kook.</p>

<p>2000 to present--H1B visas, perenial talk about &quot;immigration reform&quot; that convenietly never does anything to help anyone on anyside, except businesses which employ black market labor.</p>

<p>dem party no longer even remembers the economic populism and nationalistic economics it was founded on. it is only concerned with identity politics now to the most absurd and granular degree. criticising black market labor gets one automatically branded a racist, with no discussion. no nuance is allowed (this worse now since the trump hysteria took hold). t.</p>

<p>he MSM pushes this meme relentlessly, silencing labor on this issue and shaming everyone who does not want to be labeled a racist into silence. unfortuanately, the ones who do speak out tend to be the actual racists, having no shame to silence. this is used as proof that economic nationalism is racist, neo-nazi facism.</p>

<p>you&#39;ll notice political/identity based nationalism in the US is never actually denounced. it&#39;s encouraged, even mandated--we are one the most flag waving, military cheering, pledge saying, war waging countries in the history of the earth. in fact, identity politicas is just a form of political nationalism writ small, saying that every possible affinity group, no matter how small, deserves its own &quot;country&quot; within our country. a house divided and all that be damned. or rather a house divided be easily manipulated.</p>

<p>what isn&#39;t allowed is economic nationalism, which is and always has been primarily an issue of economic survival, for both individuals and non-global businesses, and arguing this will get you labeled a racist and a nazi and a facist, by all who are not at least a few streets over from the actual racists etc</p>

<p>there is no label for political nationalism, because they pretend they are the same thing, and pretend that there is nothing to see when true political nationalism rears its head.</p>

<p>why? because economic nationalism empowers people and cuts into globalist profits, whereas political nationalism makes people proud of their economic oppression,  and unsympathetic to all the other folk beyond their border that their country is fucking up the as twice as hard. </p>

<p>it&#39;s very effective. most dem identity politic disciples don&#39;t care about black and brown people outside of the contiguous US. this is true of most bernie supporters as well--look how they went ape shit when it was pointed out that bernie has never opposed war on an humanitarian basis as poi ted out by people like chris hedges and amaju barraka.</p>

<p>that&#39;s globalism at work, because globalist economies cannot exist in counties nationalistic economies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I had to choose between Globalism vs. Nationalism, I think it&#39;s safe to say Globalism is far better for mankind in the long run...right? Nationalism (like religion) is just a tool used by those in power in order to divide us and spread fear. It&#39;s a propaganda tool to wage wars and actually convince average citizens they have a duty to kill other people in order to &quot;defend our country&quot;.</p>

<p>Globalism is scary when power is over-concentrated towards those at the very top, and they have no interest in lifting EVERYONE up as much as possible. But globalism should be the ultimate goal of mankind once we learn how to eradicate inequality and extreme class divide. Nationalism needs to go at some point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree.  Nationalism says &quot;Take care of yourself first, and THEN the Globe.&quot;  If everyone takes care of themselves then the entire globe is taken care of, and then we start to share and lift each other up.  </p>

<p>Globalism on the other hand is world-wide socialism, by force, not by choice.  And that&#39;s only the surface level talk, the real motive is elite power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we&#39;re seeing those same &quot;elites&quot; exploiting the system of capitalism to become more powerful than ever. Wealth is concentrated towards those at the very top fraction of 1%. And that&#39;s even more dangerous, imo, than a &quot;world-wide socialism by force&quot;. I&#39;m not in favor of extreme capitalism OR extreme socialism...in an ideal world they might both work in different ways, but unfortunately they&#39;ve proven to be terribly flawed systems when mixed with human weaknesses like greed and corruption.</p>

<p>But we&#39;ve also seen the negative consequences of extreme nationalism lead to MANY wars around the world throughout human history, especially the most recent world wars of the last century. If we don&#39;t solve the issue of nationalism soon, we may soon see another world war...and with modern weapons/technology, there&#39;s no telling what the end result of THAT world war would be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO there is a third &#39;faction&#39; at play which most don&#39;t think about - The Decentralization movement fueled by the Internet and the technologies it enables. So called &#39;globalists&#39; seek to control the world under one central system with them on top with obscene amounts of power and wealth. Through technology and the Internet, &#39;decentralists&#39; can counter this by building systems that remove central points of power &amp; influence and free/redistribute wealth from the old guard. This already started with the early days of the Internet, the rise of P2P filesharing networks and Bittorrent, and the rise of social media. We are now going into the next stage with wide spread use of cryptography (i.e encryption) and the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. If cryptocurrencies succeed, the global financial system will be flipped on its head and we will see the greatest transfer of wealth in human history... After that, the only thing left will be to combine it all to create truly decentralized governance, likely ending the entire concept of &#39;nations&#39; and resulting in a real &quot;new world order&quot; - but one that no one entity or group controls. We have the technology, we just have to put it into practice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>globalism refers to economic policy, not international kumbaya-ing. it is as much a propaganda tool as any other moniker, esp because it sounds noble.</p>

<p>globalism has caused more irrereprable harm than any thing else in history--hitler&#39;s &quot;nationalism&quot; was just like stalin&#39;s, just like mao&#39;s, obsessed with killing his own people. people seem to forget that the greatest evil germans did was to other germans.</p>

<p>there are no nationalistic arguments underpinning our bombing of 7 (or is it 8?) countries, the appeal is made directly to globalism.  the iraq war was based on a lie, but on a lie about the potential threat it posed the world, not us specifically.</p>

<p>identity based nationalism is disruptive, but having a nationality is not what predisposes one to lack empathy for people in other countries. competition is. competition caused by globalist economics pitting the world against itself financially in a race to the bottom. you&#39;ll work for $1 a day? I&#39;ll work for 50 cents.</p>

<p>global capitalism turns the into thunder dome.</p>

<p>when another country has a terrible natural disaster, the whole world, ordinary people too, care and try help. we already have the empathy. we&#39;re just beat down and desperate and kept freaked out at home by horrific dog and pony shows like the &quot;ooohhhh trump ahhhhh!&quot; farce.</p>

<p>i&#39;m anti-statist, but i&#39;m no globalist.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>globalism refers to economic policy, not international kumbaya-ing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definition of globalism: the operation or planning of economic and foreign policy on a global basis. So it&#39;s actually related to BOTH economic policy AND foreign policy (aka &quot;international kumbaya-ing&quot;).</p>

<p>And I think many of the issues that arise from globalism when viewed through the lens of modern economic policy is related to unchecked crony capitalism taken to the extremes that we&#39;ve seen happen within the US. When we allow a concentration of wealth/power that is able to influence policy-making and legislation via political corruption, which then leads to increased concentration of wealth/power because those at the very top of no desire/intention to &quot;spread the wealth around&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I have the answers to solve these issues, but I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s as simple as &quot;globalism vs. nationalism&quot; or &quot;capitalism vs. socialism&quot;...I think all of these systems may be wonderful in theory but eventually crumble when combined with human flaws. Perhaps there are some pros and cons to both nationalism AND globalism, as well as both capitalism AND socialism. We need to acknowledge the good AND the potentially bad aspects of each, and figure out what can be done to resolve them in a way that works best for overall majority of people rather than just those at the top 1%.</p>

<p>Bannon and Conway are both members of an organization that takes tons of corporate money. Literally you can link them to Rothschild money, the MOST globalist globalists in charge of globalism.</p>

<p>Mike Flynn was the only person in the whole administration who wasn&#39;t controlled opposition, and he&#39;s gone.</p>

<p>Doing business =/= accepting handouts in exchange for political favor. I don&#39;t take billions of dollars from Rothschilds to set up intentionally deceptive religious organizations like the Christian Dominionists (who are NOT Christian at all, they are globalist fat cats).</p>

Pretty obvious anyone duped by him didn&#39;t look hard enough. I know trumps flaws and some of his shady shit, but I do see logical explanations for them. For instance, he used the bankruptcy laws like any smart businessman would do. He&#39;s also a 9/11 truther and basically an anti vaxxer. Those are two huge reasons I think he&#39;s not controlled. </p>

Most upvoted in thread yet few children comments (which isn&#39;t shady in and of itself, necessarily). I&#39;ve seen similar messages in other threads on here as top comment (will keep eyes open for more for future reference). Their post history says they&#39;re a Trump supporter, yet they&#39;re beginning to show regret for supporting him. Also they mention weed a <em>lot</em> (even by my daily-toking standards), which ties into what u/sether22 was saying.  Suspicious to say the least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is under coordinated attack by ShareBlue and the reddit.com management in general.</p>

<p>This place is supposed to be a fringe sub full of UFOs and nonsense. Instead, it is one of the only free thinking places left on reddit.</p>

<p>So it has to be brought under control. Reddit.com is a Democratic party site, and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was not getting with the program.</p>

<p>So expect from now on Democratic party spam to be on the front page every day, with lots of comments, plenty of shills, and plenty of upvotes.</p>

<p>Reddit.com is NOT a free speech platform. It is an advertising and marketing platform.</p>

<p>The same stories are rehashed with no new evidence day after day. Stories about busts on prostitution stings are making the front page with titles implying that they are huge pedophilia busts related to pizzagate. Every day something negative comes out about Trump in the media, the front page is lined with stories deflecting from the news of that day. I think you are way off base here.</p>

<p>Every president has continued the war they started in the middle east and has highly supported isreal in these efforts. Obama said he would bring the troops home and instead continued the war picking up where bush left off, now trump is just picking up where Obama left off. Tons of actions trump plans to do are possible because of laws Obama passed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear they have planned to have him become president for a long time now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If people stop being your friend because they disagree with you on some &quot;political issue&quot; - considering that both parties are basically full of shit - were they really your friend to begin with?</p>

<p>This is especially a problem for so-called &quot;progressives.&quot; They believe that anyone who disagrees with them is &quot;evil&quot; - racist, sexist, x-ophobe, etc.</p>

<p>Of course no one could ever be friends with an &quot;x-ophobe&quot; so progressives have to stop associating with anyone who has different views.</p>

<p>Exactly like a cult - they are always trying to alienate you from your family and friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes - by labeling everyone outside of the cult as &quot;x-ophobe&quot; - doesn&#39;t matter which &quot;phobia&quot; - they are saying that anyone who isn&#39;t in the cult is &quot;evil&quot; and you shouldn&#39;t associate with them - including family.</p>

<p>This is what the Scientologists do when they call people who don&#39;t agree with Scientology &quot;suppressive person&quot; and demand you cut off all contact with them.</p>

<p>They police their own even more harshly. They have &quot;struggle sessions&quot; where the cult members are forced to &quot;confront their own privilege&quot; and confess to the group their &quot;inner racist thoughts&quot; to be ritually humiliated by the other members.</p>

<p>Watch this cult brainwashing in action, as the cult leaders has the crowd repeat his lines, then the crowd further away repeat their lines, with a technique called the &quot;Human Microphone.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen this human microphoning done on my campus recently, definitely seems like In-group members way erasing wrongthink from the crowd and opening the audience up to suggestion.  But whatever it is when they get to the slogans and chanting I&#39;m turned off, especially when it is used as a stratagem of argumentation against an opposing viewpoint.  Later, I get lunch with a friend and mention that the protest on campus that day seemed kinda ineffective and suddenly I&#39;m guilty of all manner of ills (for example).</p>

<p>Even if you agree with the issue, if you don&#39;t show enough enthusiasm, or maybe just think some particular tactic is counter-productive, that is &quot;negativity&quot; or &quot;doubt&quot; and it makes you just as bad as the &quot;enemy.&quot;</p>

<p>You have to feel bad for some of these people - especially if they have already been isolated away from their family and friend network.</p>

I first began to wake up to the deception when Obama signed the 2011 NDAA. It was at that point I realized there was no hope for true change in this current system. The matrix runs deep and permeates itself into fooling us back into it when we think we are escaping it. But more of us I think are waking up every day. To all truth seekers, don&#39;t give up, don&#39;t let the haters bring you down, and love your enemy.

<p>I say this as a Trump-voter. I pulled the lever for him, and I love the idea that he single-handedly ended two dynasties with his victory [the Clintons and the Bushes].</p>

<p>He was (as many called him) a human hand-grenade.</p>

<p>That said, the poster is right: Even Trump is operating within a fixed paradigm.</p>

<p>The truth is: As good as the wrecking ball feels as it slams against globalism, true liberation never comes from a political solution. It comes from philosophical, moral and spiritual advancement.</p>

<p>Ethical revolutionaries [like Jesus Christ] have always left a vastly larger imprint on human history than mere political rulers [Sancho I of the Kingdom of Navarre? Who the hell remembers him?]</p>

<p>History remembers Socrates, but not the mightiest African warlord from the 13th Century.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson made this concession when he said, &quot;The artiosts are humanity&#39;s true aristocracy&quot;.</p>

<p>And by &quot;artist,&quot; he means &quot;People with refined and elevated souls.&quot;</p>

<p>Our painters, our poets, our playwrights, our story-tellers....</p>

<p>No political tract will ever free your mind. No &quot;ism&quot; will ever solve your problems. No well-worked-out economics book will ever elevate you like the poetic works of T.S. Eliot. Or Jorge Guillen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t vote for Killary, nor for Trump. But let&#39;s be real here: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>He&#39;s filling top Cabinet positions to rich people, so is he draining the swamp or filling it up? Like, wtf?? </p></li>
<li><p>Deregulate coal mining? Do you honestly think coal mine companies will act in good faith by properly disposing of run-off ecologically?  Waterways &amp; rivers will be filled with arsenic &amp; others toxic poisons. </p></li>
<li><p>So he&#39;s going to increase military spending by $54 Billion. Why!? We&#39;re already outspending the next 10 biggest nations&#39; military budgets! (Google is your friend) </p></li>
<li><p>The Wall.... OK, instead of spending all that money on a huge concrete wall, build a solar panel wall and use the energy that you create from that instead of using coal to burn steam turbines that create electricity for us. You get two for the price of one! </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m concerned dude! Yeah, I&#39;m really happy Killary didn&#39;t get in because we&#39;d be in WWIII by now (I feel so anyways), but lately the Prez ain&#39;t doing things that I wanted him to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Oligarchs are in control, and they want us enslaved to either party. Fuck this 2 party tango, it&#39;s such a fucking scam! They make us fight each other instead of storming the Bastille! They&#39;re laughing their asses off at our expense. They don&#39;t care if we kill each other. </p>

<p>They know we&#39;ll make more babies because we have to tear up more resources &amp; do factory farming to keep the &quot;machine&quot; going with manpower. </p>

<p>Scary.</p>

<p>mention that the protest on campus that day seemed kinda ineffective and suddenly I&#39;m guilty of all manner of ills</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if you agree with the issue, if you don&#39;t show enough enthusiasm, or maybe just think some particular tactic is counter-productive, that is &quot;negativity&quot; or &quot;doubt&quot; and it makes you just as bad as the &quot;enemy.&quot;</p>

<p>You have to feel bad for some of these people - especially if they have already been isolated away from their family and friend network.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Odd, I see it as the exact opposite at this point. Sure I can see a little bit of what you mention but it seemed to appear more and more frequently as opposition to the huge influx of the_donald members. </p>

<p>The same stories are rehashed with no new evidence day after day. Stories about busts on prostitution stings are making the front page with titles implying that they are huge pedophilia busts related to pizzagate. Every day something negative comes out about Trump in the media, the front page is lined with stories deflecting from the news of that day. I think you are way off base here.</p>
