       Shut the fuck up bringing Hillary up already. She lost. She isn't an issue. The motherfucker in power talking about fighting states with legal marijuana, empowering private prisons and placing Goldman Sachs and Breitbart in control of our government is the fucking issue.

       Got some big words there little guy. Every genuinely intelligent American knows Hillary was deeply corrupt, so it does matter. Trump has proven to be anti-establishment, and pointing to his appointing a guy from Goldman and Sachs as proof he is a corporate stooge is a ridiculous attempt. Do you think every person that works at Goldman is pure evil? Is that what you're saying? Are you saying that every person that reaches the top of their respective industry is evil? Because that makes you seem really dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have any useful information to offer besides dumb shit insinuations (as if we're a bunch of occupy wall st dumbasses mindlessly hating anyone who has had success in life) I'm sure people would be open to hearing it. But your post sucks and from your name calling and dick sucking requests I'm going to go ahead and make the conclusion that you suck too.

       Settle on the legal marijuana.  Why does everyone want to freak out?  Spicer said he was the wrong guy, and then spoke anyway.  That was a mistake.

       I tell you have some trepidation from our commander in chief, as I do as a trump voter. But when the astroturfed movement on the neoliberal statist left is trying to twist every concern or policy difference into a groundswell for impeachment it's hard to even make those concerns known without feeding into it. I sure as fuck don't like any of the alternatives that the establishment might give us.

        credible rumors of her gearing up for a 2020 Presidential run
       </a>
       . And more importantly, using "she's done" minimizes her crimes and treason.

       Hillary will be done when she's dead or in a jail cell.

       Honestly. I cant even research on trump because of the garbage online, which is what drove me to believe trumps goal was to influence and hijack the truth movement. Google conspiracy and you get 10 pages about trump and alex jones. Tptb planned trump for a while, thats why he told obama he will have his job.. because he knew!

       If ever we had a shot for a revolution, it would be now. We took down hillary and the dnc. Now we need to band together to take back our government!
Trump is weak, we can do this... but we must expose bush, regean, clinton, and congress too. 
The supreme court will be on the peoples side.

       And maybe he would've, but all we did was sit around and do a whole lot of nothing as we watched him get fucked over. We should have revolted then. We watched as one of the only honest, smart politicians got completely fucking cheated, and we did nothing, it's our own fault.

       Yes. This sudden idea that Trump is this anti-establishment agent is easily refutable, and a very dangerous idea.

       Either Trump was going to be anti establishment and for the people or he would be exactly like all the other presidents and is just a puppet. I feel it was a fair gamble. We all knew what the alternative guaranteed.

       Has the president been selectively boxing out the press because they ask hard questions for decades? If you don't think things haven't gotten worse in the last month then I'm sorry you can't be honest with yourself.

       Somebody who cares about people. Im here to expose this nwo coup thats taking place.

       If ever we had a shot for a revolution, it would be now. We took down hillary and the dnc. Now we need to band together to take back our government!
Trump is weak, we can do this... but we must expose bush, regean, clinton, and congress too. 
The supreme court will be on the peoples side.
