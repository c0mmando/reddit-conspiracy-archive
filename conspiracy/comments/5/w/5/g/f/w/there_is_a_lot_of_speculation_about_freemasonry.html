        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">88</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-02-25 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/polkadotgirl.html">polkadotgirl</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many people post about Freemasonry, and I am always intrigued by their questions. I wanted to find some of the answers myself, so I downloaded &quot;33 Degrees of Deception: An Expose of Freemasonry&quot; by Tom C. McKenney. Everything I am about to write is summarized from this book in Part 1: Appendix A (if you&#39;re interested in verifying what I write). I did my best to avoid plagiarism, but all credit goes to this book. In addition, the author seems to be trustworthy, reliable, and knowledgeable about Freemasonry and writes a compelling tale.  The following is a summarized comparison between Masonry and Christianity. It is important to note that these are generalities:</p>

<p><strong>Jesus Christ</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Masons believe Jesus was just a man but a great man. He was like Aristotle, Plato, Pythagoras or Mohammed. </p></li>
<li><p>Christians  believe Jesus is the God incarnate, truly God and truly man. Anyone who denies or rejects him separates himself from God.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Bible</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Masons believe the Bible is one of the holy books of men, just like the Koran or Hindu scriptures. It is not meant for literal interpretation and only enlightened elders can understand its esoteric meaning.</p></li>
<li><p>Christians believe the bible is the true and inspired word of God. No part shall be added to or taken away, as stated in the New Testament.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>God</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>God is what we perceive him to be. Every understanding of God has some truth, and God can only be known in part. The only personal God is humanity &quot;in toto&quot;. The absolute is reason. (This part was a little more difficult to summarize, so let me know if you need clarification).</p></li>
<li><p>God is eternal, all-knowing, self-existent, sovereign, unchanging, etc. He is holy. There is only one God, and exists as the father, son, and holy-spirit. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Redemption</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Redemption is about improving one&#39;s self, morality, good works, and obedience to the death oaths, or Mason&#39;s obligations, and Masonic authorities. There is no faith in Jesus as a savior.</p></li>
<li><p>Christians believe that all have sin and fall short of the glory of God - nobody is righteous solely through good works. Jesus sacrificed himself for our sins - a perfect sacrifice. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Satan</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Satan does not exist; this is an assumption of mankind. In fact, they believe people have distorted the truth about Lucifer, the Light Bearer. Lucifer is good and can be used as an instrument for truth, but he is often misunderstood. (There may be more to this than noted in this book, and that is why you probably here that Masons worship Lucifer as God). </p></li>
<li><p>Christians believe that Satan is a fallen angel, the &quot;Father of Lies&quot;. He blinds people to God&#39;s light and seeks to be worshipped as a god. He is an enemy that must be resisted, and Jesus came to destroy his works. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Spiritual Light and Darkness</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>All people are lost in darkness. Only Masonry will help people find the light.</p></li>
<li><p>Christians believe that Jesus is the light.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prayer</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Masons offer prayers to the &quot;Great Architect of the Universe&quot; and they must be universal in order not to offend anyone of varying beliefs. They are NEVER to be made in Jesus&#39;s name.</p></li>
<li><p>Christians believe prayer should be made to God the heavenly father in the name of Jesus. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Truthfulness</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lying can be right if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Christians must speak in truth at all times.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Secrecy</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Secrecy is essential to masonry and protected by blood oaths.</p></li>
<li><p>Christians believe that there are no secrets in God&#39;s kingdom, and all truth will ultimately be revealed. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Blood Oaths</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Blood oaths are made to protect the secrets and are what makes a man a Mason. They are essential to Freemasonry.</p></li>
<li><p>Christians should not take such oaths.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Seeking and Finding</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>In Masonry, the truth is a never-ending search.</p></li>
<li><p>Christians believe the truth is knowable through Jesus. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exclusiveness</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Only the enlightened few can know the truths and secrets of Freemasonry.</p></li>
<li><p>Christians believe anyone can come to Jesus. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>

<p>I am not here to convert anybody, and I believe we are all on a journey to truth. However, as I explore pop culture and this modern world, it seems that the Freemasonry version of God is promoted all over. I always look to Oprah because I used to like her growing up. She was the first to say something profound - maybe there are many pathways to God.</p>

<p>Now that I am older, I feel this is the ultimate conspiracy. I wonder if people are being tricked spiritually in modern times to believe that this is so, that there are many ways to God, when in reality, one can only find God through Jesus. </p>

<p>Of course, I know there are varying beliefs on this sub, and I am not here trying to say I am &quot;right&quot; or anybody is wrong. However, this is a conspiracy sub, and this does make for an interesting conspiracy. </p>

<p>I am always wary of what is &#39;cool&#39; or &#39;popular&#39;, and right now, that interpretation of God seems to be what is promoted in our society. This new age interpretation can be summarized like this:</p>

<p>*Anyone can reach God through any belief.
*We can find God in ourselves.
*Focus on ourselves, self-improvement
*We are God??? We can be like God??</p>

<p>Anyway, please do not downvote me for my analysis or beliefs. It took me some time to summarize the beliefs in a non-biased way, and I really hope this opens up some good discussion.</p>

<p>Edit: by the way for those reading this and downvoting me and upvoting the freemason:</p>

<p>1) Freemasons are directly tied to the new world order. If you support freemasonry, you support the NWO.</p>

<p>2) The book I mentioned is extremely well-sourced.</p>

<p>3) Research for yourself. You will find the truth. I only provided a small glimpse.</p>

<p>4) Many Masons do worship Lucifer as God (not all).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting. Thx for the write up. </p>

<p>I used to be an atheist until I read the book &#39;The Origin of Consciousness In The Breakdown of The Bicameral Mind&#39;. After reading it, I don&#39;t know how I didn&#39;t believe in a diety before. </p>

<p>Also, the HLI from 4chan said that Jesus on the cross was meant to symbolize the fact that Jesus Christ was on the crossroad between the elite rulers of the world and the slave class. Jesus attained spiritual enlightenment and brought forth that knowledge to the slave class at the behest of the elite. That probably the reason why so much of the Bible has been redacted. It gets too close to the truth. The rest is dogma with some symbolic truths mixed in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the book I mentioned, it explores the evidence of the right hemisphere of the brain being the place where God can speak to you via hallucinations, both audio and visual. The evidence is overwhelming that there&#39;s a diety. The fact that humans lost consciousness for a period of time is solid evidence of a Diety. Who was controlling their actions? What was going through their minds? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure exactly when, as I can&#39;t recall exactly when HLI said this occurred. He may have said around the time of the great flood. Also, from wikipedia:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Jaynes built a case for this hypothesis that human brains existed in a bicameral state until as recently as 3000 years ago by citing evidence from many diverse sources including historical literature. He took an interdisciplinary approach, drawing data from many different fields.[3] Jaynes asserted that, until roughly the times written about in Homer&#39;s Iliad, humans did not generally have the self-awareness characteristic of consciousness as most people experience it today. Rather, the bicameral individual was guided by mental commands believed to be issued by external &quot;gods&quot; — commands which were recorded in ancient myths, legends and historical accounts. This is exemplified not only in the commands given to characters in ancient epics but also the very muses of Greek mythology which &quot;sang&quot; the poems: the ancients literally heard muses as the direct source of their music and poetry.&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth I believe that this DID occur with all descendent&#39;s of Adam before the Flood and we lost it afterwards which is why Noah was severely depressed and his family found him drunk and naked in his tent after following God&#39;s wishes and delivering him and his family to safety to recreate humanity.  Anyone claiming to be inspired or prophetic after that was falsely trying to emulate what the people had before the flood.  As Noah&#39;s descendent&#39;s dispersed they had stories of sages and intermediaries to try to emulate (i.e. the vestal virgins or the nordic seers).</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I am what is labeled a creationist and I know the world is only about 6-10 thousand years old and flat.  So take that for what you will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if the story of Adam and Eve is actually describing the breakdown of the bicameral mind? The famous painting for Adam and Eve is God in a brain shaped vessel touching hands with Eve, who seems to be leisurely laying around. It&#39;s as if God is saying &quot;you&#39;re on your own now, I will not appear in your mind anymore&quot;. </p>

<p>What do you think? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in my opinion I believe that the Bible is absolute truth.  So if you read and study the Bible and take it verbatim you have a different perspective.  Take for instance the theory of the Big Bang that suddenly the world exploded out of nothing.  I simply remember &quot;And God said let there be light.&quot; And that has ben around for thousands of years.  Simply said.  </p>

<p>Then you read about Satan coming as a serpent to Eve.  Well just recently I saw here on reddit that DNA evidence shows that snakes maybe used to stand upright.  Well Genesis says clearly that God&#39;s punishment to snakes because of Satan&#39;s deception is that they would have to slither on the ground.</p>

<p>On a side note I am a vegetarian (sometimes I eat fish because Jesus allowed that), but in the Old Testament (before the fall) all animals and humans were vegetarian.  Now you can confirm that all or almost all animals can live off of a vegetarian diet. </p>

<p>After the fall of innocence we see Cain banished after killing Abel and starting his own tribe which God said he cursed.  This is a very easy group of people for Satan to corrupt.  I believe they were great thinkers and builders (maybe did the pyramids and easter island and macchu pichu.)</p>

<p>I know that Woolley mammoths lived at the age of the construction of the pyramids...that is well documented. I know that dinosaur type animals like brachiosaurus are mentioned as well. </p>

<p>So during this whole time God is communicating to his chosen people.  But we do know from the Bible that we cannot see the face of God (and we never do...the only time God appears physically on earth is in the body of a passerby on the road) or hear His voice because it would be like thunder.  So how was he communicating? I believe via a special extra-sensory vehicle that we no longer have. Everyone thought Noah was crazy...even his wife.  Moses broke the first tablets and was denied entry into the chosen land afterwards.</p>

<p>I really love the movie Noah with Russell Crowe.  I think it is the most wonderful Biblical movie since The Passion. So Noah is a descendent of Adam through Seth (the 3rd brother). Noah I believe retains the ability to communicate on a level that we have lost.  He is a direct descendent of Adam and Eve who communicated with our Lord.</p>

<p>And I know Eve gets a bad rep.  But the wonderful thing that came out of her decision was free will.  God could have made a perfect little playground with puppets to follow Him. But instead Eve disobeyed His rule and now He has people who come to love Him on their own accord.  Just like a parent we will disappoint Him but when we come back to Him on our own free will, (fighting Satan, fighting our own demons, acknowledging all of our shortfalls) that will hopefully make him pleased.</p>

<p>Sorry for typos....on mobile. Watch Noah too!</p>

I used to think science ruled all and that religious people were nuts (some are). Now, I&#39;m almost certain there&#39;s a Diety watching over us who created Earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty much the premise HLI described, although Julian Jaynes doesn&#39;t go into previous civilizations in his book. But as you said, if you combine his theory of the bicameral mind with the conclusions of Graham Hancock and some of Sitchin&#39;s discoveries (though perhaps not his conclusions), it paints a very compelling picture of advanced civilizations having existed as early as 30.000 years ago, and having been wiped out at least once, some 10.500 years ago by a catastrophic flood event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that if we start with the assumption that God exists and that there really is a specific way God intends for people to behave, especially if there are consequences for our actions (which I believe there are), then logically, it must follow that there is some source which we can use to authenticate what God wants and what he says, and that source must be static, that is, it must be beyond subjectivity and beyond interpretation. Otherwise we run into logical loopholes, for example God being unfair, expecting things of us that are unreasonable, or God being impotent, unable to make himself knowable or unable to even make his own terms logical and do his own will. I think this is a strong argument in favor of the legitimacy of the Bible, or at least, it&#39;s an argument that plays nice with the argument that the Bible is 100% legit. Just something to think about</p>

If you lived before Muhammad&#39;s time, you have to believe in whichever <a href="http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=16&amp;amp;verse=36">prophet was sent to you</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>Practically the same Abrahamic message relayed by 3 different messengers. Abraham preached monotheism but he did not come with a book. Prophet Moses was sent with the Torah and the people  did not believe. The Bible tells of this.  Jesus was sent yet people still did not believe. Instead man decided to alter the religious scripture. The Quran tells of that. It also provides validation to Jesus being the final messiah and gives insight on the Virgin birth. You can learn a moral lesson by reading each scripture. Notice how you can&#39;t really comprehend a verse without reading the whole chapter. These verses can easily be taken out of context --one way man has ruined the simplicity of God&#39;s overall message. </p>

<p>Mohammed does not have his biological lineage traced back to Adam and Eve.</p>

<p>Jesus fulfilled all of the requirements under Abrahamic prophesy to be the one and ONLY son of God.  His lineage is traced through Mary&#39;s side AND his earthly father Joseph&#39;s side. Not one but two sides.</p>

<p>Satan was already established in the FIRST book, Genesis, of the Old Testament (which all the Abrahamic religions follow).  So that is not shocking news.  On a side note...for all atheists please look up how &quot;science&quot; through DNA has actually proved that snakes used to have arms and legs.  Then read what God said was his punishment to Satan after the fall if Adam.</p>

<p>You reference Gabriel and yet Gabriel was the one who appeared to Mary (In the New Testament documented before your fake religion) and said &quot;your Son will be &quot;the Son of the most High.&quot;  MOST high a.k.a son of God.  Are you attempting to negate the inspired works of God that came well BEFORE your prophet mohammed? </p>

<p>Where is it said anywhere that you have to do good works or be judged &quot;after puberty&quot;?  You acknowledge Jesus at least in some way.  Jesus said specifically that &quot;there is no way unto the father but through me.&quot;  So even if you think Jesus was &quot;only a prophet&quot; would a prophet ever be wrong? Was ABRAHAM wrong?  Abraham knew that ONE savior would come again in the FIRST BOOK Genesis 12:2 and again in 13-17.  Israel is clearly stated in the Old Testament WELL BEFORE your religion was made up.  So why does Islam fight against Israel so much? God under Abrahamic law has a very clear love for Israel.</p>

<p>You have MULTIPLE &quot;holy books&quot; to fix the mistakes written by your &quot;prophet&quot;. Why do you need multiple holy books to correct or amend instead of divine scripture? Are you saying God makes mistakes and has to correct Himself? Because in The Old Testament he specifically said that he was sending ONE Savior to save the world.  Not multiple.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re referencing your Bible to refute me but we Muslims believe that the Bible has been corrupted by an evil group of people to fit their agenda. We do not agree with anything that disagrees with the Quran. But let me respond to some of your comments... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mohammed does not have his biological lineage traced back to Adam and Ev</p>
</blockquote>

<p>uh we&#39;re all children of Adam and Eve... </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Uh &quot;The Most High&quot; is one of Allah&#39;s 99 names in Islam. </p>

<p>And we agree that Gabriel was sent to Mary</p>

<ul>
<li>She chose to seclude herself (from her people); then we sent to her Our Spirit, and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects. She said: &quot;Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Beneficent (God) from you, if you do fear God.&quot; (The man) said: &quot;I am only a messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son.&quot; She said: &quot;How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?&quot; He said: &quot;So (it will be), your Lord said: &#39;That is easy for me (God): And (we wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from us (God), and it is a matter (already) decreed (by God).&#39; &quot; [Quran 19:17]</li>
</ul>

<p>And Gabriel (The Holy Spirit) was supporting and strengthening Jesus for his duty throughout his upbringing, Just like he was supporting Muhammad throughout his prophethood.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;And verily we gave unto Moses the Scripture and We caused a train of messengers to follow after him, and We gave unto Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs (of Allah&#39;s sovereignty), and we supported him with the Holy Spirit.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Of those messengers, some of them We have caused to excel others, and there are some unto whom Allah spake, while some of them He has exalted in degree; and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs (of Allah&#39;s sovereignty) and We supported him with the Holy Spirit.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;(The day) when God saith: &#39;O Jesus the son of Mary! Recount My favour to thee and to thy mother. Behold! I strengthened thee with the Holy Spirit, so that thou didst speak to the people in childhood and in maturity.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Say [Oh Muhammad]: the Holy Spirit has brought the Revelation from thy Lord in Truth, in order to strengthen those who believe, and as guidance and glad tidings to Muslims.&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So are you saying kids will go to hell if they don&#39;t believe in Jesus? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>There are no mistakes in any of the holy books. We only have one holy book right now and it&#39;s the Quran. All the previous ones are lost. God revealed the previous books to suit the needs and environment of the people at the time but the core message of worshipping one God was the same for all the holy books. For example, Adam and Eve&#39;s kids could marry each other but marrying your siblings today is impermissible. Many things in the previous books are irrelevant to us today. The Quran is meant to be our book of guidance until the end of time. </p>

<p>And to expand on this, prophets cannot be wrong. Jesus preached about 1 God and never told anyone to worship him. But wicked people changed his teachings and made him a divine being. For them is a great punishment. </p>

<p>Genesis 12:2 does not speak about a savior (<strong>even if he did, that wouldn&#39;t disprove Islam because Allah said Jesus is the Messiah in the Quran and Muhammad said he will come at the end of time to save the world</strong>). It speaks of a nation. One could argue that that nation the Ummah of Muhammad. </p>

<p>Also take a look at Genesis 17:19-20</p>

<ul>
<li>But God said, “No, but Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. “<strong>As for Ishmael</strong>, I have heard you; behold, I will bless him, and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly. He shall become the father of twelve princes, and <strong>I will make him a great nation.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We believe Muhammad is a descendant of Ishmael. </p>

<h1>The people acknowledged that Jesus was a prophet</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 21<br/>
11 <em>And the multitude said, <strong>This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.</strong></em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Luke 24<br/>
19 <em>And he said unto them, What things? <strong>And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word</strong> before God and all the people</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Acts 2<br/>
22 <em><strong>Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God</strong> among you by miracles and wonders and signs, <strong>which God did by him</strong> in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Jesus implied that he is a prophet</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 13<br/>
57 <em>And they were offended in him. <strong>But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour,</strong> save in his own country, and in his own house.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Jesus implied that he had a god (Allah)</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>John 20<br/>
17 <em>Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto <strong>my Father, and your Father;</strong> and <strong>to my God, and your God.</strong></em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>John 5<br/>
30 <em><strong>I can of mine own self do nothing</strong>: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; <strong>because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Jesus cannot be Allah</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Numbers 23<br/>
19 <em><strong>God is not a man,</strong> that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Jesus prayed to Allah</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 27<br/>
46 <em>And about the ninth hour <strong>Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli,</strong> lama sabachthani? that is to say, <strong>My God, my God,</strong> why hast thou forsaken me?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ask the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses... Does Eloi sound like Jehovah? Does it sound like Jehovah? Or does Eloi sound like Allah?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mark 15<br/>
34 <em>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <strong>Eloi, Eloi,</strong> lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, <strong>My God, my God,</strong> why hast thou forsaken me?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you would say this in Arabic, it would be &quot;Allah, Allah, lama tarak tani?&quot;. It&#39;s very similar because Hebrew and Arabic are sister languages; Semitic languages.</p>

<p><strong>Also, why would Jesus doubt God and say such a blasphemous thing??? Isn&#39;t he supposed to be the most pure man??? Unless, what the Quran says it&#39;s true and that God replaced Jesus with a bad person that looked like him and he&#39;s the one that said &quot;God why have you forsaken me?&quot;</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 26<br/>
36 <em><strong>Then cometh Jesus</strong> with them unto a place called Gethsemane, <strong>and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 26<br/>
39 <em><strong>And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,</strong> saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: <strong>nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Jesus did not know the Hour</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 24<br/>
36 <em><strong>But of that day and hour knoweth no man,</strong> no, not the angels of heaven, <strong>but my Father only.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Mark 13<br/>
32 <em><strong>But of that day and that hour knoweth no man,</strong> no, not the angels which are in heaven, <strong>neither the Son, but the Father.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Jesus was sent for Children of Israel only:</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 15<br/>
24 <em>But he answered and said, <strong>I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Jesus prophesied against <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHXjqBiSBRQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=IslamIsTheTruth99">Paul who will alter the Mosaic law</a></h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 5<br/>
17 <em>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</em><br/>
18 <em>For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</em><br/>
19 <em><strong>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven</strong>: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</em><br/>
20 <em>For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</em>  </p>

<p>5:68 <em>Say, &quot;O People of the Scripture, you are [standing] on nothing until you uphold [the law of] the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.&quot; And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. So do not grieve over the disbelieving people.</em><br/>
5:69 <em><strong>Indeed, those who have believed [in Prophet Muhammad] and those [before Him] who were Jews or Sabeans or Christians</strong> - those [among them] who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - <strong>no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.</strong></em><br/>
5:70 <em>We had already taken the covenant of the Children of Israel and had sent to them messengers. Whenever there came to them a messenger with what their souls did not desire, a party [of messengers] they denied, and another party they killed.</em><br/>
5:71 <em>And they thought there would be no [resulting] punishment, so they became blind and deaf. Then Allah turned to them in forgiveness; then [again] many of them became blind and deaf. And Allah is Seeing of what they do.</em><br/>
5:72 <em><strong>They have certainly disbelieved who say, &quot; Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary&quot; while the Messiah has said, &quot;O Children of Israel, worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord.&quot; Indeed, he who associates others with Allah - Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire.</strong> And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers.</em><br/>
5:73 <em><strong>They have certainly disbelieved who say, &quot; Allah is the third of three.&quot;</strong> And there is no god except one God. <strong>And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.</strong></em><br/>
5:74 <em><strong>So will they not repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness?</strong> And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.</em><br/>
5:75 <em>The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. <strong>They both used to eat food. Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.</strong></em><br/>
5:76 <em>Say, &quot;Do you worship besides Allah that which holds for you no [power of] harm or benefit while it is Allah who is the Hearing, the Knowing?&quot;</em><br/>
5:77 <em>Say, &quot;<strong>O People of the Scripture, do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth</strong> and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way.&quot;</em>  </p>

<p>By Allah, He, the Most Merciful made the truth so easy to understand. Yet, people decide to favor their emotions (John 3:16) over their intellect. Allah says in the Qur&#39;an:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://quran.com/6/50">6:50</a> <em>[...] afala tatafakkaroon</em> (interpretation of the meaning): <em>Then will you not give thought?</em></li>
<li><a href="https://quran.com/2/44">2:44</a> <em>[...] afala taAAqiloon</em> (interpretation of the meaning): <em>Then will you not reason?</em></li>
<li><a href="https://quran.com/51/21">51:21</a> <em>[...] afala tubsiroon</em> (interpretation of the meaning): <em>Then will you not see?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>May Allah guide you, Ameen.</p>

He is the greatest example of what a true muslim should strive to be. I know disruptors have only pushed forth lies about how he is a warlord and other much more horrible blasphemous claims about him, so it&#39;s hard for the average person to see through the false image that has been created. Once you read a legitimate book about his character and traits, you will find an utmost admirable human being.</p>

<p>It&#39;s Muhammed. And it&#39;s Kur&#39;an or Qur&#39;an. As far as I know the letter &#39;o&#39; doesn&#39;t exist in Arabic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We agree with that. It&#39;s called Bid&#39;a (innovation) in Islam and there is a great punishment for whoever does that. But that rule doesn&#39;t apply to God himself.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very strange loophole. Don&#39;t you think if anyone was going to add to the Bible they would use the guise of &quot;divine intervention&quot; to do so?

If someone were to add and take away from the Bible for religious purposes they wouldn&#39;t say it was because &quot;they felt like their version was better&quot; they would say &quot;oh because God said it was cool.&quot;</p>

<p>Thank you for this information, it answered some questions for me. I don&#39;t know much about freemasons, other than that they are liars: a grand master did an AMA recently, and some other masons also inputted...I asked if they were Christians, and they said oh yes, that they themselves were catholics. But that&#39;s a lie, because the definitive rule regarding this is that you CANNOT be a catholic if you are a freemason. It&#39;s church law, and is not open to interpretation. Freemasons are automatically excommunicated from the catholic church. </p>

<p>Also, any group of people who have it as their rule, that they must never testify truthfully in court against one another, cannot be trusted. Freemasons are obliged to perjure themselves if compelled to testify against a fellow mason. As well as being a crime, perjury is a grave sin - so much so, that a priest cannot give absolution for it in confession; only a bishop can. </p>

<p>In my personal opinion, they are up to something very strange, and if I knew a mason, I would keep him at arms&#39; length. </p>

<p>OP, I agree with you about pop culture and stuff. And I think that the Enemy has gently veered mankind off course over the past few decades...a bit at a time, so as not to make us suspicious. One of the alarming new &#39;trends&#39; I see is people being told that they (and everyone else too) are perfect/divine...this &quot;We are all gods and goddesses&quot; thing. We are not, there is no divinity in us, only in God. But the Enemy wants us to think we can ALL be just like God, because that&#39;s pride AND blasphemy, and it&#39;s what hurts God most, because it&#39;s what Lucifer did, and that&#39;s what kicked all this shit off...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you answer the question of why Catholicism has &quot;Fathers&quot; as a title when it&#39;s specifically forbidden? I&#39;ve seen an argument that it&#39;s allowed because you&#39;re allowed to call natural father one etc. That is all well and good; when priests use the title it is a TITLE, not the earthly meaning and Biblically is supposed to be reserved for God as shown here:</p>

<p>&quot;Call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven&quot; (Matt. 23:9)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi OP I just want to point out one thing that you said under redemption.  For the Christian bullet point you should reference John 14:6 &quot;Jesus answered, &quot;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot; That was reiterated notably by Peter in Acts 4:12 along with several other verses.</p>

<p>So in Christianity Redemption is available to ALL who truly in their hearts accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.  That means even in their last moments.  You can be the worst person in the world and yet if at the last moment you truly repent and accept Him you will be saved.  This is a VERY hard position for many fair-weather Christians (and non believers too) to accept.  Many people want to feel superior in living a less tainted life that they will have special favor with God.  They relish in the idea of punishment or revenge for their enemies.  However throughout the Bible, the inspired Word of God, we see Him and His Son using flawed people to fulfill His will and spread the message of His Son.   You were spot on concerning the Masonic point of Redemption.  Theirs is based on a system of rewards for actions. </p>

<p>Notably, God&#39;s words were written in Jeremiah 31:3, &quot;Long ago the LORD said to Israel: &quot;I have loved you, my people, with an everlasting love. With unfailing love I have drawn you to myself.&quot;  The key word &quot;everlasting&quot; indicates that redemption is possible and freely given to ALL despite flaws, before birth and even at the very last moment.  There is no points system or way to advance.  The only advance that people get might get is on Earth through the approval of others which is worth nothing spiritually and can even be blasphemous.</p>

<p>Just my two cents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still have 33 Degrees of Deception on my reading list.  :)</p>

<p>My first thought with regards to Freemasonry and Christianity is the difference between the York Rite and the Scottish Rite.  The Knights Templar are an order joined in the York Rite and they are sworn to defend the Christian faith.  I will leave the Knights Templar conspiracies alone to not go off topic and will refer to Freemasonry as the non-Christian type.</p>

<p>I really like the comparison breakdown as a summarization.</p>

<p>Your first point about non-Christian Freemasonry and Jesus is often the views on Jesus outside of Christianity.  There is a lot of historical evidence for the existence of Jesus and many belief systems think there is truth in some of his teachings.</p>

<p>I was not aware of non-Christian Freemasonry&#39;s view on the Bible being not for literal interpretation and that only enlightened elders can understand it.  I have read about Freemasonry and Lucifer.  I just never put two and two together but it makes sense.  It is fairly common for esoteric societies to view the Bible in this way.</p>

<p>I was only vaguely familiar with Freemasonry&#39;s view on God so I really learned from that section.  To add to your bit about &quot;reason&quot;, &quot;reason&quot; is a very important part of the creation beliefs of Gnostic Christianity and Hermeticism.  They usually refer to it as the Greek word &quot;logos&quot;.  In Christianity, Jesus is the logos being part of the holy trinity.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know about death oaths nor did I know that following Freemasonic authorities and obligations were part of their path to redemption.  That does not resonate with me one bit.</p>

<p>I was not aware about Freemason&#39;s views on Satan but I was familiar with the information on Freemason&#39;s view on Lucifer.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know that in Freemasonry, the only path of light is through Freemasonry.</p>

<p>My memory was foggy on praying in Freemasonry so thanks for clearing that up.</p>

<p>I was aware of oaths of secrecy but I was not aware they were blood oaths or that they did any blood oaths.  Shows you how little I know about a Freemasonry.  :P</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe we are all on a journey to truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn&#39;t agree more.</p>

<p>I never made the connection that the Freemasonry version of God was the one we usually hear of in pop culture.  I wonder how much of an influence they might have on it.</p>

<p>What you said about people being tricked spiritually in modern times is spot on with how I feel.  I also think this may very well be the biggest conspiracy of them all.</p>

<p>I have already told you at length about my personal feelings about Christianity, &quot;new age&quot;, and other belief systems that resonate with me greatly.</p>

<p>Thanks for the well structured, concise, and informative, at least to me, post.  :)  I, too, try to present my thoughts as non-biased as possible.  I think that helps people listen to your message and also helps to make things more accurate.</p>

<p>With regards to truth seeking, lying, and secrecy:</p>

<p>Matthew 10:26-28</p>

<p>So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mason speaking - 30 year member, Master Mason, Past Master, 32nd degree Scottish Rite
(Northern Jurisdiction), PHP in the York Rite.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much in error here. If you want to know, why not just ask us? <a href="/r/freemasonry">/r/freemasonry</a> is
full of Masons who will happily answer most questions.</p>

<p>The first thing to say is that Freemasonry is not a monolith; there are around 200 
Grand Lodges around the world, which are each soverign, and don&#39;t always see eye to eye.
What I say here is true (in my opinion) for much of Anglo phone &#39;mainstream&#39; Masonry, 
but not universally.</p>

<p>Freemasonry is religious in that we don&#39;t admit atheists or agnostics. We require
members to have a belief in Deity. I&#39;ve met Masons who are Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu,
and Wiccan. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t have a theology, nor a plan for salvation. Each member has that through his
own faith, which he brings with him. We don&#39;t modify or replace that in any way. A
Christian remains a Christian, a Jew a Jew, a Muslim a Muslim, etc. </p>

<p>We do have prayers, and in deference to the presence of men of many faiths, they are
generic, to &#39;Deity&#39; or the &#39;Great Architect&#39;, not to a specific faith. The &#39;Great Architect&#39; 
is understood to be a stand in for the God of each member.</p>

<p>We provide a place in which good men of all faiths can come together, 
celebrate what we have in common, and work for the good of our communities.</p>

<p>...and I can&#39;t apologize for that.</p>

<p>Either way, here is what I think:</p>

<p><em>You are a sh</em>ll (can&#39;t say that word)
*You&#39;re actually a freemason and subscribe to the views.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a sh*ll here, there&#39;s nothing I can do. If your a mason, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<p>1) Is this a good organization with good objectives? How do I know?</p>

<p>2) Who do I pledge loyalty to? Why?</p>

<p>3) Is this the ultimate path, or am I being mislead?</p>

<p>4) Have I researched all there is to know about Freemasons, outside of freemasonry sources. For example, Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses only use their own sources - they really aren&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; to seek outside sources.</p>

<p>5) Have I researched opposing viewpoints?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the running plot-line through the degrees, not the actual cause/reason for existing though. The whole society is best described as a drama club, with most meetings being a performance to bring the lower ranked members through each degree. Everyone with speaking parts have lines to memorise, and floor work (where and when to stand) to learn. It gets a bit more complicated than what I just described at the higher levels though, as each &quot;club&quot; can only do specific degrees, with the majority only able to do the first three.</p>

<p>If you are at all interested, go find the contact details of the secretary of a lodge near you. Most lodges will hold an annual open day, if not the lodges themselves, the grand lodges certainly would (the secretary will point you in the right direction). Many will have websites and facebook pages.</p>

<p>Freemasonry is not a secret society, it is best described as a society with secrets.</p>

<p>This is not a hunting club. This is a club where we hunt...</p>

<p>Anyway, from what I&#39;ve researched, it is a secret society. Second, I&#39;m a woman and would not be allowed in your club, so I will have to trust different sources. Third, freemasons believe lying is right, if necessary.</p>

<p>Honestly, the major thing that bugs me is more how people use the club for self-interest like politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good cliche, as it literally represents what they stand for. They are fairly open, and certainly not operating out of shadows.</p>

<p>People with an interest can even approach them directly to find out what they are about. Joining is also a straight forward affair too, as long as they are male and of good character. Such is expected of a society founded as a workers union for the development of architects and stone masons... but now just a symbolic society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: by the way for those reading this and downvoting me and upvoting the freemason:</p>

<p>1) Freemasons are directly tied to the new world order. If you support freemasonry, you support the NWO.</p>

<p>2) The book I mentioned is extremely well-sourced.</p>

<p>3) Research for yourself. You will find the truth. I only provided a small glimpse.</p>

<p>4) Many Masons do worship Lucifer as God (not all).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly can&#39;t speak for whatever religions others may subscribe to, but it has nothing to do with Freemasonry. If you turn the accusations on any other club, like debate or drama club, they are just as ridiculous (that debate club has NWO ties, that debate club&#39;s members worship lucifer... trust me).</p>

<p>You can either trust one source or trust me... or better yet, go right to the primary source and find out for yourself. It doesn&#39;t bother me, but it&#39;s a little disappointing to see a complete lack of critical thought, combined with sheer gullibility.</p>

<p>&quot;....it is definitely for an elite group of people. They can&#39;t have any disabilities, be poor, be black, be women, etc. It teachers that only a small, enlightened group, with the right amount of money, can possess the secret knowledge.....&quot;</p>

<p>made me think of the Vatican.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone is truly interested in Islam and decides to become a devout follower of it he starts to learn the moral ethics and mannerisms that are teached in Islam. You find out about Muhammed&#39;s righteous character and his fair and honest manners and actions. Muhammed is the person to follow in Islam. He is the greatest example of what a true muslim should strive to be. I know disruptors have only pushed forth lies about how he is a warlord and other much more horrible blasphemous claims about him, so it&#39;s hard for the average person to see through the false image that has been created. Once you read a legitimate book about his character and traits, you will find an utmost admirable human being.</p>

<p>ISIS has nothing to do with Islam. It&#39;s a project created and funded by a certain few intelligence agencies to create chaos in the Middle East and form new borders and power control to certain people in the region.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of the verses in the Quran are taken out of context by terrorist groups and Anti-Islam folks. The violent verses were revealed to Muhammad while he was in war with a group of non-Muslims. They are not commandments for Muslims to follow in their lives. Islam is not a religion of world peace neither is it a religion of hatred and violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m only being condescending because you&#39;re being willfully ignorant and lying about me. Like who prays against being guided by God?? Allah is not some moon God. Literally means GOD in Arabic. And there is not a single contradiction in my comment. </p>
