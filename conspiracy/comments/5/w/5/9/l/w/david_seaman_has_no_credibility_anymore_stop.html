<p>So who is a perfect source of leaked info? Don&#39;t you understand that there is an implicit understanding that these things are rumors? When Seaman says &#39;my sources say&#39;, he is telling you that it&#39;s from 2nd hand sources. Use some common sense. It&#39;s like playing a game of Telephone and then claiming the person who says the phrase to you wrong is lying. He is passing along information, and he should have never promised anything. It was a rookie mistake.</p>

<p>Uhhh you lost me there...</p>

<p>I think the answer is somewhere in the middle. I think Seaman is human and he can be manipulated by his sources. We don&#39;t know if he&#39;s being messed with or not by shadowy forces - we shouldn&#39;t comment on it because it doesn&#39;t really matter.</p>

<p>As far as his book goes, I understand that he wrote a book about building a social media business, but how can you say that he didn&#39;t start down the path and get serious once he started digging into it? His goal may have been to make money initially, but at a certain point he went way too hard. </p>

<p>If his goal was to gain support and make money, why would he EVER try to predict mass arrests? Why would he take a risk like that? He was gaining so much support before that point with all of his attention - his plan was working - so why did he fuck it all up? To myself, the most logical explanation is that his &#39;sources&#39; screwed him over and gave him bad info to discredit him, and now he is being attacked by a coordinated social media effort to make him go away. </p>

<p>If his goal was to make money, it makes no sense to do what he did. If he wrote a book on this subject, that should be clear to him as well. I feel there is a disconnect if he is smart enough to create a massive social media campaign but too dumb to not take risks he cannot manage or control the outcome of. It doesn&#39;t all line up.</p>

<p>I just got called a shill in another sub for saying I don&#39;t have <em>pity</em> for Seaman and the alleged attacks he&#39;s under because of the bullshit &quot;arrests at midnight&quot; situation. But what you&#39;re saying here is something completely different. If Seaman puts together a video and someone wants to share it here there should be nothing stopping them. However asking to help him or pity him is not something we are obligated to. You want active censorship, that&#39;s toxic. </p>

<p>Interesting perhaps to note one of the reviews on the book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ByAlexanderon March 31, 2013<br/>
Verified Purchase<br/>
Whore is a whore, even if it&#39;s buzz one. Author&#39;s admiration by Trump is telling a lot. I don&#39;t need my money back and certainly few hours of my life wouldn&#39;t be returned. I don&#39;t advise to spend yours, that definitely not worth it. Page turner - yes, but head trashing with 40+ more than doubtful rules and even epilogue - that is something. Dim fountain of raw conclusions derived from surrounding us media and obsolete 5 years old facts. In Internet era a truth become naked so easily...</p>

<p>You make a dumb little post with a blanket statement and provide zero bit of research or even the logic you employed to come to your conclusion, and thereupon want to silence everyone who want to continue the dialogue.</p>

<p>Hey, listen, I will post a David Seaman video any time I damn well fucking please on this subreddit and you see where &quot;reporting&quot; it gets you.</p>

<p>Dude - I promise you, your hubris is your downfall, pizzagate is real, and your lovely rulers are going down. Savvy? Just you wait.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey now, I said he was employing a &quot;shill method,&quot; I never called him a shill directly :/ No, seriously, my apologies - but <em>notice</em>, he deleted his account. I&#39;m sick of these fucking diseased people and they need to be called out... in a way that abides by the rules, I understand.</p>

<p>Sorry, I&#39;ll keep the rules in mind. This subreddit is probably one of the most important spots in the internet, and I&#39;m serious about that.</p>

<p>This earthly realm is a battlefield - almost literally. There are opposing forces... literally. Light must prevail. Authority and rule are the ultimate sickness this planet is trying to defeat. I will do my best to be tactful and follow the rules of this subreddit - it is a privilege, not a right... But I will continue to fight these fucking demons. :)</p>

<p>I understand he&#39;s talking about hollywood, but I would argue that the media world is very similar in terms of the attention you receive from others. I think we should all step back and realize none of us are in his situation. This may have started as a &#39;strategy&#39; from his book, but we don&#39;t know that it didn&#39;t get real at some point either. People need to stop judging what they cannot know.</p>
