    <div class="md"><p>Lol this post is obvious CTR...</p>

<p>-OP tries to give impression that the Pizzagate investigation has died down and is no longer a concern on this forum </p>

<p>-his buddies all piggyback on his thread in the comment section and agree with him, try to speak on behalf of the entire sub and say things like, </p>

<p><strong>&quot;I think we&#39;ve moved on from Pizzagate as a whole, and agreed it was a limited hangout&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Just remember, there is still a well organized, highly correlated group of CTR shills, and covering up the child abuse stuff is their priority numeral uno, Garunteed. Stay vigilant guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate was hijacked by the spread of disinformation in order to discredit the real evidence.</p>

<p>I consider the massive pizzagate disinfo campaign that has been operating since pizzagate day zero to be evidence that pizzagate is real. Factual coverage of pizzagate by notable media, such as Ben Swann, was quickly shut down. Add this evidence of a cover-up campaign to the email code words, artwork, social media pictures, and various other circumstantial evidence and I believe &quot;pizzagate is real&quot;</p>

<p>But what is &quot;pizzagate&quot;? Pizzagate is a collection of evidence (much of it circumstancial) that indicates a very high likelihood many government officials are pedophiles/abusing/sex-trafficking children. I do not think it is likely that they are torturers/murders/blood-drinkers/organ-stealers (especially operating out of chambers beneath a pizza shop) which is what the disinfo shills are hellbent on turning pizzagate into. The evidence to push this narrative (such as the wikileaks <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56492">&quot;torture chamber&quot; email</a>, or fabricated <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagateshills/1650596">LARPs</a>, can be easily debunked).</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I am sure deaths/homicides happen in rare instances (<a href="http://www.kmtv.com/news/local-news/omaha-company-on-a-mission-to-end-human-trafficking">the average lifespan of someone being sex-trafficked is 7 years</a>, and <a href="http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/defenders/2-children-saved-22-people-arrested-for-human-trafficking-during-detroit-auto-show_">10% of people sex-trafficked are under the age of 18</a>.  But I don&#39;t think you can order children off a menu in Washington, DC and murder them in basements to appease your Satanic Ritual needs. That would be bad for business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only real things about pizzagate are that it set Podesta up as the patsy for Hillary&#39;s loss, and it is being or will be used to discredit anyone who touches it. Given how it was being shilled and for how long, even as the MSM knew to avoid it, and on sites ostensibly known to be controlled by left-wing interests, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s hard to guess who was behind it.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s that graph showing a major uptick in google searches for the term &quot;fake news&quot; with 24 hours of a major uptick in google searches for the term &quot;pizzagate,&quot; assuming that&#39;s not just more fake news.</p>

<p>The whole thing is currently feeding into a &quot;check your sources&quot; meta. Still waiting to see which way the trevor breaks on this. I have a feeling the primary target is actually the left; they&#39;re potentially the greater target, given how confident they are in their sources of information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a way I feel that since there is a huge understanding in psychology these days, that, they know how to throw a fair number of people off the trail, and eventually get you to shut up about it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not though any secret weaponry or anything - more so the use of the internet and people&#39;s lack of patience for anything but immediate satisfaction - which is probably internet induced to begin with. Not everything can be achieved at the click of a button.</p>

<p>Get everyone pumped up to hear about all the exciting news with little tid bits here and there, only to never really give anything consequential up. I&#39;ve watched the whole p-gate thing from when it was kicked off - and honestly, the only difference aside from a few arrests here and there, is that people are now pissed that there isn&#39;t any major news, no government collapse, etc etc. </p>

<p>If people&#39;s attention span lasted for more than 2 youtube videos, it might not just fade away so quick with the general public. Of course, there are still some folks who aren&#39;t easily as put off, and still cracking codes, and running through sites/info.</p>

<p>It would be a complicated process in any sting operation to get through to the centre of it all... remember - you can&#39;t lock up hearsay. So, finding real, undoubted proof is going to take a while - or else it&#39;s no good in court - and you know if there are some high profile characters in the defense chair, that you&#39;re going to need a solid case - especially when millions can be spent with no issue destroying any evidence there is. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t give up - don&#39;t worry about what others are at - if you want to   keep in the PG loop, you may have to find a new place to go - this place is seeming more and more non central anyways.</p>
