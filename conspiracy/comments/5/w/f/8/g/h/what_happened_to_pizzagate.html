       I think people are moving away from pizzagate becuase it heavily focused on podesta/dnc/clinton.

       There were supposed to be huge revelations and arrests of the elite.

       Pizzagate was hijacked by the spread of disinformation in order to discredit the real evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I consider the massive pizzagate disinfo campaign that has been operating since pizzagate day zero to be evidence that pizzagate is real. Factual coverage of pizzagate by notable media, such as Ben Swann, was quickly shut down. Add this evidence of a cover-up campaign to the email code words, artwork, social media pictures, and various other circumstantial evidence and I believe "pizzagate is real"
      </p>
      <p>
       But what is "pizzagate"? Pizzagate is a collection of evidence (much of it circumstancial) that indicates a very high likelihood many government officials are pedophiles/abusing/sex-trafficking children. I do not think it is likely that they are torturers/murders/blood-drinkers/organ-stealers (especially operating out of chambers beneath a pizza shop) which is what the disinfo shills are hellbent on turning pizzagate into. The evidence to push this narrative (such as the wikileaks
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56492">
        "torture chamber" email
       </a>
       , or fabricated
       <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagateshills/1650596">
        LARPs
       </a>
       , can be easily debunked).
      </p>
      <p>
       Disclaimer: I am sure deaths/homicides happen in rare instances (
       <a href="http://www.kmtv.com/news/local-news/omaha-company-on-a-mission-to-end-human-trafficking">
        the average lifespan of someone being sex-trafficked is 7 years
       </a>
       , and
       <a href="http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/defenders/2-children-saved-22-people-arrested-for-human-trafficking-during-detroit-auto-show_">
        10% of people sex-trafficked are under the age of 18
       </a>
       .  But I don't think you can order children off a menu in Washington, DC and murder them in basements to appease your Satanic Ritual needs. That would be bad for business.

       It's probably not all true, as it is just the work of one investigator (me) to find out which elements within the pizzagate community have intentionally pushing bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is certainly my best effort.  I would think this type of information would get real responses in r/conspiracy and not attacks.

       there were child trafficking arrest, but not all of the 1000 were related to the child trafficking, mostly they were just johns, pimps and hookers. the way you phrased it it sounds like there were over 1000 arrests on child trafficking which was not true.

       The only real things about pizzagate are that it set Podesta up as the patsy for Hillary's loss, and it is being or will be used to discredit anyone who touches it. Given how it was being shilled and for how long, even as the MSM knew to avoid it, and on sites ostensibly known to be controlled by left-wing interests, I don't think it's hard to guess who was behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's that graph showing a major uptick in google searches for the term "fake news" with 24 hours of a major uptick in google searches for the term "pizzagate," assuming that's not just more fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing is currently feeding into a "check your sources" meta. Still waiting to see which way the trevor breaks on this. I have a feeling the primary target is actually the left; they're potentially the greater target, given how confident they are in their sources of information.

       "Pizzagate" is what you would call a limited hangout. It focuses on red herrings in order to distract from the fact that underage sex rings exist.

       Earth. What has become of this attention? Cognitive dissonance. No ordinary person can comprehend how someone in the "upper echelon" could support this. They do not understand the vampiric nature of the situation. This community was purposefully led on a snipe hunt in order to paint the picture of anyone pursuing this inquiry as a conspiracy theorist chasing Bigfoot.

       If it is a snipe hint, than there are literally hundreds of connections that I'm going to need you to explain to me how/why they are false and support this narrative, because I just don't see what you're driving at.

       We see you posting this again and again. PG is strong and the arrests are in the thousands. There actually is a frontpage PG post right now. thanks for helping to bring more attention to cause.

       Pizzagate and Pedogate are very real and all who are involved are going to prison. And all of this is not happening on your schedule. Get used to it.

       In a way I feel that since there is a huge understanding in psychology these days, that, they know how to throw a fair number of people off the trail, and eventually get you to shut up about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not though any secret weaponry or anything - more so the use of the internet and people's lack of patience for anything but immediate satisfaction - which is probably internet induced to begin with. Not everything can be achieved at the click of a button.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get everyone pumped up to hear about all the exciting news with little tid bits here and there, only to never really give anything consequential up. I've watched the whole p-gate thing from when it was kicked off - and honestly, the only difference aside from a few arrests here and there, is that people are now pissed that there isn't any major news, no government collapse, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people's attention span lasted for more than 2 youtube videos, it might not just fade away so quick with the general public. Of course, there are still some folks who aren't easily as put off, and still cracking codes, and running through sites/info.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be a complicated process in any sting operation to get through to the centre of it all... remember - you can't lock up hearsay. So, finding real, undoubted proof is going to take a while - or else it's no good in court - and you know if there are some high profile characters in the defense chair, that you're going to need a solid case - especially when millions can be spent with no issue destroying any evidence there is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't give up - don't worry about what others are at - if you want to   keep in the PG loop, you may have to find a new place to go - this place is seeming more and more non central anyways.
