        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not too sure about any of you, but upon learning about paid shill campaigns, my natural instinct is to try and resist this CTR campaign, or at least lessen the effect they have on this discussion forum. </p>

<p><strong>STRATEGICAL BREAKDOWN</strong></p>

<p>I think we can all agree, regarding all of the issues floating around right now in current events (Iran, Trump, DAPL, Sweden, Russia, ISIS, ect), <strong>The censorship of Pizzagate</strong> developments is the establishment&#39;s main focus as of now. They understand that If they cannot contain this information, it could seriously cripple their operation, and expose them on a GLOBAL basis, and destroy the masses trust in the establishment.**</p>

<p>This forum has been a bastion of free speech, one of the few remaining forums where PG could be discussed openly without persecution. Many people migrate to this forum each day, to lurk and listen in on what we are talking about. We are starting to finally make noise, and this obviously scares the establishment, so they have deployed a myriad of paid shills as we all know, to &quot;correct the record&quot; here...</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve been gathering lately, they have several different goals/techniques to destroy this sub. </p>

<p><strong>-Give the impression of the sub being mainly a hardcore and radical conservative discussion platform, which will in turn create animosity and tension with liberals. This is a great way to cut the amount of people we can reach in half, simply by &quot;branding&quot; us as a conservative outlet</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Along with the point above, give the impression that the majority of us here support Donald Trump, and that he has our unwavering support. Liberals hate Trump, and see him as &quot;racist and sexist&quot;. By associating the conspiracy community with Donald Trump, our cause automatically appears racist to them, if you know how group thought works. We need to be able to reach them as well.</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Most recently, try to give the impression that Pizzagate developments are no longer happening, and the topic died down, and was largely agreed upon to be a psyop. I have seen several of these posts the past few days, keep an eye out</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Most DT support here is synthetic, many of us are distancing ourselves from him because he&#39;s being exposed as a puppet</strong></p>

<p><strong>-Blatantly use crass, racist and obnoxious language in comments sections to make the sub appear racist or ridiculous, not as a legitimate discussion forum</strong></p>

<p>In this new era of sensitivity, Posting anything that directly singles out a racial or religious group, is usually met with animosity. Is that kind of stupid? Yes. Our goal is to reach as many people as possible. That includes people on both the left, and the right. We want them both to learn of the atrocities their governments commit against them, but we can&#39;t do it if we use abrasive language that scares them off. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a firm believer in waking people up, it&#39;s super important. There&#39;s different ways to approach different groups of people. Right now this sub gets TONS of new attention, because the Pizzagate stuff is picking up and a mass awareness of corruption leads people to this sub. We have the opportunity to red pill large masses of people, so must appear as neutral and unbiased as possible, as well as culturally and religiously tolerant. If you see shills pushing any of this crap, deal with it accordingly. Do whatever you can to maintain a respectful and legitimate environment for serious discussion to take place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub is non partisan.  The political spam is a coordinated effort by multiple paid entities on both sides of the isle, working together to ensure there is division.  Keep an eye out this spring, there are going to be multiple paid riots and a level of manipulation across all media that we have never seen before.  Reddit, FB, Google, Twitter, NYT, CNN and all other media that has shown to be in lockstep with our government is going to really crank things up once the warm weather comes.  What you are seeing in this sub is not an authentic representation of this community.  There has been intentional, persistent manipulation of this sub for at least 6 months now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could definitely say that, but like I said, it is one part of many, because it&#39;s too complicated to say it was only a few reasons why Trump won. Regarding your point, the electorate did not want a third Obama term, as Clinton presented herself, add that to the usual pendelum of American politics. </p>

<p>They also realized that Clinton&#39;s own personal ministry of propaganda (yes, she knew and coordinated every step, because of a legal loophole that allowed it) Correct the Record (sounds like Ministry of Truth in 1984), was so obvious and obnoxious and so evident that the only people online who supported her were paid (likely foreign) disinformation agents, who pushed people online ever further away from her with endless bullshit, snark, belittling and attacks, and making political forums so toxic, people had to go to places like T_d for political news. Places like T_d had genuine enthusiasm for their candidate, while CTR-infested cesspools like politics were nothing but endless negativity and ultra-biased attacks. That&#39;s just on Reddit. No, it&#39;s not a stretch at all to say they played their part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love trump but if im in the mood for a love fest I&#39;ll go to the donald. While i&#39;m here everything trump or otherwise gets a fair consideration. Example: fuck what Spicer said about weed. Further, I think pizzagate is real but I don&#39;t <em>want</em> it to be as some way to damage an opposition party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trump is a sociopath who will pillage and plunder America to enrich himself and his friends.  That makes him absolutely no different from the last 4 administrations.  However, at least (unlike Hillary) he&#39;s not (probably) involved in running the worlds largest child sex trafficking operation.  If he puts the DC pedos in prison then all his abuses will be worth it.  If he doesn&#39;t then he&#39;s just another in a long line of rich sociopaths who thing that not rich people are cattle to be slaughtered at will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Genuine question, what is the focus of this sub? It is on r/all a lot lately, and I assumed it was a place to discuss interesting conspiracy theories. Seems to be mainly political in nature though. And heavily right-leaning.</p>

<p>I&#39;m truly not trying to start an argument, but I&#39;d like to hear from people who have been long-time regular participants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That happened leading up to this election really. Before that this sub wasn&#39;t really partisan or for that matter political at all. The majority viewpoint back then was that both parties were wolves in sheeps clothing. </p>
