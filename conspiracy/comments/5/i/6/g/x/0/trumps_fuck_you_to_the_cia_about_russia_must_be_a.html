       The treasonous criminality and corruption of those in charge and their media and alphabet stooges (CIA and the other corporate mercenaries called "government") has never been this obvious.

       They

       to get the people looking elsewhere,   because the scum crooks behind the curtain have been exposed,  pulling all the levers and full of lies and deception,  even killing us on 9/11 and using our children as cannon fodder so they could make their stinking money.

       There is a war on in case you haven't noticed.    Its going to go one way or another,  someone is going to win,  someone going to lose,  over time.   So far,  its the Seth Rich and Hastings,  the Webbs that have taken it on the chin.

      <p>
       If and when it turns,  will it be the Clintons,  Obama, etc. taking it on the chin?    Didn't you read about revolutions?       Check out 1917 for example.    Or 1776.

       This series of events leads to so many questions.

      <p>
       Maybe a genuine struggle is going on within the elite, maybe it's the elite v. White knights finally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's a very well laid out farce that makes it appear to be a struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what we can all agree on is no one at the top levels of government got there without any blood on their hands.

       People will tolerate a lot until their world starts falling apart,  and until enough of them are pissed.    Also when their leaders tell them if they don't have bread,  to eat cake.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites have stolen so much,  and are so obviously cheating and lying on so many levels that when people are hurting,  it will turn violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rulers are by definition an elite,  no matter how many times we replace them.   Some of them are loved more than others,  some of them are hated more than others.    The corporate media had their orders from above,  so they had no choice.    They have lost the peoples trust as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       All it will take at this point is another economic downturn,  which we get about every 8 or 10 years like clockwork.    If its a bad one,  there will be massive government layoffs and probably a new populist party.   One or both of the existing parties might be dissolved.     Or their could be a military coup.    A state of emergency.

       because you're peddling obvious fake news about Trump "accepting assistance from a hostile foreign government".

       ok show me your proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       show me your evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Washington Post cites an unnamed source, NY Times cites Washington Post, Every other MSM outlet cites NY Times and Washington Post.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a chinese whisper of no sources coming out.
      </p>
      <p>
       heck even the DNI and elements of the CIA (not to mention FBI) are now in disagreement with the "secret source" that leaked to WaPo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck, can you even proof WaPo didn't make it up?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only things we know atm are:
      </p>
      <p>
       DNC emails got released
RNC WASN'T hacked (multiple RNC confirmations inc FBI)
Podesta emails got released
      </p>
      <p>
       UK Ambassador said on the record he met the leaker of the DNC emails and he was an insider.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta lost his phone multiple times and had his own tech guy tell him to enter a password into a phising link.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is basic. I could have done this to him. This is not "on the level of only RUSSIAN HAXXORS".
      </p>
      <p>
       Its just plain stupidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we also know is that the FBI have stated that ~5+ foreign agencies had access / hacked HRCs PRIVATE SERVER.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also know that none of those emails / info have been released.
      </p>
      <p>
       I WILL ADMIT - it is likely Russia was one of those 5 agencies involved but AGAIN - NOTHING RELEASED TO INFLUENCE ELECTION from those emails.
      </p>
      <p>

       Well lets start with Motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin hates Clinton, he knows she will be tough on Russia and enforce the sanctions that are in force.  He blames her for the protests that took place after the last election in Russia. He blames her and the current Admin for much or what happened in Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin favors Trump for many reasons. One being his total lack of experience in diplomacy, his large ego which could be manipulated by a master of deception like Putin. Trumps advisors and members of the campaign of many connections to Russia and Putin himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump believes a lot of the Kremlin propaganda. He denies that Russia is involved in Ukraine. He believes that Putin and Assad are just fighting terrorism in Syria. He speaks fondly of strongman totalitarian leaders and dictators like Putin and Assad as well as Saddam.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC and Clinton was the only target. Trump is an easy target yet no attempt to hack or discredit him was made. Instead Trump and Putin kissed each others ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       The white house and the Intel agencies of the U.S. gov't all agree that Russia was involved.

       ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       so you have no evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       motive? why wouldn't Putin want an idiot as President who he has outmaneuvered at each turn as SoS?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ukraine is in ruins - the admin installed there by USA is crumbling. Russia now has Crimea &amp; a semi autonomous republic within Ukraine proper now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia as i said MOST LIKELY has Clinton private emails (as do multiple other entities) = massive leverage. You agreed yourself they dont have leverage on Trump since he wasnt hacked
      </p>
      <p>
       FINALLY. The Intel Agencies HAVE NOT ALL AGREED that Russia was involved. You are quoting a newspaper who is making shit up. = FAKE NEWS.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are multiple ones who contradict this statement including head of DNI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally there is no DIRECT evidence of involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are basically saying "only Russia has the balls to do this on a governmental level, were going to ignore rogue people unaffiliated with government employees, btw we have no GOTCHA evidence".

       I know in your tiny world everything is a major conspiracy but here in the real world it doesn't work like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes Russia took Crimea and from that they suffered immense financial problems due to sanctions causing the ruble to plummet. Secretary Clinton or any other candidate would continue to use this as leverage whereas Trump who has zero clue what he is doing can be easily Manipulated by Putin. He can continue his assault on Ukraine with zero repercussions under trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin knows an inexperienced trump will rely heavily on advisors. He also knows Trumps main advisors are very pro russia. Putin can manipulate policy whenever he wants with trump. Putin also knows fools like you believe that Putin just wants to be friends with the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest motive is NATO. Trump has spoke out negatively about NATO on more than one occasion. Putin has stated many times his biggest threat and our biggest piece of leverage is NATO. In trump Putin can attempt to degrade NATO and maybe even pull them back from Russias borders allowing him free reign to treat other small neighbor states as he does the Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA,FBI and NSA have all agreed that Russia did interfere in the elections and took part in the hacking and leaks on order to influence our election process and undermine it. The white house has also made the same statement. This is a major issue that even top republicans can agree on. Trump may not have been involved, I highly doubt he had any direct connection to it. But he would have to be a total idiot to think it didn't happen.

       You dont understand the Russian mentality. The more foreign powers screw over Russia the more they stand behind their country.

       The sanctions have only increased backing for Putin.

       first of all the elections weren't hacked. no one saying that.
      </p>
      <p>
       what was hacked in your opinion (or LEAKED which is the more accurate term) were DNC and Podesta emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       DNC email leak was confirmed to be insider job by both Julian Assange and a very respected British ex-Ambassador who has had dealings with whistleblowers before so its not a leap of logic to suggest that the DNC leaker would have spoken with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta emails AGAIN got released due to his own negligence. He was sent a phising email asking for him to change his password.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could have done that.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is not a brute force hack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elections couldnt have been hacked because as pointed out by multiple states (and CNN in October etc and many other democrats) their voting machines aren't connected to the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would have needed multiple on the ground cells to manually infiltrate and physically alter the machines in countless counties
      </p>
      <p>
       In the recounts of PA the judge said that this allegation was ludicrous. None of the states said there was any possibility of hacking on machines. MI does paper only too (or non internet cant rmb).
      </p>
      <p>
       So before I waste MY TIME FURTHER do you agree on the above points?
      </p>
      <p>
       What you should be saying is:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Russians hacked emails which showed Americans the truth about the democrats".
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you re held the elections - that knowledge is still out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       EVEN IF we assumed that Russians cent thousands of agents to infiltrate thousands of voting stations to alter the machines that would mean that a true re-election would require 100% paper ballot.
i can guarantee you the democrats wouldnt want that. especially with the increased scrutiny.

       Well as I said. Glad we agree election wasnt hacked. Sorry if i misunderstood you. Glad were agreeing on a consensus bit by bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       DNC emails weren't hacked. Refer to my above point - so again moot point. If a whistleblower leaks them can't really blame some foreign entity for doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that only leaves us with Podesta.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta was a private citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we ignore the fact that it wasnt a "hack" (unless basic phising emails which anyone can do are now hacks too ) Would i care if Podesta got "hacked"?
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as I would care about any other private citizen getting "hacked". I'd tell them to get better internet security and move on. its their responsibility to be vigilant.
      </p>
      <p>
       If as a result of the above information from a private citizen got exposed which altered the outcome of the election would i want an investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes.

       Assange and UK Ambassador have confirmed DNC were insider leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think Assange said same about Podesta but im not 100% sure so im just sticking to what we know - anyone could have done it and it was on private citizen.

       Yeah it sucks to have that feeling.

       But dont see Americans complaining about CIA / SoS influencing elections and governments across the world for the past 5-6 decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Including the Russian 90s election which elected a terrible leader who destroyed Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention countless other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same CIA who has had numerous blunders such as the below:

       dailycaller.com/2016/12/13/flashback-the-cias-top-7-intelligence-blunders/
      </p>
      <p>
       The same CIA who shouldnt be doing domestic work (so how would they even know legally about domestic hacking unless theyre breaking the law).
      </p>
      <p>
       But it doesnt even matter because CIA sources and ODNI and FBI have all gone on record to disagree with the WaPo "leaked" claims.

       I'll check out the links. You had me laughing about the Russia world peace thing tho. Good one. They've been undermining democracy in every state that was once a part of the USSR.

       As far as china goes its a complicated relationship that I wont even pretend that I understand in full. I know our economies need each and a trade war would fuck the whole world so I hope cooler heads prevail.

       Ive never heard of Craig Murray and I don't see any evidence that he knows anything beyond heresy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I can tell you that the wiki page shows the guy isn't very informed on some of the topics he has spoke about. He claimed the IMU aka islamic movement of Uzbekistan isn't linked to Al Queda when they are absolutely a main part of Al Queda and Taliban forces that operate inside of Afghanistan. Further they've deployed units to Syria along with Al Queda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on for days about that shit but Id probably bore you as thats been one of my main fields of research. But that alone really makes me question this guy.

       the guy was ambassador to Uzbekistan. im sure he has better knowledge than you.
      </p>

       stop thinking that as some basement dweller you have better knowledge on world affaris than a diplomat.
      </p>

       and tbh having seen what Wikipedia has descended into over past few months / years i dont even trust it to be unbiased. i simply linked it to prove fact he WAS an ambassador.

       Unlike you and most retards like you I don't pretend to be an expert on things unless I am. So while you sit there pretending like you have a clue what you re talking about its become extremely obvious that you are fucking clueless about any of this.

       why are you switching the topic of conversation?
      </p>
      <p>
       the views of the ambassador on various splinter radical groups has nothing to do with the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       look mate you lost. just give it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       stop being a conspiritard.
      </p>
      <p>
       youre the one peddling conspiracies of hacking or w/e.
      </p>
      <p>
       honestly just stop and save everyone some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       move on gracefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s. ill admit - i dont know of the top of my head about this splinter group convo but again, as first port of call id place more credence in the knowledge / thoughts and opinions of an ambassador to the country (who would have direct access to e.g. people seeking asylum etc and whistle blowers than i would from YOU or a bunch of random websites)
      </p>
      <p>
       i have no interest in arguing this point because as i said its not of interest to me and not pertenant to the convo at hand
      </p>
      <p>
       if you have any EVIDENCE of Russian Government HACKING or INFLUENCING the elections, feel free to reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       as you are probably a paid shill i would point out to you that you are not "wasting" my time or derailing the convo etc. i dont really post much so youre better of spreading your propoganda elsewhere whilst youre still getting paid for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       if youre not then i simply feel sorry for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       youd be much better served opening your eyes, looking at the other side of the argument and simply realising that maybe, just maybe, Trump will MAGA and you wont be sitting stewing in misery
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s. as mentioned before - i will admit that there is a HIGH probability that Russian state linked entities HACKED HRC PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER WHICH SHE SET UP TO AVOID TRANSPARENCY AND FOIA REQUESTS AS SOS BUT THE CONTENTS OF THESE WERE NOT RELEASED. PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING SAVED FOR PURPOSES OF LEVERAGE (which they wouldnt have had against Trump or GOP since they didnt hack Trump or RNC)
      </p>
      <p>
       p.p.s Russia says thanks to HRC for being so inept that Russia managed to reacquire Crimea and also get access to 20% of USAs uranium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wonder how many great deals they could have forced her into as President.

       The CIA FBI NSA etc seems to disagree. They seem to believe the Russians hacked the DNC et al in order to help get Trump elected. I'm no fan of trump or Clinton. I was a Kasich guy and lost interest after the primary.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do fear Trump will use the office for the purpose of making deals to benefit himself and his friends. He also seems to be so far up Putins ass its disgusting and morons like you eat it up and believe Putin just wants to be friends because you've swallowed trumps cock and can't see reality.

       ok show me the proof / on the record statements that DNC was hacked please.
      </p>
      <p>
       all we have are credible sources stating that INSIDERS leaked the DNC emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump said his business will make no new deals whilst hes a President - even though its not a legally mandatory thing for him to do.

       People calling for war with Russia etc and sabre rattling for no reason like you are the 'morons'

      <p>
       You need to get round the concept that "mainstream media" doesnt always tell the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course Russia wants to be friends. Russia has no interest in being at war with America. It has no ideological motives to spread to other countries like during the USSR times.

       Well lets start with Motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin hates Clinton, he knows she will be tough on Russia and enforce the sanctions that are in force.  He blames her for the protests that took place after the last election in Russia. He blames her and the current Admin for much or what happened in Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin favors Trump for many reasons. One being his total lack of experience in diplomacy, his large ego which could be manipulated by a master of deception like Putin. Trumps advisors and members of the campaign of many connections to Russia and Putin himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump believes a lot of the Kremlin propaganda. He denies that Russia is involved in Ukraine. He believes that Putin and Assad are just fighting terrorism in Syria. He speaks fondly of strongman totalitarian leaders and dictators like Putin and Assad as well as Saddam.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC and Clinton was the only target. Trump is an easy target yet no attempt to hack or discredit him was made. Instead Trump and Putin kissed each others ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       The white house and the Intel agencies of the U.S. gov't all agree that Russia was involved.
