<p>The modteam (and myself in particular) thought it was worthy to share. And I disagree regarding its profoundness, and a few of us here agreed that this post would be worthy to shine a spotlight on. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Maybe not all the time. But for a few days I see it as a good message to propagate.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Message the moderators with a post of actual value (or better yet - come up with something yourself) and be the change you want in the sub instead of bitching about something you don&#39;t have to read at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;research means nothing without humility&quot; is a patently false statement. </p>

<p>Then refute it, Plato.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You do if I cannot see.</p>

Imoho the world is made up of 4 kinds of people; the blind, the deaf and the mute. The blind accept what they are told because from and early age they rely on it, the deaf see what they believe to be real and cant hear any other argument  (they see the lightening and wont understand why people who didn&#39;t but heard the thunder are reacting the way they do. And then there are the mute. The ones who see and hear but either cant  or  won&#39;t communicate it to the other two. Oh yeah, the 4th kind of person? Dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;...be as objective and detached and as neutral as possible. Never instantly accept what you see, and never instantly reject it either. Cross reference as much as you can. Let it float around your head. Don&#39;t turn it into a belief system. Always let the information you digest be malleable, so you can add to it and shape it and let it grow naturally. Allow yourself to go down the rabbit hole without effort.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s major division and the only truth is we have the true power. We&#39;ve just been groomed to think otherwise. Whether a person is a Marxist or republican shouldn&#39;t matter, but it does. Here in America, we&#39;ve been fed history with a bias, decided to puff our chests out and bully the entire world. When the proles here became too expensive to pay, they sent the jobs to the proles in 3rd world. They busted up unions. They made healthcare inaccessible. </p>

<p>It&#39;s important we come together to save the earth and each other. I never understood why people are ok with government employees having access to socialist programs, but do not think that WE need them. Bootstraps, work hard, company line. I don&#39;t want my people to worry about going broke if they break their leg or get cancer. This is America for chrissakes. We eat burgers bigger than some countries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s simply not true. The bigger factors were his willingness to address several topics that many grassroots voters have been concerned with for a while -- namely illegal immigration, Islamic terrorism, and corruption in DC. Whether or not he&#39;ll tackle these issues is beside the point of people believe he will. Add to that his willingness to toss aside typical political pussyfooting in favor of a brash, no-holds-barred persona and it&#39;s no wonder so many people took to him as if he were their prophet. Trying to connect these factors to &quot;racism and xenophobia&quot; is extremely patronizing to a large portion of Americans. And ironically enough, it&#39;s that patronizing attitude that pushed many people to vote for Trump who normally would not have.</p>

<p>And the elephant in the room is Hillary Clinton. Trump&#39;s opponent was millionfold flawed. That most certainly gave him a helping hand.</p>

<p>Sure, some who harbor racial hatred likely voted for Trump because they felt he appealed to those ideals. But it&#39;s in the smallest of minorities of voters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know, he most certainly was <em>not</em> addressing illegal immigration or Islamic terrorism. Not in the way many would want. IIRC he even planned to legalize tons of illegals. To the vast majority of Trump&#39;s base that&#39;s a big no-no, a massive cheating of the system and extremely unfair to those who immigrate legally. And he was practically the anti-Trump in personality. Many viewed him as weak, like when he basically relinquished the microphone to BLM members who stole the spotlight from him.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on the fence about his cabinet. I have a feeling he has some bigger design in mind with these picks. But I&#39;m not certain. I&#39;m not forming an opinion until he&#39;s in office and we start to see some of his real choices. If he even makes it to office.</p>

You want to know how I felt? I was happy someone was finally addressing immigration, and was happy that someone was speaking to Americans as <em>Americans</em>, not as white and black and brown and make and female blocks of voters. Identity politics are so tiring and unintellectual. And good god, I&#39;m not even gung-ho about him. He could still turn out to be a greedy bastard who doesn&#39;t change shit.</p>

<p>1) people don&#39;t like you sitting on the fence.  They demand you come down.  They want you to come down on their side if they like you, or on the other side if they don&#39;t so they can have fun attacking you.</p>

<p>2) You can see both sides from the fence.</p>

<p>3) Sometimes you may ideologically be on one side of the fence, but you need to sit atop it so you know what everyone is saying</p>

<p>4) There&#39;s nothing wrong with sitting on the fence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a UK citizen, I&#39;ve found myself in a train of thought very much similar to yours. The fight between left and right wing voters since the conservative party first won parliament right through to brexit, all I&#39;ve seen are people become more stubborn in their beliefs then vilify one another for opposing them rather than listening to each other and at least trying to understand where someone is coming from. I&#39;ve learned to listen to someone and to always comb over what I believe in. I certainly have my ideas and values, and I feel that in time, the right people will understand mine as I try to understand theirs. People can say they sit on the fence, but they can&#39;t deny their legs dangle on one side or the other, if not both.</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Questioning everything especially our own assumptions. Most importantly, the assumptions you&#39;ve made and don&#39;t even realize&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The amount you read and the way you process what you read is more important than finding the &quot;right&quot; books. Learn a lot of facts about a lot of things, and be careful not to confuse assumptions or hunches for fact. Deduce for yourself, rather than accept others theories.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Your main limitation is your belief in things that are not true. Try to axiomatize your worldview. Test these assumptions by examining the extrema of their consequences. Get rid of or add new assumptions and examine what you can no longer explain or the validity of new deductions. You&#39;ll come to know yourself and your world in this way.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;You need to deemphasize exposing the current system to some degree, <strong>more specifically put it in the context of offering a better alternative and expose what people are missing out on by going along with the current system. If you can do better, you can show people they are being cheated. If you can&#39;t offer a better alternative, they will wonder why should they care</strong>.&quot;</li>

<p>Hell, I share just about anything on my FB page for instance. But much like you I don&#39;t just immerse myself in it 110%. I&#39;ve been called both a &quot;Libtard&quot; and an &quot;Alt Right Conspiracy Nut&quot; <strong>in the same day.</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s as if moderate, middle-of-the-road politics, is now a repulsive concept. I post something about Pizzagate on FB, and two days later I get messages from family linked with &quot;Alex Jones Pizza conspiracy Debunked!&quot; as if Alex Jones is my idol, or that high-level pedophile rings are simple not possible.</p>

<p>People&#39;s critical thinking abilities are seriously hampered. Yes, Pizzagate hasn&#39;t been 100% proven, but did anyone ever consider that is <em>because it&#39;s being actively hidden by powerful people?</em> No, I don&#39;t want to shoot people at a pizza joint. Yes, I understand some people are fucking retarded when it comes to &quot;conspiracies.&quot; But Yes, conspiracies happen, all, the, time, and are never heard of by anyone.</p>

<p>Basically every historian will talk openly about a Roman Emperor&#39;s conspiracies; Ceasar did this, Caligula did that, but holy fuck if you mention how retarded Trump OBVIOUSLY is or how corrupt Hillary OBVIOUSLY is, jesus, ya better watch out.</p>

Proving one side wrong doesn&#39;t in itself prove that the other must be right.

<p>These people run in a very different world than the rest of us. All I can rely on is what I know from looking at their histories.</p>

<p>Pence and Podesta have been personal friends since 1965. You can find that by running any search in google or other search engine. Trump is certainly Pence&#39;s friend or he wouldn&#39;t be VP.</p>

<p>But there are connections that cross parties via Dennis Hastert and others, like Wiener. There are so many connections going back and forth it all becomes muddled.</p>

<p>I think this is part of their design plan. And they should ALL burn.</p>

<p>For political purposes, we are now only hearing about the dems and liberals. Which makes me think the repubs and conservatives are hiding so damn much, too. The GOP is entering power and has a lot to lose, so their crimes are covered up. It would be the reverse if dems were coming to power.</p>

<p>They are all a bunch of fucking liars and criminals, both parties. I want ALL the guilty people to hang.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your response. The only thing at all I know about this is that my girlfriend grew up in D.C. around the corner from the pizza joint and says the idea that it was involved in a pedophile conspiracy is ridiculous.

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate started as a bunch of weird observations with strangely coded emails and pictures/symbols of pizza places near DC.</p>

<p>It QUICKLY expanded into people believing there was a global pedophile/trafficking network .  The name #PizzaGate doesn&#39;t do it justice. It makes it sound like it&#39;s all about CometPizza and that&#39;s just a tiny portion of it.  Visit <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate</a> and just scroll through the topics. You&#39;ll see that very little of it has anything to do with comet pizza. </p>

<p>Also, keep in mind, it&#39;s an investigative/theorizing effort. People don&#39;t know the extent of what&#39;s going on, so there are a lot of wild ideas being tossed around. Don&#39;t assume that everyone believes everything posted in on that subverse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Most of the pizza gate posts are just circlejerks of the same &#39;evidence&#39; ... But if you take you time to follow a lot of links to a various things happening, a lot of pieces of a puzzle come to fit together. Just enough to say &#39;Hold on , there&#39;s definitely something shady goin&#39; on here.&#39; I&#39;m literally sick of the Alefantis related posts, when there&#39;s so much other very related themes and mails that need further attention.</p>

<p>Humility is not aiming to be right, only knowing with the right epistemological pragmatism, and perhaps a little bit of faith or confidence in ones self, in the struggle of maintaining positive or truthful narritive among  different perspectives. </p>

<p>A social constructivist foundation embedded with the relative material pragmatism of very self-reflective thought on oneself and others. Tempered by moral and ethical conviction in the righteousness of action, or faith in action. </p>

<p>People have a tendency to cherry pick information to bend to a belief system they have already created for themselves. Then they justify their belief system with said information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly, this is the way most people think. It&#39;s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>   </p>

<p>That&#39;s how governments convince their people to do what they otherwise normally would not. In Nazi Germany, Hitler and Goebbels did not just propose the idea of subjugation, and then genocide: they fed people only information they wanted them to hear, and let their brains process the information they had available to it--the conclusion Goebbels wanted them to believe becomes a belief the people thought they came to on their own. </p>

<p>A more current example: the reason the American public supported the Iraq War: we were told what to believe, that they had weapons of mass destruction, were an evil regime, etc. In reality, it was about oil, and even senior US officials admitted this.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p><strong>If someone can control what someone has can see and hear, they can control what they think</strong>. When I saw the Washington Post article claiming the Ron Paul Institute and Wikileaks are &quot;Russian Propaganda,&quot; which was published in their &#39;News&#39; section-- I was terrified.<sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> This WaPo article is an example of a broader political agenda to influence and even set the stage to control what information people have access to.<sup>3</sup> At the same time, the US government has quietly repealed the ban on domestic propaganda.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Based on my research, it seems that one could make a good argument that the categorization of events that we see reported as fact here in the US would certainly be heavily disputed by the regime in Syria and the Russians and could be disputed by someone holding all the facts. Who is the true agressor? What is the cause of all the fighting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said, I try to maintain the same attitude, but sometimes it&#39;s really hard to keep track of how much you&#39;re stretching the imagination. Symbolism is a large part about conspiracies (esp illuminati related), and unless you have a PhD in math, it&#39;s hard to keep track of how correlated the proposed findings really are.</p>

<p>For example the speed of light being endoded in the pyramid&#39;s location on the earth, in meters/second. I&#39;ve verified this fact myself through Google Earth (wiki lists it aswell), and it seems generally accepted fact. Yet, how likely is it (statistically) for this to happen by chance? And alot of people will hit at a dead end here, as do I alot of times, because the a large part of the credibility relies in it not being coincidence...</p>

<p>On your long search, what are some of your personal beliefs? I know you are like me, and you don&#39;t really want to claim one thing or the other, but if you had to make a prediction 30 years from now, which things do you think will have been proven fact. (Chemtrails, vaccination, illuminati, ...)</p>

<p>I have always put forth an effort to do the same. It&#39;s important to recognize you can try to get close to the truth, but you never know for sure. And it is immensely important for us to do our own research from a vast amount of sources of varying opinions and positions. </p>

<p>My biggest mission is to try to remind or teach my friends this. One cannot simply google whatever article and the word &quot;fake&quot; next to it to disprove their position. We must keep our minds open to all possibilities, and entertain many different ideas and theories. It never hurts you, but could end up with a different world view.</p>

 have a mansion but forget the price
Ain&#39;t never been there, they tell me it&#39;s nice 
I live in hotels, tear out the walls
I have accountants, pay for it all
They say I&#39;m crazy but I have a have a good time
I&#39;m just looking for clues at the scene of the crime
Life&#39;s been good to me so far
My Maseratti does one-eighty-five
I lost my license, now I don&#39;t drive
I have a limo, ride in the back
I lock the doors in case I&#39;m attacked
I&#39;m making records, my fans they can&#39;t wait
They write me letters, tell me I&#39;m great
So I got me an office, gold records on the wall
Just leave a message, maybe I&#39;ll call
Lucky I&#39;m sane after all I&#39;ve been through
(Everybody say I&#39;m cool, he&#39;s cool)
I can&#39;t complain but sometimes I still do
Life&#39;s been… </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is certainly refreshing. This, in my opinion, is also how most of the folks on this sub function. At least I hope it is. As I was driving into work this morning my thoughts went to this exact place. Maybe Putin did have something to do with the leaks. Maybe its the Assange folks that are lying. Then it hit me, maybe they are all lying. Its up to our gut instincts at this this point to suss out some form of objective reality out of this situation. 
One fact is clear. There is a concerted effort to sway public opinion and this is were our power rests. We can help to at the very least put alternative information out there so that its at least a planted seed as OP said. 
They may try to shut this all down. They may try to demonize anything not directly related to corporate controlled media. They may even start arresting people. For whatever reason they want to take our truth from us. But I say to you all as a call to arms, or keyboards as it were. &quot;From my cold dead Tongue!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sound advice, I&#39;m sure.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a lurker here and sceptical about everything but I try to be as open-minded as I can. I&#39;m interested in conspiracy theories for the same reason I&#39;m interested in other beliefs people hold. For me, that&#39;s about thinking from a philosophical perspective about how it colours a person&#39;s view of the world to hold beliefs of any kind -- Robert Anton Wilson&#39;s idea of <em>Reality Tunnels</em>, an ontological filter that colours everything we see. I spent a large part of the summer absorbing as much Flat Earth information as I could, not in order to judge whether I think it&#39;s true or not, but to understand their perspective and to try seeing the world through that tunnel myself. Watching hours of videos every day, defending the position to people I know, thinking about all the news I heard in light of the fact that the earth is flat. I really enjoyed it! I think I was actually (almost) as excited as any of them when the NO FORESTS video came out, since I was up to speed with their belief system by that point, and here was a frsh addition to it. What a day! All of that made me think the experiment was working and a few days later I was done with it. I should be clear, I am <em>not</em> equating all CTs with Flat Earth.</p>

<p>The desire to and habit of projecting patterns onto the world around us is what makes us human. It may be the one kink in our brain that led to us evolving how we did and is what caused religions, science and conspiracy theories to appear. Keep it up but remember we&#39;re in our own reality tunnels too, it&#39;s just that some of them are less distorted than others.</p>

This is why I can&#39;t contribute to <a href="/r/askengineers">/r/askengineers</a> because you can&#39;t possibly know every domain in engineering and there is always a set of pricks (consequence of arguing with an engineer) who point out technicialities in everything you say.  They aren&#39;t wrong, but for fuck sake when I say air velocity near the boundary of a solid is minimal therefore polishing the surface to a mirror finish is not going to improve the aerodynamics...but technically it does improve the system aero by 0.00034% and more in water, information that a Surface Flow Engineer actually studied and pointed out, so now I am a fucking idiot for opening my mouth even though reality is 0.00034% means fuck all.</p>

You cannot do any kind of research if you&#39;ve already convinced yourself  what you&#39;re researching is true, or untrue.  I went through a period in the mid 2000&#39;s where I was just lapping shit up from places like Infowars and random idiots on youtube, then realized that everyone, everywhere, all the time, has an agenda.  Even when they don&#39;t realize it themselves. </p>

<p>So thirst for knowledge all you can, and question everything.  Including the things that line up nicely with your current world view.  Maybe even ESPECIALLY those things. </p>

<p>This is where you see people who have fallen down the rabbit hole really lose themselves. Some of them get so paranoid that anything that happens is automatically a nefarious, pre-planned, dark occult-inspired event. So much so that they never have hope for a way out of this big mess.

    <div class="md"><p>Nice words but you&#39;re preaching to the subreddit that, very recently, jumped on the fact that some AP story was removed from the NY Times as evidence that the owners of NY Times were covering things up until multiple people pointed out that this in fact how AP (or is it Reuters?) works and has always worked on other media outlets as well. Forgive me if my impressions from visiting the sub are that it isn&#39;t exactly a bustling hive of rationality---and keep in mind folks that just knowing about cognitive bias can sometimes actually make you more biased because you (think you) see it better in <em>other</em> people but not in yourself.</p>

<p>Always be suspicious of gold posts here bc the purists here would never give money to Reddit.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say OP is shilling, I don&#39;t think he is, as his post is quite eloquent and well though out. However, that doesn&#39;t mean this well written call for &quot;rationality&quot; doesn&#39;t serve the same purpose as many shill posts do, resulting in gold within 20 minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s kind of interesting, I&#39;ve heard over and over in this sub about the biased mainstream media and many people saying it would be perfectly fine if they were completely banned from existence.  Now these same people are jumping to the defense of a country that completely controls and censors almost all of their media and actually citing their propaganda as justification for their beliefs... This is a country that literally murders reporters who criticize their leader.  How are you supposed to do fair research if the leadership is suppressing opposing views?  I&#39;ve head a lot of support for Trump&#39;s plan to impose broad federal libel laws on the press, which would allow rich people to bully and bankrupt critical reporters.  </p>

<p>Russia has launched a very powerful psy-ops campaign, especially in this community and it is readily accepted because until now, it has favored Trump and people like that.  But they are posing as Americans and using botnets to inflate likes on twitter accounts, youtube videos, reddit posts, facebook posts, conspiracy websites, etc while down voting opposing views.  I would not be surprised if this very post was written by a Russian. It sounds incredibly reasonable and it&#39;s impossible to find anything to criticize, no matter what your beliefs... but then it prescribes a specific policy.  The bill in question is specifically targeted at Russian state-created propaganda.  Are you just trying to protect your ability to hear what you want?  Or will you also stand up for free speech when Trump tries to suppress his critics?</p>

<p>So Ron Paul is Russian propaganda to you?  The most patriotic politician America has seen in decades? You gotta be fucking kidding me. You don&#39;t see the Irony in what you&#39;re saying? That bill is targeting free speech and you buy the bait that it&#39;s aimed at a collapsed superpower with the GDP size of Italy whose more efficient in propaganda than the current standing super power? </p>

<p>Oh god please don&#39;t tell me this is how the majority of Americans think. If it is say goodbye to your bill of rights everyone. The deep state is only getting started... Ignorance is bliss until it comes knocking at your door.</p>

<p>I mean I hate to say this but I think you&#39;re just trolling. Good job troll! Because if you truly believe in what you&#39;re saying, you are delusional. It doesn&#39;t matter republican or democrat, Trump or Hillary, they&#39;re all out to fuck us over and gain more power for themselves. If Putin did help Trump it makes sense since Hillary was literally trying to fuck Russia (and her allies) over anyway she could. Guess what though, Russia would win if this bill is passed you know how? Our traditions of freedom and independence in our open society (or what&#39;s left of it) goes down the drain. We slowly let our values become authoritarian just like the country you are demonizing right now. You actually think Fake news and Russia is a threat? It&#39;s brainwashed minds eating up corrupt politicians lies that is the threat. Wake up dude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not for it, but it is targeting foreign propaganda, not free speech(which is a right that only American citizens are guaranteed).  That of course does not mean it isn&#39;t a threat to free speech.  My point was that Trump has rhetorically attacked every facet of the first amendment, and Russia represents the worst case scenario for it. I just hope this community will be just as outraged when Trump targets liberals, minorities, and democratic institutions.  I&#39;m not optimistic, because Trump lies more than any person I have ever seen and his supporters believe him regardless of the truth.  He could literally take over half of the American media the way Putin did and say he&#39;s doing it in order to <em>protect</em> free speech and his supporters would believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people in conspiracy are already outraged at Trump for many different reasons. Personally for me it&#39;s all his promises he made on the campaign trail that he will go half ass on or just plain lied about and also his VP choice/cabinet picks. I wish you would be outraged about all the lies/corruption the DNC has hidden. Our government has a 1984 way of naming things that imply its there to help/protect the citizens instead it helps drive the agenda of the government/corporations . e.g. Patriot Act.

    <div class="md"><p>I never know exactly what people mean by mainstream media.  I think a lot of people consider it to just be the FOX, CNN, and MSNBC tv networks.  I agree media is changing but the most popular sources are always going to have the most money and are going to hire the best journalists and editors with degrees from the best schools.  So sure, guys like Alex Jones with a community college degree will still have an audience but online papers and magazines like the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal will continue to dominate - because they have the most consistent reputations for being accurate, breaking stories first, having the best writing, and doing in-depth investigations.  The fact that you believe what you&#39;re saying in your second to last paragraph is why fringe sources don&#39;t survive long-term - their audience eventually looks silly for believing their bad reporting.</p>

<p>The Russians have been doing this all across Europe recently and it will come to a head soon.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of reasons for it, your link sites the most glaring one for the very recent trend: Donald Trump.  He stole Sean Hannity and Alex Jones&#39; formula for capturing followers.  Make people believe that you&#39;re the only one they can trust and everyone else is lying to them.  Trust also goes down in election years because people use it as weapons and consequently also find themselves on the receiving end of it.  Also, uneducated people take an abnormally strong interest in it around election time, propping up less reliable sources before they lose interest again.  But my point is it will never go away, it will just adapt.  Just because people think that most sources are biased doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they&#39;re going to stop consuming it.  People may drift toward other sources, but then those will be the new mainstream.  The cable networks are dying because tv is dying.  But the one thing that will never change is that news media is a free market where branding and building trust are the most important elements.  All of the most successful media sources will secure the integrity of their brand by hiring the best journalists and that means the educated liberal elite who run the New York Times, Rolling Stone, Salon, Time, The Washington Post, etc, will always be in the driver seat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;People have a tendency to cherry pick information to bend to a belief system they have already created for themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>People have beliefs (not a &quot;belief system&quot;) they have acquired through observation and logic.  Don&#39;t try to talk down to us.   The increasingly frequent use of the words &quot;humility&quot; and &quot;humble(d)&quot; by the msm and inquiring, concerned &quot;minds&quot; online and off are an obvious attempt to make us believe that line of bullshit.  Our enemies need to be humbled, humiliated, and destroyed.  And they will be. (You do what you&#39;re told. No.  I don&#39;t.)</p>

<p>&quot;And now it&#39;s reached a point where we may actually have our alternative media shut off, according to this latest news of congress passing a bill to censor alternative news.&quot;</p>

<p>And this is because we haven&#39;t learned humility?  Bullshit.  We don&#39;t engage in pissing contests.  We are enraged.</p>
