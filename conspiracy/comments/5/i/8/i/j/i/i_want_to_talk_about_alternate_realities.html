On one hand, I&#39;m very much on the &quot;fuck it, can&#39;t do much about it&quot;, but in the deep recess of my mind. there is an itch that won&#39;t go away. The repercussions are too big and the uncertainty are major. Only 2 hypothesis are valid at this point. Multiverse merging or the simulation. I would really like it better if it was the multiverse.

    <div class="md"><p>Of course faulty memory must be taken into account. But your argument is flawed, the only thing that can be &quot;verified &quot; is somethings that is common among many people. I have found a very Mandela Effect in my personal history with my brother. The only other person that could remember it for verification is dead. So... It&#39;s pointless because no one can attest whether is a faulty memory or truly a modification.
I have talked to this one guy that has written a history of the German Naval fleet during WW2. He tell me he doesn&#39;t recognize his 2nd chapters and that the amount of complete frigate has changed by 2 less than he remembers. That is very specialized knowledge. Can&#39;t prove shit about it. Only Where we have common knowledge can we actually detect it, and not chuck it to faulty memory. If you build it, ____ will come, it&#39;s a beautiful day in ____ neighborhood, interviews with ____ vampire. Houston we ___ a problem was a big one for me, friend of mine work on that flick, I remember the poster had that phrase in small font on a black background with Tom Hawk. I looked it up on YouTube when I heard that it had changed. Sure enough, all the sudden Tom Hawks say Houston we HAD a problem. Less than a week later, on this subreddit I read that it went back. I use my YouTube history to pull up the same clip. Boom it had changed back to Have!</p>
