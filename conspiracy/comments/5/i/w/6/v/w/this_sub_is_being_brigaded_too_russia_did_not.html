       How the fuck any single one of you buys the the Russian hacking narrative is boggling my mind. Not all of us are Trump supporters (tho im becoming hopeful), but I'm literally watching people this conspiracy community parrot MSM talking points. What the fuck is going on?! There's a mediamatters article on the first page, for fuck's sake!!

       Dont let the Red Scare come back. Don't make people afraid of their heritage again. And I'm sorry to say, the answer is not being afraid for its own sake. Don't listen to propoganda. Only trust your own eyes.

       Nobody here has bought into the "Putin hacked the DNC" narrative, as far as I can see. It's a dumb move by the elite, because it will wake up a lot of people who can see it's an obvious lie - it will break the spell and make people realise the government and the media are in cahoots - peddling bullshit.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       posts that appear on their front page, and their views are far less red-pilled than the regular visitors to the sub. That's why we get these "Hillary was bad, but Trump was worse" comments.

       Leading up to the election anti-hillary posts were typically the only posts scoring thousands of upvotes. the top comment in those would almost always be something along the lines of " good, she's a cunt" "hang that lying psychopath", "watch out for the clinton kill count". F

       In case you haven't noticed, even though Hillary is almost universally hated here, that does not mean Donald Trump is wildly popular. There have been hundreds of posts lamenting the fact that this sub has "become an outpost of T_D." Don't tell me you haven't noticed this.

       To defend his point a little bit, it's not just about those who subscribe to the sub; when a post gets popular enough to hit r/all you start getting
       <em>
        all kinds
       </em>
       of people in here.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you're arguing that forum manipulators are responsible for this, I think that view actually complements Sabremesh's. It's the posts that start getting close to r/all that professional opinion massagers are most concerned about manipulating, too. So you've got a double whammy increase of both shill infiltration and random redditors who have no clue about any conspiracy and are conditioned to ridicule the faintest hint of an uncomfortable question.

       Clinton is a dangerous woman, to think otherwise would be stupid. But I agree, Trump made a point to make /conspiracy his platform and probably Kremlin trolls too. It also makes it easier to see the Trump fanboys as well, I for one was happy that he won over Clinton, but the man is far from good for the people of America and the world for that matter.

       okay, here's the thing..... if Russia did help out trump by hacking the DNC and spreading disinformation that trump benefited from.....
       <strong>
        that would be a conspiracy
       </strong>
       , If the democrats and the left are making all this up that is
       <strong>
        also a conspiracy
       </strong>
       , this subs entire purpose in life is for open discussion about these types of things, it isn't about silencing a narrative just because the trump cult doesn't like......

       your entire comment history is basically nothing but loving trump and calling liberals idiots, and the only reason you would try lying about that is because you want people to think this isn't just the trump cult pushing their agenda on other people......

       Dissenting opinions are more than welcome. Care to present actual evidence that Russia hacked anything at all besides "FBI/CIA" says they did? Thing is, no one has. All they do is point to your bias, accuse you of being a Trump "cultist",

       ummm no, idk if you maybe forgot what you dedicated this post to, but it wasn't about having an open discussion regarding the allegations of Russia alleged involvement with this elections, this is a dedicated trump cult circle jerk, your first line was
       <em>
        "How the fuck any single one of you buys the the Russian hacking narrative is boggling my mind"
       </em>
       . it's only about how you think anyone who thinks the opposite of you is basically an idiot,
      </p>
      <p>
       and maybe if you want to have that conversation try starting a post that ask people unbiasedly for their opinions...... instead of lying about being a trump supporter to tell people to stop thinking a certain way.......

       So you're bothered enough by a little hyperbole on Reddit to dig through a user's post history, come here and bitch about it, and present no counter-arguments whatsoever? Make your own posts if you want to be nice about it, i can word my opinion in any manner i choose.
      </p>

       And yes, if you believe the FBI/CIA Russian hacking narrative, I sincerely fucking believe you are misinformed, or simply delusional. Care to try and shame me out of that opinion some more?

       You're wrong about Blix. You might have missed the
       <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2003/sc7682.doc.htm">
        report
       </a>
       showing that Iraq was complying with UN edicts or the

        statement
       </a>
       that the inspectors had found no evidence of prohibited weapons programs. Opposition to the war was NOT solely moral or pragmatic. It was also based on the lack of evidence and faulty claims as to evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand the collective need to think that we are informed and critical and weren't fooled. People like Judith Miller of The New York Times have tried to rewrite history on this. But we were warned about every aspect of this.

       all that does is buy us some time. look at all these other subs it doesnt take long for them to install their own mods etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       taking these discussions in to our own private little corner serves no one but them, at least here there are public eyes that occasionally stumble down the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       the upside is these idiots are common stock morons, so their ability to cover their tracks and appear genuine is pretty limited (Which is why its always so damn obvious when they start doing it)

       stay critical, look for the angles, and always ask who benefits. i've been around this sub for the last 8 years or so, i have confidence in most of the people here to keep doing this and stay ahead of them and their disinfo bullshit.

       Keep in mind though, I'm not saying for it to be fully private, just a bit blocked. So we don't get vote brigades and propaganda posts popping up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's probably not hard to make an automod that checks those who post on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , then check the account to see if it's over a year old, then add it to the party. Then a mod, if seeing someone get in that shouldn't, can ban. It's be 'filtered' instead of 'private'.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Mod Coupes, make the bot open source, and if it goes to shit, just make a new sub.

       like i said the only defence against these sort of attacks is an intelligent an aware user base. if you censor anyone it become just a matter of time until some one from TPTB gets a spot as a mod and then the whole thing implodes on itself.

       Yes, and intelligent user base helps. However having discussion constantly altered due to vote brigading, and constant attempts at large-scale attacks is a downside.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a mod change happens, just move on to a new subreddit. Keep the bot open source, and have it compile two lists, those who have been banned, and those it accepted in. A simple Binary Search algorithm with an alphabetically sorted user name, as well as a way to just add everyone from the list.

      <p>
       But it seems no one likes this idea so I guess I'm done here. No use defending this idea.

       I'm all ears go for it.  I honestly haven't heard a good argument.  I was under the impression that all countries were hacking each other.
Surely, you don't think Russia is more of an agent on foreign cyber-attacks than China and America, right?
According to Snowden and the shadow broker leaked, however, I am under the impression that only the USA trapping meta-data on foreign and domestic servers, which is just as bad imo

       Here's the most forensic description I've found.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The forensic evidence that links network breaches to known groups is solid: used and reused tools, methods, infrastructure, even unique encryption keys. For example: in late March the attackers registered a domain with a typo—misdepatrment[.]com—to look suspiciously like the company hired by the DNC to manage its network, MIS Department. They then linked this deceptive domain to a long-known APT 28 so-called X-Tunnel command-and-control IP address, 45.32.129[.]185.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the strongest pieces of evidence linking GRU to the DNC hack is the equivalent of identical fingerprints found in two burglarized buildings: a reused command-and-control address—176.31.112[.]10—that was hard coded in a piece of malware found both in the German parliament as well as on the DNC’s servers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Russian military intelligence was identified by the German domestic security agency BfV as the actor responsible for the Bundestag breach. The infrastructure behind the fake MIS Department domain was also linked to the Berlin intrusion through at least one other element, a shared SSL certificate." (

         http://motherboard.vice.com/read/all-signs-point-to-russia-being-behind-the-dnc-hack
        </a>
        )
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The evidence that state-directed Russian hacking is responsible for the DNC breach is, in other words, more than circumstantial.
      </p>
      <p>
       An important part of the hack was a so-called 'spear-phishing' campaign that attempted to emulate legitimate websites to pilfer credentials and even maintain a persistent connection to a secure session:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim's full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim's account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access."
       </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The forensic evidence left by the hacks (C&amp;C IP addresses, spoofed certificates, encryption codes) point to Russian sources due to similarities between these intrusions and previous ones in Germany, Georgia, Latvia and other confirmed breaches.

       Again,
       <em>
        this has been out since July,
       </em>
       including evidence that "Guccifer 2.0" is a smokescreen persona:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "ThreatConnect is the first to identify and detail analysis of Guccifer 2.0’s operational infrastructure. In our original hypothesis, we suspected Guccifer 2.0 might be leveraging French infrastructure to communicate with the global media, and we have validated this finding with the help of the media. As more details continue to surface surrounding Guccifer 2.0, we continue to identify heavy traces of Russian activity, from the specific Russian-based VPN service provider, domain registrants, and registrars as well as various discrete events that have circumstantial marks of Russian origins.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we pointed out in our previous analysis, we conclude Guccifer 2.0 is an apparition created under a hasty Russian D&amp;D campaign, which has clearly evolved into an Active Measures Campaign. Those who are operating under the Guccifer 2.0 Twitter, WordPress and Email communications are likely made up a cadre of non-technical politruk attempting to establish “Guccifer 2.0” as a static fixture on the world stage along the likes of Manning, Assange or Snowden. Their use of Russian VPN services with French infrastructure may shed light on a method Russian intelligence operatives use — domestic services coupled with foreign infrastructure — to help hide their hand and deter any potential attribution to Russia."
       </p>

       <a href="https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-all-roads-lead-russia/">

      </p>
      <p>
       There is plenty of forensic evidence to parse through. Yes, sure, it's
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       that DNC networks were compromised by APT28 / APT29 (Cozy Bear and Lazy Bear)
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       that the leak did originate from another, third (possibly internal?) source.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, it's a very bold and risky play to deliberately use cyberwarfare capabilities to leak internal documents in lieu of traditional espionage: it compromises quiet ongoing surveillance in favor of a ploy that may or may not work, and could even spectacularly backfire. But it's also compatible with an emboldened Russian foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And certainly it's also possible that the leak had far more wide-ranging influences that anyone intended, and all the players are caught off guard here and just improvising. (In fact that's more likely: only in movies does the villain 'foresee' events 12 steps in advance).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the evidence is more than circumstantial. Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear left significant fingerprints over the crime scene, from the command and control IP addresses, to the specific code and exploits used, to the Cyrillic settings on leaked documents; again, read the third-party security analyses for yourself. We don't have to just take someone's word for it, even though the American intelligence community is unanimous in its assessment here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So: there is evidence; it's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a slam dunk, but pretty close; and there are many unanswered questions still.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just a normal dude with a kid and a messy house and I don't have time to answer everyone. There are thoughtful comments downthread that discuss the limits of this evidence, such as it is, and other comments that are less useful. I acknowledge that the forensics are compatible with a lot of possibilities (including a massive conspiracy to start a war!), but some of these possibilities seem very remote to me. Follow the links, read what's there, and make up your own minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanted to say: there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       evidence, not
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       evidence as some were saying. It is in the nature of evidence that it does not form a deductive logical proof. So it goes. You don't have to just 'take someone's word for it,' even if that someone is the PoTUS and 17 intelligence agencies...
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, look, how likely is it really that we're off to war with Russia when, in 30-odd days, Rex Tillerson will be Secretary of State? You know, the guy who supports removing sanctions from Russia over Crimea and has the Russian Order of Friendship medal? This is not a pretext for WWIII. If you watched Obama's press conference he talked multilateral frameworks to curb cyberwarfare between states, not thermonuclear armageddon. Y'all need to calm down.

-the CIA has a long history of supplying disinfo foreign and abroad
-nyt and other establishment mouthpieces (MSM) have been wrong more times in the last 16 years than I can count.

       IMO, there's quite a bit of certainty surrounding the issue, which is of course obvious by the tone of the post. Ultimately, it's more about the brigading.

       I don't see any reason the Russian hacking story isn't plausible, or even likely. It has been developing for months, and there's no question Putin/Russia was very pro-Trump, and/or anti-Hillary. Everything that appears in the MSM is not bullshit, and whether it's a story that's makes Trump appear tainted (which he's only making worse by not considering the possibility Russia did hack, and seeing it as a legit threat to our nation in itself, rather than taking the suggestion of interference as a personal insult), it is very much a story to be reported. Not even because of the content of leaks, but because there may very well have been interference in our elections by a foreign nation. That's a risk to our democracy, and I'm not going to dismiss the story because it's from the evil, terrible, bad, dishonest, blah, blah, blah MSM.

       I'm not convinced by Assange's denial. No good journalist is going to name that source, and it'd be near-suicide for him to say "this comes straight from the Russian government, at the behest of Putin himself." I'm not convinced, at this point, that Wikileaks hasn't lost integrity, particularly with Assange himself saying he hopes to stop Clinton.

       While that email piece depicts sensible political strategy - just as much as Trump keying in on deleted emails was - it doesn't remotely indicate a connection to any hacking/influencing issues. Those are separate. And the Russian hacking issue hit the news back in June, to begin with, at least.

       The only
       <em>
        hack
       </em>
       the MSM and libs have backed down into still pushing ( because its been exposed that that their narratives are fake and they have literally ZERO evidence of anything else) is the Podesta emails/DNC "hack".
      </p>
      <p>
       But these emails were released by Wikileaks and a couple others (Guccifer and another IIRC).  Julain Assange himself, with a 10 year unblemished track record of accuracy and reliability, told Hannity point blank yesterday that "NO STATE ACTOR, INCLUDING RUSSIA" leaked the emails.  So could Russian agents have been behind one of the other 2 sites that leaked them? Possibly.   Its plausible.  But the main leak source, WL, said it WASNT THE RUSSIANS! PERIOD!! so WL would have published them anyway, and from non-russian source. Have russian agents hacked other government institutions in the last few years? Undoubtedly, and so havent a dozen other countries.  And we have hacked
       <strong>
        them
       </strong>
       also. The point here?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        everything else is a smokescreen and a flimsy finger-pointing excuse
       </strong>
       . None of the public buys it except libs who ar elooking for more excuse narratives every day anyway.

       And most real-life libs, who aren't the cartoon people on Tumblr or handed to you by alt-right media, aren't looking for an excuse. Hillary lost, and most of us aren't shocked. Most of us don't for a moment think Trump shouldn't take office, whether we like it or not, unless he's directly tied to whatever Russia did do in our election. Instead, we're concerned that another nation might have interfered and outright influenced our election. Regardless of how much Trump takes the mere mention of hacking as a personal insult, that sort of interference is something we'd especially like to see addressed for the safety of
       <em>
        future

       I agree on defense vs hacking in a very broad sense - with the caveat that there has been ZERO evidence presented that it was Russia who hacked the DNC.

       US cyberdefenses should be beefed up to prevent hacking

        any and all

       The whole

       I'm in agreement with you almost completely, eight up until the stuff about the NYT. They may have made it a point to report "against" Trump, and clearly had an anti-Trump bias, but that doesn't equal a "smear campaign" when what they are reporting is verifiably factual much of the time, and newsworthy to report in providing a view of a Presidential candidate's negative qualities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry to ramble, ignore that if you want. Anyhow, yes. My much greater concern is the cyber-safety factor. I have zero expectation to see Trump un-Presidented, and don't think even think he should be if he wasn't directly connected to whatever. But I don't want
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of our systems hacked. Elections, most of all, because they're essential to truly living in a Democracy. But damn...there are so many things to screw up for us otherwise in every aspect of our society. Getting into top-level officials' emails and god only knows what else is a big damned red flag cyber security needs to tighten up, even if it's pretty good, overall. And systems need a very thorough check across the board right away.
      </p>
      <p>
       It bothers me a great deal Trump is dismissing the concept out of hand, and dismissing the possibility of Russia being involved. He's acting like he thinks he's being told they want to take his President's crown away now, rather acknowledging the penetration of vital government systems may be occurring by an outside agent.

       Do you have a quote from him re this statement?
      </p>
      <p>
       AFAIK the only thing he has dismissed are the WaPo media reports, which are, in fact, dismissable considering they have been attack propaganda for the last year towards him.  It appears Obama has seen intel and does agree, and I know at least one congressman who serves on an intel subcomittee was on Fox saying he has seen intel and it is compelling.  But thats all we know, we know nothing further than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       To counter-point that, Julian Assange himself said point blank that the reported emails were a submitted leak, not a hack, and were not a state party, including Russia.  Wikileaks has a ten year spotless accuracy record and I see no reason why their founder himself would come out and volunteer that if it was untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       So:
we agree, in broad terms, that our cybersecurity a) is a joke and b) MUST be strengthened. We must not be vulnerable to institutional hacks, from any source
      </p>
      <p>
       where Im not sure we agree is that liberals and dems cant help themselves but continually somehow desperately try to merge this bi-partisan fact with the DNC email server hack. Same general issue, yes, but a) DNC
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       have had better security - I mean after all the RNC wasnt penetrated by all accounts, even though intrusions were attempted and b) hackers intruding into corporate and governmental systems is a matter of course, even though it
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be addressed and stopped and most importantly c) the source and motive of the DNC hacks/leaks is contested between intel sources and the info publisher fer cryin out loud. So we
       <strong>
        just dont know

       Here's the problem in a nutshell. He didn't like the
       <em>
        source
       </em>
       so it's ok to disregard the report completely,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       smear the investigating agency because of that. Whether they've been anti-Trump or not, they still report legitimate news. And they didn't report Alex Jones, a known nut, as saying it, they reported a main agency he himself will depend on for intelligence as saying it. Dismissing it because he didn't like the source, or the source hasn't been nice enough to him, isn't acceptable given the importance of the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange would say almost exactly that if he were trying to cover for Russia, too. I don't trust him, or wikileaks, at this point. I can see it as plausible they've taken on an agenda, which Assange previously acknowledged saying he would be posting anti-Hillary stuff. It's
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       it's a leak, and I think determining that should be priority, too.

      <p>
       I had heard the RNC was as well, just not released. I see the DNC server email hack as a symptom/example of the need for greater cybersecurity. Unless there is solid evidence of Trump being directly connected to something sneaky, or actual hacked vote counts themselves, I don't think for a minute he should be denied the Presidency. Love it or hate it, he won. But, even though it doesn't reflect well on Trump, every time the idea is suggested, he reacts as if he's being taunted as not the winner. He needs to get over that. "Looking bad" and "being made to look bad" is part of the Presidential job description.

       In my view, their reporting is
       <strong>
        so
       </strong>
       far left, they are no better than Alex Jones.  In fact, I would sooner trust AJ.

       And I disagree about not trusting WL or Assange himself.  His entire 10 year perfect record relies on his trustworthiness, I dont see him throwing his weight behind anything willy-nilly. It literally is all they have (his rep).

       I'm not taking about the tilt their commentators put on things, I'm talking about the actual news itself. The spin is whole 'nother thing, but actual news reporting on CNN is pretty reliably accurate. Whereas Alex Jones delivers the spin as news itself, and often on topics that are purely made up.
      </p>
      <p>
       My tendency is to think Assange has been compromised by Russia. I'd rather he not be, however. It's important to note too, that last I'd heard, CIA was certain the hack of DNC was Russian, and less so the hack of Podesta was. So, Assange could be correct that the source of the leaks he provided was not Russian.

       Im not saying this is right or wrong, but what is your basis for believing this? Thanks for pointing out that the DNC server and Podesta may in fact be 2
       <strong>
        separate
       </strong>
       incidences, given he admittedly lost his phone several times too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange only asserted that the leaks given to him were
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       from any state actor.  He said in the same interview that guccifer 2.0 and another publisher may in fact have received files from government-directed sources, he simply did not know.

       Bits and peices of read here and there regarding him disappearing for a bit, differences in ID tags (beats me, tech stuff) in posts, and that literally the only things being published are exclusively anti-Hillary, at least in the sense that "leaks on Hillary!" itself
       <em>

       bad, so they they still work against her. I'm not ready to tar and feather him, nor would I vote to convict, but I can see him being compromised at least as a distinct possibility. And I could definitely see it equally plausible that, compromised or not, the leaks he published weren't provided by Russia.

       <p>
        RUSSIA DID NOT LEAK THE EMAILS!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is a bold statement. For the record, I've seen no strong evidence tying Russia to the hacks, other than what CrowdStrike
       <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/">
        put out in June
       </a>
       . I've also criticized this report here and elsewhere, as it essentially says Russian hackers must have done it because the hackers used the same methods that Russian hackers have used in the past. The problem with that logic is that if CrowdStrike knows their methods, others likely are also aware, and a sophisticated actors could mask their efforts as Russian hacks. It's the difference between finding a gun that was used in a previous crime vs. finding a gun of the same model that was used in a crime. It's weak at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't find Assange's denial that Russia was the leaker too convincing either. Sure, WL has never been found to have released falsified or inauthentic documents, but that doesn't mean we should trust them implicitly as to the identity of their sources. That Assange has not made a solid PoL in two months does not help his credibility on this matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm with you; I'm disinclined to believe the claims that Russia is the leaker without some damn good proof, none of which has yet been offered, but I'm also not going to make a definitive claim that they weren't. It would fit their MO, and they do stand to gain by a Trump presidency vs. HRC. They certainly have the means, motive, and opportunity for the crime, and it would be folly to rule out the possibility at this time.

       I'm not sure, and I've honestly not looked too far into CrowdStrike. They're an infosec firm hired by the DNC after they suspected a breach in their security. It could seriously hurt their reputation if they are found to have falsified or misrepresented what they discovered, but I wouldn't put it past them, especially if they thought they could win favor in what seemed a likely Clinton administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       But like I said, I don't find their evidence all that compelling, regardless of the company itself; I just presented it here as it's the strongest evidence
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       has produced thus far. Omitting it would have been disingenuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       The narrative that Russia did this does make sense to me. They would clearly gain by not having HRC as president, who certainly would have caused them more headaches in Syria and likely elsewhere, and they're more than capable of breaching what seems to be rather poor security at DNC. That doesn't mean I think they did it, but I will withhold judgement until the US IC presents their evidence, and I will disbelieve them if they fail to bring such evidence.

       Isnt it much more likely that Americans realized they had much to gain by an HRC loss? Of course Russia is a mutual beneficiary to that, no one is denying it. That in no way implicates them, however. It's really a win-win.

       Is the IC sheduled to brief the electors before Monday? I havent heard that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they do, don't you agree their briefing should be fully dislcosed to the public? If the briefing was behind closed doors, would you trust that you werent being lied to?

       I think it's hard to assign any type of likelihood values to these things when there's just so many variables we can only guess at. It's possible we'll never know. You're correct though, it doesn't implicate them; I'm just not ready to rule it out.

      <p>
       No, not that I'm aware of. My best guess is that the EC will vote in Trump, there will be some final grumblings about this, and the news narrative will shift to something new. A week from now, you'll be hearing about the latest Trump conflict of interest, and this whole episode will be largely forgotten.  I think this was a last ditch effort to salvage the HRC campaign. If the IC had any hard proof, they would have released it instead of pussyfooting around with anonymous leaks to the press.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they briefed the electors behind closed doors, I would absolutely not believe it. They would likely defend it as "protecting national security and intelligence-gather methods," which always reeks of bullshit.

       There is a secondary effect in this neo-McCarthyist act.  People on both sides are pushed out of taking Russia seriously.  They are still a significant world power and we should still be educating ourselves about how they operate and what they actually do right and wrong.

       You can be paid to post a certain narrative and still post about what you enjoy watching or reading.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it just adds to the overall experience of being a "normal" Reddit user by having comments in multiple subreddits to distract from the fact that you're being paid by CTR.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a possibility that you use multiple accounts to vote manipulate other users, and it's happened before to legitimate users when they disagree with your employer.

       How insecure in your own beliefs do you have to be to assume everyone who disagrees with you is paid to do so? Seriously, its fucking baffling how delusional you are. Heaven forbid someone thinks your ideas are stupid so you cope by telling yourself they must be paid to disagree.

       Yes, conveniently ignore my frequent posts to r/buildapc, r/civ, r/Overwatch, and r/marvel because it fits your fragile viewpoint lmao. Relevant username btw. Funny you have 600 karma and haven't even been on reddit for a year yet I've been hear 3 and have 400K. Who's really the shill? Is Alex jones paying you to post?

       Funny how in my 6 years I have 13k comment karma as a pretty frequent user but you seem to want to boast your 400k as if it means anything. We all know you can buy accounts with a bunch of karma. Your rush to legitimize your account by stating your diverse range of subs you contribute to is suspicious as fuck as well. Might have to go buy another account and be a bit more sophisicated in creating your backstory because you're transparent as fuck.

       Lmao. You have no idea how easy it is to buy upvotes.

      <p>
       Reddit is one clusterfuck of shill bots all upvoting each other, or you can use third party vendors who have their own collection of bots.

      <p>
       IIRC several thousand upvotes cost $50-$100, which is spare change for the Clinton Foundation.

       Reddit is one clusterfuck of shill bots all upvoting each other, or you can use third party vendors who have their own collection of bots.

       I agree on defense vs hacking in a very broad sense - with the caveat that there has been ZERO evidence presented that it was Russia who hacked the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       US cyberdefenses should be beefed up to prevent hacking
       <strong>
        in general
       </strong>
       wouldnt you say?
      </p>
      <p>
       Im more concerned about
       <em>
        any and all
       </em>
       foreign governments hacking
       <em>
        any and all
       </em>
       of our institutional systems.  To me one specific government hacking a political email server who cant be bothered to use up to date security methods is the least concern I have.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole
       <em>
        interfering in our elections
       </em>
       is so laughable. Was it
       <em>
        foreign
       </em>
       interference when Carlos Slim - owned NYT dishonestly smeared Trump for nearly a year (while pretending to be "news")? Please. Now THAT is foreign hacking.

And I could definitely see it equally plausible that, compromised or not, the leaks he published weren't provided by Russia.
