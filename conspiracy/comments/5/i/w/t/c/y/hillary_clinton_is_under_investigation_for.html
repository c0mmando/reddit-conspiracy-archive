        "There's evidence that the state sponsors of terrorism, namely the ISIS, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are major donors to the Clinton Foundation. Sec of State Clinton at the time, committed herself to waging a war against the terrorists and at the same time, she receives money from the state sponsors of terrorism--which, in effect, constitutes an act of treason." --

      <p>
       Keep in mind, these emails are real.  Clinton's emails are real because they've been evaluated by congress, weiner's are real because they've been evaluated by the FBI; and podesta's emails are real because they've been dkim verified by google and double validated by those within the media who were CC recipients in email threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have her dead to rights.  The only way out for her is to for her to steal the election in 2 days, and for america to accept that coup by a presidential candidate who is under investigation by 3 different agencies for treason.

       Unless that changes, the FBI isn't doing shit, because it's likely he's implicated as well.   The entire system is corrupt.  Until people understand that, nothing changes.

       None of it is new, but I've seen more about these 3 topics in conspiracy corners of the internet in the last few weeks than in the last 10 years.

       Because the system is corrupt, everyone knows it don't matter.  Our lesser america has been screaming that our rights are being trampled. At what point do people see the corruption and not care? Now? No, people have never cared.  Our complacency was bought w our comfort. And our lesser America was right, these are some dirty dogs were all up against. Our lawmakers.  Who watches the watchers?

       I don't know what to say about that, other than the fact that 3 months ago, I, and many others, weren't not aware of any of this.  I followed politics, but really didn't believe that the media corruption/manipulation went as far as it did.   What changed my perception, was first considering the idea that Clinton actually was guilty, and then seeing the extent of the cover up and how many people it involved/implicated.  That woke me up in a hurry.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, people are waking up. Keep planting seeds, keep informing.  If people understand this isn't a democrat vs republican issue, they're a lot more likely to be open to listening.

       I think the term "liberal" doesn't mean what we usually think it means. Since Clinton (NEOlib / NEOcon extreme authoritarian right winger like Obama, Bush, etc.) also identifies as a liberal.....it's probably more accurate to say "left wing" or "democratic socialist" or something. (Which Clinton CERTAINLY IS NOT) But liberal seems to be thrown around for anything lol. And that's how fools think "the establishment is liberal!!!" which is ridiculous. The establishment is fascist. It wants the people to be slaves. In the French revolution, those that were "on the side of the kind" were RIGHT WING. Those that were "on the side of the people" were LEFT WING. Political ignorance fuels the alt right which uses scapegoats like immigration, political correctness and other absurd things that make distractions so you don't suspect the real problem......the government.

       Funny you say that! At my very first ceremony, that was the message in my journey that I kept getting, "We are all one!" The next day, the couple next to me were whispering to each other, but loud enough I could hear. The girl whispered "So.. we are all one?" slightly confused. The guy shushhed her, like it was a secret or something. But my eyes got big...

       The greatest secret. One that is now being revealed to the world and remembered by its souls. We are light, we are love, we are beings of both, and that is our essence. We are all one, the earth, it's animals, its citizens, our galactic neighbors, we are all one with source.

        The Twelfth Amendment requires each elector to cast one vote for president and another vote for vice president.[4][5] In each state and the District of Columbia, electors are chosen every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, and then meet to cast ballots on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.[6] The candidates who receive an absolute majority of electoral votes among the states are elected President and Vice President of the United States when the Electoral College vote is certified by Congress in January.

       Correct, but they're not set in stone until Monday. In many states, the Electors could, technically, give the people the middle finger and vote for whomever they want. That's what the death threats, the C list celeb vid, and other coercion is about.

       Good question, this is what the consensus of the rest of america. It doesn't need to be downvoted, its a legitimate question in this muddy, disinformation fueled election. And the answer is equally important.

       I think they have been pushing it back to the latest it can go given the situation at hand. There is an allowance of time so votes can get counted and whatnot, and the deadline is in 2 days I guess

       The Electoral College votes on... well... essentially on the status of the President elect and whether or not they accept the vote under the previously established legislation... There is talk that because Clinton won the popular vote by such a huge margin they won't accept the results (edit: even though there is also acknowledgement of voter fraud etc, CogDis)...
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing is bullocks. On an interesting sidenote, 2016 was the year of predictions for "the last pope" and "the last president" (usually coincides with an "extended term/third term" prophecy).  The system doesn't work - I wonder if the outcome of this election will create an awareness in the American populace.... Next week should be very interesting!

       Man that sucks. I'm all for getting rid of the electoral college but it's double standards to give Clinton a free ride while they ignore the fact Bush won without the popular vote.....and on top of that, I consider Clinton the "worse evil" with her warmonger foreign policies even though I used to think it was Trump who was worse everywhere else....now I'm not even bloody sure!! Trump's cabinet is looking increasingly shitty by the day. Establishment bastards filling his cabinet like a labor secretary that hates the minimum wage. Americans will be at the mercy of what their state allows as the minimum wage....or even NO minimum wage! :/ So uh....I think people in Bernie's home state of Vermont are probably one of the luckier ones with $9.60 an hour. :P
 Some people think Obama will become dictator, the world will end in 2012....la la la la....but who knows when the prophecies start to come true lol. But I am suspicious of the elite using biblical references or prophecies to lead religious people into a trap, e.g. the Christ/anti-Christ thing....there's a conspiracy theory that Putin will be a "Christ like figure" and then later reveal himself to actually be the "anti-Christ" but no idea if that's disinfo against Russia or if we are truly fucked with a "east vs west illusion"......shit.

       The college is working exactly like it's supposed to. It brings balance to the process. It's basically instituted for the same reason that we don't just have a HoR based on population, but also the Senate with and equal amount of legislators for each state.
      </p>
      <p>
       It protects the smaller states and allows them to have a say in the process. Actually pretty fucking brilliant when you think about it.

       How is it brilliant that some farm-state with a low population gets just as much say, if not more, than a state with millions of people?

       Because it keeps California (a relatively small portion of the union in size) from single handedly deciding the vote. Also I don't know where you get off on considering "farm states" as an insult but without them states like California would collapse spectacularly.

       I think it's still better to just go back to democracy 101
and have 1 person = 1 vote.
 I guess that's what I really meant. Count up all the votes, candidate with most, wins. No other complicated nonsense intended to keep the power structure. :D

       Oooo bad idea. This is why they dont teach civics in high school anymore. The last thing you want is a pure democracy. That's why it's called a democratic republic.

       But isn't the entire concept of "a state" pretty arbitrary?
I understand this argument and not sure what compromise is best as I'm not a mathematician (although, state populations fluctuate anyway....) but certainly this current system is hugely flawed hence we get people like Bush without getting the popular vote.

       Correct. It is actually the Republican-controlled Congress who makes the final decision on the election. The power of any College elector to go against the state popular vote and change the outcome of the election is zilch. In their first joint session, Congress, with a GOP majority in both chambers, approves or objects to the December 19th vote.

       This video is over a month old.  Things have been moving so fast lately that this information is almost dated at this point.  Clinton was under investigation by the FBI - the same FBI that the CIA just said has completely changed their tune and are now claiming that Russia
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       in fact tamper with the elections (which I think is a bullshit claim by the CIA attempting to sabotage the FBI, but the claim
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       still being made).

       Remember when bill clinton pardoned a bunch of terrorists and criminals with his presidential powers? One of the guys (John Deutsch) was us intelligence who had moved classified information to his home computer without auhthorisation. Still think hillary doing it as well was an accident? Well the fbi do and yet they are well aware of both stories. -
