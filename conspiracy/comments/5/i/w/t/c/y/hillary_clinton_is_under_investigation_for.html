<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s evidence that the state sponsors of terrorism, namely the ISIS, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are major donors to the Clinton Foundation. Sec of State Clinton at the time, committed herself to waging a war against the terrorists and at the same time, she receives money from the state sponsors of terrorism--which, in effect, constitutes an act of treason.&quot; --<em>Professor Michel Chossudovsky of Global Research Canada.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind, these emails are real.  Clinton&#39;s emails are real because they&#39;ve been evaluated by congress, weiner&#39;s are real because they&#39;ve been evaluated by the FBI; and podesta&#39;s emails are real because they&#39;ve been dkim verified by google and double validated by those within the media who were CC recipients in email threads.</p>

<p>We have her dead to rights.  The only way out for her is to for her to steal the election in 2 days, and for america to accept that coup by a presidential candidate who is under investigation by 3 different agencies for treason.</p>

<p>Unless that changes, the FBI isn&#39;t doing shit, because it&#39;s likely he&#39;s implicated as well.   The entire system is corrupt.  Until people understand that, nothing changes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what to say about that, other than the fact that 3 months ago, I, and many others, weren&#39;t not aware of any of this.  I followed politics, but really didn&#39;t believe that the media corruption/manipulation went as far as it did.   What changed my perception, was first considering the idea that Clinton actually was guilty, and then seeing the extent of the cover up and how many people it involved/implicated.  That woke me up in a hurry.   </p>

<p>In other words, people are waking up. Keep planting seeds, keep informing.  If people understand this isn&#39;t a democrat vs republican issue, they&#39;re a lot more likely to be open to listening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the term &quot;liberal&quot; doesn&#39;t mean what we usually think it means. Since Clinton (NEOlib / NEOcon extreme authoritarian right winger like Obama, Bush, etc.) also identifies as a liberal.....it&#39;s probably more accurate to say &quot;left wing&quot; or &quot;democratic socialist&quot; or something. (Which Clinton CERTAINLY IS NOT) But liberal seems to be thrown around for anything lol. And that&#39;s how fools think &quot;the establishment is liberal!!!&quot; which is ridiculous. The establishment is fascist. It wants the people to be slaves. In the French revolution, those that were &quot;on the side of the kind&quot; were RIGHT WING. Those that were &quot;on the side of the people&quot; were LEFT WING. Political ignorance fuels the alt right which uses scapegoats like immigration, political correctness and other absurd things that make distractions so you don&#39;t suspect the real problem......the government.

<blockquote>
<p>The Twelfth Amendment requires each elector to cast one vote for president and another vote for vice president.[4][5] In each state and the District of Columbia, electors are chosen every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, and then meet to cast ballots on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.[6] The candidates who receive an absolute majority of electoral votes among the states are elected President and Vice President of the United States when the Electoral College vote is certified by Congress in January.</p>

<p>The whole thing is bullocks.

I&#39;m all for getting rid of the electoral college but it&#39;s double standards to give Clinton a free ride while they ignore the fact Bush won without the popular vote.....and on top of that, I consider Clinton the &quot;worse evil&quot; with her warmonger foreign policies even though I used to think it was Trump who was worse everywhere else....now I&#39;m not even bloody sure!! Trump&#39;s cabinet is looking increasingly shitty by the day. Establishment bastards filling his cabinet like a labor secretary that hates the minimum wage. Americans will be at the mercy of what their state allows as the minimum wage....or even NO minimum wage! :/ So uh....I think people in Bernie&#39;s home state of Vermont are probably one of the luckier ones with $9.60 an hour. :P
 Some people think Obama will become dictator, the world will end in 2012....la la la la....but who knows when the prophecies start to come true lol. But I am suspicious of the elite using biblical references or prophecies to lead religious people into a trap, e.g. the Christ/anti-Christ thing....there&#39;s a conspiracy theory that Putin will be a &quot;Christ like figure&quot; and then later reveal himself to actually be the &quot;anti-Christ&quot; but no idea if that&#39;s disinfo against Russia or if we are truly fucked with a &quot;east vs west illusion&quot;......shit.</p>

<p>The college is working exactly like it&#39;s supposed to. It brings balance to the process. It&#39;s basically instituted for the same reason that we don&#39;t just have a HoR based on population, but also the Senate with and equal amount of legislators for each state. </p>

<p>It protects the smaller states and allows them to have a say in the process. Actually pretty fucking brilliant when you think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But isn&#39;t the entire concept of &quot;a state&quot; pretty arbitrary?
I understand this argument and not sure what compromise is best as I&#39;m not a mathematician (although, state populations fluctuate anyway....) but certainly this current system is hugely flawed hence we get people like Bush without getting the popular vote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. It is actually the Republican-controlled Congress who makes the final decision on the election. The power of any College elector to go against the state popular vote and change the outcome of the election is zilch. In their first joint session, Congress, with a GOP majority in both chambers, approves or objects to the December 19th vote.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m all for getting rid of the electoral college</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The college is working exactly like it&#39;s supposed to. It brings balance to the process. It&#39;s basically instituted for the same reason that we don&#39;t just have a HoR based on population, but also the Senate with and equal amount of legislators for each state. </p>

<p>It protects the smaller states and allows them to have a say in the process. Actually pretty fucking brilliant when you think about it.</p>
