        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if this is the place to talk about this, but I really wanted to share this and get it out there. </p>

<p>A newspaper article was published in the Phoenix Gazette in 1909. The story was highly detailed and described how a man named G.E. Kinkaid was searching for minerals at the Grand Canyon when he found a cave opening and decided to explore it. Inside the cave, he found many artifacts. He gathered some and sent the to the Smithsonian for examination.</p>

<p>Not too long after, the Smithsonian decided to start an excavation. They sent around 40 men to go and explore the cave. What the found, though, was something that no one would have thought about. They apparently found and underground city full of hundreds of rooms, but it was what was in the rooms that is crazy. They found ancient Asian artifacts, including a statue of Buddha sitting cross legged and holding a lotus flower or lily in each hand. In other rooms they found ancient Egyptian artifacts, including urns, tablets and doorways all baring Egyptian hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>They also found advance tools made of copper, weapons made of metals, seeds, cooking utensils, cups, pots, urns, vases and many other things.</p>

<p>But, when the World Explorers Club called the Smithsonian within recent times, they were told that no such excavation had ever happened, even though there was a highly detailed report on the front page of a big time newspaper and detailed reports of G.E. Kinkaid&#39;s personal journal.</p>

<p>What do you think about this? Could it very well be possible that ancient Asian and Egyptian (and possibly Native American) people lived and worked together in an underground city in the Grand Canyon. Just remember that it might not be true. There&#39;s not much information and the Smithsonian said it never occurred.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link to a website that talks more about it: <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/gc_egyptconnection.html">http://www.crystalinks.com/gc_egyptconnection.html</a></p>

<p>Edit: Here&#39;s a link to a video that also talks about it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soGNyfilZKg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soGNyfilZKg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome post bud! its refreshing to read interesting theories here for a change, i just tried finding published articles on universities library website and unfortunately i couldn&#39;t find anything about this being real or fake..(searched G.E kinkaid, Kinkaid caves, Tunnel city, Egyptians in the grand canyon etc, etc,) </p>

<p>so than i followed a few bread crumbs on google, I&#39;m not telling you this isn&#39;t real, but it seems like a majority of what shows up is theorist supporting this, and here was a decent article that actually addresses some of the main points, so take it for what you will and good luck on your research </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the contribution! I read the post and like always, I&#39;m not going to say that there is or there isn&#39;t an underground city in the Grand Canyon. I&#39;m going to still keep an open mind. Who knows, maybe the very people who don&#39;t want it to be known made it out like the &quot;theorists&quot; were just crazy theorists. Or maybe it is all fake. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ll keep researching with an open mind!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a nice  comment.</p>

<p>The claims of people who clearly have no experience whatsoever in the fields of anthropology/archaeology never cease to amaze me. Hell even before this class I wouldn’t say such things after doing the barest modicum of research like glance at a Wikipedia article, because it’s just common sense not to talk about topics you have no idea about beyond a passing interest. I personally don’t get why people claim things such as Lost Egyptian Cities in the Americas, but I like to come up with some theories; for example, I believe some people just seem so desperate to be one of the great ‘discoverers’ of our time that they will say and believe anything that hints that their might be something ‘more’ that archaeological societies, who have spent much money on these topics and continue doing so, just so they can have a shot at fame. Some people are just unnaturally moronic as well.</p>

<p>I did appreciate the reference to one David Icke too. Personally he was one the more memorable crazies I knew of before this class and was surprised Professor Watrall did not mention him as the sheer outlandish nature of his conspiracies and his ongoing presence in the conspiracy communities is something worth bringing up I find. However since the nature of his comments are mostly political that might be the reason why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. It makes me want to gather up some people and go explore the canyon. Though, it would be nearly impossible to explore the area that supposedly had the underground city. That area is totally forbidden, even for some park rangers. Basically, any of the areas that have mountains (?) named after Egyptian or Asian lore is forbidden. Sounds fishy, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

(The link you provided does nothing to corroborate the idea that there are portions of the park rangers are barred from, or the idea that these portions might line up with landmarks with ties to Asia or Egypt(idiotic)) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I passed some information. I never said that it was true. I&#39;m keeping an open mind. It could be true or it could be completely fake. Yeah, I might have gotten carried away when I said it was also barred from park rangers. That, I truly do not know. I do know, however, that there are restricted areas. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry for seeming like I&#39;m just throwing information around. I didn&#39;t mean to do that. I am researching the subject, but there isn&#39;t much to go on. I just thought I&#39;d share the story.</p>

<p>That is total trash. If you&#39;re propagating information through a network, it is your responsibility to do(and the very least) some low-level fact checking and critical thought on it. Otherwise you&#39;re just blasting noise.</p>

<p>There are restricted areas in every national park, you would know this if you actually read the link you just shared with me. That isn&#39;t indicative of anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, you sound like a charming person. Secondly, you are fixated on literally one aspect of OP&#39;s comment that isn&#39;t that big of a deal (rangers not being able to go in a restricted area doesn&#39;t make or break the theory). Yes, people should do research before they post, but he is pretty clear about not knowing a whole lot about this topic, that&#39;s why he is asking others about it. </p>

<p>If we are talking about critical thinking, let&#39;s evaluate yours. OP asks about a theory he read about and can&#39;t find a lot of information on. He adds some extra information that might show there is something fishy going on. You start to correct him that he doesn&#39;t actually know whether the extra info was true. He admits this, claiming he is trying to keep an open mind about all the facts surrounding this theory. You double down, yelling at him for pushing false information. Can you really not differentiate between pushing an agenda based on unverified information and sharing theories with a conspiracy theory group and not being absolutely sure with some of the details? </p>

<p>As they say, &quot;never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&quot; (not calling him stupid though)</p>

<p>Some people treat conspiracy theories as a legitimate means of inquiry and means of redressing the many inequalities in our society and world. And some people treat them as campfire stories. It is the later attitude that is largely responsible for the former not being taken seriously.   </p>

<p>Regarding Egyptians. I find that not possible to be in the Grand Canyon. That is far off from any shoreline, or river system to take them there. It could be trade, but you would have to find evidence on the gulf to show that might have happened. I would tend to think that at the time. It was Phoenicians that came to the gulf and sailed up the Mississippi trading for valuable copper which was known to have ancient copper mines in the upper river system. Copper was considered just as valuable in the Bronze era as was Gold.</p>

<p>Phonetician coins show a map of the Mediterranean Sea, and the Atlantic with Eastern North America also included.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://phoenicia.org/america.html">http://phoenicia.org/america.html</a>)</p>

<p>There is also evidence of the Red Bird petroglyph of North African writing.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://s8int.com/phile/page43.html">http://s8int.com/phile/page43.html</a>)</p>

<p>Regarding Asian. That is shown already by ancient Jomon culture pottery shards found in in Western Chile, and also Polynesians who landed in both North and South America by archaeological evidence. Polynesians if you want to call them Asian. They are descendants of Jomon which came from Taiwan/Okinawa (Jomon). Long before Chinese immigrated to Taiwan. They were navigating the pacific in voyaging canoes long around 2000 BCE by evidence of Lapita culture and Austronesian root language. They were apparently known to come to the North American shores as local native American tribes changed the way they made their ocean canoes. Single one piece hulls to multi planking as Polynesians did. Plus the style and efficiency of fish hooks, and arts and crafts also apparent. I can see Native American tribes trading with inner native American tribes and making it out to Grand Canyon. Mankind, no matter what culture, likes to trade for something uniquely different than what others have in their culture. Just to Wow and Awe the others at story time.</p>

<p>He has so much research on his main page that to me is undeniable proof of a shared ancient global religion about the inner divinity of man. Makes sense when you see it all laid out as to why they genocides almost all indigenous cultures that spoke of this inner divinity and replaced it with brainless consumerism </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the summation of cocaine and tobacco being of two sources (they went there or people came to them) misses out on the notion that artifacts could have been contaminated at the time of discovery. modern ideas of forensic integrity just didn&#39;t exist back in 1909. plastic was decades from invention and people were prescribed cocaine. tobacco would have been everywhere. in fact, the presence of cocaine and not just coca leaves suggests contamination during excavation, transportation or testing of the mummies. I dunno. it would be cool but fantasy is no reason to ignore such possibilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well no I don&#39;t think so mostly because most of ancient asian history or even current history is so overly exaggerated and most of the time completely made up thanks to them having a policy of trying to make the emperor look as amazing as possible. That&#39;s how we get claims of a city sized wooden ship with an entire forest on board that was able to travel the world even though there are so many problems with that claim let alone that there are 0 amounts of proof that the ship was ever built or could ever be built. It&#39;s best to just take any asian/chinese claims with a grain of salt because they just are not very trustworthy in giving the truth.</p>

<p>Yes this has been known for a very long time.  The information you have come across is nothing new.  It fits a very specific narrative.  And if you believe this then it starts to for example break down other narratives. </p>

<p>Most haven&#39;t.  When I was in university at University of Chicago my professor in history showed us many historical pictures of very dark skinned (black) native american tribes all up and down the east cost and upper midwest. </p>

<p>Blew the minds of most in class including myself seeing they literally taught the opposite in all my school years. </p>

<p>Well let me explain further, he showed pictures along with historical records of that time concerning, battles, captured natives etc., from the EUROPEANS perspective not the natives.</p>

<p>So it wasn&#39;t just pictures.  Many he showed were the Yamasee and the Iroquois tribes. We even took a trip to a Blackfoot reservation well the Chief Elder verified this and much more which is just too much to type.

<p>LOL, are you serious?  Not to sound antagonistic but it just seems so naive that like: WOWzers blacks were in the America&#39;s before Europeans brought them over?! Wowzers.  Even I wasn&#39;t that skeptical and I&#39;m a white guy.  </p>

<p>If you genuinely have interest in the subject, you should just look at a bit of world history.  Look at the western and the NON-western history to get a more well rounded view.  </p>

<p>There was world trade going on well before any Europeans Settlers so called discovered America.  Obviously not at the scale of today, but it did happen.  Also, look at the African Nations who were the worlds best in naval warfare and taught the many other nations how to navigate the oceans not only to America, but what is now called South America and Cuba.</p>

<p>The information is out there if you truly want the factual truths.  If I were at home I would actually give you a few books to lookup.</p>

Yeah, if Asian&#39;s and Egyptians were in America before the Europeans, then of course African&#39;s could have been too. </p>

<p>I was just asking if they were truly native to the region or if they came from Africa way before Europeans brought them over. Because based on most general knowledge of geography, the black skin does not come from North or South America. Brown and dark brown, yeah. I just wasn&#39;t sure if people were saying that some blacks were NATIVE to the Americas.  It&#39;s totally plausible for them to have come to America from Africa, and that&#39;s not so crazy. I&#39;m not naive and I&#39;m not totally shocked by it. If they came out and said that black people CAME, I mean originally, came from America then I&#39;d be a little shocked because that would rewrite the whole history of were certain skin colors came from.</p>

<p>Well, let me blow you mind with this one.  At one time the WHOLE WORLD was Black skinned!  Rather you lean toward the eventually separation of Pangea, or the locked in Icelandic conditions, or even ancient aliens human DNA with monkeys and begot the lighter races, still the fact is if you trace everyone back as far as it goes, most people would either go back to a black woman/man or a Nethandral/monkey. </p>

<p>The one thing done to humanity, that is not only a travesty but in fact it is a crime against humanity, is the deceiving of man by hiding the reality of his nature and where he comes from.  Denying him knowledge of just the facts of history without the propaganda. </p>

<p>So man is destined to be in an endless loop of Fighting, Feeding, Fleeing and Fornicating.  </p>

<p>Where are these Buddha statues and urns today? Where is the underground city? Old timers made up all kinds of stories about the West. </p>

<p>Further, what is the motivation for the Smithsonian for hiding the evidence? If they had shit like this, they would hold the world&#39;s biggest exhibition, press conference, and T-shirt sale. The underground city would be grabbed by the Feds and they would charge $100 a head to see it. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe the media. Take it from what you would call a full-blood Indian (myself): The word Native American is offensive to MANY of us. Analogy - China imposes empire on Tibet and calls all Tibetans &quot;Native Chinese&quot; and ask yourself - would Tibetans find the word &quot;Native Chinese&quot; offensive? Russia takes over Ukraine and calls all Ukrainians &quot;Native Russians&quot; - would that be offensive? Use the word Indian if you must lump all tribes together.</p>

<p>Sure there are &quot;tribes&quot; like the federally recognized Cherokee Nation which prefer &quot;Native American&quot; but know that such &quot;tribes&quot; have looked like this for hundreds of years - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QoQ1h2EQBk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QoQ1h2EQBk</a> and they were never Indian to begin with.

<p>Which of course, later, may have gone on to be Asians and Egyptians too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds creepy. Have you seen Bone Tomahawk? It&#39;s a Western about cannibals who kidnap a man&#39;s wife and they have to save her. It was kind of disturbing on some parts, but if you&#39;re interested you should give it a watch.</p>

<p>I might check out the documentary if I have some time :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really the Mandela Effect. The Mandela Effect is when people remember something very clearly, like Hannibal saying &quot;hello, Clarice&quot; on Silence of the Lambs, but then they find out that Hannibal never said that line. The Mandela Effect usually means that some mass of people remember something happening that actually never happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, alright! I didn&#39;t realize, sorry XD</p>

<p>And yeah, my brother was mind-blown by &quot;Hello, Clarice&quot; too. I&#39;ve never seen Silence of the Lambs, so it didn&#39;t really bother me. But my brother was like &quot;WHAT? NO. HE SAID IT BECAUSE I REMEMBER EVERYONE QUOTING IT!&quot;</p>

<p>Where do you think the &quot;Native Americans&quot; originally came from? </p>

<p>&quot;Native American&quot; is the Anglo name for the indigenous peoples. In Five Tribes culture, that term is considered an insult.</p>
