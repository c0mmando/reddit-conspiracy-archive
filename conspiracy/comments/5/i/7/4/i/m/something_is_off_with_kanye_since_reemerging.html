        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s forget about his speech, forced mental health evaluation, and blond hair. Let&#39;s forget the blond hair which seemed significant enough for the NYT to report on with examples of other celebs having breakdowns then dyeing their hair blond(e).</p>

<p>Most have seen that first photo of him after he reemerged after being committed forcefully, with his new blond hair, at a museum. Take a close look at the earlobes in this picture. Now go to Google and type in kanye west ears in Image Search. Look at the earlobes from older pictures on the top row. The earlobes are clearly not attached, as they clearly are now since Kanye has come back in public. Why, how, I don&#39;t know. Just thought I would mention it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the image from the museum with earlobes clearly attached:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/kanye-west-debuts-blonde-hair.jpg">http://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/kanye-west-debuts-blonde-hair.jpg</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example image, among countless others, where the earlobes are clearly not attached:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eonline.com/resize/600/315/eol_images/Entire_Site/2013511/rs_300x300-130611044954-300.listeningparty.kanyewest.jc.jpg">http://www.eonline.com/resize/600/315/eol_images/Entire_Site/2013511/rs_300x300-130611044954-300.listeningparty.kanyewest.jc.jpg</a></p>

<p>Also here are two more examples that pre-date the mental health evaluation.</p>

<p>Earlobes attached: <a href="http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/news/63470/f585b8bf.jpg">http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/news/63470/f585b8bf.jpg</a></p>

<p>Earlobes not attached: <a href="http://runthetrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/chi-kanye-west-honorary-doctorate-art-institute-20150317.jpeg">http://runthetrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/chi-kanye-west-honorary-doctorate-art-institute-20150317.jpeg</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s another pair of images since the commitment where the ears are very obviously not the same as in other older pictures, not even only that the earlobes are attached but the overall shape: <a href="http://i2.wp.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/kanye-west-hospitalized-blonde-hair-nyc-ok-hero.jpg">http://i2.wp.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/kanye-west-hospitalized-blonde-hair-nyc-ok-hero.jpg</a></p>

<p>Make of this what you will, I make no speculation. Just thought I would mention it.</p>

<p>[Edit: As of today, December 14 2016, if you typed Kanye West into Google and let it do the drop-down autofill, the first thing to pop up was &quot;Kanye West cloning.&quot; When I went to take a screenshot of this for proof and posterity, this had now changed to &quot;Kanye West tour.&quot; I swear I&#39;m not making this up. Just to remind everyone, I wasn&#39;t suggesting anything about replacements, cloning, lookalikes, doubles, etc. Just an observation.</p>

<p>People complained the image is too small, here&#39;s the largest resolution version I can find <a href="http://www.upscalehype.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kanye-West-Adidas-sneakers.jpg">http://www.upscalehype.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Kanye-West-Adidas-sneakers.jpg</a> . Also interesting to note as that as of right now, any combination of Google Image Search with kanye west blond (or blonde), kanye west museum, kanye west blond museum, is not returning results for this much discussed image. I actually had a really tough time trying to find the image with Google Images to find a higher resolution.]]</p>

<p>Have you seen the magazines covers that came out after this about a week ago?  </p>

<p>She&#39;s now pandering around saying she was in the house with a mad man (validated by expose` and being committed) and sadly for Kayne.  </p>

<p>SHE IS ABOUT TO TAKE EVERY DIME FROM HIM!</p>

<p>This is a classic chess move.  Step outta line, paint you as a monster, the one THEY setup you up who you were MADE TO HAVE A CHILD WITH, takes everything because she was abused AND because of child.</p>

<p>Classic checkmate.  Sadly.</p>

The video of him walking into Trump Tower, the way he walks and more importantly, the way he is slightly smiling until he realizes a video camera is on him, at which point he stops smiling and looks away from the camera. This is a classic Kanye move. He does this when he is shown in the crowd at a sporting event, awards ceremony, etc. He smiles a lot but when he knows a camera is on him he stops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not kanye. I&#39;ve followed him his whole career. You can recognize someone from the energy around them. If someone replaced your parent with a clone you&#39;d be able to tell because of the <em>feeling</em>, rather than the 5 senses. The thing about human cloning is it doesn&#39;t have to happen in the way that is scientifically known to the public. I believe in rapid cloning. Look at this kanye, his proportions are off. Its subtle. Its not just that he looks medicated or out of it. Its literally a different form altogether. What I wonder is- can the clone survive the test of time without the original. Is kanye dead or are they keeping him somewhere?</p>

<p>All in all: the reason they keep cloning a secret is so they can use it to do stuff like this without being called out. Honestly this makes me very mad. I love Kanye regardless of how &quot;crazy&quot; he was. And I truly beleive that by the grace of God the truth will come to light. Many fans know kanye&#39;s vibe down to a tee, over time they will be able to tell that this is not him. I feel like cloneing someone and killing them is worse than just killing them, because people live with the lie &quot;clone&quot; and think its actually them. Wouldn&#39;t surprise me if the old donald even knew. They are just using his image for political gain now.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>hes just looking around like hes lost or something, zoning out, didn&#39;t reply till third question. They did something to him in the hospital for sure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TL;DR - Just read the first two paragraphs (rest is mostly just me going into more detail on my experiences with these drugs, and rambling a little on the off chance some one finds it interesting) and the warning in footnote 2: &quot;Don&#39;t do change dose dosages without first consulting your doctor.&quot;</p>

<p>If he was sleep-deprived before hospitalisation (due to mania, or perhaps causing a manic episode), I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he&#39;s on benzodiazepines or one of the Z-drugs to induce sleep. If he&#39;s on a high-ish dose of either, it could easy explain him zoning out and not being entirely with it.</p>

<p>FWIW I&#39;m currently taking both, so am somewhat familiar with the side-effects. It varies from person to person, but the first time I used Zopiclone, even at the lowest dose, I lost multiple hours of memories and had mild hallucinations. I&#39;m now on a higher dose[1], and those initial side effects have mostly gone[2], but I definitely feel groggy and not all there the next day.</p>

<p>[1] Normally given the initial bad reaction, I&#39;d avoid Zopiclone entirely, but my sleep issues (related to headaches, generalised anxiety disorder and OCD) went from &quot;at least some sleep every night, even if it&#39;s only 1-2 hours [20mg tamazepam as required]&quot; to &quot;I slept 6am-9am on Friday, it&#39;s now Tuesday and I&#39;ve slept less than an hour since 9am Friday&quot;. After another sleepless night despite 30mg diazepam and 40mg tamazepan, I finally resorted the Zopiclone - at that point, the side effects from the Zopiclone will start to happen regardless if I don&#39;t get any sleep, so took it and managed a whole two hours sleep..... I doubled[2] the dose the following night, which had surprisingly LESS side-effect and got me seven hours sleep. Day after, I slept without the Zopiclone fine, so seem to be improving. Still on the Zopilcone most nights, which I&#39;m not a fan of, but lack of sleep makes my other symptoms (headaches, anxiety levels, OCD) so much worst (until I reach about 50-60 hours awake and the anxiety/OCD drop dramatically, which is nice and probably contributes to my insomnia, but by that point the headache feels someone is trying to remove my forehead from the rest of my skull, and his only tool is an icepick) </p>

<p>[2] Don&#39;t do this without first consulting your doctor. I have a science (non-medical) background, and have taken some pharmacology courses online, so could consult the literature and read enough RCTs to determine that the dose increase I was proposing was not at all risky (My GP also knows that I tweak doses and dose timing, usually for a lower dose, so also likely wouldn&#39;t mind). It not something I suggest other people should do (for hopefully obvious reasons), but I just seem to enjoy reading about drugs, how they interact, their pharmacokinetics, how they behave in overdose, at typical clinic doses, so usually spend an hour or so reading before taking a new drug anyway.</p>

<p>It actually come in depressingly useful a few months back - I was woken up to be told a &quot;friend/family member/family friend&quot;[3] had overdosed on paracetamol/acetaminophen and was on his/her way to A and E. I asked how much they had taken - approximately just less than one pack - so that almost certainly 16x500mg, so the dose was 8g(based on a full pack, possibly less). Given I could calculate paracetamol mg per kilo of approx. body weight, realise it&#39;s the potentially hepatotoxic range, but (s)he is already presenting at A and E less than four hours after the dose. They&#39;ll do a serum paracetamol level test, and it&#39;s a dose/timescale that <em>might</em> require N-acetylcysteine treatment, but should be absolutely fine. I took a few seconds to run through that, then said to my grandmother (who woke me up) &quot;(S)he&#39;ll be fine. Let me know if you hear any bad news, but I&#39;m nigh-on certain (s)he&#39;ll be fine later today. I&#39;m going back to bed&quot;. Having that background knowledge avoided raised my anxiety, and I think my grandmother calmed a little after I seemed so sure (s)he would be. (They were, thankfully. Not sure if the NAC was needed or not) </p>

<p>[3] Being vague as I doubt they&#39;d appreciate me identifying them.  </p>

<p>Yea, that is just fucking false. And what you added is literally repeating what I said: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Its also funny how you go out of your way to say seratogenic, which 5HTP obviously is, then refer broadly to psych drugs. Originally suggesting benzos is also idiotic, the subject would not retain the necessary information nor keep their composure (they say what they think), which is why SSRIs are generally the first line of offense in psychiatry. </p>

<p>By saying seratogenic I was agreeing that in combination medications can have much stronger effects. 
SSRI is not the first line of defense in psych for many, many disorders. For depression, certain types of anxiety, sure. they would try an SSRI. but a person like kanye who is potentially delusional at intake and definitely in a manic state? Hell no. An SSRI makes those types of symptoms much worse. Youd give them a benzo to calm down, something in the atypical anti-psychotic family to fight off the mania, and go from there. Not an ssri.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His forehead and nose look a little longer in both old photos, even though I scaled them to match head size pretty well. Could just be the perspective and lighting; in the Trump photo he&#39;s tilting his head up a few degrees more, which would shorten the nose and forehead.</p>

<p>The photo from 2013 shows his forehead line arch on his left side better than the September 2016 photo, which looks a little airbrushed. Not surprising, as Kim was originally in the frame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did not realized you scaled them. I was looking at features like his exact ear structure(inside and out), the forehead wrinkles, lips, nose/nostrils, scar. At first just the photos in this thread but honestly all in all he looks the same to me when i see them side by side.</p>

<p>Then i googled trump and kanye, found <a href="http://www.bet.com/music/2016/12/13/kanye-speaks-donald-trump/_jcr_content/image.heroimage.dimg/__1481664254202/121316-music-so-here-s-what-kanye-west-and-donald-trump-had-to-discuss-at-tr-1.jpg">this photo</a></p>

<p>then googled &quot;kanye west teeth&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/20/article-1322074-0BAF9C4D000005DC-160_468x286.jpg">found this</a></p>

<p>to me.. theyre the same. all the things at the time contributing to his strange appearance, water weight, weight gain/ loss, cameras contrasts/lightings/resolutions, colors of hair/clothes/ surrounding colors etc. Honestly wanted to believe they werent  the same person at first though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is going to sound extremely sarcastic but if you&#39;re an expert on cloning technology and processes, is it not possible that minor DNA alterations occurred in the cultivation/development phase leading to some of the inconsistencies mentioned in this thread? Imagine taking two generically identical plant seeds and growing one in dirt (or a womb) vs growing the other hydroponically (or a test tube)—is it really <em>that</em> far fetched that one plant might have might tiny differences compared to the other? This is a very oversimplified example for the sake of discussion, but anyone who knows anything about genetics will tell you that DNA often carries multiple susceptibilities to varying risk factors from several <em>environments</em> (i.e. having your genetics predispose you to alcoholism for example doesn&#39;t mean as much if you&#39;re never in an environment where you&#39;re exposed to alcohol). </p>

<p>All that to say, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as cut and dry as &quot;Not 1000% phenotypically identical? Not clones!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget that there is a lot of light reflecting from the floor in the Trump Tower, which I think would cause someone to look different compared to the usual outdoor or overhead lighting. The first image from OP is hard to make out attached earlobes because of its poor image quality. He does look different though in the picture where he is walking inside of TT. But the one with Trump he still looks the same despite his blonde hair. Keep in mind - that there may be a real phenomena where white people think black people look the same, even if you aren&#39;t racist lol and it may go into the fact that you haven&#39;t picked up on how a black person looks through out their career but now when looking closely you see their facial complexities in pictures especially from angle, lighting, age, etc. I have a decent amount of good black friends so I notice the differences of facial construction where some people who have infrequent contact may not, until they look closely.  Don&#39;t take this offensively please it&#39;s just an idea to think about! Just my thoughts. I do kinda worry about Kanye though especially after all he&#39;s going through. He actually spoke up on live TV during Katrina but the aid was stopped because it could only come in if the governor accepted Martial Law from Bush. He held out for 3 days but eventually had to take the Martial Law deal for aid. So yeah Bush just didn&#39;t give a fuck about anyone esp. Poor people probably who were black and brown.</p>

<p>He does look a bit off but one of my best friends recently had a full psychotic break and was diagnosed as schizophrenic and his facial features did change dramatically. His jaw line and cheaks were puffier and his eyes look emptier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a quick note... as of today, if you type Kanye West into google and let it do the drop-down autofill, the first suggestion is Kanye West cloning. No shit. (EDIT: After this post I went back to Google to take a screenshot of this as proof and it has now changed to &quot;Kanye West tour.&quot; I&#39;m not making this up, I have no reason to lie and nothing to gain.)</p>

<p>Also to the few who say the image is too small to conclusively tell, I somewhat agree. I didn&#39;t post the best highest resolution image. You can find the museum pic on Google Images and click it, then select similar images and choose a higher resolution. There are also other example pictures than just this. I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s been replaced, cloned, or anything like that. Just an observation.</p>

<p>Also here are two more examples that pre-date the mental health evaluation.</p>

<p>Earlobes attached: <a href="http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/news/63470/f585b8bf.jpg">http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/news/63470/f585b8bf.jpg</a></p>

<p>Earlobes not attached: <a href="http://runthetrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/chi-kanye-west-honorary-doctorate-art-institute-20150317.jpeg">http://runthetrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/chi-kanye-west-honorary-doctorate-art-institute-20150317.jpeg</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s another pair of images since the commitment where the ears are very obviously not the same as in other older pictures, not even only that the earlobes are attached but the overall shape: <a href="http://i2.wp.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/kanye-west-hospitalized-blonde-hair-nyc-ok-hero.jpg">http://i2.wp.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/kanye-west-hospitalized-blonde-hair-nyc-ok-hero.jpg</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not cherry picking here, I just grabbed these two as good examples. Go compare any number of other photographs. I make no speculation as to why this is, only an observation.</p>
