    <div class="md"><p>The overwhelming opinion being spun on reddit at this point in time is that any pro-Clinton voices are &quot;Correct the Record&quot; paid shills - essentially a &#39;claque&#39; - professional applauders.</p>

<p>I would say that there is probably an equal force on the side of Donald Trump. The man is a billionaire, refuses to release any information of his finances, and has no particular problem in pretending his disasters are anything but.</p>

<p>I would aruge further that if you were to look into the works of Marshall McLuhan and also the documentary Manufacturing Consent you&#39;d see some pretty obvious patterns in the way the social media has been used to the advantage of both candidates - the problem being for the dems that going low works a hell of a lot better than going high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you honestly believe that only one side of the coin of American politics actively tries to influence the populace? </p>

<p>We should be questioning EVERYTHING; not just the side we don&#39;t agree with. There are groups, agencies, bots, shills (whatever you want to call them) working through every mode of media to create bias and influence on both sides. </p>

<p>Looking back at Facebook and Twitter during the election, so many Americans were politically manipulated by memes and 140-character quotes. Social media played a huge role in this election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does the current situation not remind you of the beginning of the cold war? There is an obvious pattern of manipulation here - from the very basic &quot;cuck! shill!&quot; ad hominem to the &quot;bernie bros&quot; poisoning the well to the alarming &quot;false news&quot; - yes there is false news, and it comes from social media.</p>

<p>There is a very dangerous war being fought for minds RIGHT NOW and there is nothing worse you can do than buy right into it. I remember when I was in highschool we had an assignment to read three different newspapers about a major story and to write a report than was of our own conclusion. Bias is a weapon, and everyone has a bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit post. You should know damn well why <em>this sub</em> would be skeptical of the CIA and a clear agenda in the establishment media to push the &quot;Russian hacking&quot; narrative.</p>

<p>To save myself the trouble of writing out all the reasons to be skeptical of that narrative, allow me to quote myself:</p>

<p>All of these claims of Russian hacking run counter to conflicting claims that are at least as reliable. Who has a better reputation for honesty, Assange or an unnamed CIA source? Who is in a position to know with more certainty the source of the leaks, Assange or an unnamed CIA source? And Assange has all but bluntly stated that the DNC leak was from Seth Rich. He has also stated, in the interview with John Pilger, that the Podesta emails came from a &quot;Washington insider&quot;.</p>
