       So Russia has a master plan to get Trump elected, but that plan didn't include unleashing bots in the mainstream, but in a niche group?

       Please pay attention to Pizzagate there's nothing at all going on with the government, conspiracy minded people NEVER question the government, CTR, CTR! Meanwhile there's an assload of billionaires unqualified to set foot in the doors of the offices they have been appointed to.

       I simply don't understand why people can't accept that if they take CTR at face value there might also be a diametrically opposed side working for the other candidate.

       The overwhelming opinion being spun on reddit at this point in time is that any pro-Clinton voices are "Correct the Record" paid shills - essentially a 'claque' - professional applauders.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say that there is probably an equal force on the side of Donald Trump. The man is a billionaire, refuses to release any information of his finances, and has no particular problem in pretending his disasters are anything but.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would aruge further that if you were to look into the works of Marshall McLuhan and also the documentary Manufacturing Consent you'd see some pretty obvious patterns in the way the social media has been used to the advantage of both candidates - the problem being for the dems that going low works a hell of a lot better than going high.

       Do you honestly believe that only one side of the coin of American politics actively tries to influence the populace?
      </p>
      <p>
       We should be questioning EVERYTHING; not just the side we don't agree with. There are groups, agencies, bots, shills (whatever you want to call them) working through every mode of media to create bias and influence on both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking back at Facebook and Twitter during the election, so many Americans were politically manipulated by memes and 140-character quotes. Social media played a huge role in this election.

       Does the current situation not remind you of the beginning of the cold war? There is an obvious pattern of manipulation here - from the very basic "cuck! shill!" ad hominem to the "bernie bros" poisoning the well to the alarming "false news" - yes there is false news, and it comes from social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a very dangerous war being fought for minds RIGHT NOW and there is nothing worse you can do than buy right into it. I remember when I was in highschool we had an assignment to read three different newspapers about a major story and to write a report than was of our own conclusion. Bias is a weapon, and everyone has a bias.

       I was under the impression that taxation without representation was a sacred thing for Americans, is it not beyond the realm of possibility for an investigation into a very messy election to go forward without someone's hair being a bird?

       You mean while Obama stays in office past his term?  Or when the electoral college votes are thrown away because of the dead line allowing the crooked politicians to pick our president? Who do you think the republican held house will pick to be president over us peasants?

       OK well none of this has happened and the electoral college is not looking like it will overturn anything at this point but if they were to be faithless electors I would guess the house would choose 1) Trump 2) Romney 3) Kasich in order of likelihood.

       If you choose to believe Obama will go all Captain Planet villain and declare Martian Law I don't know what to tell you other than it's pretty much a wait and see venture at this point.

       If CNN wants you to believe it on the basis of some vague news published by WaPo citing unnamed sources which a number of reputed former officers who were happy to even reveal their names have disregarded as rubbish, the whole thing is guaranteed to be fake. Probably a pathetic last ditch effort to get the Electors to not vote for Trump.

       Shit post. You should know damn well why
       <em>
        this sub

       would be skeptical of the CIA and a clear agenda in the establishment media to push the "Russian hacking" narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       To save myself the trouble of writing out all the reasons to be skeptical of that narrative, allow me to quote myself:
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these claims of Russian hacking run counter to conflicting claims that are at least as reliable. Who has a better reputation for honesty, Assange or an unnamed CIA source? Who is in a position to know with more certainty the source of the leaks, Assange or an unnamed CIA source? And Assange has all but bluntly stated that the DNC leak was from Seth Rich. He has also stated, in the interview with John Pilger, that the Podesta emails came from a "Washington insider".
      </p>

        https://youtu.be/_sbT3_9dJY4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from that there is the statement of Craig Murray, an associate of Assange and a generally credible source, who says as much, claiming that he has even met the leaker and that it was, again, a "Washington insider":

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, the American intelligence community is not even in agreement about the claims of this anonymous CIA source, with both the FBI and ODNI stating that they're unwilling to support the claims. In addition, many US intelligence insiders, who actually were willing to reveal their names, disagree with the CIA claims:

       I simply don't understand why people can't accept that if they take CTR at face value there might also be a diametrically opposed side working for the other candidate.
