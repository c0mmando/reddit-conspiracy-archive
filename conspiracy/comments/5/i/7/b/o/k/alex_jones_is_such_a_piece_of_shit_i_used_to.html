       He is quite literally a DBA (discredit by association) psy-op. In my experience I can't even broach any legitimate conspiracy theories around normies without their hurling accusations of "Go back to InfoWars you retard." This is his entire purpose.

       what's with all the hate on him lately, did something happen? I think you just have to take him for what he is. He's always been out there and trying to have is own business run off this sort of stuff so he's always had to play it up. but i haven't seen any evidence of him being a piece of shit or being a shill. I think it's much more plausible that's how people/media want the image of him to be associated with crazy. David brock's media matters wrote an article on saying he's nuts, and that dude is deep in the clinton's pedobutt
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr - people got bills to pay , don't mean you're automatically a shill. I think he believes in what he says, and for the most part, he's been right years later. Despite everyone laughing at him

       I think the show is great, accurate news and highly entertaining Alex opinions. I always avoided infowars right up until around last Halloween once I caught wind he was being proven right alot lately and wasn't 100% nutty like I was led to believe. And I stick around because it's conspiracy theories and political news with some decent production values and guests for a change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not anxiously waiting for the next show, but I can't fault him for trying to make a living off of it. He does full shows up to 6-7 times a week, that fact along with the passion shows me he cares about what's going on out there.
 Also don't mind commercials, I can skip 'em. And they're from companies brave enough to advertise with him. And better than hiding half the show behind a pay wall for "premium subscribers" like Mysterious Universe and Coast to Coast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides if you're someone who's is totally against infowars, tell me what other media out there is opening eyes as much as Jones on important facts with a viewership as large? Unless you start one yourself you run out of options fast. People who work 8-10 hours a day away from desk listen to Alex Jones, and I'm glad they have that option.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes he can't talk about pizza currently until some irrefutable incriminating evidence shows up. Neither can I. People depend on us. Not everyone can take such a serious risk without hurting innocent people in their own worlds.

       It's not so crazy, here in my town they have found high lead in our water systems especially our school  water systems.  I had already told my child not to drink water from the school because of daily nosebleeds, after switching to filtered water only, they suddenly stopped and was able to focus at school and get off ADHD meds.  It's like it was the water was causing all the negative effects the whole time.

       We now have a reverse osmosis water filtration system, not bought by Alex Jones or anything but I've realized how important clean water is.  And if you have to support yourself somehow then selling water filtration systems isn't so bad.

       Dude. Seriously? Water filtration why not? You really think fluoride is good for you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it wasn't harmful, why the hell would anyone choose to drink it if they could afford to filter it out?
