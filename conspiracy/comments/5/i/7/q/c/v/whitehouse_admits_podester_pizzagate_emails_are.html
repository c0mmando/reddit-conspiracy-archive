       Yeah, this really is an admission that the emails are indeed authentic.

       But why do people making these videos have to make them so goofy. Like we could have had it replayed just twice, and it would get the point across. By the time I heard it four times, I was pissed off I didn't hear anything else.......

       We don't need their confirmation.  Either googles system of email and domainkeys public key system is secure, or everyone who has ever used google apps for business has an extremely good reason to class-action lawsuit them for trillions of dollars for having paid them for a service that turned out to be illusury and insecure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it would mean everyones email through gmail would could not be used in court as evidenciary; retroactively demanding that anyone sued or jailed because of gmail's email system could then reopen the case since this fault of google would suggest faulty prosecutorial evidence was used to get a verdict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, all the other email systems that use domainkeys would similiarly be compromised and tTHEY could sue google for having a compromised, insecure system on the backend.  In other words, it becomes a case of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT on behalf of google.   If you pay a service for privacy, but they are snooping in your drawer looking at everything you have, then if any of these services had any kind of IP theft, or copyright infringement they should be right to blame google.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore I can conclude that none of that is true.  That the google's DKIM PKI system is secure, as it's become the consensus of many tech experts (of which I am one).
      </p>
      <p>
       If somoene wants to doubt that, then they doubt EVERY email, every document, every search results that google has ever given them as potentially invalid and that seems so risky a proposition that a smart company like Google would not risk their entire business just to win one stupid election.
      </p>
      <p>
       finally, several people in the media have come forth stating that the podesta emails are valid, because they've been cc'ed and just look in their box and compare with what wikileaks released/
