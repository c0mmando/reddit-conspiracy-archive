    <div class="md"><p>could be a coincidental name. hard to say. since Rothschild&#39;s banking family is very secretive, it&#39;s hard enough to prove they themselves are in the family let alone someone who doesn&#39;t work in banking. </p>

<p>He&#39;s one of these</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild#People_outside_the_banker_family">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild#People_outside_the_banker_family</a></p>

<p>I like up the first one though an Abraham Rothschild who was a murderer. He&#39;s the son of a Meyer Rothschild who worked as a jeweler . . . come on you want me to believe that&#39;s not from the famous family!!! Well I don&#39;t have a &quot;reliable source&quot; just common sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>look at this subtle symbolism in an article from when he first announced he was running for mayor:</p>

<p>Jonathan Rothschild’s earliest political memory is of JFK’s assassination in 1963. Following President Richard Nixon’s resignation in 1974, Rothschild, then a student at Kenyon College in Ohio, became an intern for the National Student Lobby</p>

<p>in Washington, D.C. But Rothschild, now 55, didn’t jump into the political fray himself until 2005, when he became the Pima County Democratic Party treasurer.</p>

<p>After his political experience in college, “I fell away from being involved,” says Rothschild, who discovered then that “it’s difficult to get something done on public policy. You don’t always get what you want, and at that age I didn’t appreciate that.”</p>

<p>Last month, the Tucson native announced that he would run for mayor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First I want to take you to this email </p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/9Qnz2">http://archive.is/9Qnz2</a></p>

<p>I believe *<em>Gray Steven Fuller *</em> is some genetically engineered human </p>

<p>I think Gray Steven Fuller is the creation of this man, <a href="http://archive.is/DrBuH">Steven Fuller</a> (read the article, it&#39;s strange.) </p>

<p>The article says things like &quot; We were noisily arguing about something—let&#39;s say Fuller&#39;s call for a fusion of Kantian ethics and utilitarianism&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In his public talk, Fuller defended transhumanism, the idea that humans should embrace genetic engineering and other technologies that can help us transcend our biological limits.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>At various moments, he sounds like a socialist, Jesuit (and in fact he was raised Catholic</p>

<p>His Book, The Intellectual was selected as a Book of the Year in 2005 by the UK liberal-left magazine, New Statesman. He periodically contributes a column to the Project Syndicate, associated with <strong>George Soros&#39; Open Society project</strong> </p>

<p>For Fuller, transhumanism offers humanity the prospect &quot;to <strong>re-engineer the human body</strong> to enable us to <strong>live longer</strong> so as to work and play harder.</p>

<p>Maybe his goal was to Combine the genetics of these two men (hence the name Gray + Steven&#39;s Fuller. Look at the blog below. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sounds nuts I know</p>

<p>Remember the article does say he said <strong>&quot;but my version of paradise calls for radical social and cultural changes, and especially the end of militarism&quot;</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>It gets weirder trust me. Moving on from Steve Fuller.</p>

<p>So the guy Gray Steven Fuller sends that rant to a guy David Frederick McCullar (still need to investigate who he is) </p>

<p>Anyway, David Frederick McCullar sends a weird email to <a href="mailto:katrinapeterson33@yahoo.com">katrinapeterson33@yahoo.com</a> </p>

<p>Who is Katrina Peterson?</p>

<p>Maybe? <a href="http://doctor.webmd.com/doctor/katrina-peterson-a1bcc3e5-86c0-49a6-95f3-5fac773bef68-overview">http://doctor.webmd.com/doctor/katrina-peterson-a1bcc3e5-86c0-49a6-95f3-5fac773bef68-overview</a></p>

<p>Titled - &quot;Barbara please don&#39;t ignore me lady.&quot;</p>

<p>He says he&#39;s from old money and He&#39;s clearly connected to the Bush family but how? Also mentions Barbara being raped ?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Then I look into his possible family name and come to this person </p>

<p>George A Fuller</p>

<p><strong>known for inventing the modern skyscraper!</strong> weirddddddd!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_A._Fuller">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_A._Fuller</a></p>

<p>&quot;Fuller, who was a proponent of using <strong>steel</strong> in building construction, utilized it for the floor beams, a decision which subjected him to criticism from the architectural community, which was wary of using steel and unsure of its long-term properties&quot; extra weirrrd !!!</p>

<p>There&#39;s more ....</p>

<p>I think he is the son of this man;</p>

<p>George Fuller </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Fuller_(congressman)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Fuller_(congressman)</a></p>

<p>He died from Myelodysplastic Syndrome -</p>

<hr/>

<p>Remember how the rant talks about losing his mom?</p>

<p>Well I take you to <strong>Hilda (Fuller) Bush</strong></p>

<p>Hilda Bush (Fuller) 71, </p>

<p>&quot;after a long struggle of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)</p>

<p><a href="http://m.legacy.com/obituaries/tucson/obituary.aspx?n=&amp;amp;pid=100236247&amp;amp;referrer=0&amp;amp;preview=True">http://m.legacy.com/obituaries/tucson/obituary.aspx?n=&amp;amp;pid=100236247&amp;amp;referrer=0&amp;amp;preview=True</a></p>

<p>*<em>Died in Tuscan AZ hospital *</em></p>

<p>So then I started looking into </p>

<p>FA occurs in about 1 per 130,000 births, with a slightly higher frequency in Ashkenazi Jews</p>

<hr/>

<p>Who are Ashkenazi Jews?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews</a></p>

<p>&quot;moving out of the Holy Roman Empire&quot;</p>

<p>They are considered the Modern </p>
