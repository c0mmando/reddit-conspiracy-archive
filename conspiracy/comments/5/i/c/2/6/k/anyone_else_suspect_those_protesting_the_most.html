       Bush did not endorse Clinton.
       <em>
        One
       </em>
       person claimed he told her he would vote for Clinton (Kathleen Townsend). The claim was never verified, she never followed up on it, and Bush himself never made any public endorsement.
      </p>
      <p>
       A spokesperson for him said, “The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.”
      </p>

       So, no endorsement.

       As someone who lives in an extremely liberal part of the country, I will say that Trump's being elected has genuinely pissed off the dems off in a major way. I do not think that the people protesting against him are all acting on ulterior motives. Do I think MSM putting more of the spotlight on the Trump opposition as a way to undermine the recently exposed DNC corruption? Absolutely.

       I agree, I'm from a relatively affluent area and almost everyone is just bummed out that Trump got elected over HRC, but I don't know a single person protesting (especially not over a month after the election).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty clear that the MSM is just a propaganda machine at this point that's beginning to lose its control over people (hence all the #FakeNews BS).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where was the MSM during the massive protests at the DNC convention, or at Bernie's 100's of massive rallies? (Or even just covering HRC's scandals without bias)

       Yes exactly. Even my non-conspiracy minded democratic friends while sad of Clintons loss, still respect the results. To be fair, most of them/us are worked too hard in their everyday life to even have time to consider protesting on the streets.

       Strawmanning much? There are extremists on both side of this debate, but that's what they are, extremists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the actual issues instead of paying those loud minorities attention; Is the issue of Trump adding people like Rex Tillerson (who has strong ties to Russia) to his cabinet something to be concerned about, especially when the US intelligence offices believe that Russia had a finger in the Election?

       What disinformation? Were the Wikileaks emails wrong? Look, we're never going to agree on this. You believe in your Russian boogeyman and I won't. We can go our separate ways and that's fine.

       the source of truth as to where they got their information. Would it clearly not be in their best interests and even more bolstering if they got their info from some "disgusted" democrat instead of Russia?

       Yes. You know what, you're right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully there has NEVER been ANY pedophilia in governments before. There haven't been rumors for years or people arrested in the government like Dennis Hastert for child molestation. There wasn't a report five years ago of over FIVE THOUSAND Pentagon employees buying child pornography. Thankfully Bill Clinton never flew on a convicted billionaire pedophile's airplane over a dozen times. The suspicous "cheese pizza" talk luckily isn't a known code for pedophiles, even though many people have said it is. Thank goodness for all of that. NOTHING TO SEE HERE, FOLKS. MOVE RIGHT ALONG. YOU'RE JUST A CONSPIRACY THEORIST, SILLY.

       But I'll go along with your Russian boogeyman shit instead. Let me guess, the CIA says Russia is bad for exposing Hillary Clinton's corruption and now we need to go to nuclear war with them?

       I know that Cambridge Analytics was used by the Trump campaign.  I know that CA is owned by the Mercer family.  I know that Mercer owns Breitbart.  I know that Mercer is responsible for installing Conway and Bannon into the Trump administration.  It's not an "interesting" conspiracy in the way Pizzagate is, but it's demonstrable.  We
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       Trump is owned by the Mercer family and I think it's far more worthwhile to investigate THEM than some "code words" in the Podesta e-mails.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know other people are owned by the Mercers, like John Bolton.  We know that Make America Number 1 - the Mercer Super PAC - was run by Conway and Bannon, then Davis Bossie, who was also responsible for Citizens United, and who all are now part of the Trump team.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a clear-as-fucking-day conspiracy to take over the goddamned United States and turn it into a plutarchy, loot it, and get the fuck out.  But no, a "coded" e-mail about pizza and handkerchiefs is way, way more important.

       You complain about Trump's ties to Russia, they are nothing compared to Hillary. HRC approved the sale of

       of all USA uranium to Russia while Secretary of State And Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation even got a cut). (

       Because the election was between HRC and Trump, and HRC/CTR's tactic this election cycle has been to invert the truth (and blame her opponent for things she's guilty of).  They falsified connections between Trump and Russia/Putin, then they have the MSM cover it repeatedly.  The MSM conveniently ignore the real stories like how HRC sold 1/5th of our uranium to Russia for a massive payout through the Clinton Foundation (or her emails, or how she rigged the primaries or even PizzaGate).
      </p>
      <p>

       I believe Pizzagate is a conspiracy meant to distract.  To me, it's obvious.  You and I are polar opposites in this regard.  To you, Pizzagate is 100% true, to me, it's 100% false.  That doesn't mean we should start calling each other shills, dude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of the many tens of thousands of comments I have made over my 6+ years on Reddit, only a handful have been about Pizzagate.  So, it's not 90%, more like .009%

       I'm just going to list a bunch of coincidences that have happened in the last couple months:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Norway arrest 51 in an elite pedophile ring (shortly after donations from Norway to the Clinton Foundation drop 90%!)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The New York Times, Washington Post, and ABC News all deleted their articles on the Norwegian pedophile ring on the same day (a few days ago).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         1000's of pedophiles were openly posting child porn on Twitter, instead of banning those accounts Twitter actually bans the accounts that are calling them out.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The current CEO of the NYT is Mark Thompson, the same Mark Thompson who covered up Jimmy Savile's pedophilia for YEARS
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Andrew Breitbart was murdered after claiming John Podesta is a child-trafficker in 2012 before any of these emails or other stories were released.  (The coroner who examined his body died of arsenic poisoning)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Australian 60 minutes released an episode exposing an elite child trafficking ring (Involving some Americans too)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Do you want more? Cause I got more, lots more...

       Why do you not care about Cambridge Analytics?  They outspent CTR by millions of dollars.  Is it because they did it for Trump that you don't care?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, Trump calls Hillary crooked, is crooked himself.  Trump says he'll drain the swamp, instead fills it.  Accuses Clintons and their foundation of supporting and accepting money from all kinds of foreign interests, including the Saudis, turns out he's actually guiltier of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I'm not a Clinton fan and I want her to go down and get what she deserves, but it's not mutually exclusive to calling out Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to read about your numbers 1 and 2 before I can comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 - This is not a fact.  This is all based on the accusations of a single twitter account.  No one can verify this account, who owns it, or how they got the information.  The user being banned is not surprising, as they were essentially on a harassment campaign.  Note, I'm not saying it isn't true, just that you shouldn't treat it like gospel.

      <p>
       Draining/filling the swamp is subjective and not specific in the slightest. (nor is it an attack)
      </p>
      <p>
       And calling her 'crooked' is an oversimplification, he was specifically referring to her crimes during Secretary of State. (Emails, abuse of power, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       That's enough about Clinton, as I think we're in agreement that she should be in prison for her crimes.

         It's not a fact he was murdered, but he was only 43. (And the CIA uses a poison dart gun that is 'untraceable' and makes it appear as a heart attack)  Why do you think his coroner died from arsenic poisoning?

         Several sources claim that the Weiner emails (that the FBI confiscated from NYPD) contain a mountain of proof.  Let me remind you that Weiner was found to be sexting underage girls.

         Jeffrey Epstein is a convicted pedophile, he's also the co-founder of the Clinton Foundation. (And his island is notorious for it).  Bill Clinton has taken many trips down there, even aboard Epstein's private plane, the Lolita Express.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         John Podesta has art depicting cannibalism in his office, and Tony Podesta his brother is even worse (has 'art' depicting young children being murdered/abused).

        <p>
         I'm going to mention the Australian 60 minutes episode again exposing the elite pedo-ring, cause you didn't even mention it.

       If you're not convinced that there is at least something nefarious going on among the elite/establishment/MSM, you're either blind, ignorant, or apart of it.  The probability that all of these points are simply coincidence are less than a trillion to one, and arguing against it without any evidence is futile.

       I really, really hate this way of thinking.  "If you don't see what I see, you're complicit or stupid."  I don't think you're stupid for getting caught up in Pizzagate, I think the people manipulating the Pizzagate story are just very good at appealing to conspiracy-minded people.
      </p>
      <p>
       They take a dash of truth and use it to convince people of whatever story they are trying to push.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you not care about Trump's associating with Epstein?  Why is Pizzagate worth investigating, but not the accusation that Trump and Epstein raped a minor together?  You know, the case that was dropped because the plaintiff was getting so many death threats to stop the story from getting out?

       I do care about Trump and Epstein, I'm not 100% convinced that Trump isn't associated with all of this, all I know right now is that he's certainly got a better chance of dealing with it than anyone else.
      </p>

       You didn't even try to further debunk any of those 10 points, just look into them, that's all I ask.  I fully admit I don't know the full scale of this, or even all the implications, all I know is there is significant evidence pointing to an elite pedo-ring in the USA (CIA), UK (MI5), Australia, and Norway (As well as the MSM).  I don't make these accusations lightly, but they're serious and needs a full investigation.

       I've seen the instagram and found it totally innocuous.  Same with the e-mails.  Twittergate makes no sense to me - why would thousands of people knowingly propagate child porn on a public website in a public manner with full knowledge their actions were being recorded?  Why is this tied to Pizzagate?
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think it points to evidence that there are elite pedophiles in this country and maybe some of them are in it together, but I don't think it's as large as Pizzagaters think.  I think there may be a few different groups that get up to all kinds of awful behavior.  Again, I think Pizzagate is a distraction from other, larger conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is on its way to becoming a Christian Theocracy and we're going to lose many of the rights we were born with.  All because people are too busy googling Pizzagate instead of reading up on Trump's cabinet... for example.

       Before the election I thought Hillary was a criminal and Trump a buffoon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since PizzaGate broke and the propaganda of ALL the MSM became clear, I'm beginning to believe Trump's our only hope.  All the elite's that are implicated realize this and are scrambling to do everything in their power to stop it, even if it means a coup (by the CIA/Obama).

       The CIA needs to be axed, and Hillary sent to prison for life (or even death).

       Wasn't thrilled with Trump at first either. I didn't seriously start paying attention until about mid-October. Then I started following Wikileaks daily. Pizzagate hit and it began to dawn on me that there are way too many coincidences. Something huge is here.

       Woah there, big boy. There are plenty of reasons other than being a pedo. I recall during the Bundy standoff Reid being implicated in a scheme selling land to a Chinese solar company. They deemed a tortoise a endangered species to secure the land. I've no doubts he's dirty, but a pedo? Yea... probably, heh.

       He compared Trump getting elected to 9/11...
      </p>
      <p>
       You can be upset about Trump, sure. You can be pissy about it for awhile, fine. But comparing him to 9/11 seems a bit hyperbolic and a little insulting to everyone who had to deal with all of the trauma 9/11 brought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just makes me wonder if there's more to Harry Reid than what we're seeing, especially with the Pizzagate revelations. That's all.

       Agreed.  Thanks for the clarification.  Wasn't aware it was him who made that comparison.  DRAIN THE SWAMP!

       This echoes pretty much how it went down for me, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasn't thrilled with Trump at first either. I didn't seriously start paying attention until about mid-October. Then I started following Wikileaks daily. Pizzagate hit and it began to dawn on me that there are way too many coincidences. Something huge is here.

       I agree, I'm from a relatively affluent area and almost everyone is just bummed out that Trump got elected over HRC, but I don't know a single person protesting (especially not over a month after the election).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty clear that the MSM is just a propaganda machine at this point that's beginning to lose its control over people (hence all the #FakeNews BS).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where was the MSM during the massive protests at the DNC convention, or at Bernie's 100's of massive rallies? (Or even just covering HRC's scandals without bias)

       Why do you not care about Cambridge Analytics?  They outspent CTR by millions of dollars.  Is it because they did it for Trump that you don't care?

       Anyways, Trump calls Hillary crooked, is crooked himself.  Trump says he'll drain the swamp, instead fills it.  Accuses Clintons and their foundation of supporting and accepting money from all kinds of foreign interests, including the Saudis, turns out he's actually guiltier of that.

       Look, I'm not a Clinton fan and I want her to go down and get what she deserves, but it's not mutually exclusive to calling out Trump.

       3 - This is not a fact.  This is all based on the accusations of a single twitter account.  No one can verify this account, who owns it, or how they got the information.  The user being banned is not surprising, as they were essentially on a harassment campaign.  Note, I'm not saying it isn't true, just that you shouldn't treat it like gospel.

       He died in the presence of other people who witnessed him have a heart attack.  I like how you just state he was murdered though, like it's a fact.

       I am interested in non-politicized conspiracy theories you may have - I'll even continue to listen to your right-wing spin - but hopefully you can start linking proof.

       Deflecting again, but ill bite. How is a company that has been accused of having ties to russia
       <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/3351049/wikileaks-julian-assange-and-the-trump-russia-connection/">
        (which they do)
       </a>
       the source of truth as to where they got their information. Would it clearly not be in their best interests and even more bolstering if they got their info from some "disgusted" democrat instead of Russia?

       You know who i dont trust more than anyone? People on the internet. Especially redditors that only have 18 day old accounts and have only posted to T_shitstain and r/Conspiracy.
