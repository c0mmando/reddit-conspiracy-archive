       The endless corruption of language, it goes hand in hand with dumbing down people. We live in 1984 and its a fucking sad shame, a lot of people are literally unable to deliver their opinions or accurately interpret the complexities of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel this is the biggest obstacle to the information war that we are fighting, disseminating information is a key skill, what is a greater skill is being able to articulate yourself to others and have them able to understand.

       1984 controlled one tight narrative where everyone agreed with the state news... This is more like Brave New World... where everyone is so overwhelmed by information that they just decide to get high and fuck instead of worry about it.

       Everyone was forced to comply and agree with what they couldn't even make sense of. 1984 is like North Korea, but many of the lessons can be applied to our reality as well.

       Ok. --&gt;Anthropogenic &lt;-Climate Change- is NOT happening. There's a difference.  First off, if you really want to lift the veil on the matter, here are a few pointers: Hold on to your seat. Take some time to reel that in, if you're serious about getting to the truth. 
-How (Natural) Climate Change not only IS REAL, but always have been! And how climate is also changing on other planets as well. How the hell does human Co2 gets up there? LOL  Using «Climate Change» as is as a new thing is just like using Orwell's newspeak.
       <br/>
       -The 2 Climategate scandals (many site discredit them, surely, worth investigating, heh.)
-How George Soros gave millions to Al Gore for «agressive» postering for a "warming" meme-age. «The ice caps will be gone by 2013! » yeah.
       <br/>
       -How about the breaking records for ice in Antartica? Why don't we talk about these too?
-CO2/Heat correlation curves (on the timeline) have been broken off since the start of the industrial age (more C02), but the human emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere are less than 1%, which is absurdly low for the amount needed to cause a change in temperature. And the graphs tell that. That's why they had to mess with the graphs so they fit the narrative better.
       <br/>
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2420783/Worlds-climate-scientists-confess-Global-warming-just-QUARTER-thought--computers-got-effects-greenhouse-gases-wrong.html">
        http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2420783/Worlds-climate-scientists-confess-Global-warming-just-QUARTER-thought--computers-got-effects-greenhouse-gases-wrong.html
       </a>
       -Most graphs stating the heat curves from -1880 to now- are purposefuly avoiding showing the temperature before this period, because it was hotter right before. See more long-term graphs to see what has been hidden.. No graph before that? Ok, Dig deeper to find them. 
-The improbable «consensus» in scientific thought and protocols. 
-UN's IPCC who's had only bad predictions with their models for the past 20 years. 
-The many thousands scientists who are not getting in line with the "warming narrative" get intimidated, and are cut from research funds; if that's not telling enough. 
-Media is used to repeat day after day after day after day so it becomes real in the minds of everyone. That's how propaganda works. «More fake news», but who would discard a doom card, just in case, heh!?
-Tinkering with the weather has real effects (climate chaos, droughts and storms); Weather warfare /Geoengineering (in place for the last 100 years), hacking the ionosphere with hi-energy waves for control, Solar Radiation Management nano-particulates in the air for electro-magnetic conductivity and ice cristal creation.
       <br/>
       Here's Jim Lee (Climate Viewer)' s incredible Geoengineering timeline showing how far back does that go in time.. Eye opening. «CONSPIRATARD!» Hmm.. Nope. Just History.
       <a href="http://climateviewer.org/geoengineering-timeline/">
        http://climateviewer.org/geoengineering-timeline/
       </a>
       (scroll down).
 It's deeper than your average bellybutton, all of this technocratic shitness with nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Long solar cycles and their effects on earth's weather (we're starting a downward trend in global temperature, a «maunder minimum».. Soon enough, we'll be hoping for warmer weather! That happens every 400 years or so. Last time it was in the 1600's.. We are due. Get you some nice wool socks and machete to kill off cannibals. eech. ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       In the same streak:  the weakening of the magnetosphere allows more cosmic radiation to come through, which creates more clouds, so more cold weather.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out this great vid from the Suspicious Observers Community about the 6 biggest problems with «Climate Change» as sold to us by the UN (for Agenda 21, that is.. Read about the long-term goals of that shit..eech):  MUST SEE. Nice wrap up.

       Most likely because the globalist endgoal is UN's Agenda 21 which depends on how they can manipulate the public opinion towards accepting the steps for progressive deep re-engineering of society. EVERYTHING that we know is at stake.  Look how it is debated and opposed (even if discredited as another loony thingy.. sigh. )

       Yep. Many factors are conjoining. Complex system(s).  That's why it's preposterous from the get go to tardet C02 (or anything else specifically) as the ONLY reason for everything.

       I agree, just saw no mention of the moon in your post so thought I would add that as a possible addition to the system of things touched on in your post (top work).

       Climate change is not my usual topic of interest, but you can't complete a puzzle without all the pieces so that's my contribution.

       Thank you!  I've not done research on the moon's influence, but since we are linked in many ways to our Sun, (among other celestial bodies), it would be quite natural to see how the moon would play in some way, even just slightly. So much to learn!   :)
Edit: yep, there is work done to correlate this, many allusions:

       On a related topic, have you read or seen about the «lunar wave» phenomenon?  It's quite baffling when you look at all the videos. Search for Crrow777's work. He goes deep...deep.   Sometimes it feels like he's a bit misinformed (even for all of his experience and knowledge, but most of the time it just puts your brain in a WTF trance.

       I still believe in Climate Change but I found it weird how suddenly after Trump's win there were a shitton of posts on
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       about concerns over Climate Change and lots of fear mongering. After the media's record over the past year...I'm actually starting to doubt if Climate Change is really as bad as it's rumored to be or if it's a massively exaggerated issue...

       It's not a serious problem now for most people. We just have the hottest year on record. Still livable for the most part and not a dramatic impact on the lives of most people.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the problem is that it's being pushed along by human activity and the temperature is just trending upward with no end in sight. This is not a hoax, this upward trend ever since industrialization kicked in is independently verifiable, although after over 100 years, it's still only gone up a few degrees Celsius on average. We're OK now, and we might be OK tomorrow, but our children? Their children? How about wildlife that is losing its natural habitats? Rising sea levels damaging property? People get excited and make a big deal about it now when it's not that big of a deal, because if we keep waiting, it'll be too late. It could be too late already.

       Shorthand concerning why Trump's win triggered all of the CC hysteria, it's because it's one of the most influencial globalist hoax. Whether Trump is a «denialist» (or Truther, sigh. Geez. ) because he has a foot in the oil interest is partly relevant that there is much to learn about the whole issue, mainly because lots of parties (billionnaires) are interested in making the peasants (us) as culprits to implement increased taxations and massive re-engineering of ALL of society through the communist UN Agenda 21 (from socialist Maurice Strong, who had fled to China after been caugh red-handed in the oil for food scandal in 95 (Irak). Agenda 21 is already in motion, exponentially since a few years ago, after a long time waiting (proposed to countries in 92, @ Rio's earth Summit).. Anyway.... Giving you lots to read, I know... ;)

       Gonna fwd what I posted a few hours ago , concerning the validity of it all (it's lengthy, but worth the read): 
Ok. --&gt;Anthropogenic &lt;-Climate Change- is NOT happening. There's a difference. First off, if you really want to lift the veil on the matter, here are a few pointers: Hold on to your seat. Take some time to reel that in, if you're serious about getting to the truth. -How (Natural) Climate Change not only IS REAL, but always have been! And how climate is also changing on other planets as well. How the hell does human Co2 gets up there? LOL Using «Climate Change» as is as a new thing is just like using Orwell's newspeak.
-The 2 Climategate scandals (many site discredit them, surely, worth investigating, heh.) -How George Soros gave millions to Al Gore for «agressive» postering for a "warming" meme-age. «The ice caps will be gone by 2013! » yeah.
-How about the breaking records for ice in Antartica? Why don't we talk about these too? -CO2/Heat correlation curves (on the timeline) have been broken off since the start of the industrial age (more C02), but the human emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere are less than 1%, which is absurdly low for the amount needed to cause a change in temperature. And the graphs tell that. That's why they had to mess with the graphs so they fit the narrative better.
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2420783/Worlds-climate-scientists-confess-Global-warming-just-QUARTER-thought--computers-got-effects-greenhouse-gases-wrong.html">

       </a>
       -Most graphs stating the heat curves from -1880 to now- are purposefuly avoiding showing the temperature before this period, because it was hotter right before. See more long-term graphs to see what has been hidden.. No graph before that? Ok, Dig deeper to find them. -The improbable «consensus» in scientific thought and protocols. -UN's IPCC who's had only bad predictions with their models for the past 20 years. -The many thousands scientists who are not getting in line with the "warming narrative" get intimidated, and are cut from research funds; if that's not telling enough. -Media is used to repeat day after day after day after day so it becomes real in the minds of everyone. That's how propaganda works. «More fake news», but who would discard a doom card, just in case, heh!? -Tinkering with the weather has real effects (climate chaos, droughts and storms); Weather warfare /Geoengineering (in place for the last 100 years), hacking the ionosphere with hi-energy waves for control, Solar Radiation Management nano-particulates in the air for electro-magnetic conductivity and ice cristal creation.
Here's Jim Lee (Climate Viewer)' s incredible Geoengineering timeline showing how far back does that go in time.. Eye opening. «CONSPIRATARD!» Hmm.. Nope. Just History.

       (scroll down). It's deeper than your average bellybutton, all of this technocratic shitness with nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Long solar cycles and their effects on earth's weather (we're starting a downward trend in global temperature, a «maunder minimum».. Soon enough, we'll be hoping for warmer weather! That happens every 400 years or so. Last time it was in the 1600's.. We are due. Get you some nice wool socks and machete to kill off cannibals. eech. ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       In the same streak: the weakening of the magnetosphere allows more cosmic radiation to come through, which creates more clouds, so more cold weather.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out this great vid from the Suspicious Observers Community about the 6 biggest problems with «Climate Change» as sold to us by the UN (for Agenda 21, that is.. Read about the long-term goals of that shit..eech): MUST SEE. Nice wrap up.

       there's no point in debating someone who is unwilling to honestly evaluate a perspective antithetical to their own.  politicians will never be honest or transparent, because they have to appeal to ideologies that they don't actually agree with.

       It has gone beyond corruption of language.  Propaganda is now legal in US.  At the same time, Congress is now trying to make some "fake news" sources illegal in violation of the First Amendment. And all this while the Big Brother is watching 24/7.

       I've been identifying the "Fake News" onslaught as an organised counter-offensive, which is exactly what it is. I think on our side it's necessary to view it as such because it forces us to deal with it in that way with effective strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of how the public views this, we the organic and sincere citizen journalists and investigators, don't have any type of history of propagating 'fake news'. Sure people have made mistakes and erroneously passed on bad information or data that wasn't properly sourced or vetted, but the majority of that has not been intentional. I see it as learn-as-you-go experience building and getting up to speed by growing into these roles which for many are brand new.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must remember that there is and has been a concerted effort by the self-dubbed elite to prevent any organisation of progressive people by their legions of in-place agents and agencies. People are just now getting a breath of that fresh air into their lungs and it's energising them using their collective outrage as a fuel and a bonding commonality.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, the state-directed media outlets have a documented history of collusion with the intelligence community and governmental administration known as Operation Mockingbird. In countering this "Fake News" assault it would be effectively prudent to persistently link them to this with the historical documented evidence. That way the masses can make up their own minds on who has a mission agenda. As well as an established, collaborative past of following state-narrative directed lies, convenient omissions of facts, planted "experts", and gross manipulation of evidence and testimonies.

       1984 is good. You should check out
       <em>
        We
       </em>
       by Yevgeny Zamyatin, published in 1924. Orwell used his book to write 1984, and I think it's a more concise description of our dystopian reality.

       unfortunately i feel like most people in today's society don't give a fuck about anything other than their online social lives.
they don't care about truths or even injustices of the world.
that soak up propaganda like sponges and regurgitate it without hesitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       free thinkers, like the people who frequent this sub, are few and far between.
being open to possibilities and understanding the global impacts of actual conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       the thing is most people are literally waking around with their blinders on, faces stuffed in their phones. they don't want to hear anything other than the narrative of what i've come to realize as being the law of Thelema , "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will." that is the theme of basically every song in modern day music/culture. 
it's a "fuck you, i do what i want." mentality.
a "you only live once" mentality.
just indulge and abuse.
it's turned people into narcissistic assholes, if something doesn't directly effect them they will make a joke out of it and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       not every is this way, and i'm thankful for the people who aren't.
but damn there are a lot of sleepers.

       No doubt they used someone like Frank Luntz to cook it up.  "Fake news" implies that the alternative is real news.  As we saw for the entire fucking year before the election, our "news" channels in the USA are nothing but propaganda.  Not even relevant news bites any longer.  It's all bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm with you OP.  It's propaganda, and
       <em>

       is where americans get the most of it.

       Fake News™ is Orwellian "gab."  A term created in the political zeitgeist that is so poorly understood, both sides of an argument use it and it dilutes the big picture conversation.  Pedesta created the term "fake news" so the MSM and independent media would be so busy lobbing at each other, we'd all lose track of him being a blood drinking, childfucking Yalie like all his friends.  The only "fake news" is generated by Alphabet, and he's getting so much smarter by the day I promise you don't even know anymore.

       I almost threw up and broke my car radio when I heard this on NPR:

        http://www.npr.org/2016/12/11/505154631/a-finders-guide-to-facts
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ----&gt; This is from the article: "Is the story so outrageous you can't believe it? Maybe you shouldn't. Respect the voice inside you that says, "What?"
Is the story so outrageous you do believe it? That's also a warning sign. Many stories play on your existing beliefs. If the story perfectly confirms your worst suspicions, look for more information."
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT my comments below: 
-- So we should only judge truth by things we can believe, and if we do believe it because it fits into our worldview, that means it must be false. This is Psychological Warfare being peddled from a public radio station.

       I'm just wondering, does this sub totally discredit the idea of fake news? It's a blanket statement referring to actual made-up news, false memes circulated on fb/twitter, and badly-sourced or wrong articles (like claiming 90% of Clinton Foundation money is going towards execs, when most of that money goes to the foundation's own charity work)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's undeniable that this happens and has become a common thing. The solution isn't to fully trust alternative media instead,  much of which has a history of consistently giving false and quickly-discredited information, but rather to look for the facts and research the veracity of an article/picture/etc's claims yourself. Regardless of which side it comes from.

       I honestly feel infowars is only there for people to point to when they talk about delusional conspiracy theories. Plenty of decent fact based journalism (zero hedge, corbett report, etc...) is on their "fake news" list so they're now 'officially' categorized with the sites interviewing the air force veteran who served with Obama during their teleportation experiments in mars.

       This is what happens when 6 companies own all the news, You start believing it's all propaganda and you have to start looking for alternatives.  Sifting through the horseshit is almost like another job. And "fake news" becomes something that people find that lines up with their biases and isms.

       For-profit news will end up corrupted, no way around it. If you sell out, you ask to be told what to do and how to do it.

       Fake News is a blanket generalization by MSM to de-legitimize alternative news sources and an attack on free press / free speech. Obama legalized propaganda through the NDAA back in 2013 to be used on our own citizens. Hence, the endless confusion of the public in a media tug-of-war.

       Propaganda is the lifeblood of any cause or organization, large or small, though. Even, the "true stuff" based on "reality, logic, and facts". It's all propaganda. Some people would even classify individual value expression as propaganda, though I think that dilutes the symbol too much. But the connection is still plain. So in light of that, what use does an academic label do, except function as a weasel word like cult or bigot.

       its always propaganda when the journalist tries to make politic and not just deliver news.
      </p>
      <p>
       journalists have to report facts - they dont have to tell me how i should think or feel about.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is why RT has such success worldwide - they tell noone how they have to think about something. they present facts (only the facts they like) and let the viewer/reader decide what is wrong and what not.
