I stumbled across this forum and saw all this stuff about pizzagate. I did a little research and it all seems pretty ridiculous. However, I believe myself to be open about things and you guys seem pretty convinced, so convince me that pizzagate is real, and give me some proof.
Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another commenter is right, to begin, you need to break your way of thinking first (without coming across as condescending of course!):</p>

<ul>
<li>That the government is truthful.</li>
<li>That the media does the best they can.</li>
<li>That the concept of conspiracy theory was actually designed to subvert people looking into the JFK assassination and has been the most effective CIA psychological operation ever since.</li>
</ul>

<p>Search and read these terms (because I&#39;ll give ya this, you don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know, so how could you search and find the truth?). I&#39;ll give you a solid headstart:</p>

<ul>
<li>khazarian mafia (also Rothschild Zionists)</li>
<li>Laura silsby and what happened to her in relation to Hillary Clinton</li>
<li>Operation mockingbird</li>
<li>AIR AMERICA (CIA). See proven conspiracy theories in this subs sidebar.</li>
<li>the Clinton chronicles (witness testimony and whistleblowers)</li>
<li>look into George Soros, Rothschild, Rockefeller, JP Morgan (how and what they profit from)</li>
<li>project Veritas (DNC in 3 part videos etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you&#39;ll be able to piece together what is actually happening. To see that P1zz@G@t3 has been happening for hundreds of years among our elites and national &quot;leaders&quot;, you need to see a much higher perspective because you will begin to see that not only is it possible, it actually appears to be a way of life for them.</p>

<p>If you get through most of the above, you could also watch Mark Passio&#39;s long winded presentations on Natural Law (former satanist).</p>

<p>Trey Gowdy (Congressman) once asked a bunch of University convocation goers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would you rather freedom or truth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very few say truth over freedom, why is that?</p>

<p>Once you research enough, you&#39;ll probably reach an emotional point where you will realize everything is true, and you <em>might</em> come close to a nervous breakdown. I&#39;m not exaggerating, take it easy and just remember to think about the bigger picture if you do go through that. </p>

<p>You will need to put the comments in order by sorting by oldest as the OP continues their writing in response comments. This post was made 3 years ago, so this post was not made in response to the pizzagate conspiracy theory, but rather people have been researching into the problem of child trafficking already for years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While this is completely unrelated to pizzagate, it is definitely a step down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/pdf/2016/04/epn2016474p21.pdf">http://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/pdf/2016/04/epn2016474p21.pdf</a></p>

<p>This is an article in a physics journal using evidence, along with physics to show that during 9/11 the towers were in fact brought down by controlled demolition. </p>

<p>There is a lot of other &quot;proof&quot; that 9/11 was an inside job that is just comically wrong, but the results in this article are sound.</p>

<p>This should be a good step towards the rabbit hole. </p>

<p>I have a physics degree and an MBA, so I prefer to link to hard evidence to open peoples minds rather than blast them with circumstantial evidence that makes them think we are all &quot;tin foil hat&quot; people.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think of the article :)</p>

<p>I believe myself to be open about things and you guys seem pretty convinced</p>

<p>There are a lot of differing opinions here. Some people think it&#39;s BS, some think it&#39;s worth investigating further, and others are convinced that these people are involved in pedophilia and ritual abuse.</p>

<p>I would provide you a link to a compilation of the evidence so that you can make up your own mind, but Reddit is now shadowbanning any links to Voat. Proof is in <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5icmku/what_exactly_is_the_evidence_for_pizzagate/">this thread</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>One ten minute video showing me the symbolism and pedo-related imagery found in the personal lives of some of the involved people was enough to make me believe that something is up.</p>

<p>Add onto that stuff like Savile in the UK, who was protected by ex-BBC exec and current NYT exec, it makes me believe that there should be an actual government investigation. It would not hurt to investigate, as there is more than enough reason to suspect illegal activity. The fact That MSM so brazenly denies all of it makes it all even more suspicious, knowing that the media is owned and run by the elite of the elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in your position last week but I knew even less. Something prompted me to see what this pizzagate was all about. I thought it was just some reddit conspiracy that had no weight. Then I became morbidly curious about it... The more you research the more disturbing it becomes. It&#39;s just incredibly abnormal behavior. Even if there weren&#39;t the suspicious emails leaked from John Podesta, there is a disturbing amount of paedophilic imagery and connections you can make... </p>

<p>Like, you&#39;ve seen Joe Biden being seemingly creepy with children, the whispering in their ear, making them <em>visibly</em> uncomfortable? Not saying that he&#39;s a pedophile, but it&#39;s something...</p>

<p>If you have finals to study for I implore you to get completely done with that first. This stuff is disturbing and occupied my mind for a bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just going to list a bunch of coincidences:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Norway arrest 51 in an elite pedophile ring (shortly after donations from Norway to the Clinton Foundation drop 90%!)</p></li>
<li><p>The New York Times, Washington Post, and ABC News all deleted their articles on the Norwegian pedophile ring on the same day (a few days ago).</p></li>
<li><p>1000&#39;s of pedophiles were openly posting child porn on Twitter, instead of banning those accounts Twitter actually bans the accounts that are calling them out.</p></li>
<li><p>The current CEO of the NYT is Mark Thompson, the same Mark Thompson who covered up Jimmy Savile&#39;s pedophilia for YEARS</p></li>
<li><p>Andrew Breitbart was murdered after claiming John Podesta is a child-trafficker in 2012 before any of these emails or other stories were released. (The coroner who examined his body died of arsenic poisoning)</p></li>
<li><p>Australian 60 minutes released an episode exposing an elite child trafficking ring (Involving some Americans too)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Do you want more? Cause I got more, lots more...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>keep in mind: half of the conspiracy is the that media is trying SO HARD to quickly call this debunked and excuse all this scathing information as innocent and just quickly sweep it under the rug.</p>

<p>whenever you hear the term &quot;fake news&quot; - they are trying to discredit wikileaks and the pizzagate / spirit cooking investigation and at the same time blame Russia.</p>

<p>pizzagate is NOT about an supposed underground murder tunnel under a pizza restuarant - it is the bigger picture: a global pedophile and human trafficking ring used to blackmail leaders and politicians, and so much more depending on how far you want to go down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>make sure to read the FBIanon threads</p>
