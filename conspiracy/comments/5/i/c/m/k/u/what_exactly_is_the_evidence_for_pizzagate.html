    <div class="md"><p>John Podesta has a circle of personal, political and financial relationships with convicted pedophiles and child traffickers.Wrong  <a href="https://sli.mg/ddFwzS">https://sli.mg/ddFwzS</a></p>

<p>Eg. Dennis Hastert (lifelong friend), Richard Harding (lives next to Comet Ping Pong), Jeffrey Epstein, Terry Bean, Christopher Kloman, Laura Silsby, ARK employees, etc...</p>

<p>(Also, unconvicted pedophiles have been uncovered... <a href="https://sli.mg/qHo3V4">https://sli.mg/qHo3V4</a>)</p>

<p>Comet Ping Pong is part of a series of businesses set up by Andrew Kline, of Veritas Law Firm, including a large number of pizza places that appear to be fronts for breaking down large sums of money across multiple entities. </p>

<p>Basically, the business and financial relationships are proof of money laundering after tying Takia Dialog and others together through Bizapedia and the Offshore Leaks. <a href="https://sli.mg/qxz8Fl">https://sli.mg/qxz8Fl</a></p>

<p>James Alefantis is a professional money-launderer. Why does he need to disguise this much money?</p>

<p>Given the ties to all the pedophiles, many speculated that it was pedophilia and cult related, given the imagery and aesthetic chosen for the art in Comet Ping Pong.</p>

<p>A wider net reveals a list of 5200 names that were involved in child porn trading at the Pentagon. Tanked investigation. Twittergate revealed 24,000 traders of child porn. No investigation. Franklin Scandal. Dutroux Affair. Jimmy Savile scandal. </p>

<p>So many scandals involved pedophile rings that are never brought to justice that we are left wondering where these thousands of victims are even coming from.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is the assertion that there is widespread political corruption that results from an intelligence community that relies on bribery and blackmail using sex with children to control a large number of politicians across the world.</p>

<p>There is a straight line from the Franklin Scandal prosecutor, to the Savile case, to the NYT covering up political pedophilia.</p>

<p>It gets worse, though. Looking into the Clinton Foundation, it was discovered that the Board of Directors almost exactly matches  that of J &amp; T Packing. (Many think John &amp; Tony) They operate out of a giant empty lot, shipping autoparts.</p>

<p>What does <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> refuse to talk about? AK 47 silencers  without serial numbers being shipped as &quot;small engine mufflers,&quot; that was being used to outfit some mysterious black ops in West Texas.</p>

<p>The media refuses to talk about the scandals verified by the leaks... all the leaks not just wikileaks. Uranium One. TARP Fund scandal. Fisker/Gore/Obama Scandal. </p>

<p>Proven conspiracy after proven conspiracy and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is still having a hard time putting it together because too many people are relying on the mainstream news to give them information.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is the microcosm of money-laundering involving pedophiles surrounding Comet Ping Pong (<a href="https://sli.mg/luQdln">https://sli.mg/luQdln</a>), but it is being attacked vociferously because it is revealing a wider pattern of organized crime being conducted by &quot;privatized intelligence, social engineering, and global forecasting&quot; (under the Tavistock umbrella) that has thoroughly infiltrated our government and media and twisted them to its own ends of funneling wealth and inciting conflict across the world.</p>

<p>Seriously, there&#39;s so much shit being censored here (Not this sub, the site), that I basically jump between voat and Reddit. </p>

<p>The problem with Reddit is not many users experience censorship first hand, so they have no reason to leave. As soon as voat starts getting better content (i.e: more users), Reddit will finally join the ranks of MySpace and digg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone that considers themselves to be skeptical towards mainstream media and the conspiracy community I will give you my opinion.  I will say there was at the very least, &quot;peculiar&quot; emails sent by the Podestas.  John once referred to children as entertainment and said someone was ubering the children and went on to specify their ages.  He also had an email that indicated he was going to be attending a &quot;spirit cooking&quot;  if you google what spirit cooking you will find that it is also at the least, &quot;peculiar&quot;.  Also in 2013 Tony Podesta referred to Dennis Hassert (convicted serial pedo) as a good man whose character has not changed from 1965-2013.  I dont know if there is anything concrete linking them to Comet Pizza, but what i do know is that there has been reports and convictions of pedophilia in Washington for a long time.  There is enough strange circumstances around the Podesta&#39;s that I understand the suspicions however i don&#39;t know that there is solid evidence there.  Despite that I think it is an important conversation to have, because we know there have been some really sick guys doing sick things in government and i think it would be naive to think it was an isolated incident. </p>

<p>All in all, the election crimes surrounding Comet Ping Pong&#39;s social circle are as serious as it gets:</p>

<p>18 U.S. Code § 599 - Promise of appointment by candidate</p>

<p>18 U.S. Code § 600 - Promise of employment or other benefit for political activity </p>

<p>18 U.S. Code § 601 - Deprivation of employment or other benefit for political contribution</p>

<p>18 U.S. Code § 604 - Solicitation from persons on relief</p>

<p>18 U.S. Code § 606 - Intimidation to secure political contributions</p>

<p>18 U.S. Code § 610 - Coercion of political activity</p>

<p>Even Obama encouraged, on national television, 18 U.S. Code § 611 - Voting by aliens</p>

<p>Keep in mind, Hillary&#39;s letter endorsing Comet Ping Pong and Obama&#39;s picture playing ping pong on Alefantis&#39; Instagram make the personal, social connections incontrovertible. Further personal ties, including &quot;xoxo&quot;s from Alefantis are evident in the leaked emails.</p>

<p>You are invited to bring your prostitute to Comet Ping Pong. (Trick is slang for prostitute.) <a href="https://i.sli.mg/W3FMhT.png">https://i.sli.mg/W3FMhT.png</a></p>

<p>Here is a portion of James Alefantis&#39; album, which he made public, where we learn of a few other crimes. Notice that this is supposed to be an &quot;all ages&quot; and &quot;family friendly&quot; establishment. <a href="https://sli.mg/a/gaffhM">https://sli.mg/a/gaffhM</a></p>

<p>Thus far, here are the known crimes surrounding Comet Ping Pong. If the average person did any one of these, they would face consequences:</p>

<p>DC Codes:</p>

<p>§ 22–2701. Engaging in prostitution or soliciting for prostitution.</p>

<p>§ 22–811. Contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</p>

<p>§ 25–101. No Nude Performances in a Restaurant.</p>

<p>§ 6–641.09. Construction without permits</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are three major aspects to a money laundering scheme. The first is placement, in which someone gets dirty money into a legal banking channel. The second is layering, which involves breaking large amounts of money into smaller pieces that are more difficult to detect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comet Ping Pong, and the other Saudi properties, are a way of breaking down large sums into smaller amounts of money. Art is one of the ways to trade a lot of money for something that is little to no value to produce. Mr. Alefantis, through Transformer and other entities, is tied to a number of players in the political world. Rachel Chandler, tied to convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who flew on the &#39;Lolita Express&#39; and Bill Clinton is still operating as an artist who takes pictures of nude children. <a href="https://sli.mg/iE4eWo">https://sli.mg/iE4eWo</a></p>

<p>These &quot;artists&quot; and &quot;art collectors&quot; have some peculiar tastes that involved satanic/occult symbols, known pedophilia symbols (according to the FBI) and naked little kids. Nevermind &quot;spirit cooking&quot; with blood, breast milk and semen.</p>

<p>Financial criminal codes aside, the taking of foreign money to influence politics is technically treason, misprision of treason (if you know other people in on it) and countless Voorhis Act violations.</p>

<p>18 U.S. Code Chapter 115 - TREASON, SEDITION, AND SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES</p>

<p>§ 2381 - Treason</p>

<p>§ 2382 - Misprision of treason</p>

<p>§ 2386 - Registration of Certain Organizations</p>

<p>One only has to look at the financial dealings involved to start tying this whole web of slime together.</p>

<p>Uranium One scandal, which includes all of these treasonous crimes was reported on by the New York Times. Later, the Panama Papers confirmed John Podesta, Tony Podesta and several others were involved. John Podesta&#39;s emails revealed further confirmation from a primary source whose authenticity can be confirmed through Google&#39;s DKIM.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html?_r=0</a></p>

<p><a href="https://sli.mg/qxz8Fl">https://sli.mg/qxz8Fl</a></p>

<p>Since the primary source proof has been released, the Mainstream Media has failed to report the treason, but has slowly revealed other failures to report foreign money influencing our politics. Another issue the mainstream media has ignored is the TARP Fund Scandal, where nearly every politician&#39;s future campaigns were paid for by the banks who took TARP money. They basically reached into the pockets of every American and their children&#39;s pockets to rob our future and our infrastructure. </p>

<p>As the web of slime is traced through finances, emails and news articles, it quickly became clear that a number of convicted pedophiles were directly connected to the Comet Ping Pong social circle: Dennis Hastert, Terry Bean, Christopher Kloman,Clement Freud, Jeffrey Epstein, Richard Harding (lives next to Comet Ping Pong), Laura Silsby (child trafficking), and hundreds of others whose investigations were tanked. </p>

<p>The issue that surrounds pizzagate is a wider web of corruption where the protected pedophiles should be the first to address. Ask yourself why it isn&#39;t a priority to investigate a 5200 strong list of child porn traders operating out of the Pentagon. CNN just took down an article on it. <a href="http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1184433">http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1184433</a>  From Nov 30, 2016: <a href="https://archive.is/1PQEs">https://archive.is/1PQEs</a></p>

<p>Other massive cover ups of politicians involved in pedophilia have been reported on by every mainstream news source. Why aren&#39;t we doing anything?</p>

<p>The web of slime continues to get way worse. Paperwork from the FAA showing the deregistered &quot;Guantamo Express&quot; plane as out of commission raises questions as to why it was found crashed with 3 tons of cocaine. <a href="http://www.narconews.com/Issue49/article2989.html">http://www.narconews.com/Issue49/article2989.html</a></p>

<p>The day after the election, a number of other planes were destroyed in the Bethlehem fire. <a href="http://www.wgrz.com/news/local/inside-the-bethlehem-fire-in-lackawanna/354672775">http://www.wgrz.com/news/local/inside-the-bethlehem-fire-in-lackawanna/354672775</a></p>

<p>All of these relationships begin to tie together in J &amp; T Packing, where Giustra, the Clintons and the Hawaiian connections begin to reveal themselves.</p>

<p>What does J &amp; T Packing do? I think that is where the investigation is currently at.</p>

<p>Pizzagate isn&#39;t an alt-right conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is a large group of people who are demanding that the Mainstream Media stop protecting pedophiles in politics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to a study of 2,709 members of the American Psychological Association; it was found that 30 percent had seen cases of ritual or related abuse and 93% of the professionals were “certain” that ritualized abuse occurred. In 1992, a survey of the membership of the ISSTD, Nancy Perry concluded that 88% of 1185 mental health professionals reported belief in ritual abuse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Political Pedophilia is the real issue. It is not fake news. There are thousands of victims and thousands of medical and mental health professionals who believe them.</p>
