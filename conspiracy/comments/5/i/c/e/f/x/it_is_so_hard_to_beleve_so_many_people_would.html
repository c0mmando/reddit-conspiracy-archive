    <div class="md"><p>I think at the least we can assume that some people will say whatever they&#39;re told to say so long as the gravy train keeps chugging along.</p>

<p>The MSM has been following the AP and is used to reporting the stories exactly as the government asks when they ask. This is something that has been occurring more and more frequently as the years go on, and it&#39;s at the point where they don&#39;t really know any different.</p>

<p>I find it interesting how quickly values vanish when one faces the reality that they may lose their job, or worse, be blacklisted from a whole field of employment. So long as we can all be extorted in that fashion, none of us should expect drastic change quickly.</p>

<p>They are running a family restaurant where many children are present. I personally couldn&#39;t care less what americans want to do with that knowledge but I wouldn&#39;t go there with my kids. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need 100% proof for my own limits. They have a really faimily friendly art collection of tied up children in underpants. No crime but weird. They hang out with convicted paedophiles.

These are just two facts I need no internet propaganda for. The rest is just the icing on the cake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, lets never question anything even if it throws up more questions than answers. 
You know how criminals are found? By following a hunch. Having a suspicion, taking circumstantial evidence into account.</p>

<p>You know how to find out if your government thinks you are an idiot?
By believing everything they tell you. Even if it leaves you scratching your head because it doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Just to put a little perspective in, many things have happened in the world since, that are what they are and people accept them because they make sense. When one out of many stories doesn&#39;t make sense are we supposed to shrug our shoulders?</p>

<p>Voat is where thousands of people went to discuss pizzagate after it was banned here. There is constantly 1000-3000 people online discussing it. The discussion here sucks because it&#39;s disrupted by all the shit reddit comes with. </p>
