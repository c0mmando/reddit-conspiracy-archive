       I am a believer in pizzagate and child trafficking within governments. However, I cannot wrap my head around EVERYONE in all the tv world protecting it. There is no way that everyone is okay with this. I mean, at this point I even think Steven Colbert rapes little children. He might as well be doing right?
      </p>
      <p>
       How does everyone justify this? Or do they seriously think it is actually fake news and the whole idea is rediculous and that is how they justify making the whole thing a joke?

       The celebrities, politicians, CEOs, and Prime Time entertainers probably mostly all do it. News anchors, business types, wealthy people, lawyers etc probably have a percentage of people who go along; the rest are simply deceived and indoctrinated into certain thought patterns.

       I think at the least we can assume that some people will say whatever they're told to say so long as the gravy train keeps chugging along.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM has been following the AP and is used to reporting the stories exactly as the government asks when they ask. This is something that has been occurring more and more frequently as the years go on, and it's at the point where they don't really know any different.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it interesting how quickly values vanish when one faces the reality that they may lose their job, or worse, be blacklisted from a whole field of employment. So long as we can all be extorted in that fashion, none of us should expect drastic change quickly.

       I'm sure there are more. Some, like avoidgettingraped, claim that this is just "canned puff pieces" and not from-the-top scripted propaganda. Fluff or not, they tell you how to think and act, and that can't be dismissed.

       Colbert is a CBS pawn. If they tell him to cover up pedophilia, he'll do it.

       Nice theory, except, ummmm, people wouldn't be getting any repetition with these puff pieces. They're shown in small local and regional markets. Unless you're warping from Spokane to Muleshoe to Birmingham to Buffalo and back to watch each individual news broadcast, you're going to see one of these canned puff pieces

       Why? I mean tell us why? All I hear from some here is that we are retards and morons and how brilliant they are compared to us idiots. 
I have eyes and ears to do research and I could tell you what's fishy.
However can the constantly condescending know-it-alls please explain without swearing and name calling [it's awfully distracting from your apparent intelligence] WHY? Tell me, I want to be convinced otherwise.

       I have never on the whole internet, anywhere, stated that I think these people are paedos. I have however pointed out consistently that people with a background that ANYONE can check out for themselves on their official websites, would get a job as a babysitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are running a family restaurant where many children are present. I personally couldn't care less what americans want to do with that knowledge but I wouldn't go there with my kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need 100% proof for my own limits. They have a really faimily friendly art collection of tied up children in underpants. No crime but weird. They hang out with convicted paedophiles. Good for them I say but gives me yet another reason to find them a tad unsuitable for little Jonny's birthday party.
       <br/>
       These are just two facts I need no internet propaganda for. The rest is just the icing on the cake.
      </p>
      <p>
       People less fishy have been checked here in the UK before working with children. Just saying. Keep an eye out for your little ones.

       Yeah, lets never question anything even if it throws up more questions than answers. 
You know how criminals are found? By following a hunch. Having a suspicion, taking circumstantial evidence into account.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how to find out if your government thinks you are an idiot?
By believing everything they tell you. Even if it leaves you scratching your head because it doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to put a little perspective in, many things have happened in the world since, that are what they are and people accept them because they make sense. When one out of many stories doesn't make sense are we supposed to shrug our shoulders?
      </p>
      <p>
       People like you are very helpful in helping 'potential' bad guys. 
Just lean back and have another cake watching TV.

       That is not pizzagate. That is proven in many different ways.

      <p>
       Don't conflate the two, that is why you are confused. Pizza has nothing to do with anything. They are laughing at pizzagate because it is based on nothing, that is why it is being debunked so easily. Research actual topics with actual evidence and you will see it is much harder to debunk.

       Well you don't know what you're talking about. Pizzagate is most definitely about international pedo rings. One look at Voat proves that.

       no it isn't, and voat has nothing to do with anything, it is the same people making the same silly claims as here. Go ahead, you are lost in the sea of pizza obviously, so you can keep ignoring reality and chase your magical fairies. Too bad people don't actually care about helping kids, they prefer to play fake detective with nonexistent evidence they made up. The MSM will keep laughing at you until they shut you down, which is coming faster than you think. You are an easy target because your fantasy is not only easy to disprove, it hurts actual people. I wouldn't be surprised if a bunch of you got summonses to court for defamation, after they shut down all the sites talking about it.

       Voat is where thousands of people went to discuss pizzagate after it was banned here. There is constantly 1000-3000 people online discussing it. The discussion here sucks because it's disrupted by all the shit reddit comes with.

       You obviously have no idea what effect repetition has on the brain, especially to the subconscious or unconscious (news in the background while working or sleeping). Just because it's fluff doesn't mean it's not propaganda.
