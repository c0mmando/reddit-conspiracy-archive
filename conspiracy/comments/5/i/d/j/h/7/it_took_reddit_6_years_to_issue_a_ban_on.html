       Reddit's statement when banning child-sexualization subs:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At reddit we care deeply about
        <strong>
         not imposing ours or anyone elses' opinions
        </strong>
        on how people use the reddit platform. We are adamant about
        <strong>
         not limiting the ability to use the reddit platform even when we do not ourselves agree with or condone a specific use.
        </strong>
        We have very few rules here on reddit; no spamming, no cheating, no personal info, nothing illegal, and no interfering the site's functions. Today we are adding another rule: No suggestive or sexual content featuring minors.

       I highly value freedom of speech but i think even discussing about this topic is very dangerous for all world. I can see how islamists in my country will try to abuse it etc. So if you are speaking of far future yes, maybe rehabilitation will be considered but not near future, not possible. 
 I wrote like that because you sounded like that. You compared women and blacks to pedophiliacs.

       In my country several pedophiles have come forward in the media that they were born with this disposition but never want to hurt anyone nor posses media for which children were hurt. Together with a doctor some of them decided to have themselves treated by hormone therapy, removing their sex drive entirely. As a result, they are not harmful, and they can engage in a dialogue with broader society how to treat their affliction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imho, this is the best possible outcome. And we still need to engage more of these people in the dialogue, to root out child sexual abuse entirely. Stigmatization of those who try to make things better even if it means outing themselves isn't going to solve anything.

       Im not saying that society will one day learn to tolerate people who are pedophiles, but rather that they will realise one day that it's far more helpful to try and deal with the problem by methods like chemical castration or something rather than just waiting and hoping that they commit a crime so that they can be identified and thrown in jail.

       will downvote you for saying R's deserved to be treated like human beings. How much of this is CTR BS who really knows. Bernie engages with the R voters, he doesn't dismiss them or shun them. There is a whole lot we can agree with and much of that is agreeing our government and media are in bed together and corrupt as can be. It wouldn;t take much of a shift to upend the whole thing.

       I came here to post something exactly like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to have a knee jerk reaction to someone committing an absolutely horrific crime. I can understand the desire to just brand them for life and to kick the shit out of them/castrate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just like the war on drugs, brute force won't mitigate the harms or continuance of this problem. Unfortunately this is a historically recurring urge some humans exhibit. It's not going to stop for a very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm getting at is that we need to allow places like that sub to exist because it allows dialogue. I'm not a fan of them sharing CP or arranging offline illegal activities, but if their discussions entail with emotional support and resources, I'm okay with that. I can't tell because there is no way in hell I want to end up on a list somewhere by clicking into that sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel (but don't have data to back it up) that most people with these urges know how wrong it is. They know what happens if they get caught. They don't want their lives ruined.
      </p>
      <p>
       spaces for them to privately handle their urges without harming or endangering children are necessary. as disgusting as I find their sexual urges I would rather have a million non violent private creepers than 500 active ones comitting illegal sex crimes in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Harm reduction works with drugs. There's a solid chance it can work with other parts of humanity's vices.

       In theory it sounds reasonable,  and I'd agree.  In theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I absolutely agree with harm reduction. I agree that giving help to pedophiles mitigates more damage than simply ostracizing them.  I do believe that pedophiles probably are not even at fault for their own desires- actions certainly, but desires not so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       In practice, in context, and in specifics... I'm not sure that giving pedophiles a platform to speak with other pedophiles in an anonymous and uncontrolled format is harm reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedo's anonymous? I'm sorry,  but I think a group of pedophiles is capable of far more harm and damage than the same number of pedophiles working alone. Sum greater than whole of its parts,  and all. I'm not sure that the people I'd want giving pedophiles support are other pedophiles. In fact,  I'd believe the last people they should be around are people with the same urges.

       A shrink can have you committed on a whim if he even suspects you might harm others. Confidentiality ends when you might become involved in a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also a solid chance of getting a shrink who has his own prejudices and motives when handling you.  Finding one who can truly help would be risky.

       People who are convicted of *pedophilia related crimes in US jails are targeted quite severely. Even when they are in low security jails with mostly sex offender populations they end up in segregation due to assaults. Or they are just outright murdered.

       It's customary for people to reveal what they did to be locked up in a penitentiary. People who are hesitant to divulge why they are there can easily be researched by people on the outside. Everyone has a number and the penal system has searchable websites that list the inmates' crimes.

       Is it really customary?  I've had friends do time and they said a lot of people don't even talk to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, why don't those pedos just lie?  How would anyone find out?
      </p>
      <p>
       Prison inmates don't have access to outside information.  Most of them don't even know the time.

       EDIT:  In order for another inmate in the jail to find out what you actually did, they would have to enlist an outside party to research your name.  They would have absolutely no reason to do this unless they thought you were lying, and they would have very little reason to suspect you of lying since they would have no outside information to cross-reference in the first place.

       I'd suggest you go talk to some CO's from state level penitentiaries. Information from the outside travels readily from watching news stations, talking to people on the phones, and from new inmates. People also have cell phones smuggled in on the regular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it's customary. In low security prisons people talk to each other all the time. People who are doing small stints don't talk to other inmates but when they are looking at more than a year there's plenty of socializing going on. Maybe your friends were in county or local prison which typically involves inmates keeping to themselves.

       A friend of mine was in jail for a few months last year. We'd talk on the phone a few times a week and this was actually brought up in the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes the correction officers will actually let it slip to an inmate on purpose. And jail/prison is worse than high school when it comes to things like gossip, or any other useful information they could use against someone later. The information spreads like wildfire in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the information doesn't come from a CO and you want information about someone inside with you, all you need to do is ask someone during a phone call to look the person up. If they're a sex offender, they're very easy to find (at least in my state.)

       So, it's ok for these pedos to be attracted to your children and think about having sex with them as long as they don't act on their desires? Fuck that! Pedos should just slit their wrists and be done with it. No fucking sympathy!!!

       I think it's probably on a spectrum though. At what point do you draw the line?
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone showed you a picture of a 17 year old and you found her attractive, should you die? Obviously you'd agree if it was a 7 year old, but where do you draw the line between those 2 points?

       These people need medication to supress their sex drives as they are sick and twisted, if they are convicted child rapists they need to be castrated. They should be more concerned about not having these illegal immoral desires than to have a little talk group on reddit.

       The thing you're talking about isn't legal. The thing the person you're quoting is talking about (finding people who are willing to accept you, even with a mental illness) is totally legal. There's more than one kind of ally.

       LOL. Pedos meeting up with other pedos just helps them enable each other. They aren't psychiatricaly qualified to help each other, that's what a licensed therapist aught to be doing. A pedo meeting another pedo (off the internet) to discuss pedophillia is just going to end up in both of them rationalizing pedophillia as being OK.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just common sense 101: pedophiles meeting each other online isn't for self improvement, it's for pedophillia.

       Well if you actually read the Admins statement explaining why those subs were banned you'd understand why that wasn't an option.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/Jailbait was a very active subreddit with a very large amount of pictures being uploaded daily. The amount of moderation that was required e.g removing and reporting CP to the feds was just to much to handle so it got shut down. The actual Jailbait itself wasn't illegal but the line between JB an CP is thin so an additional rule was required.

       For real, didn't a guy end up going to the place with a gun to "investigate" anyway? Part of finding a conspiracy is critical thinking, but a lot of people stop thinking critically once they think they've found a lead.

Osama did 9/11 &lt;-- be critical of that
Bush did 9/11 &lt;--- also be critical of that

       Isn't this likely more of a legal thing? They're not likely to get in trouble for hosting "questionable content" unless they do so knowingly in a provable fashion. They can pretty much ignore the small pedo subs because they're miniscule, they tread the line (but never actively cross it) because there's no threat to the company as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, pizzagate was enormous and in the media. It was a very big sub and, at the very least the admins claimed, there was the rampant posting (and poor control) of personally identifying information. If someone were to act on that information, it would open them up to one
       <em>
        hell
       </em>
       of a lawsuit. They couldn't claim ignorance in that case. It was "ban or get sued".
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind there may or may not be an actual conspiracy here but the business answer is the most direct and complete one. Nobody is going to sue them or threaten them for
       <a href="/r/pedo101">
        /r/pedo101
       </a>
       . Pizzagate was aiming to identify government employees; the types who have the resources to shove a lawsuit so far up Reddit's ass that spez himself would be eating shit as a result. The threat of a lawsuit was very real and, conspiracy or not, it's not surprising that a ban happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        To articulate it simply
       </strong>
       : Reddit's administrators acted rationally. If there was a conspiracy, it may very well have been orchestrated externally in order to put legal pressure on the website. Whether the legal pressure originated from legitimate or manufactured scenarios Reddit would still be liable.

       That is a really good point, OP. In my view, everything about the pizzagate backlash is just topsy turvy. By the way, the Hampstead children also warned us about pizzagate. I think there is a lot of stuff still to be discovered/exposed/hopefully-stopped-for-good ahead of us.

       Wait, were these 'pedo' subs with actual pornography/half-pornography of under 18 children who could be seen with intimate parts revealed or actual porn, or it was simply one of these 'jailbait' type subs/sites where they posted pictures simply of teens/children in sexual positions or dresses?

       You are probably seeking for someone to provocate... You're quite good at doing it, but I still want to see if you really act like stupid or you are troll for real. If you haven't learnt simple English and do not know what 'WERE' means then please go back to your English class... I asked for confirmation in QUESTION form and you could see by the question (?) mark at the end of my comment.... You are the worst kind of troll I have ever seen as you do not seem to distinguish questions from statements...

       <p>
        But over time, Digg changed. Redesign after redesign unnerved loyal users. Finally, one new version, v4, was so atrocious that there was a mass exodus from the site altogether. The new site was a disaster both visually and content-wise,
        <strong>
         as “sponsored links” were thrust onto the front page and users felt like they were being packaged and sold to companies.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Digg pushed a narrative the users did not agree with and they migrated to Reddit as the new aggregate news/lolcats site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit today is pushing their own narrative and sites like Voat are in place to repeat those same events.

       Reddit is being more subtle with it. And I'm okay with them doing it to make money, definitely. they have a lot of people employed and that is great. But fuck their mobile site. I can't click on things, I hate how the spinsered stuff in injected into it, and man when I click on the comments, I don't want to just see 3 comments and more things on that sub. I don't browse individual subs often, but when I do I'm already in the sub and looking. I don't need that nonsense!
      </p>
      <p>
       The top comments are usually jokes anyways, it makes you miss out on some of the meat of the comments.

       Isn't sexual content featuring minors illegal? Wasn't one of the rules nothing illegal. I'm confused why it took so long. All though I still haven't seen much convincing me pizzagate is real I do not condone the act of Banning it. Shame on you reddit. I thinks it's t I've for another reddit/digg like website to emerge I would happily use it.

       Just read two posts over at one of those sad subs, but now i see why the Dems wand the muslims to flood in. Here is some advice they give out.
      </p>
      <p>
       "If you are in a muslim country you can have fun with a young girl based on muslim law, after she has had her first period, in fact Muhammad married female girls as well, look at child brides, you can express yourself freely in such an area. Just don't break any laws and stay safe my pedo friend." Sick, disgusting bastards

       Those pedophile subs were banned because the work that was needed to moderate those subs became to much, distinguishing between what posts were Jailbait and those that could be considered child pornography became much harder when those subs gained popularity.  I believe the Admins said so in the statement you're referring to. (There was of course the issue with investors not being happy with Reddit being thought of as Jailbait site).
      </p>
      <p>
       r/pizzagate got shut down because of the "no personal info" rule, moderators couldn't keep up with the doc dropping so it got shut down. Simple really, but I think you're right when you say that Aaron wouldn't be proud of what Reddit has become.

       You literally don't understand what doxxing is. Public or privately available data doesn't chance the fact that you're targeting individuals and collecting information and data on them and their friends and families without their consent and then messaging them death threats. It's against Reddit rules and can be a crime too.

       Mods on that sub said it was clean and they patrolled it.  It was literally a last minute call shutdown.  There was clear foul play on the admins above them and intent against r_d when a whistleblower admin came out.

       That's what I don't get about these obvious liars coming in here. They must know we can all tell they're full of shit, so why do they even bother? It doesn't help their goal of spreading disinformation if their lies are instantly downvoted to -12 and all of the legitimate contributors here shut their dumb bullshit down. It's like they think if they bullshit enough and spam all of the popular topics eventually we'll believe the bullshit, but each instance of bullshit is easily identifiable by all of the downvotes and all of the comments blowing them the fuck out. Who the fuck comes to r/conspiracy and says "no, conspiracies aren't real, you have to believe the government and mainstream media here!!!!" and what sort of moron thinks that would do anything to help them or their goals?

       Gimme a fucking break! Stop parroting the bullshit cover stories and either actually read into it, or shut up about it. If this is real this is going to come out sooner or later, with our without your input. If it's not, then nothing will come of it but maybe the mild humiliation of those digging, but moreso the relief that just maybe the elites aren't raping and murdering kids.

       The mods were actually working hard to keep people from doxxing, banning people who might take things too far with regards to personally identifiable information. Doxxing was not even a problem on the sub thanks to mods doing their job. I had heard that admins had also unbanned users who had been banned by the mods. Why would they do this?

       Or maybe it was banned because it's a manufactured, coordinated conspiracy. Obviously people with money are trying to control the more impressionable among our population. Liberals call anyone they don't like "rapists," and conservatives call all of their enemies "pedophiles." It's weaponized propaganda that's going to destroy this country, and very fast. I imagine the runners at reddit must be able to analye their traffic to know that pizzagate is being directed from some collection of entities. Maybe they banned it to do damage control on psych ops propaganda. It's crossed my mind at least.

       Gimme a fucking break! Stop parroting the bullshit cover stories and either actually read into it, or shut up about it. If this is real this is going to come out sooner or later, with our without your input. If it's not, then nothing will come of it but maybe the mild humiliation of those digging, but moreso the relief that just maybe the elites aren't raping and murdering kids. Whatever helps you sleep at night.

       So, it's ok for these pedos to be attracted to your children and think about having sex with them as long as they don't act on their desires? Fuck that! Pedos should just slit their wrists and be done with it. No fucking sympathy!!!

       In theory it sounds reasonable,  and I'd agree.  In theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I absolutely agree with harm reduction. I agree that giving help to pedophiles mitigates more damage than simply ostracizing them.  I do believe that pedophiles probably are not even at fault for their own desires- actions certainly, but desires not so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       In practice, in context, and in specifics... I'm not sure that giving pedophiles a platform to speak with other pedophiles in an anonymous and uncontrolled format is harm reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedo's anonymous? I'm sorry,  but I think a group of pedophiles is capable of far more harm and damage than the same number of pedophiles working alone. Sum greater than whole of its parts,  and all. I'm not sure that the people I'd want giving pedophiles support are other pedophiles. In fact,  I'd believe the last people they should be around are people with the same urges.

       It's customary for people to reveal what they did to be locked up in a penitentiary. People who are hesitant to divulge why they are there can easily be researched by people on the outside. Everyone has a number and the penal system has searchable websites that list the inmates' crimes.

       A friend of mine was in jail for a few months last year. We'd talk on the phone a few times a week and this was actually brought up in the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes the correction officers will actually let it slip to an inmate on purpose. And jail/prison is worse than high school when it comes to things like gossip, or any other useful information they could use against someone later. The information spreads like wildfire in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the information doesn't come from a CO and you want information about someone inside with you, all you need to do is ask someone during a phone call to look the person up. If they're a sex offender, they're very easy to find (at least in my state.)
