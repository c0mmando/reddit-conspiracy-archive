        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">34</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Ilsaluna.html">Ilsaluna</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From the intro...</p>

<p>The following article details a pivotal piece of history that all who seek freedom would do well to understand. While many people assume that the legal system is a discoherent mash of randomly enacted &quot;laws&quot; (which is true in some cases), there is a more delicate underlying fabric at work. </p>

<p>The legal system is a set of codified policies founded on contracts or equity law, which is the science of how two or more free-will beings work with each other co-creatively. The organic Constitution for the United States of America is a contract or charter of the government of the organic Republic, formed after the revolution in 1776. While this wasn&#39;t a perfect document, it was created by the founders for the purpose of governing the union autonomously (independent of British rule), a document created by the people.</p>

<p>But the Cabal, for reasons too complicated to list here, cannot let any nation or group of people escape their clutches. They needed to ensure that eventually the fledgling United States would be forced back into the fold. They tried to do this using several means since the beginning of the nation, such as enacting a fractional reserve banking system just after the Revolutionary War ended. They also attempted to reinvade during the War of 1812. And while one could conclude they were successful in corrupting the U.S., it wasn&#39;t until 1871 that an overt takeover took place. This was when the &quot;keys to the kingdom&quot; were handed over to the enemy and new and unparalleled era of corruption began. </p>

<p>Ever since 1871, the continental United States of America has been run and managed by a foreign occupying entity, the Federal State created by the Act of 1871. This occupying force can be described as the Cabal—a nefarious group of bankers and elitists who want to suppress freedom wherever it springs up, using infiltration, deception, and bread and circus distractions to destroy the autonomy of any group of peoples. </p>

<p>For this insidious purpose, a new government replaced the organic one because, during the war, Congress was abandoned and no official government existed. Lincoln issued General Order 100 or the Leiber Code in 1863, granting himself emergency powers to rule over the war-torn nation as the first dictator of the United States. Those emergency powers have never been relinquished, which granted him (and every other president since then) the ability to issue decrees (Executive Orders) that have the full force of law. Since that time, through the Act of 1871, and various other acts, the Federal government has usurped nearly all the power that was formerly held in the hands of the people, via the states of the union. </p>

<p>Today, the cancer of the Federal government has infiltrated every aspect of American society and civil life. The once quasi de jure status of the states and counties—which were initially the backbone of authority in the union—are completely beholden to the might is right federal government.</p>

<p><em>In plain English, the United States of America created by the founding fathers died back in 1871—it was taken over by a foreign occupying force. Since then, every president elected by the people was a deceptive fraud, a way to garner consent of the governed that do not understand their true history. When a person votes for a president of the United States, they are literally committing treason against the organic Constitution, endorsing the foreign occupying force and becoming a &quot;turncoat.&quot; Of course, we aren&#39;t taught this history in our schools, nor do they teach law and contracts to the people so they can recognize the truth. Most likely, those presidents and representatives elected since this act were not aware of the insidious purpose of their election in securing the consent of the governed to be ruled by an authority not loyal to the people.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the true home of the CIA.  Home is where you hang your hat.  In this case, where CIA stores its anonymous blackops money from drug dealing, arms/human/sex trafficking around the planet. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also where a lot of the P2 Italian freemasons escaped to, including but not limited to licio gelli, who was caught, extradited by the swiss and french interpol type agents back to italy on a train that had numerous snipers! on both sides of the embankment!  lol  He still escaped, via france to argentina, where he finally died.  The nazi ss also escaped to switzerland after the war.  One such had a suitcase shell company called octogon trust corp that was created with allan dulles&#39; help to basically act as a proxy financial network to get the exfiltrated nazi assets hidden away from the americans and british to avoid asset seizure at the end of ww2...of course it ended back in germany at the CDU at the end of the day, and in addition in 1953, queen elizabeth forgave their ww1/2 war debts, so they got their money back. When I say &#39;they&#39; i mean the german govenrmetn, not the middle class--whose corporate abuses on them caused them to become nazis in the first place!</p>

<p>So basically switzerland is one, big, mountain nazi, fascist stronghold that empowers international crime by anonymity; and yet the security states of the various governments of the world want to complain about bitcoin and other cryptocoins.  What a bunch of damnable hypocrites.  That&#39;s why these dickheads use the double headed eagle--did you notice that?  It&#39;s because that&#39;s actually a steganographic janus, the symbol of two-faced-ness; the idea that the government is both the lawful legit ruler and also an illegitimate criminal gangster; simulaneously.  Switzerland embodies this principle, more than any other country in the world...it&#39;s the final home of the templars, the nazis, the alchemists, and all other tricksters janus faced scoundrels around the world.  </p>

<p>They make Germany look like saints in contrast; and always have.</p>

<p>And yet, when we think of Switzerland, we think of milk maid lasses pouring hot chocolate from their bosoms, bringing us chocolate coins, and ricola, yodeling, and bavarian towns in fantasy lost valleys among the edelveiss and chamomile; clean villages with bratwurst where everyone has a stein in one hand and their bayonet in the other...it sounds so nice.  </p>

<p>No one would ever suspect they are all criminal gangsters that ought to be nuked off the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, Switzerland has a role in the madness. Because it&#39;s not one of the three city states is my guess as to why the author didn&#39;t mention it. (Those are two of my favourite posters, btw. Both have a tremendous amount of knowledge and share it freely. If either takes the time to post/comment, it&#39;s worth my time to read it.)</p>

<p>The question of &quot;who/what is the shadow government&quot; or &quot;who/what is the cabal&quot; has been asked with increasing frequency in both free-standing posts as well as within the comments of a variety of seemingly unrelated topics/posts over the last 6-8wks. </p>

<p>As it&#39;s impossible to explain in a few sentences or paragraphs how several seemingly different groups are all connected to someone just wiping the sleep from their eyes, I hoped this article would provide a basic idea of the who/where/how/why for dots to be more easily connected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. This is great discussion. Remember in 007&#39;s Spectre movie, the group&#39;s meeting that James Bond crashed? That&#39;s pretty much how I think things go in terms of controlling society. I think they get their marching orders from shadowy priest-like figures of mystical orders that are most likely pre-Egyptian and may-or-may-not live in the Moho Discontinuity (Mohorovicic Discontinuity), but that&#39;s just me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds interesting. (I&#39;ve not seen it as movies have never really been my thing.) If it resonates with you, it&#39;s probably part of your truth and that&#39;s what matters. The things you need to know will find their way to you when it&#39;s time for you to know them; how they get to you is irrelevant. :)</p>

<p>The process of waking up, from the thing that causes the alarm to go off to the path followed, is different for every person (which is part of the fun). We need to be patient with ourselves and with others as not everyone is down for this particular ride right now. It&#39;s all good; they&#39;ll get there when they&#39;re ready. </p>

<p>As for me, things were really weird from the get-go. My trip started on an esoteric path and then merged into the spiritual aspect and that&#39;s when things began to make sense (well, as much as they can since truth and what&#39;s right is subjective). It&#39;s provided a solid foundation for dealing with the things that continue to be revealed as part of the collective awakening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the best summary/explanation I&#39;ve seen that succinctly explains how so many different rabbit holes are connected and are all working together. </p>

<p>Once this is understood, the other things labeled as conspiracy theory are seen for what they are; tools to harm us and/or keep us divided while looking everywhere else except to the parties who are pulling the strings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good read. I wonder what part of the non-government is running the show these days. </p>

<p>Intelligence services popped up in the 1900&#39;s. I wonder if the patriot act was the proverbial nail in coffin for our government. </p>

<p>As of lately it seems like we are ram by the intelligence cervices, namely CIA and NSA.</p>
