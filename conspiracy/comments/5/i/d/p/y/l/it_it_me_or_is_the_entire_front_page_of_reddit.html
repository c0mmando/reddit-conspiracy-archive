    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s all just posts that are backed by reddit and reddit&#39;s owners so they just artificially inflate scores to help boost that narrative. I really wish we still had government protections in place against this kind of shit. News/media was supposed to be unbaised and impartial as well as providing equal coverage for all candidates. I think that reddit should absolutely be considered a part of the news/media concept since it&#39;s the place so many people go for their news/media. just because they are an aggregate site doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t provide news/media to the public. Bias and fake stories/narrative pushing used to be illegal but thanks to good old clinton the bill one, all that protection stuff/rules regulations all got deleted and allowed for what we have now which are 6 massive news/media entities with the ability to sway public opinion in any way they choose although due to them failing to rig the election the way they wanted maybe their hold/control is also failing?</p>

This allowed a little bit more variety and gave less popular posts a chance to get traction.

<p>It was posted 10 hours ago and has 3.5k upvotes. Only 3 hours ago it was only at 2.2k. It is currently the 5th highest rated post in this sub for the entire week.</p>

<p>All the comments are pointing out how absurd it is. I&#39;m almost certain Pizzagate is real but I also agree that a picture from The Simpsons is absolutely terrible &#39;evidence&#39; that doesn&#39;t prove anything. Seems like a straw-man which is easy for them to shut down, makes us look like fools for upvoting it, and takes away from the strong evidence out there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This change was done to give the appearance that reddit user activity wasn&#39;t dying out.</p>

<p>The large majority of defaults have a steady decline in active users while subs like this one and the_donald have had a steady increase in users.</p>

<p>The censorship is killing the website and users aren&#39;t using it as much. This change removes that from being noticeable with the voting.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been redditing for 8 years, karma has never been tied to upvotes for links. The change a few weeks ago reflects a posts score display, not it&#39;s karma. They kept the system that calculates karma the same, the displayed number is different now (and is a truer reflection of how many upvotes minus downvotes a post gets) but upvotes minus downvotes is not how karma is calculated. That&#39;s a secret.</p>

I&#39;ve gotten stuff to the front page before. If it&#39;s stupid shit, like memes or something, they&#39;ll let it slide. But they watch the posts that rise very carefully and  if they don&#39;t like something, believe me, they&#39;ll get rid of it.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, someone is definitely manipulating some at the very least. I saw a topic in r/politics in r/all that was at well over 30k upvotes. The headline was something like &quot;Putin personally involved in hacking US election&quot;. Definitely bullshit. </p>

<p>I just wonder whether the Reddit admins are in on it or if it&#39;s a third party merely buying upvotes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I totally agree. Something weird is definitely going on. I have no doubts that Reddit has been compromised. Any centralized social site will always be.</p>

<p>I am glad I ran across your post because it kind of goes along with a post I just submitted. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5igj0u/anyone_else_notice_how_weird_rbidenbro_is_seems/">Here&#39;s a link.</a></p>

<p>Basically, I post an observation I made about <a href="/r/bidenbro">/r/bidenbro</a>. It&#39;s such a weird cheesy subreddit filled with really awkward memes about Joe Biden. Most of them aren&#39;t even remotely funny. In a nutshell I point out the possibility that &quot;The Left&quot;/Illuminati/Elite Rulers took note about how Trump supposedly won with &quot;the power of memes&quot; and now are trying to prop up someone they can control through their own memes. Not too long ago most of Reddit disliked Biden and thought of him as creepy and definitely not in a positive light. All of a sudden these lame Biden memes have been slowly been floating to the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>...</p>

<p>It&#39;s all too weird and coincidental in a way... It got especially weird when they posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bidenbro/comments/5gsxsw/what_the_electoral_map_will_look_like_in_2020/">this submission</a> joking about Biden running and winning against Trump in 2020. It actually got pretty high up on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> that day. I was surprised such a lame meme that literally came out of nowhere could really get so many upvotes. To me it seems like some really weird Meme Propaganda going on.</p>

<p>Reddit recently, like within the last week, changed their voting algorithm. Thats why you are seeing posts with over 10k karma. This couldnt happen before, but now its uncapped. </p>

<p>But nah, lets just ignore facts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit doesn&#39;t add karma to your count after your post gets popular enough. This is widely known and they&#39;ve been doing it since Reddit first began. This is so that if you <em>do</em> get a post with 50,000 upvotes, your entire karma count is not based solely on this one post.</p>

<p>Basically, they want people with a fuckton of karma to be people who post lots of content that gets a decent amount of upvotes, not people who struck gold just the one time.</p>

<p>Someone posting 10 posts that get 5,000 upvotes each is more valuable to the website than someone who posts one post that gets 50,000 upvotes. They want to reflect this in karma counts, and they have been. Even before they let us know that the post that got 50,000 upvotes actually got that many upvotes.</p>

<p>They also do this with comment karma.</p>

<p>And they also do this with negative karma as well. So if your comment gets -60,000 votes because you said something insanely unpopular, it doesn&#39;t fuck your score forever.</p>
