       When have you ever heard Alex Jones covering specific details of a "conspiracy"? He might throw a name or two like Soros, Warren Buffett in general rabbit hole connotations, but nothing specific!
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time he talks about stuff its "they, the NWO, the elites, the globalists, etc..." he never names names, he never goes into specifics.
      </p>
      <p>
       His marriage to his wife was arranged, 100% arranged Jewish marriage(not saying jews are evil here, just stating facts), he is in fact Jewish on his mothers side(notice how he never mentions her and that side of his family?). He is controlled opposition by Israeli private groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes he covers REAL issues, because he has to stay relevant, but never covers them journalistically or just basic specifically, its always some general down the endless rabbit hole way! Essentially creating a black hole of information that can never be unraveled, that can never end!
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2012 when Ron Paul was actually winning and having a chance he did not cover him and his campaign for over a month, only when RP's campaign was winding down and losing steam, he covered it to "confirm" its game over for RP, even though technically RP was still in the game in terms of delegates, but you never heard AJ tell you that, he essentially said that RP lost and it was all futile to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the campaign he would literally mention RP every day, identifying himself with RP(in order to gain supporters and sympathisers from RP fans), then when it was important to cover him and advertise Ron Paul he completely stopped mentioning him, only appearing over a month later to say that RP's campaign was over!
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the same with this years campaign, he self identified as "libertarian" for the past two years, mentioning how he is "libertarian" daily to gain support and trust from libertarians, but when Gary Johnson announced his campaign and went on the trail, he never once covered him, not an interview, not a mention of the Libertarian candidate. Alex Jones WAS WORSE THAN MSM in covering Gary Johnson, it was 100% CENSORSHIP!
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't buy his stuff, don't promote his radio show, don't take him as credible source or as an alternative voice. He is an enemy of freedom and enemy of knowledge and real information!

       That is absurd. Not the best or most core libertarian, but 10x times better than Trump or Hillary and not even one mention of Johnson, when CNN had two town halls with him. He literally covered third party candidates ZERO times, worse than the MSM!

       According to 25 protocols of zion, the elite put plants like Alex Jones to trick whistle blowers into subitting secret info to people they trust like Alex Jones. They reveal themselves to the elite. Then the elite take action on the whistle blower. Jones may or may not be a plant but be sure the elite has plants.
