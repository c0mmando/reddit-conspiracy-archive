       Hillary and the DNC lost and now they're pulling everyone down with them. The fact many believe Trump is literally Hitler reincarnated means that turning the election over to Hillary is very important to them. So important they will go to war with Russia over it. They will upset the functioning of the election system for it. It is the ultimate cause that blinds their emotions to make them easy to manipulate, just like 9/11. This clicked for me today.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now we're going to go to (more direct) war with Russia potentially, and people will go along with it by and large, simply because they hate Trump and they associate Russia with Trump and hate Russia in this neo-McCarthyism that is being stirred up by the mainstream media left. The mainstream left is now officially anti-peace, which is a complete 180 from where they were during the Iraq invasion during the Bush years. Which just shows they don't care about peace, they care about their side winning. Just like the Republicans who are now suddenly pro-diplomacy with Russia. Which is good, but I hate that the motivation is politicking more than actual peace. It's so fickle, and only one side will try it at a time because they feel they always have to oppose each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting Trump elected was the perfect False Flag in a lot of ways, they used the media to set the culture against him, then when elected they can find a good portion of the populace who will do
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       to get rid of Trump, including go to potentially nuclear war over some Middle Eastern country.

       I don't think Trump was expected to win.  The newscasters seemed legitimately surprised and stunned at the outcome.  They wouldn't even call the final states that night in disbelief of it happening.  Hillary didn't address her pre-planned celebratory party, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this turmoil is the result of the surprise Trump win and the revelations of pizza gate which has the felons in this criminal network squirming to avoid exposure.  They are creating the "fake news" and "Russia" distraction to protect themselves from any further damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows though.  Since the election things have been so strange its hard to figure anything out.

       I don't think Trump was expected to win either, but that's exactly what makes it such a good ploy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you could very well be right about the origin of the turmoil. I'm seeing hypocrisy that makes no sense unless you consider it under a partisan light, like when the FBI is just doing political posturing when they go after Hillary, but when the FBI backs up the CIA that says Russia helped Trump win, clearly it's solid proof of wrongdoing. It's blatantly hypocritical, which means they're grasping at straws. There's this weird tit-for-tat atmosphere that is dragging both sides down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things have indeed been strange. It's hard to make heads or tails of things the last few months, in some ways. I think the main lesson is the US public needs to detach from the mainstream media narratives or else we are in for some serious mental abuse. Some people are definitely waking up though and freeing themselves.

       Who's ploy exactly? I'm a big believer in false flags, but i dont like to believe every outcome is an elitist ploy. I think there are genuinely good people in high levels of power. Information leaks combined with a rise of alternate media outlets are responsible for the downfall of the DNC. Not all agents are neferious.

       Not sure how reliable these guys are but:

      <p>
       "By Tom Heneghan, International Intelligence Expert
and Stew Webb Federal Whistle blower
UNITED States of America   –   It can now be reported that the U.S. Military Grand Jury have enough evidence to link the Clinton Foundation to a massive pay-for-play child sex trafficking operation tied to both Israeli and Saudi Intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This pay-for-play operation involves Huma Abedin, Bill and Hillary Clinton, junior George W. Bush FRAUD, John Podesta, Karl Rove, Mitt Romney and over half of the U.S. Congress and the extortion friendly U.S. media elite filth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note:  The Clinton’s and Bushes face immediate arrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can ow report that Hillary Clinton made a call to her CIA ‘handler’ daddy Bush aka George Herbert Walker Bush to hack and steal five (5) states on election night 2016 on behalf of Satanist lesbian Hillary as daddy had done for his Satanist homosexual son in the year 2000 election coup de eat.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a half an hour after the 2016 election coup was ordered by pedophile daddy Bush (George H.W. Bush) the patriotic U.S. Military stepped in and stopped the election hacking operation and tuned off the E-Systems West Star satellites and Israeli VIA Sat satellite out of Englewood, Colorado that were about to steal yet another U.S. Presidential election."
      </p>
      <p>
       How's that for a conspiracy??

       Trump wasn't expected to win. It's already come out that rigging, for Hillary, occured that night. But this is the funny part. By election night, the good guys were well prepared. Any attempt to rig the election would be squashed. You could see the realization creep into their faces through the night. Hillary couldn't even come out of her hole. Ha!

       There was only a recount in WI, which was a sham. Many places refused to hand-recount, the ballots were open to tampering for the 3 weeks before election day, and some machines had broken seals.

       There would be the benefit of exposing Democratic election corruption, and Jill Stein was paying for it, not the state. Whatever their court decision was, it could be a cover for not wanting a recount to happen. And there's still reason to doubt that Detroit's implausibly high turnout is real, based on the results.

       not sure what to think. she cancelled her fireworks display two days before the election...

       obama said the other day that he didn't make a stink about russia before the election, because he thought she would win. no one called him on this, but it's a pretty astounding admission.

      <p>
       plan A: clinton wins, pat each other on the back, plans for hot war with russia continue a pace.
      </p>
      <p>
       plan B: trump wins, use russian "yellow cake" hacking claim as justification for increasing hostilities that have been in the works for at least 2 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       plan B1: overturn election before inauguration--protests, recounts, doxing, bribing, harrassing electors, paint trump as a putin plant and traitor--to get him to step aside "willingly" or to set up immediate articles of impeachment
      </p>
      <p>
       plan B2: force trump's hand by using obama's last few weeks to make hostilities with russia unavoidable, so that the tipping point is met or passed by jan 20.

       yup. except the US has no chance of winning a war against Russia so it's really the height of folly for them to set things up like this. i wonder if there was supposed to be a different FF when hillary was elected &amp; had her ducks more in a row.. this feels rushed and desperate because they know trump won't cow to the plan they had so they had to retcon. hard to tell what will materialize out of all the hot air everywhere.

       I don't think they really want to fight Russia, they just want to overthrow Assad and take Syria, but that has a very high chance of placing us in direct conflict with Russia. That's really what I meant in the title. I think the rest is just posturing to keep Russia in check for that plan to succeed. But I also think they might bite off more than they can chew out of overconfidence and the Russians may respond.

       They won't push the dissidents out because the dissidents are heavily funded by the west and many are hired mercenaries from other areas. So as long as the US and Europe want that war to continue, it will.  But if the mercinary proxy war doesn't work out, I could see a large scale event similar to the Sarin Gas thing several years, but larger, used as a justification for the need to invade Syria as a humanitarian effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Syria is not a small conflict. It's a line in the sand Russia has drawn. After the US/Israel/Europe overthrew Iraq and Kuwait, as well as many other countries in the region, Russia has decided that Iran and Syria are the final straw, and will not let them fall, so they keep funding them and arming them, just like the US is doing with the "rebels" on the other side. This proxy war could go on for a long time, but it seems to be escalating because both sides seem to be stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget the US tried to enter Syria boots on the ground about 2 years ago and was literally blocked by russian warships and anti-air missiles in the Mediterranean. Plus it was hugely unpopular, like I hope it remains. Unless they pull some false flag bullshit to try and get everyone all emotional about the need to invade Syria

       thank you for the info and your perspective! i had been relating Syria to other proxy wars in the ME but it sounds like it's more significant than my attributions. i do see people talking about the conflict as a 'genocide' and have seen, for example, the hashtag #HolocaustInAleppo (or similar) being pushed, which fits with your hypothesis that the US is upping its pathos game. i had (apparently foolishly) hoped Syria would return to some sort of stasis if the 'rebels' got beat back enough but it sounds like you don't see that happening.

       it is a proxy war with russia, and syria wasn't the end game. syria was just a sloppy attempt by the CIA to check in 1 with a pawn. the whole purpose was the no fly zone, which would almost gaurantee war with russia.

       we deployed 1600 tanks to the netherlands thursday and 4000 troops to poland a fews days before that. i wish i had your confidence that a hot war is unlikely...i just don't.

       The gameplan was to cut Russia out of the European oil market.  They were going to send oil direct from middle east through Turkey to Europe, and they wouldn't need to buy from Russia any more.  They wanted to beat Russia economically by beating Syria.  Then Russia was called upon by their ally Syria to defend them.

       syria is a proxy war with russia. it's just a reboot of the CIA proxy afghan war of the late 80s-90s.
      </p>
      <p>
       some faction in our govt has had a hard on for at least a renewed cold war with russia for at least 3 years, when we started agressive NATO war games from the baltic to the black sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       clinton's beloved no fly zone over syria was a golden ticket to a hot war with russia.

       To put simply, we don't want nukes involved.  If we tried to invade, Russia has tremendous defensive capabilities and we wouldn't succeed.  Russia doesn't have the same offensive mobility, but on home turf they are amply prepared.  And if things ever get serious, they will play the nukes.

       russia has mutual aid treaties with china and north korea, if it goes to war, they do to.
      </p>
      <p>
       a war with russia triggers NATO article 5, pulling every NATO signatory and protectorate into the conflict (i.e. the UK, all of europe, canada, and australia).
      </p>
      <p>
       US, russia, UK, france, china, north korea all have nuclear arsenals. as does israel (wink, wink), india, and pakistan. i don't know about those last two but israel will def jump in.
      </p>
      <p>
       neither russia, nor china, has ever lost a land war within its own borders (contrary to popular belief, it was the red army that defeated NAZIs, not us). china literally has a billion more people than we do.

       The only two ways I see for Trump being Hitler:

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hitler reborn himself in form of Trump

       Trump was one of the first people to ground zero that pushed the 9/11 story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump also claimed that 9/11 was an inside Job while running.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then,
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has recruited men and women that helped support the narrative that 9/11 was done by a group of Muslim terrorists and not an inside Job.

       Whatever the narrative is that they are creating for us, I
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       believe the wealthy interests who are behind Trump and Clinton are convening together to produce a result that benefits the New World Order as a whole. The financiers behind the superpowers of Russia and The U.S. are convening and networking toward a common goal. I now see that this whole election was used to create chaos and brew hostility/tenion between the two parties, and both Trump and Clinton participated and played up a clever little rivalry for us, and helped that hostility fester.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are trying to pin as many individual groups of people against one another as they can. They're using the media to push this idea that there is a huge problem with racism in this country, and the feminist and LGBT groups are all heated and up in arms. They're pinning us all against each other and stirring the pot, so when they pull the rug out from underneath us and usher in the collapse, we're all at each others' thoats. We will be too hostile towards one another and too disorganized and unprepared to deal with the collapse and a proper, organized resistance will not be able to form. Don't fall for the race war bullshit, and don't let them convince you that everybody hates each other right now, thats simply not true.

       short answer: know one really knows
      </p>
      <p>
       long answer: the USSR was communist, the soviets were mostly russian, and the soviet capital was in the millenial old capital of russia, moscow.
      </p>
      <p>
       the USSR also had a bad habit of anexing other slavic countries, and were as dedicated as we were to building an impenatrable military deterent led by a nuclear arsenal that could end the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       the fact they were the true heroes of WW2 (they defeated the NAZIs, not the west, and certainly not us), scared (and probablly irked) our govt and its paranoid schizo spook class.
      </p>
      <p>
       the soviets did to hitler exactly what the russians had done to napoleon, and our govt didn't want to take the chance they'd do it to us too (ignoring the fact that they'd done that in response to direct invansions).
      </p>
      <p>
       and for sure stalin was a monster and there was no such thing as civil liberties in the CCCP (but there was also no homelessness, nor unemployment).
      </p>
      <p>
       our govt trained people to hate the soviets, just like they trained little boomer kids that if THE BOMB hits, just get under your desk. its just the age old mass programming, "aaahhhhh ruskies!!!!!" or "aaahhhhhh trumphitler!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       the programmers do it for their own reasons, but onced programmed...well...
      </p>
      <p>
       our current beef with russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       oil; and its refusal to stay down and be a humble, little groveling loser; and the fact that boomers, who were raised to be cold warrior, true believers, still run everything--they just can't seem to quit their red hysteria. the programming was strong with them (maybe all the radiation in the air from the open air tests in NV helped get it really cemented in?).
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm an Xer, i don't know any of us who hated the soviets/russians growing up. i also don't know any of us who didn't hate our own govt growing up. i was way more afraid of the CIA, then the KGB. apparently, Xer programming was all just about being suicidal, fatalists with authority issues. it's unclear what the goal of that was thought to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's an embarrassingly silly video (but an oh so 80s song) and you'll probablly not appreciate it, but there was a reason this song was popular:

        https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MzGnX-MbYE4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       we thought the USSR hysteria was stupid. and teriffying. i think we all assumed we'd eventually die under the a mushmroom cloud, i know i did. but everyone i knew, including my parents, assumed we'd be the ones to jump the gun. that's why war games seemed so plausible. and probably why i'm so uneasy right now.

      </p>
      <p>
       it's been so long since i felt like this. it's like PTSD from growing up during the period of the cold war where we got the closest to midnight on the doomsday clock ever...well, until now...now we're  back up to 3 minutes to midnight.

       Russia was a kingdom until Lenin and pals caused violent revolution in early 1900s and overthrew the government.  They made the country communist.  Communism was the opposite of Americanism.  The government controls everything, plans everything.  No elections, no freedom of speech, no open press, no freedom of religion (Orthodox Church was stifled and told what they could teach) but atheism was official, government controls the schools, and tells you where to work.  When Stalin came into power, he set about exiling or executing everybody who was not a proper submissive communist.  Children were taught in school to rat out their parents.  They implemented multiple 5 year plans to progressively transform society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia was the #1 most despised country in the west.  But in WWII, Russia wasn't really an ally.  It just happened that expansionist Germany and Japan both targeted Russian territory (big country).  When WWII ended, the US restored all the countries it liberated back to their former status, and set up democracy in Japan and Germany.  Russia meanwhile kept all their territories, made them communist dictatorships, and established the Soviet Union.  They implemented the Iron Curtain and forbade anybody going outside of their Union without government permission.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also infiltrated the US, stole plans for nuclear weapons, and started the arms race for nuclear superiority.  Ideologically they were already enemy #1, but this made the whole thing super dangerous.

       Going into the election, I completely expected it to be rigged for Hillary. So when Trump managed to pull off a win on election night, I was shocked, but my first thought was that he won a sufficient landslide to overcome the pro-Hillary fraud. Then I saw the
       <a href="http://tdmsresearch.com/2016/11/10/2016-presidential-election-table/">
        exit polls
       </a>
       , which told exactly the opposite story: Hillary had the election rigged
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       her.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked into the evidence for a while, and came away fairly convinced that the election was rigged for Trump. But it seemed absurd for the establishment to do such a thing. Hillary was their preferred candidate. When, in late November, the media suddenly began taking seriously the idea that the election might have been rigged, and supporting a recount, I became very suspicious that the fraud in Trump's favor was a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the past 16 years, the media has never taken election fraud seriously. The establishment press wouldn't have changed course this year unless they expected it to benefit them. And if there actually
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       fraud in Hillary's favor, they wouldn't risk exposing it. Putting it together, it looked like the establishment rigged it for Trump specifically because they wanted it to be exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would happen if it was exposed? Trump would be delegitimized, for one. And back in August, the media actually did something strange: they talked about the vulnerabilities in electronic voting machines. However, they always made sure to frame it in the context of Russian hackers. I thought, back then, that they might try to rig the election for Trump and blame it on Russia. Seeing what the media was doing brought that concern back to the forefront of my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it actually looked like Russia hacked the presidential election, it would appear to be an act of war. And the deep state, which wants a war (or at least a more aggressive posture) with Russia, would have the perfect setup to retaliate.

       My guess is that the recounts were intended to expose the fraud. But the MI and PA recounts were blocked, and election administrators ran a sham in WI: many counties just retabulated ballots by machine, the ballots were unaccounted for the 3 weeks between the election and recount, and some machines may have been tampered with. Since the recount failed, the Obama Administration was forced to come out with the CIA report accusing Russia.

       richard charnin provides excellent analysis of the exits themselves and the fact that they are implausibly based on clinton getting significantly more independents than trump. there is a strong argument to be made that the exits were deliberately inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       the 3 states with the largest diviation btwn exits and reported vote were actually NJ, CA, and NY all significantly in clinton's favor and without which, she loses the popular vote (even though she still wins each state with a healthy margin).
      </p>
      <p>
       i live in broward county, FL, the epicenter of election fuckery. i got involved in the miami herald's post mortem recount, after having been recruited by my law school in VA that fall of my 1L year to learn as much about election law as was possible before the final ruling (election law was a niche so small back then as to basically not exist--we based our final prediction on marbury and the political question doctrine, only to have SCOTUS' "strict constructionists" wing ignore them completely (200 year old precendents tossed out the window. poof.)
      </p>
      <p>
       anywho, those experiences led to my involvement in working on election fraud in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       here's the thing, counterintuitively, the counties and states most likely to stuff the ballot box are not the ones a candidate is expected to lose but where they expected to win the easiest, for the very practical reason that all poll workers and election officials are partisans and it's easier to cheat among like minded people.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyone who is thinking that the wayne county discrepancy in number of voters vs ballots favored trump should thank god the count was stopped. wayne county is the broward of MI, when thumbs are pressed on the scales there, they are for the democrat.
      </p>
      <p>
       that a post mortem investigation by the state is going to take place there, should make any clinton supporter nervous.
      </p>
      <p>
       if charnin is right and the exits were purposefully manipulated and CA, NY, and NJ were the most rigged, then one could conclude clinton, or someone on her team, at least believed that it would be very close, too close, and as the night wore on, and things got uglier and uglier for her, CA was instructed to flip as many votes as possible, specifically to validate the popular vote argument. they were setting the stage for the bullshit that has been going on since nov 9th, and building the foundation for the narrative they wanted to push--trump is not only dangerous, he is illegitimate, which is morphing into he is a traitor.
      </p>
      <p>
       clinton and the DNC had just had the sanctity of exit polls rammed down their throats for months during the primary...corrupting exits to manipulate the narrative is exactly the sort of grinchy thing podesta, clinton, et al would delight in, when they aren't sniffing the pineal glands of poor little murdered children.

       NJ did have a large exit poll discrepancy, but in favor of Trump. CA had virtually no discrepancy. And NY is the only state with a significant discrepancy favoring Hillary (which shouldn't be a surprise).
      </p>
      <p>
       Charnin's argument against the exit polls' accuracy
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CAVDEF/comments/5d5f3c/are_the_2016_unadjusted_exit_polls_correct/">
        is mathematically invalid
       </a>
       . He erroneously applied the adjusted exit poll party ID weights to the unadjusted exit polls. The unadjusted exit polls still have Trump winning independents.
      </p>
      <p>
       It certainly
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be the case that the exit polls were manipulated to put Hillary ahead. But there are reasons not to believe that. Aside from Charnin's math being wrong:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are downticket Democrats who also suffered from a red shift, not just Hillary. Supposing that Hillary's margin in the exit polls is falsified, that doesn't explain the other Democratic candidates, who are much more likely to have the election rigged
         <em>
          against
         </em>
         (not for) them. Since the red shifts between presidential and downticket races often match up, it's likely that Hillary's red shift is legitimate as well.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I looked at the precinct sampling of the exit polls, and at least some of them (like Ohio) appear to underweight Democratic areas.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And the study of exit polls goes back to at least 2004. During that time, the media could have always opted to obscure the evidence of fraud, depriving the election integrity analysts of an essential data source. Hell, they actually did withhold the exit polls in 2002 because the red shifts were massive. But they never did. So why would they start now?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree recounts are just as dirty as elections. That's why I believe that WI's recount was a sham to cover up the fraud for Trump, like the 2011 WI Supreme Court recount. And the anomaly in Detroit appears to be based on a misconception, using number of ballot
       <em>
        pages
       </em>
       cast instead of the number of ballots cast.

       I agree with letting it be. Hillary was never a legitimate candidate for the general election due to the fraud in the primaries. But it is important to get the truth out about what happened in the general.

       This is interesting, and your narrative sounds credible.  And yet, I've run into so many accounts of potential fraud on behalf of democrats, going back to when Trump refused to promise to accept the results in advance. I haven't bothered to track it like you seem to have been doing, but honestly I wouldn't be surprised if both parties were neck-deep in the muck in various locations.  I feel like the entire country should be audited in the next 4 years, and fraud-proof auditable voting systems (and no black box computers) and procedures be implemented.

       I agree with the need to have a trustworthy and verifiable voting system, and audits. The actual culprits of election fraud are unclear, but I'm inclined to think it's not as partisan as many believe. State election officials often don't know how to manage their voting machines, so they outsource it to vendors and contractors. These vendors and contractors are the most likely perpetrators.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at them, there are frequent connections to the military-intelligence complex and deep state crime operations (like Watergate and CIA drug trafficking). Defense contractors were also some of the biggest proponents of electronic voting machines in the early 2000s. I think the deep state developed a voting infrastructure that they could control, and then promoted it into mainstream use.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would make the deep state, rather than one party or the other, in control of the fraud. They might have contacts with partisan operatives (like Karl Rove for the GOP and the Podestas from the DNC), but they ultimately call the shots. Of course, some aspects of election fraud are still doable by partisan officials, but my view is that election rigging is largely a deep state operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as for Trump refusing to accept the results in advance, I think he (rightfully) believed at the time that the fraud would be in Hillary's favor. Hillary herself almost certainly believed that too. But the deep state pulled off something different from the original plan.

       deepstate eh?  I saw somebody saying they had been involved in a report on NSA interfering in CA, and were planning to publish soon.

       There are several examples of deep state links to the development and adoption of electronic voting machines:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cocaine traffickers, convicted in the 1980s (around the time of Iran-Contra), gained executive jobs at Global Election Systems (the precursor to Diebold) and its New England dealer LHS Associates.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Jeffrey Dean, who embezzled money from a Seattle law firm, got to develop King County's absentee voting system while in prison, suspiciously received millions of dollars to start a ballot printing plant after his release, and had it bought by Global, making him an executive. He proceeded to add features into their system that facilitated election fraud. Dean embezzled money in a scheme with some of the law firm's partners, likely including Egil Krogh, the head of the White House Plumbers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Military contractors and intelligence affiliates got heavily involved with electronic voting. Diebold, a military contractor, decided to buy Global. Other military contractors are some of the largest investors in Diebold, ES&amp;S, and Sequoia. SAIC, a contractor whose executives are former Pentagon and CIA officials, helped develop Diebold voting machines' security. And military contractors were also some of the early voices calling for electronic voting in the early 2000s.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Franklin pedophilia scandal pulled in top business executives from Nebraska. ES&amp;S was a prominent Omaha company, and it would later be bought by the McCarthy Group, an Omaha investment bank. The Urosevich brothers (ES&amp;S founders) and Mike McCarthy (McCarthy Group founder) could conceivably have been involved in Franklin. Mike McCarthy would definitely sit on the boards of Omaha corporations that
         <em>
          were
         </em>
         linked to the Franklin scandal.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And suspicious deaths, commonly used to cover up deep state crimes, surround election fraud as well. There's Ray Lemme in 2003, who died from a staged suicide after investigating Clint Curtis's allegations of vote rigging software, and Mike Connell in 2008, who died in a plane crash before he could testify about the 2004 Ohio election.

       The exit polls were the primary piece of evidence. They've accurately indicated fraud in numerous past elections, so it's reasonable to assume they still would. However, some people (like Richard Charnin) did believe the exit polls were falsified to make it
       <em>
        look
       </em>
       like Hillary suffered from fraud, so I looked into that as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Charnin's argument
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CAVDEF/comments/5d5f3c/are_the_2016_unadjusted_exit_polls_correct/">
        is mathematically invalid
       </a>
       . The exit polls also show downticket Democrats, not just Hillary, doing better than reported. As a general rule, Republicans are the beneficiaries of election fraud, so even if they had a motive to fake Hillary's discrepancy, the downticket exit poll discrepancies are likely to be legitimate. If that's the case, it reinforces the exit poll discrepancies for Hillary, which often match the downticket ones. And comparing the exit poll's precinct sampling to the actual voter turnout indicates that if anything, Republican areas were weighted too heavily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, there were cumulative vote share graphs showing an uptick for Trump when they should flatten out, and counties in Wisconsin with

       I've read about numerous aspects: the exit poll discrepancies and the statistical proofs that they indicate vote rigging, GOP voter suppression tactics, SmarTech, Stephen Spoonamore, Michael Connell, the forensic audit by Richard Hayes Phillips, and Cliff Arnebeck's court case (King Lincoln Bronzeville v. Blackwell).

       The voter suppression was all the work of GOP election officials. Vote count rigging was a more complicated operation, involving the cooperation of:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Election contractors, like Diebold, ES&amp;S, and Triad, to rig central tabulators and voting machines.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         County election officials to manipulate paper ballots and cheat the recount.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         GOP operatives like Karl Rove and Michael Connell to organize the fraud, including the setup of an vote flipping man-in-the-middle with SmarTech.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So there is a fair amount of GOP involvement in there, but it may extend further. The election contractors have partisan ties to the GOP, but there are also links to the military-intelligence complex and deep state crime operations. And I read an
       <a href="http://www.intrepidreport.com/archives/5222">
        interesting piece
       </a>
       about how Mike Connell's vote rigging system might have been adapted from CIA election theft technology.

       Or the real false flag comes after monday. When "Russia loses the election" in the electoral college vote. Then we get a cyberattack that even the CFR is predicting and it hits the financial system. Then you get your NATO-Russia/China conflict clearly being set up. Take a look at the troop movements or missile defense systems. Romania, South Korea, NATO on the Russian border. Maybe research covert weapons systems the US has been building since WW2. If anybody thinks the US isn't prepared for a global conflict, they're in for an amazing surprise.

         Both parties are a different side to the same coin. The real people in power aren't freaking out about Trump winning. Most likely scenario is that he is their guy just like Obama was, presume to be the outsider of change and hope. Trump will be much more status quo than they realize. He will break their cherry like Obama broke a lot of early millennials. What's important about the election is the showing to the Globalists that we don't buy their Globalization, Open immigration, loss of freedom, and servitude to the rich.

        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The majority of people rejected hostilities with Russia. If they wanted war with Russia they would have voted Hillary. With the trust of the media so low it is impossible to stir up a war with Russia when the person in the white house ran on normalized relations with Russia.

       Meanwhile wall to wall war propaganda this Sunday morning on CBS ABC NBC FOX on what obama is going to do to the Rusians for exposing Hilary as the stupid, incompetent, lying, theiving, corrupt war criminal that she most certainly is. Of course this is fake, but if it were true we should sincerely thank the Russians. Are linsdly graham, mccaine, menendez, obama, brennan, carter and soros really starting a war with Russia in poland? These corrupt fools, who are owned by defense contractors, need prosecution to the fullest extent of the law for treason.

       Nah. They're probably using this, it's actually insignificant compared to other shit they have done like pizzagate, to try and get the public to trust msm again. A month from now the media is going to pretend to investigate and find that Russia didn't do the hack. Then the public will swallow all the pieces of shit the media pull out of their asses, again. Mission accomplish.

       Election hacking would almost certainly be done by voting system vendors and insiders in election offices, not remotely from Israeli satellites.

       Trump was one of the first people to ground zero that pushed the 9/11 story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump also claimed that 9/11 was an inside Job while running.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then,
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has recruited men and women that helped support the narrative that 9/11 was done by a group of Muslim terrorists and not an inside Job.

       deepstate eh?  I saw somebody saying they had been involved in a report on NSA interfering in CA, and were planning to publish soon.  No evidence given, but it wasn't a context given to making up that sort of thing.  (And if he was lying, we'll just never see any such report so I didn't care.)
