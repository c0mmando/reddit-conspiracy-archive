        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">90</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Sabremesh.html">Sabremesh</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So there has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5id53a/links_to_voat_are_now_being_shadowbanned_mods_can/db79s4e/?st=iwq2342k&amp;sh=50801689">considerable debate</a> about why (or indeed whether) voat/pizzagate links are being automatically removed from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>This prompted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/5igbw7/links_to_voat_are_now_being_shadowbanned/">further discussion in /r/undelete:</a></p>

<p>So, is this down to the admins, or down to the mods?</p>

<p>FACT: If you link to a specific voat/pizzagate comment in a reddit comment (eg <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1467888">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1467888</a>), it WILL be removed by automoderator as &quot;spam&quot; across reddit.</p>

<p>There are two solutions to stopping this: </p>

<p>a) the mods of a particular sub can tweak their Automod settings to override reddit site settings, and pre-approve /v/pizzagate comments, which is the set-up in <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>, and also (now that we know what&#39;s going on) what <a href="/u/creq">/u/creq</a> has sorted out for us in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>b) the mods can manually approve any individual reddit comment after it has been redirected to their modqueue, at which point the comment will become visible in the thread it was originally made in. This is what we have been doing in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> up until now.</p>

<p>However, there are a couple of exceptions, just to confuse things: </p>

<p>Generic links to pizzagate (eg <a href="http://www.voat.co/v/pizzagate">http://www.voat.co/v/pizzagate</a>) in a reddit comment, are not removed by Automoderator, so these should be visible straight away across reddit. This is why many people have been arguing that /v/pizzagate links are not banned. </p>

<p>Also, and somewhat confusingly, if you make a specific link to a voat pizzagate post in a reddit post title (eg <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5is6l6/pizzagate_fits_same_fact_pattern_as_penn_state/">like this</a>), it will also be visible automatically. </p>

<p>TLDR: The admins have classified /v/pizzagate links as spam, meaning they are automatically removed across reddit. The Automod config settings in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have now been amended by <a href="/u/creq">/u/creq</a> to override this.</p>

<p>If anyone has contrary or additional information about this, please feel free to share your thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for digging into this more to figure out what is going on. If you notice the second update to my thread that you linked, private messages with the Voat links were also being shadowbanned. However, the test link that I sent finally appeared today. Did somebody have to approve that message, or did someone change the filter settings? Also, wouldn&#39;t it be the admins who have control over private messages?</p>
