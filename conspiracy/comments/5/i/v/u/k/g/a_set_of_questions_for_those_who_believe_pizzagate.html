       Four sets of questions for pizzagate believers.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         What happened to the real evidence that the NYPD supposedly had and was going to leak?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gag orders come from judges, and the FBI don't just take cases from jurisdictions (refer to the faq on their website), so when is the NYPD going to leak the evidence you and others claim exist? In addition, obstruction of justice wouldn't be applicable as the party accused would have had to lie while speaking with investigators.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Considering pizzagate is now worldwide, why aren't the NYPD or FBI corroborating your claims? Why aren't they asking for anyone with public information to come forward like they would do in any investigation that is known to the public?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the FBI is doing an investigation, there is no doubt that the investigation will come into play in Welch's trial. So, why would the FBI charge Welch before their investigation is complete when that puts their investigation in jeopardy and could be brought up at trial
        </p>

       If they are going to do anything I suspect they will wait until after inauguration day, to avoid slippery pardons from the outgoing president. Its always a risk arresting anyone high profile at the end of a presidents term, doesn't matter who the president was.

       Well, the first problem with that being an answer is that a president can only pardon on the federal level. There is no way that if this is being investigated, that state charges wouldn't occur.  In addition, the FBI just doesn't come in and take a case (refer to the faw on their website.) And a person can't cite Welch's state charges being dropped because that was a matter of
       <em>
        location.

       True but any major arrest from the NYPD would be handed off the FBI as the crimes would have occured across multiple state lines and other charges may rest solely on the juristiction of the FBI (human trafficking for example). Additionally if the NYPD knows charges are pending from the FBI they wouldn't leak anything because a major leak like you are suggesting could compromise major evidence that could be used to indict mulltiple individuals (eg. Weiners emails).
      </p>
      <p>
       You are assuming the incumbant president or AG are not actually in communication with the FBI, NYPD and other authorities that might be involved. I am willing to bet that all involved agencies already know what his plans are and that they are keeping quiet until Jan 21.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a failure to act by March then I personally will assume a)no one has fuck all evidence or b) the President is a sell out. I'll personally start a thread here March 31 (please remind me) to state I've been a foolish idiot and all of my opinions were based in error and incorrect assumptions. I doubt I'll need to do that as there's too many groups in play here so if one doesn't act on somethig another will. I even suspect WL is holding off on leaks until safely after Jan 20.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally don't forget the outgoing president can pardon people for crimes "not yet charged for". There is 2 cases of precedant for this which I really can't be bothered looking up the source for.

      <p>
       Yet the NYPD has arrested no one. In addition, human trafficking doesn't rest solely on the FBI. This is why you can have multi state investigations and why a person can be charged for trafficking at a state level (refer to cases where pimps are sometimes charged with this).

      <p>
       Only that's not how this works. The FBI are looking at federal violations. The NYPD would be looking at state violations. Both are utilizing different statutes and the interpretation and applications are different. The two investigations are seperate. Again, refer to the FBIs own FAQ as proof of this.

       Why does the 21st matter if this is being investigated on a state level? No president can pardon anyone on the state level as his powers only apply to federal cases.

      <p>
       Ok, so I did. Here is what it says;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The FBI is a national security organization that works closely with many partners around the country and across the globe to address the most serious security threats facing the nation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...the investigative resources of the FBI and state and local agencies are often pooled in a common effort to investigate and solve the cases. In fact, many task forces composed of FBI agents and state and local officers have been formed...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, it can be assumed that when a multi-state investigation occurs (for example human trafficking) the FBI coordinates with state level and federal level agencies. So actually, it kind of
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also asked the following;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why does the 21st matter if this is being investigated on a state level? No president can pardon anyone on the state level as his powers only apply to federal cases. 
...
Not at a state level.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And you are 100% right. You reminded me that the pardon must occur at a state level, by the Governor. This got me looking into our friend Andrew Cuomo (D).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the NYPD and FBI be concerned about a pardon from Cuomo? Well.... this......
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         Cuomo joined the Clinton administration in 1993, when he was appointed Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). He was U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 1997 to 2001.
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Cuomo joined the Clinton administration in 1993
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah.. looks like the odds of a Cuomo pardon are pretty fuckin likely too. I suspect this may be the reason the NYPD are letting the feds run on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also might ask about the NY Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman (D). Well, his career involved partnership in 1987 with Kirkpatrick and Lockhart until elected in 1998 at Attorney General. Kirkpatrick and Lockhart, now known as K&amp;L Gates gained some notoriety in 2012 with their $1.29mil donation to the Democrats. I'm sure they made some donations during the 2016 election, but who knows how much? Either way, it looks like the NY AG is probably a no-go for successful prosecution either.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No one doubted that the FBI coordinates with those on the state level and other agencies. What is being doubted is that the FBI is taking over the investigation or that they have prohibited people from talking.
      </p>
      <p>
       A "common effort" simply means "catch the bad guy, indict, get a conviction, move on to the next." As stated before, federal charges often differ from state charges. So one is not going to sit on their hands if they want to bring charges while the other doesn't. Again, look at any court case within the last 10 years where a black man was shot and the feds looked into it as well as the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly, let's take a look at what you
       <em>
        left out
       </em>
       . I'll go ahead and bold it so we can focus on it. The following is taken from the FBI website:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If a crime is committed that is a violation of local, state, and federal laws, does the FBI “take over” the investigation?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Let's take a look at the answer:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         No. State and local law enforcement agencies are not subordinate to the FBI, and the FBI does not supervise or take over their investigations.
        </strong>
        Instead, the investigative resources of the FBI and state and local agencies are often pooled in a common effort to investigate and solve the cases. In fact, many task forces composed of FBI agents and state and local officers have been formed to locate fugitives and to address serious threats like terrorism and street violence.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, there you have it, straight from the horses mouth. The key words really are "their investigations." Those investigations stay their's because their investigation is at a state level and has nothing to do with federal statutes and the application and interpretation of them.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And you are 100% right. You reminded me that the pardon must occur at a state level, by the Governor. This got me looking into our friend Andrew Cuomo (D).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So why are people talking about a pardon?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Cuomo joined the Clinton administration in 1993
       </p>
       <p>

       That's straight from NY. How can he pardon her if she has yet to be convicted? That's the first thing needed for a pardon at the state level. And let's just say she were convicted, take a look at number 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, the odds of getting a pardon from Cuomo are
       <strong>
        zero
       </strong>
       . She would need to be convicted first and even then, it's a sex crime so there would be no pardon.
      </p>

        You also might ask about the NY Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman (D). Well, his career involved partnership in 1987 with Kirkpatrick and Lockhart until elected in 1998 at Attorney General. Kirkpatrick and Lockhart, now known as K&amp;L Gates gained some notoriety in 2012 with their $1.29mil donation to the Democrats. I'm sure they made some donations during the 2016 election, but who knows how much? Either way, it looks like the NY AG is probably a no-go for successful prosecution either.

      <p>
       I'll say this again, just like I have been saying since day one. It is foolish to believe that puppets of the global elite will arrest, indict and convict their puppet masters.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No. State and local law enforcement agencies are not subordinate to the FBI, and the FBI does not supervise or take over their investigations. Instead, the investigative resources of
        <strong>
         the FBI and state and local agencies are often pooled in a common effort
        </strong>
        to investigate and solve the cases.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which has been my point from the beginning. They are working together. The feds are not pursuing indictment to ensure the pardon doesn't happen, and the NYPD are playing ball with the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Governor's pardon I duly stand corrected. In this case I can only assume the NYPD are holding off to help the FBI. Either that, or the Attorney General may be stonewalling the arrest also. It happened at a federal level, so it's entirely possible the AG is could do it at state level.

       Who said that they aren't working together? What I am telling you, that you don't seem to grasp yet, is that they each bring their own type of charges. One brings federal charges. The other brings State charges. One is NOT dependent on the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is Dylann Roof who was convicted on federal charges this week. So that means the FBI did it's own investigation, fed charges were brought and he was convicted.
      </p>

       Now tell me what the following is:

       LMAO! SEE ABOVE. Roof = convicted on fed charges. Roof = not even tried yet on state charges.

       Ok, either you have selective reading, a reading comprehension problem or you are high. A federal pardon has
       <strong>
        nothing
       </strong>
       to do with a state pardon. You can be pardoned or offered clemency on the federal level but still answer to state charges (and vice versa). I gave you the case of Roof who was recently convicted on federal charges but set to stand trial on state charges in Jan. There is no blowing a load early, because, for the third time,
       <strong>
        THEIR INVESTIGATIONS ARE DIFFERENT, AND FEDERAL CHARGES ARE DIFFERENT FROM STATE. THE STATUTES ARE DIFFERENT, HOW THEY ARE INTERPRETED AND APPLIED ARE DIFFERENT AND, IN MANY CASES, EVEN THE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS ARE DIFFERENT.
       </strong>
       So, if we're to apply your bizarro world logic to reality, Roof wouldn't be on trial at a state level and it would all have happened at once, lol.

       Again, refer to the Roof case or
       <strong>
        ANY
       </strong>
       case where state and federal charges occurred. Weiner should be facing a grand jury soon. If they indict it will be up to the Feds and state to decide as he can actually be tried in North Carolina, where the victim is from. So this isn't a case of not moving forward, it's a case of where to get the most bang for the buck.

       Well, I think your resistance to the concept of pizzagate is evidence as to why they don't really need to melt the evidence quite yet. Here you are on reddit, in the conspiracy sub, and despite there being more evidence for a global pedophile conspiracy surrounding the Clintons than there is for the JFK assassination you continue to doubt and deny pizzagate. Ive seen you post
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       on this sub, and it's fairly consistently anti-pizzagate. Sure you are perfectly entitled to your own opinions, but the fact that you frequent this sub as much as you do indicates you have a predilection towards allowing for the possibility of the truth of conspiracy theories. Nevertheless you rally against pizzagate as strongly as you do. Now... imagine someone without that predilection to believe conspiracy theories, and what they would think about pizzagate with a fragment of the evidence you have at your disposal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the perps of the crime not worry about discovery and disposal of evidence? Precisely because people like you, and those less informed than you fight so strongly against it. They know you will protect them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also why did I post the link? Because someone bought a 1 year old boy for $8000 to rape and photograph and trade with others. Imaging what they could do with millions of dollars, and the media and members of the government actively protecting them.

       How do I have resistance to the concept of pizzagate when I'm writing a comic book series where a pedophile ring and gun running operation was run out of a cafe? Also, the first issue was completed
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       PG was even a thing. How am I resistant to the concept of pg when I mentioned a woman who claimed Hillary molested her as a child, mentioned the word "two-faced" (which deals with genital mutilation) and linked others to the story?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the woman who said she was molested by Hillary. I believe the people who said they were molested by the Bushs, Cheney, etc. See, I believe them because they weren't babbling on like idiots and the evidence they presented checked out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I post in many subs and topics. I've never said PG should not be investigated. What I've consistently stated are: 1. It's foolish to believe that
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       something is going on, that puppets of the global elite will arrest, indict and convict their puppet masters and 2. That even
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       the CJ system were not corrupt, that the so called evidence would not be enough for a warrant, charging document and conviction by trier of fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       No video, no audio, no ledgers, no images, etc. No one who has posted in this forum, or any other forum, has shown anything like it or even said they forwarded it to those they
       <em>
        claim
       </em>
       are investigating it. The pieces of shit in the link you provided were convicted based on tangible evidence. They had video of a crime. They had images showing a crime. Any
       <strong>
        evidence of a crime
       </strong>
       in PG? If so, what is the evidence of a
       <strong>
        crime
       </strong>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let me address that protection bullshit because you're going left field. Listen, I'm not the one who was in this forum saying he would give Trump a pass if he molested and raped so long as he brought others to justice. That was a PGer. I'm not the one who said "all they're doing is jacking off to images." That was another poster. So I don't know where
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       get this "protection" idea from when I'm simply using critical thinking and examination to form a logical assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if someone could by a child and rape and record it, and get convicted on it, where is the evidence in PG? Where is that same type of evidence? And guess what, if you have billions in dollars you know what you can do? Squash the story exactly how they did in the cases of the allegations against the Bushs, Cheney, etc.

       Seven fucking years. Think about that. A pedophile internet ring with 70,000 subscribers.  At least SEVEN FUCKING YEARS it took to catch the cunts who purchased a baby for the sole purpose of fucking. Two guys, working out of their California home, who traveled around the pacific and accumulated 25,000 images and 65
       <strong>
        hours
       </strong>
       of video footage and it took
       <strong>
        seven years
       </strong>
       to catch them. Just what the fuck do you think the resources the Clintons and DNC and RNC would have to bring to a defense of cover-up if the allegations of pizzagate are true?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're sitting there behind a keyboard and drawing table pontificating about the illegitimacy of this because the authorities aren't laying out specifically what evidence they have for
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       to make a judgement on. The FBI (or anyone else) hasn't even confirmed an investigation beyond
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       they are looking at with the Clinton Foundation. When the fuck do you think videos is going to appear??? Let me answer that for you,
       <strong>
        After charges are laid
       </strong>
       and as I've been saying since the start those won't happen until next year.
      </p>
      <p>
       What evidence is there video and emails even exist? Maybe we could ask Virginia Roberts who says Epstein had his entire house wired for video specifically to blackmail people. Considering she was getting fucked by men twice her age and slapped around by Epstein she might be a pretty fuckin reliable source.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the evidence of a
       <em>
        crime
       </em>
       ? I don't know. I'm not in on the investigation myself and wasn't able to partake in the raid on Weiners house or the DNC offices, or Epsteins house, or anything else. Unfortunately I'm also not able to check up on any of the wiretaps they probably have either. If they aren't sending me in the info I'm pretty sure they aren't going to send it to the guy writing the comic book either. But let me know if you get something, k?

       As for your overly defensive reply to the whole

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And now I'll explain it.
       <strong>
        You
       </strong>
       have the entire sub to view, and read, and knowledge of all of the other incidents which have occurred over 30 years.

       Someone who

       <strong>
        That

       is the protection the perps rely on. If someone had told me six months ago that there was a conspiracy theory that Washington elite were trading and trafficking children for the purpose of rape and power manipulation, and that the MSM and government were complicit in the practice I would have though "What the fuck mate?" . Now, having researched as much as I have I've come to believe that the situation is far graver than just some pizza guy fucking a few kids in a pizza shop. I think Alefantis is a blip on the radar who got sloppy with cover up and that's about it. I personally believe the problem is way deeper than simply Comet Ping Pong.

       See, this is the bullshit I'm talking about. The FBI hasn't confirmed anything yet you pizzacrusters went full dummy retard based off your own interpretations of shit. Then when those operating in the realm of logic and reason say "wait a minute", you start hurling accusations. I mean take a look at you and the moron who deleted his post. Both of you stay typing falsehoods and are the poster boys for wrong answers. So it's fair for you all to say this or that but it's wrong for me to show you, from the horses mouth, that the delays you guys are talking about is complete bullshit? There is no possibility of obstruction of justice. There is no pardon at a state level. There is no gag order. So where the
       <strong>
        fuck
       </strong>
       is the evidence you all said the FBI had and why aren't the FBI or NYPD corroborating anything? In fact, the majority of people who did endorse it have started to shy away from it. That shill AJ, Ronald Trump or whoever he is, etc.

       Well, the FBI twitter account has posted some odd details that seem to fan the flames of this investigation. As others have pointed out, your questions could be answered by the fact that the FBI's investigation is ongoing and they're not willing to release any details yet. On the flip side, you could be absolutely correct. If we don't see any developments over the next 6 to 12 months, then I think it's safe to say that nothing will happen. All we can do for the time being is be patient

       Ok, you guys are focused on the FBI but what about the NYPD? Again, if they found something that investigation wouldn't stop. The FBI doesn't just come in and yank an investigation away from the state. Again, refer to the FBIs own website and their FAQ as they plainly state they
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, what happened to the evidence the NYPD was supposed to have and when are they going to leak it? Why isn't the NYPD corroborating any of the PG claims?

       I'm not a lawyer, so I won't pretend to know the nuances of how jurisdiction is established or how the FBI can intervene in cases. But could you provide a link to the FAQ? I'll take a look at it and see if I can come up with any rebuttals.

      <p>
       We do know, however, that the CIA has intervened in investigations and shut them down. One example is the Franklin coverup. A government agency (I can't remember which one) was investigating the Watchers and their involvement in child trafficking, but the CIA came in, confiscated the evidence, and put a gag order on the investigation

       The CIA? Yes, they did shut down that case with the watchers. I read the leaked document on that one myself, even commented on it when someone posted it again. However, the problem with this is the CIA didn't shut down the investigation of the laptop and people were saying the Feds are on it.

       Thanks for the link. I guess I would highlight this portion from their statement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Instead, the investigative resources of the FBI and state and local agencies are often pooled in a common effort to investigate and solve the cases. In fact, many task forces composed of FBI agents and state and local officers have been formed to locate fugitives and to address serious threats like terrorism and street violence.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Thus, even though the FBI doesn't completely take over the case, they do often perform joint-investigations. So in the case of Weiner's laptop, I would assume they're working together. It would make sense for this joint-investigation to not release any details that could compromise the larger investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

       Again, the two (fed and state) have different laws/statutes, different statue of limitations, different sentencing rules, etc. You had joint investigations recently when several black males were killed and the state and Feds looked into it. However, in those cases you saw the release of information or findings at different times and no one was thrown under the bus for talking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, there is nothing to prohibit the NYPD from releasing anything, holding a press conference, etc. Their investigation, even if it's a pooled investigation is their own investigation.

       But that doesn't negate the possibility of what I mentioned. And elite pedophile rings (assuming they're true) and the Clinton Foundation are quite a different beast than a few murders.

       So if it's a an elite pedophile ring, why would you expect for those who have shown time and time again that they serve the elite, to arrest, indict and convict them of this type of crime?

       One of the dumbest accusations I've ever encountered on reddit. but please readers, take a look at my post history and go to when I first made a thread in this sub over a month ago. After you do that, take a look at my history in the relationship sub, the HELLDIVERS sub (great game by the way), the PS4 sub and hell my own sub (which is a gateway to an ARG). Oh yeah, also take a look at my recent postings in the whereisassange sub. Here is a highly upvoted post of mine in that sub:

         The NYPD stuff could have been a false rumour. But I think it's more likely that someone doesn't have the guts yet.

         I believe the FBI and NYPD are both corrupt at the top. A pyramid power structure, with the most corrupt people at the top. James Comey admitted that Hillary Clinton said false information to the FBI on many occasions. And yet she stayed free as a bird. Other people have been prosecuted just for lying.

         Welch is a trained actor, he's been in many previous productions. Welch was involved in a propaganda psy-op,
         <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2625901/">
          http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2625901/
         </a>
         Just like Luis Burbano was playing a part in the Orlando shooting in June. It's bizarre. The FBI are not interested in Welch, they just want to get him out of the way, he has done his job for the corrupt.

       Thanks for the link. I guess I would highlight this portion from their statement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Instead, the investigative resources of the FBI and state and local agencies are often pooled in a common effort to investigate and solve the cases. In fact, many task forces composed of FBI agents and state and local officers have been formed to locate fugitives and to address serious threats like terrorism and street violence.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Thus, even though the FBI doesn't completely take over the case, they do often perform joint-investigations. So in the case of Weiner's laptop, I would assume they're working together. It would make sense for this joint-investigation to not release any details that could compromise the larger investigation into the Clinton Foundation.
