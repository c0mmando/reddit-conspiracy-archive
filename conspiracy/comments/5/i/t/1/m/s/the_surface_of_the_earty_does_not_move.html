Go to your local natural history museum and the odds are that you will see a &quot;Focault Pendulum.&quot;  That&#39;s one of the best tools for both demonstrating and measuring the rotation of the earth.</p>

<p>So now that we have proven that the Earth is moving, we can say that Michelson-Morley, Lorentz, and Hammar&#39;s experiments conclusively disprove the existence of &quot;Luminous Aether.&quot;</p>

<p>Motherfuckers tried to prove the existence of this ether for literally decades, but none were successful.</p>

<p>tldr:  It <strong>did not</strong> &quot;fail to detect the movement of the earth which was already assumed to be true.&quot;  It failed to detect &quot;ether.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, I hadn&#39;t heard of that before.</p>

<p>Looks like most of the evidence you&#39;re referring to came in the 50s.  More modern experiments in the early 2000s found a similar phenomenon on a few occasions, but nothing conclusive.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting that the anomalies are <strong>sometimes but not always detected</strong>, even using much more sensitive equipment than the pendulum.  Looks like this one is still up for debate, but this so-called &quot;Allais effect&quot; may be proven or dis-proven next year when a big ol eclipse cuts across the USA.</p>

<p><a href="https://briankoberlein.com/2015/03/22/the-pendulum-of-truth/">https://briankoberlein.com/2015/03/22/the-pendulum-of-truth/</a></p>

<p>Either way, this anomaly in no way affects the observed rotation of the earth.  You asked to be &quot;proved wrong&quot; in your statement that earth does not move.  I think I&#39;ve done that.</p>

<p>Are you ready to accept that earth does, in fact, rotate?</p>

<p>I looked at the site.  None of the evidence is reputable.  The experiments are too vague to be reproduced.  Can you not provide evidence outside of that one shady source?</p>

<p>Also Socrates says the earth seen from above is like a ball.  He says we are not &quot;inside&quot; of the ball, he says we are living in the cracks, or &quot;hollows.&quot;  He says space is the true heaven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I&#39;m asking for sources, and all I&#39;m getting are vague allusions to weak arguments housed on one website.</p>

<p>Show me legitimate evidence or provable physical phenomenon and I&#39;m on board.</p>

<p>Creative interpretations of old maps is not evidence.  Creative reading of ancient philosophical texts is not evidence.  Creative reading of failed experiments from the 50s is not evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open, you just have to bring me some actual factual evidence.  Surely if we lived on the interior wall of gigantic sphere, which contained not only the sun and moon, but the stars, galaxies, and meteors that we see in the sky then there would be some super basic ways to demonstrate it right?</p>

<p>You know the super high sky dive that was sponsored by red bull recently?</p>

<p>When Felix Baumgartner was up there, he stated that all he saw of the sky was entirely pitch black. Apparently stars are only visible from the lower atmosphere. Because science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Felix Baumgartner is exactly right.  Read a book about the SR-71 test flights, or really any experimental high-altitude flying in the 60s and 70s, the pilots say the same thing: you can&#39;t see stars from the edge of space.</p>

<p>Also, Baumgartner&#39;s video clearly shows a round earth before he jumps!!  If you&#39;re going to cherry pick quotes, you should use sources that don&#39;t directly contradict this &quot;concave earth&quot; business.</p>

<p>Look here, none of the arguments or evidence I have presented come from the &quot;government.&quot;  They come from papers published by scientists in peer-reviewed journals whose results have been summarized and detailed in open-source websites like wiki-leaks and google scholar.</p>

<p>The US government has zero to do with Focault&#39;s Pendulum, zero to do the Michelson-Morely experiments, zero to do with private satellite-imagery providers.</p>

<p>My evidence of the nature of the planet is literally thousands of books, photographs, experiments, and videos from airplanes, satellites, balloons, and rockets that consistently demonstrate the reality of our physical planet.  My evidence also includes going to a beach and watching ships disappear of the horizon, watching the sun set, and observing the accurate models used too demonstrate moon phases and seasonality.</p>

<p>Many pictures from space <strong>are not</strong> owned by the government.  No body of space-censoring officials form the CIA approves every single photograph of our round planet taken from a private satellite or GoPro strapped to a model rocket.</p>

<p><em>My evidence</em> is massive, widespread, and comes from quite literally thousands of sources.  <em>Your evidence</em> is one website which specializes in old and mistranslated documents as well as &quot;experiments&quot; preformed by completely anonymous and unverifiable sources.</p>

<p>The burden of proof is on you bud.  And so far you&#39;ve come up with nothing.</p>

<p>Plate tectonics is a theory rather than a law (i.e. it is an <em>explanation</em> of observations, rather than an observation itself) but it is a theory which very well explains a number of phenomena including: </p>

<p>1) The creation of volcanoes and why the exist where they do. For example, the crust sometimes moves over mantel &quot;hotspots&quot; which periodically become active, creating chains of volcanic islands which predictably go from &quot;new&quot; to &quot;old&quot; in the direction of plate movement. An example is Hawaii.</p>

<p>2) The creation of mountains and why the exist where they do, i.e. at boundaries between converging continental plates. </p>

<p>3) &quot;sea floor spreading&quot;, i.e. the manner in which the ocean floor regenerates itself at boundaries between divergent oceanic plates. This also explains why the magnetic polarity of the sea floor is an alternating striped pattern: the earth&#39;s magnetic field reverses from time to time so each stripe is generated at the current polarity.</p>

<p>4) Earthquakes also occur at plate boundaries, when plates rub side by side against each other.</p>

<p>5) Similarities in the fossil records on continents which were previously attached (e.g. South America and Africa).</p>

<p>etc. </p>

<p>So unless your &quot;doesn&#39;t move&quot; theory better explains those or some other phenomenon, I&#39;m not buying it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. To think that we don&#39;t live on a globe seems insane. It&#39;s one of the most fundamental beliefs we have as humans.<br/>
But, there&#39;s experimental evidence that shows we actually live on a flat plain.<br/>
It&#39;s perhaps the ultimate conspiracy theory.<br/>
Because if these real-world experiments are to be believed, then it means that everything we&#39;ve been taught is a lie. That the world map we know is incorrect. That the Antarctic is a wall of ice encircling the land masses. That the Sun and the Moon are not where or as described. That the stars, galaxies, universe are not as described.<br/>
And so on and so forth..   </p>

<p>It&#39;s the proverbial Alice in Wonderland rabbit hole. That the Jesuits/Masons/Satanists have created a global deception for the last 500 years in an attempt to convince us that the earth is a speck of dust in a vast unknown of space instead of the only thing there is. That evolution is real. That there is no God et cetera...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to believe anymore.<br/>
I used to be an arrogant atheist. I had faith in science and didn&#39;t believe anything that couldn&#39;t be proven.<br/>
And in my arrogance I just accepted the same common assumptions as everyone else does.<br/>
But there are some very troubling proofs that should not be possible if we live on a globe as we all assume we do.<br/>
Some very simple experiments provide evidence that directly contradict a globe earth.<br/>
And, once cognitive bias is overcome, it just opens a Pandora&#39;s Box of questions.<br/>
So, I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s so much purposeful disinformation out there that it&#39;s very difficult to be sure of anything.<br/>
I think therefore I am.<br/>
But then again, we almost certainly live in a simulated holographic matrix universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simulated idea is an interesting one for sure.  Thanks for your response, I&#39;ll take a peak at that info.  </p>

<p>Quick question.  What could be done to prove that idea?  I think of all the videos I&#39;ve seen of astronauts in space and all the video there, how or what would show that to be false or manipulated?  </p>

<p>Would the Russians withhold that information as well?  Like, if they have their own space program and they found something different, what would keep them from spilling the beans?</p>
