       Saw at least 6 different low flying military aircraft in Chicago today. Not the kind that come into town when Obama is here or the kind that do flyovers. Very scary, big, all blacked out airplanes.

       I can't stop thinking about it, anybody else notice this in their cities?

       There was some reported yesterday here... and some in NYC widely covered a few days before that... I'd guess they are tracking some sort of signals? I'm not techy enough to know... but cracked of all folks were talking about the spoofing and honeypotting and cell/wifi blocking government planes were doing.

       I saw a black military helicopter with double propellers fly right over top of me the other day. Found it kind of alarming as I definitely don't see that shit around here, but can't really say whether it's part of any larger pattern.

       In St. Louis, helicopters doing strange circles, like they're going over the city in a grid pattern. Not news choppers, but black, and they have large sensors attatched to their landing gear. Very obvious. I got pictures.

       I've seen unusually air traffic all over the north suburbs of Chicago lately. This past summer we had loads of helicopters. I assume something DARPA related. Also this summer it seemed like a lot of local homeless were disappearing from their regular hangouts.

       I JUST said that about the lack of homeless in Chicago and not in a good maybe they've gone on to find shelters or warming centers way but definitely a *where *are *they *putting *them way.

       The helicopters were noticeable almost every where I went. Even going outside has this Erie feeling- it's been hanging around this area for quite some time now. I bartend and I'm usually coming home around 3am (it's against policy for us to drink at work) and that's when I see the crazy stuff around here. The other day a billboard on 90/94 was frozen and the only visible word blinking was  "DIE" instead  of diet.

       I did take a picture while driving because it was so low. Checked our local news feeds and turned up with nothing.

       The fucked up thing is this wasn't even DOWNTOWN Chicago this is a suburb 30 minutes out. For the longest time I thought they were building or hiding something in this property that runs along the highway sound barrier walls that's surrounded with 30 feet tall  electrical fences that's tucked neatly behind a 3 mile wall of hills and tons of trees. I used to watch military helicopters all last summer Disappear in broad daylight into that high security property. Every time i visit my mom there seems to be some sort of Erie feeling when I pass it. Saw a military hummer  leaving it once

       Which direction? Also a lot of municipal airports. Sometimes they serve as fuel pit-stops or overnight parking for out of the norm stuff. I occasionally see small helicopters go to KUGN, and they have ultra-low contrast markings - if any at all. Basically blacked out. But there's a ICE/DHS trailer in the south lot. Yet the way they fly patterns, I don't think there's much to worry about unless you're growing some weed or cooking meth in your garage.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way KUGN hosts airshows, so it's possible for military aircraft to land there just fine. The main runway is also long enough to land a 737, even though I've never seen one operate from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another airport that probably does this stuff is Chicago Business Center in Wheeling. That's even bigger than KUGN. O'Hare and Midway also do stuff with military reserve flights, but seems the outer airports see more activity with the more "odd" things as they're away from all the high-volume commercial traffic.

       Wheeling is about 35-40 minutes north of where I was. I was about 20 minutes west of the Chicago loop. They all seemed to be flying west towards the city. I'm
Pretty familiar with both major Chicago airports and their flight patterns. For example at my moms house sometimes when the visibility is low or the winds are strong they change the flight path and the planes will come in low and clip a sharp right towards midway. My friend lives about
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       5 minutes  from ohare so you can't miss the flight paths there.
      </p>
      <p>
       These all seemed incredibly out of place and startling. I'm not growing weed- maybe just watching a lot of YouTube videos  about kanyes clones and clicking Reddit link conspiracies. Could it be that Jackie killed JFK video I watched? LOL, it's just odd all together. Been reading up on the New York sitings- maybe it's all to throw us off. Things just seem strange even when I went outside just now things don't feel right

       Yeah. Military style aircraft aren't typically common here. So I've made the blog posts about time and location when I see them along with aircraft type when I can identify them. I bet they luuurve that kind of offside intel being on-record. Not that it really indicates what they're doing, but that something is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow sometimes odd stuff has a less involved side-story. I've seen a small collection of random and mostly foreign military aircraft show up outside any scheduled airshow, and depart in a rather showy fashion. Turns out they were contracted as part of an exercise training reservist pilots. Dig a little, maybe get a tail number, and then find out what's behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But of course there could be stuff going on that's nefarious too. Since they're obviously not dropping stuff or blowing things up... No way to really tell, unless you have hardware setup to see what they could be doing to stuff like radio-based communications. Even then you'd need a lot of people working at this in any attempt to pin down what they're doing.

       And in regards to this kind of stuff... I wonder if there's a MUFON-style site to report activity and location of unmarked aircraft? Something that mirrors the style of the UFO site, but with ways of tracking aircraft types (along with ID picture lists) and their comings and goings associated with dates and times.

       I have, turns out to be just a very rough terrain with hills/ditches, a running road and a trench of water before the giant drop off  that runs along the golf course

       Almost looks that way- To be honest I got hooked on this site when the Bowie conspiracies started up. It wasn't until more recently that I started posting my own findings. I'm not sure how to attach a picture but I do have a saved screenshot of the land I'm talking about. How can I send it to you?

       Yup. Since the elections, I've had helicopters, jets, drones and UFOs circling my neighborhood basically nonstop. I live next to an airforce base though.

       I've noticed it too. A couple weeks ago one went over my apartment and it was so loud, my girlfriend and I thought a plane was crashing. We're close to O'Hare so the planes never bother us but holy shit those double propeller helicopter/plane things are loud as fuck when they fly low.

       We're probably pretty close to each other then. When this first started with the helicopters my friend brought it up that they seemed to be more active at night- one night out of boredom I searched "helicopter" on Twitter. People were talking about sighting these all over the country around the same time from California to Texas to Utah- they all described the helicopters the same way. Scary times
