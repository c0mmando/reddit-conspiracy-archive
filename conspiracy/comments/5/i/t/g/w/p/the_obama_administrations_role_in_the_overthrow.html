       By now, most people on this board are aware of the role of the Obama government in toppling Assad and fostering the rise of ISIS. To say that "Obama created ISIS" is perhaps too simplistic, but the actual truth is no less damning. I've made this post, partly to organize my own notes on this subject, but also to seek other references and hopefully reach people who are unaware of the facts and balk at allegations that the US has been involved in any way in the rise of ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, the plans to topple Assad's government in Syria were not laid by Obama's administration. They are part of a long-term project to maintain control of the region and the petrodollar regime—basically the "neoconservative agenda" spelled out in the "Project for a New American Century".
      </p>

      <p>
       And how would the overthrow of Assad be orchestrated? Obama has wished, or sought to create the impression that he wished, to avoid direct military engagement in Syria. Whether for political concerns, to avoid appearing to be a warmonger, or because of a misguided belief that his chosen method of indirect engagement would be somehow more ethical or less brutal, is hard to determine exactly. But here is some mainstream coverage of the reasoning shaping the Obama administration's policy on removing Assad:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-obama-war-idUSBRE97U0AP20130831">
        http://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-obama-war-idUSBRE97U0AP20130831
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What's important, though, is that Obama
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       following through with the PNAC agenda. And the chosen method of engagement, instead of direct military invasion, was
       <em>
        subversion
       </em>
       through the orchestration of the State Department, the CIA, and regional allies, especially Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_involvement_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_involvement_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       To implement the regime change operation, the first stage was to orchestrate "dissidents" through CIA and State Department sponsored NGOs. To fuel the necessary anti-Assad propaganda campaign, it is first necessary to create the impression that there is a "grassroots" uprising ready to burst out. It should be acknowledged that Assad is not so benevolent a leader that he could not inspire legitimate dissidents, but the fact that mass protest movements were orchestrated was established by leaked cables:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-syria-wikileaks-idUSTRE73H0E720110418">
        http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-syria-wikileaks-idUSTRE73H0E720110418
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The next stage was to enact a false flag attack that would tarnish Assad's reputation and provide the pretext of legitimacy for the insurrection that would bring about his removal. Of course, adhering to its policy of avoiding direct involvement, US intelligence orchestrated the gas attack against the protesting dissidents that it helped to put in place by relying on its foreign allies:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And now the "rebels" enter the scene. But only
       <em>
        moderate
       </em>
       rebels, of course, a phrase chosen no doubt because it causes the reader to imagine there are some tea-sipping British Labor voting type armed insurgents ready to bring about a democratic "Arab Spring" in Syria. Nevermind that some of the principal fighting groups being sponsored are affiliates of Al Qaeda:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_groups_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_groups_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there is ISIS. Who created ISIS? In a sense, it's a pointless discussion. Movements like ISIS, like any ideological movement, have antecedents in other movements. According to the conventional view, which we'll stick to here, its "founder", Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was a member of Al Qaeda that led the faction of it that would become ISIS. A better question is who pays to arm ISIS, who provides it with intelligence, and who protects it? While ISIS can generate its own revenue to some extent, it would not have been able to operate without funding, principally from Saudi Arabia and Qatar:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_ISIL">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_ISIL
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, some of John Podesta's leaked emails confirmed what we already knew there, showing that Hillary Clinton (and implicitly, everyone else privy to the same intelligence knowledge she had) knows that the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5469">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5469

        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1828
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But, some may say, that does not mean that the Obama administration knew about or sanctioned this funding of ISIS. And to that, I would say there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       evidence they knew, as Michael Flynn former DIA Director explains in the following interview. But I would also add that assuming that US intelligence was not aware that its allies were funding ISIS is naive, and there's every reason to believe that it's exactly what they wanted because it would help to achieve their goal of toppling Assad. All we're missing is hard evidence of direct involvement of US intelligence with ISIS, but there are clues of that too:

      <p>
       Thus are the origins of the Syrian "Civil War", which brought death and destruction to scores of innocent Syrians and launched the great migration. This humanitarian disaster has not only destroyed this country's people and infrastructure, its consequences have placed Europe's security in jeopardy, have propelled the undoing of the EU, and are likely to lead to violence there before all is finally settled.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for what? I thought it ironic that some people had been criticizing Trump's pick of Rex Tillerson of Exxon-Mobil, as a demonstration that Trump is getting ready to run the government for big oil—
       <em>
        ironic because it has been that way all along
       </em>
       . Indeed, the Exxon-Mobil deal with Russia was nixed by Obama, who instead chose to sponsor the Saudi-Qatar pipeline that would need to
       <em>
        run through Syria
       </em>
       . Leaked cables again show that it was precisely when Assad refused to allow the pipeline to plow through Syria that the plans to topple him were set in motion:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Was reducing Europe's reliance on Russian oil and catering to Middle Eastern allies by toppling the Syrian government and plunging it into war the more ethical approach? Now that the project has failed, I wonder how it can possibly be justified at all.

But its a topic that has been public knowledge for some time but only twice have I seen it spelled out. Once by Assange and once by Greenwald on The Intercept. The reason we can trust this politician in this case is because it is verifiable and documented. If not actually spelled out until just now by Rep. Gabbard.

       Its necessary to point out that the significance of this email is not what it literally states, obviously the US would rather limit ISIS' influence in the region. The context is that the US knew that Saudi Arabia was arming ISIS when the

       You can decide that this isnt actually treasonous. But you should know that this comes as close as any Presidential Candidate has ever got to crossing that line. Chances are that if you disagree about Clinton or Kerry or Obama's culpability in this matter, you would have said Reagan and Oliver North were Traitors if you were asked 5 years ago.

        ISIS was armed with American Weapons

       report it says (Pg. 20, 21):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is also likely that some of the small arms in IS’ possession – such as an M4 carbine-style Bushmaster X15E2S manufactured in the USA and documented in IS’ arsenal entered Iraq with private security companies during the US occupation and found their way into Iraqi arms markets.

         secret US intelligence report

        , written in August 2012, which uncannily predicts – and effectively welcomes – the prospect of a “Salafist principality” in eastern Syria and an al-Qaida-controlled Islamic state in Syria and Iraq. In stark contrast to western claims at the time, the Defense Intelligence Agency document identifies al-Qaida in Iraq (which became Isis) and fellow Salafists as the “major forces driving the insurgency in Syria” – and states that “western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey” were supporting the opposition’s efforts to take control of eastern Syria.

       to clarify a few things:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Clinton openly criticized the Saudi, Qatari, and Kuwaiti governments for failing “to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations.” Her newly released 2014 email goes a step further, directly attributing support for ISIS to the Saudi government.

       The US created the Refugee Crisis in Europe by knowingly arming ISIS and is why

      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: State Department skirts along the definitions of Treason by knowingly selling weapons to people that are arming enemies of the US. This has created a destabilized Middle East that in turn caused a mass emigration to Europe that has also contributed to Brexit and may lead to the dissolution of the EU and NATO according to the Prime Minister of France and several key members of NATO, including Turkey - the 4th largest military in the world.

       Since the Podesta Leak in October, Rep. (and Veteran) Tulsi Gabbard has introduced
       <a href="https://gabbard.house.gov/news/press-releases/video-rep-tulsi-gabbard-introduces-legislation-stop-arming-terrorists">
        a bill to make this kind of thing explicitly illegal

       . And to add to that, here is the spin NPR put on the bill:

       as if the legislation isnt in direct response to the State Department actions regarding ISIS.
