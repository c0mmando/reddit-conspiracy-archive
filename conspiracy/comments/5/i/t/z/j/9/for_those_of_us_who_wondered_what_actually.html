sorry, i&#39;m a bit drunk but what she says makes a lot of Paul family stuff make sense. i live near Rand Paul&#39;s constituency so this is kinda a deal for me. with Rand Paul i kept wondering. why was he flip-flopping? i watched his rise to Senator on a local level of seeing it. i&#39;m sure this is old news to r/conspiracy. for newbies like me who have only recently awakened this is how it works. i would be very curious to hear from ye elder wiser conspiracy persons what THEY have on him. or were the the Paul family controlled opposition all along? tyvm for whatever you have to teach me. wisdom is the greatest weapon. </p>

<p>My theory is that Rand, being younger and somewhat &quot;up and coming&quot; in popularity, was hit before he had the chance to even compete. He was a threat because of his own views, but worse, his father&#39;s run definitely fueled attention onto him. So, before he ever had the chance to have a chance, he was knocked out.</p>

<p>Kind of like how they shot down JFK Jr.&#39;s plane over Martha&#39;s Vineyard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I also don&#39;t think Rand has quite the same set of morals as his father. I don&#39;t hold him as in quite high of esteem. </p>

<p>I also want to add that the way they pushed out Ron Paul was that he was the head of the Tea Party movement, which at the time was a very legitimate movement. Then the Koch Brothers funded Sarah Palin, and she became the new face of the Tea Party, which made it look insane and eventually it actually became that way, and they pushed Ron Paul out of the spotlight and stole the word &quot;Libertarian&quot; right out of his hands and spun it in to this Corporatist fantasy that divided the movement. To this day, Libertarianism is split between right-libertarianism (Koch Brothers and Sarah Palin) and left-libertarianism (Ron Paul and Noam Chomsky) and the right-libertarians have much more influence and money because they wanted to push out the left-libertarians because they were a genuine threat to the establishment. </p>
