    <div class="md"><p>sorry for long reply</p>

<p>I think they actually prefer professional psychopathy to run a portion of society (pays well, keeps cash flowing, keeps psychos busy and using prisons, big pharma, mental institutions as assets, creating manchurian candidates) they go after lot of people with artistic, scientific or social talent to control their influence on society and sometimes plagiarize their work. On a more spiritual side I heard it&#39;s like creating synchronicities for the dark side, the aim is basically control over others. Only before time when everyone&#39;s labeled a &#39;target&#39;. Scary times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The goals of Predatory Gangstalking of an individual are numerous. Predatory 
Gangstalking is intended to deprive someone of their freedoms and rights. It destroys a person&#39;s privacy and control of their own environments. It is intended to create distress, disrupt all relationships, deplete person&#39;s resources, destroy one&#39;s physical and mental health, and inflict great overall long term suffering. They interfere with a target&#39;s sleep thereby producing chronic sleep deprivation, as a strategic tactic. They employ a variety of interactions with the targeted individual which are likely to produce accidents and various forms of illness. One of the main weapons they use for their own protection and to enable their success in gangstalking is to manipulate the target&#39;s life in such a way as to cause them to lose their credibility with others. This is usually the first objective reached. After that, gangstalking the target involves only minor risk. Notably, people who become involved generally stop caring about the abuse by either turning a blind eye or actively joining in. While others, though concerned for the target, become too frightened to speak out or come to believe the propoganda that the target is mentally ill and needs ‘this‘ help.</p>

<p>Predatory Gangstalking also involves provoking &quot;accidents&quot; and consequences of harm to the target. Predatory Gangstalkers will surrounding a target&#39;s moving vehicle and attempting to force them off of the road when they are stressed and exhausted.</p>

<p>Worse, these tactics will be employed after tampering with a targeted individual&#39;s vehicle. Predatory Gangstalking is very serious business. Predatory Gangstalking is, at the least, psychological violence, and at most, it is a protracted sadistic sociopathic domination and calculated destruction of an innocent human being for reasons of pleasure, power, and social control by a group predatory stranger.</p>

<p>Aside from the gangstalking or street theater (which thankfully hasn&#39;t been so bad for me yet) I&#39;ve had fake relationships or relationships ruined by creating lies, property ruined or stolen, had my heart squeezed 20 times, heavy pressure under my scalp which could control my eye movement and cause forced speech, shown an eye of horus when I closed my eyes, induced a virtual reality dream (first person view and looked very real) of me being tied and stabbed in the throat, induced vibrations in legs or eyes for long periods, voice to skull tech of handler&#39;s voices or playing porn sounds in my ultra consevative muslim neighbors heads or of me laughing while walking behind some one and vise versa, voice of god tech, sexually stimulated and forced to cry like pushing a button, induced suicidal thoughts and feelings of extreme depression for couple months, tortured daily with directed energy weapons with feelings of needle pricks/hot needle/cramps/shocks/headaches (connected to a program that tortures me after certain activity like meditating, reading, drawing, posting online or people upvoting my posts, after certain emails, sometimes when strangers approach me outside or when people just look at me...n I&#39;m just 22 :/ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People calling targets mentally-ill online or sending strange/threatening messages happens to most targets, I&#39;ve just got a few weird messages and usual reddit shills ridiculing me I just ignore them</p>

<p>I&#39;m not 100% sure of all reasons for my targeting, it started about 5 years ago when I got woke and made a conspiracy facebook page for Iranians and started to meditate a lot. The attacks get a lot worse when I meditate a lot (scared half to death twice by what I believe were scary entity sounds but could&#39;ve been technology and induced needle prick feelings between sleep/awake state when lot of paranormal activity happens cuz I astral projected once and saw another reality) I&#39;m an alien contactee I think that&#39;s got something to do with it as well, Also I think they don&#39;t like my artistic talent and that I have a really good artist friend and we wanted to do a lot of good stuff for humanity...they made damn sure that doesn&#39;t happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find big lifestyle changes, feeling safe, living your fate or living life spontaneously helps, definitely weed, meditation, divination methods like i ching or tarot cards, chanting made up tones that sound nice, automatic writing, talking to yourself about whatever&#39;s on your mind, praying, repeating positive affirmations.  </p>

<p>The first time I contacted a being I was high and really in the mindset, did some weird hand gestures and I let my mind open to be influenced, I saw a tall Nordic in my mind&#39;s eye, we communicated in a made up language and relayed sensations of phrases (I heard my handlers at the same time being kinda pissed and mentioning that I could do automatic writing) I had to use some kind of verbal communication because that&#39;s how I&#39;m used to talking and it made it easier to communicate my feelings, he could show me gifs if I didn&#39;t understand something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had only one other experience and I read that I had astral projected, it was a very vivid dream right before waking up of a place with thousands of clear beings spiraling around red spheres, one came through like a frequency barrier, turned into a very beautiful human like being and stared and smiled at me for a few seconds. (This happened before the Nordic, about 2 years ago. I didn&#39;t want to mention it cuz we didn&#39;t talk but I&#39;m pretty sure it was a profound experience because at that time I had meditated and prayed A LOT and scary entity sounds/suicidal thoughts happened shortly after)  </p>

<p>I suppose it does get easier with practice, I heard brains are like telephones and consciousness is abundant in the universe, just have to learn to tune into the right frequency of the being you&#39;re trying to contact...I don&#39;t have too much experience with contacting sorry, most important things that worked for me were meditation and weed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sleep paralysis is the most terrifying thing I&#39;ve ever experienced. The situations sound so unbelievable when you look back on them, but when they are happening in your mind they feel absolutely real. I&#39;ve had monstrously tall, shrouded reapers dressed in black, face obscured and ghostly, float through my dead bolted-shut front door. </p>

<p>Time seems to freeze, and from across the room they telekinetically pull me to the floor and pin me to the ground. Feels like hundreds of pounds of force pushing me to the ground, but I&#39;m able to slowly look up and see them floating a millimeter a second towards me. I scream, but have no voice. I try to roll over, but can only wiggle like a fish seconds away from death. They slowly creep closer and closer and closer. Seconds feel like minutes, minutes feel like hours. Time doesn&#39;t seem to exist or matter anymore, as it&#39;s impossible to tell how long it has been happening and the only way it will stop is with your death. </p>

<p>As the reaper reaches me and looms down to end it, I wake up. In my bed, cat snuggled between my legs softly purring. </p>

<p>Anyways, how often do you smoke weed? Everyday, 24/7 kind of thing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d really like it to be a 24/7 kind of thing, recently I been having financial issues and can&#39;t afford too much few joints a week, maybe more sometimes. 2 years ago For about 5-6 months when I was meditating hours every day I had lot of weed luckily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So how did you realize you were being stalked? Was there one moment where it just hit you? You put the pieces together and were like, &quot;Oh shit, this is real. This is definitely not me being delusional or schizophrenic. This is actually happening.&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I forgot to mention another experience about 4 years ago I was awake laying towards the wall and I heard few footsteps walking towards me then loud digital sounds of different tones, I waited a few seconds cuz I didn&#39;t want to miss out on my first ET experience then got freaked out, when I turned nothing was there. After that (edit: few years later) I had the astral projection experience, entity sounds, v2k of a guy who said his name was George and shown an eye of horus when I closed my eyes. All this led me to keep digging for answers. I searched lots untill I finally saw a link about V2K then one about TI symptoms and it made me piece everything together and I recalled many instances of gangstalking. When I found out I been a TI for at least 4 years they started stalking me a lot then over 2 days induced pressure under my head, V2K of handlers, voice of god, squeezed my heart 20 times, spoke through me and induced a virtual reality dream of being stabbed which made me sure that I&#39;m a TI.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One time 2 guys stood right behind me in a store acting like they were talking to each other but saying things about my personal life, few times ppl have walked passed me acting to be talking on their phone and speaking loudly about me. Sometimes they&#39;ll try to help a TI in shitty ways after they&#39;ve fucked with their life as a joke, I told my friend on skype I wanted more friends and the same week I was spending a lot of time outside to waste their time, one day there was a man and a woman (who have made fun of me another time) talking to random people trying to get them to talk to me to make friends, just 2 guys (that were much older) had the guts they kept following me then said hi and I ignored them lol at the end the man and woman walked passed me looking at me like they were disappointed. One time I told my friend IN HER HOUSE that I want a boyfriend then there were way more guys saying flirty stuff as they&#39;d walk passed me, there were 2 guys (that I&#39;ve seen stalking me 3 times) hanging around a park I go to exercise I ignored them, one night 2 other guys passed looking at me I knew they were stalkers I just looked straight ahead and ignored them, one yelled &#39;she doesn&#39;t want a boy!&#39; the same night there were 2 women who walked passed me and called me lesbian then took out their phone out fast and looked at me a lot when they saw I was practicing to do a handstand to call ANOTHER guy with a tablet in his hands who was there the whole time thinking I was just walking, he came running and looked at me, did something on his tablet and we both left. One other time I was in a store and a guy I&#39;ve seen once before was just standing there the whole time with his phone in his hand just looking at me. They have their phones out a lot of the time I&#39;m not sure why, to keep in contact with each other or act like they&#39;re keeping tabs on me prolly.</p>

<p>One time a little while before I knew I was a TI there was a rlly creepy looking guy following me with his motorcycle in an empty street, and when I was a kid a few times one guy followed me home from school and showed me his dick once lol but idk if they were with them, sometimes I think everyone is under surveillance since birth and my targeting just spiked after my interest in conspiracies and aliens.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s all an illusion to make me think they&#39;re in control of my environment and make me paranoid, meh I just laugh it off and feel really bad for them...</p>

<p>There have been many stalkers but these were the ones that stood out most sorry for boring you with me stalking stories :P </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last week I was driving home from a friends house, I passed the shop and realised I need milk and other stuff.  Seeing a gap in traffic I kind of slammed on my breaks and did a u turn.  I was shocked to see a black bmw that was behind me, do a u turn also, almost crashing.  He followed me to the shops.  He parked far away from me.  When I came out of the shop I decided to walk past his car for a closer look.  As I got within 20ft he started the engine and sped off! </p>

<p>3 days ago driving home, noticed a black bmw again.  I took some really weird turns, small back roads and did a big loop.  Still behind me.  So I got into some traffic, waited for a red light,  jumped out and went to his window.  He stared straight ahead despite my banging on his window. 
He was white, and more or less normal looking. </p>

<p>Long storey short, he turned out to be my girlfriends ex.   Also turns out BMWs don&#39;t work with a gas tank full of my piss...
Poor guy</p>
