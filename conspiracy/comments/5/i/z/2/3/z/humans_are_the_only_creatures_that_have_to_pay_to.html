<p>I can buy about a thousand litres of clean, drinkable water for the cost of one hour of minimum wage.    </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not like they kick you off the planet if you can&#39;t pay your bills.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One could argue our Apex predator now comes in the form of debt collectors and law enforcement.</p>

<p>You may not be starving but in America alone, millions of kids go to bed hungry.</p>

<p>Even in a first world country like America, our water sources are questionable at best with oil spills, fluoridation, and scandals like the Flint water crisis. Many places like Brooklyn put up warning signs about the poison in their tap water.</p>

<p>You can be prosecuted if you choose to avoid paying your bills. One of those taxes being on the land you already own.</p>

<p>You can live off the grid but creating a self-sustaining ecosystem for fresh water and power will not be easy or cheap, despite what tech magazines may lead you to believe.</p>

<p>Civilization has it&#39;s perks, but what have we sacrificed in exchange?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our reliance on society&#39;s perks has led us to compromise our immune system, gut flora, and overall mental health with the food we eat, the water we drink, and big pharma meds we&#39;re told will fix us. </p>

<p>Most people wouldn&#39;t survive a week without their precious opioids. For those not already a slave to prescription pills, no amount of survival skills and high tech solar panels will save you from a compromised immune system. We would all die out in the wild. It is a futile effort to try and escape the cage society has made for us. The implication that I should be thankful for the safety of my cage is asinine. </p>

<p>Poisonous water, nutrient deficient food, and addictive medications for diseases caused by our toxic environment is not some coincidence of society&#39;s stupidity, it is a deliberate effort to keep us dependent on the system we constantly rail against. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your point is spot on. While I disagree with the direction we have taken, society has managed to keep billions of people alive who would otherwise be dead/never been born. One of the problems though in my mind is that we don&#39;t really have the option to opt-out of society, I can&#39;t choose to hunt and gather on land I want because of urbanization and property rights ect. On the flip side my ancestry is from Northern Europe so if things were &quot;natural&quot; again I would be hunting and gathering in titty cold weather, so I much prefer a warm house and food not from hunting and gathering. Now if only we could fix society so we can reach warm house equilibrium for everyone...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes there are. They supersede the rights and freedoms of the corporate state.</p>

<p>The system only exists because people cooperate and exchange things. The system wishes to control this and take what doesn&#39;t belong to it in order to maintain power.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no logic in saying nobody wants to live completely outside the system. They can&#39;t because they are part of a social animal that cooperates. It&#39;s more logical to say the system doesn&#39;t want people to not buy into it.</p>

<p>Conspiracy is one of the most interesting and fascinating topics for a forum, simply because it is more of a lens or perspective, than a rigorous topic for discussion. Defining, interpreting, and communicating <em>conspiracy</em> is an under-explored region of psychology. </p>

<p>The conspiracy community is very avant-garde like in that it opposes the myopic focus of the mainstream. Freedom of speech is regarded as the foundation for the community&#39;s existence, and thus we get posts like this. I find them all fascinating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh you are so right. I live in germany. In 2007 they signed a bill here, that practically forces you to get the public health insurance. Beforehand it was that you only had to do it, if you are an employee. But the new bill made it so you are forced even if you have NO INCOME. i didn&#39;t know about this in 2010, when i dropped out of the family policy of my parents insurance. I went through a though phase of depression back then and didn&#39;t open the letters i got. Am still paying today. 
How i hate these scumbags.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We probably do need some form of shelter, (particularly for those of us who live in cold countries) but we need much less food than we think we do.</p>

<p>Obviously most of the technology we use is basically needless. People often portray young children as pressuring their parents to buy them gadgets, but it&#39;s usually the other way around.</p>

<p>My parents bought me and my sister a game console without us ever asking for it, my dad bought me a laptop without me requesting one and my mum recently made fun of me for not being on twitter (lol).</p>

<p>Overconsumption is unhealthy, and it makes us economic slaves, dependent on the elite for our sustenance. I made a post about eating being a habit, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5hkbn1/there_is_no_real_need_to_eat_or_drink_eating_is_a/">not a necessity</a>, it&#39;s very relevant to this topic.</p>

<p>The author is clearly unaware that poisonous foods exist.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s just wrong. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.petmd.com/bird/conditions">http://www.petmd.com/bird/conditions</a></p>

<p>He probably thinks birds don&#39;t get sick because we can&#39;t talk to birds and ask if they&#39;re feeling okay. </p>

<p>Wait till he looks at how most land animals drink. Lapping up water with the tongue is far more complicated and inefficient than a person just scooping up water in their hand. </p>

<p>This page is just verbal diarrhea, he says something that sounds fancy but give it a second and you&#39;ll realise he&#39;s a fool. </p>

<p>If you are not omnipowerful, omniscient, and omnipresent, then you do not have anything even approaching absolute freedom.  But always judge the limits of your freedom wherever and whenever you can.  We have freed ourselves from the matrix of primitive tribalism and become a collective communicating body, just as we restrict ourselves today with governments and monetary fiat...but what other freedoms ought we to have that we do not have by nature alone?

    <div class="md"><p>It goes right along with one of the arguments the left uses. Being that everyone should be getting weekly payments from the government just for being alive. This payment should be enough to cover food, housing, and kids. Basically tax the shit out of the people that are actually working, and give it to faggots (not gay) that lay around all day thinking they know everything about the world. </p>

<p>But there are sooo many problems with that it&#39;s hard to put them all onto paper even. </p>
