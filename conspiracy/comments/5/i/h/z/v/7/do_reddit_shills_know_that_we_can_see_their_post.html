       I'd be willing to say that 70% of the people that you think are shills are just people with a different point of view than your own. That said there's still that 30% and if they were actually good at their job, they'd be invisible.

       I've looked at post histories a couple of times and those times have been when someone looked at my post history and commented on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trouble with looking at post histories is it's so contextual that to truly understand a standalone comment, you have to look at what the guy is commenting upon, what he's replying to, and what the thread is about which requires reading the article.

       I mean, I guess if you have a spare hour to determine whether one guy is a shill or not, go for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But man, when there are so many out there it becomes too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to take people at face value. If we aren't getting anywhere, move on. I'm not here to change minds necessarily. Especially ones that don't want to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that applies to shill or non-shill. So why bother looking at post history? I'm amazed people have looked at mine and pulled something up from months ago. It's like, "you really spent that much time to pull up a comment of mine from 3 months ago and still misrepresented it? Wow. Good for you."

       See, I've been a lurker for a long time on this sub. I think the shills are more annoying than anything, and I usually just try to read into what they're saying and if they're trying to push a larger agenda onto people, or they're just being fishy as fuck with what they're saying. Other than that I don't want to spend an hour or so of my time trying to figure our if they're a shill. I'm here to educate myself and help the discussion move along and if someone wants to try and get in the way of that, you do you pal but it won't get you very far.

       You guys! It's easy to spot some shill / bot accounts by glancing at account history.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the account only recently became active after a long time being inactive, good chance it's a purchased account.
      </p>
      <p>
       If its a new account and aggressively trying to push some far fetched narrative, no good proof, links, it's probably a shill / bot
      </p>
      <p>
       Also accounts just constantly posting walls and walls of text or incoherent ramblings are probably bot / time drain

       They have to know, but it's likely that if you're the type of person who will check it, you're not the type of who will fall for their bullshit. You're not their target. There are tons of people who wouldn't care to check post history and would take whatever is posted at face value. These are the people they want to sway and influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep calling them out on it and more people will be likely to investigate on their own.

       Anyone removing post history is clearly trying to hide who they are.

       For when people don't sort the sub by "new" or "hot"? Trying to go through old threads and losing out on tons of context because people deleted their posts is annoying as fuck. That and it's memory holing, it shows you're covering something up, be it by embarassment or a change in political view, whatever.

       Look at a place like eBay where the amount of info you can see about bidders history has been heavily redacted since I started using it close to 15 years ago. (I'm sure you could argue this is a good thing I'm just pointing out another place that did it.)

       There are already scripts that will go through a person's comment history and locally save each post. I don't doubt that there would soon be a script to do the same by scraping whole subs looking for certain usernames. But at that point you're trying to save a sinking ship anyway.

       What convenient tools are out there to analyze post history these days?

       In the past I've made use of some that aggregated number of posts / comments to different subs. Would be useful to pool resources.

       O it's not a generation it's an age that the generation happens to be in their 20s.  Add to that immersion in the internet but ignorance of it's inception and the migration from old to new media and there is a distinct lack of perspective.  This era's script kiddies are all targeted individuals.

       So what about the baby boomer generation? 
Also, it has #always been a media brainwashing generations. 
It's not just this generation. Why do you think pot is illegal? Because it kills people and is terrible for you? No. Because the media made people believe it made you crazy. That only "negroes" and "Mexicans" smoked pot and minorities are dangerous!
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason it may seem like the young generation is brain washed is because social media is a major role in today's society. I mean look at me and you right now. We're on Reddit, a social media website.

       The association of pot with hippies and blacks and Nixon demonizing it or the giant list of other bullshit leaders have done over the years, is a recurrent theme.  We have always needed media so that we have a check against gov't corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm not thinking it's brainwashing.  There is an odd dynamic at play where like babyboomers are massively tech illiterate.  Gen X is sort of in the middle.  And this new generation of 20 somethings is extremely skilled because they have grown up immersed in the new medium.  The lack of perspective comes from not having seen news before the Bush era.  We have an entire generation for whom making an extreme statement is just par for the course, a way to get an impression or get the post up to the top.  This is because of the way the media skewed during that time.  The networks became more and more polarized to the point that they are all spin all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politics are taking a similar turn now as the effectiveness of the new "lie and label" tactics have taken over.  They are literally just making things up now and keep saying them until the election is over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government has always lied.  That is true.  But the media has not always consisted of caricatures of wingnuts.  There was once a moderate voice to represent the fact that most people are moderates.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a time when journalists tried to find common ground or understand the people who were being interviewed instead of trying to set them up for a sound byte to prove their point.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah I'm really not blaming the generation.  We are all products of our environment. I just fear the fallout from a generation that is so loud and savvy with tech, that was raised in an environment that was already destructive and getting worse.  I imagine corrupt politicians can find a lot to do with their enthusiasm and propensity to jump the gun for their "team".

       Ah man that's a lot to reply to, but I read your whole comment and I agree with you entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our (my) generation didn't grow up with the most advanced technology.. We saw the "bloom" more to speak. Off of dial up, the birth of the iPhone, and Facebook and Reddit. We also saw gaming across consoles from house to house (though I know computers did that long before, it was more popularized and made easier through consoles). But it's not my generation that I believe we have to worry about. My nephew is 2, and he can unlock a phone, even text and call, can play games, and can even buy games off of his (my sisters) tablet. Now, I believe that's the generation that's going to be what decides our future tech wise. I grew up with a game boy, game boy advanced and then to a game boy color, and a N64. Then I moved to ps1, ps2, 360 and now the Xbox one. Looking at all those consoles the ps4 and Xbox one literally mocks the older consoles and hand Helds.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're totally right and I agree that a lot of our news these days are simply made up... A vast, and I'll even admit I do this myself at times, majority of people simply read the headlines and take it as is. That's why "clickbait" articles are becoming more of a thing. Because people don't read the article, but the headline.
      </p>
      <p>
       And true journalism is dead. It's just government controlled propaganda....and it's not just here in the US, it's all across the world. It's a frightening time we live in, but that's only because now we know what's been going on behind closed doors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe our last true president was JFK. he was openly against occults being in position of power, and actually listened to the people. He was (just speculation) probably the first president to do something about the laws against marijuana.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually quit smoking, but I'm an advocate for marijuana. And one reason why i really believe it's still illegal to this day isn't because it's dangerous, or poses a threat to paper companies.....I believe it's because it expands your mind. It's lets you relax, forget about just "you". And to think about the world, contemplate on more than "I wonder who's gonna win Sunday". And it's funny now how marijuana use has gone up, and so the conspiracies have risen, and even some came out to be the truth! Because people are finally realizing that were not in control! This is not a government "by the people for the people" it's "a government to help the rich get richer and make the poor get poorer".

       Wow well at 21 you remind me a lot of myself about 20 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing I notice so different about the up and coming generation in their 20s now is that they are social media expert users with almost no perspective of how things were before it and how it may need to be changed to be more conducive to discussion.  Basically the loudest most prominent users are the least likely to see shortcomings.  Attribution of quotes and really fact checking in general died when people started being allowed to cite wikipedia as their source.  (Research used to be a lot harder to do and consequently there were less people doing it and they were more highly skilled).  Maybe I'm getting older but I see this as a recipe for disaster.  My hope is that innovation occurs that solves these problems, if only this generation knew it was a problem, they might be able to invent something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marijuana is definitely a useful "de-programming" drug.  And it certainly aids the mind in taking a different perspective.  It's also a damn fine medication that will IMO end up taking the place of a number of current medications that have much worse side-effects.  If the gov't doesn't sell out to big pharma and let them attack us with synthetics with side-effects for 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what happened with JFK.  It certainly is fishy as hell.  A lot of people from my parent's generation, even those that hated him, believe it was an inside job.  Did some cartel take over when this happened?  Had it already happened and was Kennedy an outsider?  We are facing a situation now where we must learn the truth of all these conspiracies.  The population is either going to get some transparency from the gov't or we will lose all sense of reality on social media, caught in the middle of state-sponsored propaganda wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       And thanks for the discussion as well.  I hope more people find a way to make better discussions possible on social media.

       1) Isn't a new thing.  The large outlets have always been fed info from the gov't.  Some journalists know how to play this the right way and plenty have told stories over the years that the establishment did not want to hear.  In many cases I believe that people do believe their own profession demands that they do "something" when they see something wrong.  In many cases the circumstances or structure of a society can move to stop that information from presenting itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I think this is an extreme characterization.  The networks share common interests and sources.  They simply aren't as dynamic in covering stories as they once were.  All forms of media have lost some of their integrity as we have begun to increase the pace with which we produce information.  Think of it like a thousand tiny decisions that put reporters further from the truth.  Attribution, research, remote working and remote information, all of these things make it easier to do the same job 98% of the time and it's faster.  Maybe you sacrifice a little integrity with each decision and soon you are only doing 90% of the job you once were, but it takes half the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people need to be more careful with that term.  Spin doesn't make something fake.  It just makes it more of an opinion with some facts thrown in.  If you are aware of the spin then you can still use the information (all of it even the spin gives you info about the source).  There actually is "fake news" apparently in that some people make ad revenue off of sites that post completely made up articles.  Now I know they only found fake right wing sites and the lefty owners don't get how to make fake left wing news, but I'm pretty sure smart right wingers could make a left wing fake news site pretty easily too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in some cases things are "fake news" but I think that people are conflating multiple confusing media reports from "intelligence sources", which cite that Russia's propaganda engine helped to spread some stories created by admittedly fake news sites.    This is just saying that for instance RT.com ran the story about FBI agent who was investigating Clinton Foundation being killed.  It was a specific story that they traced back to a guy who ran a site to make advertising revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
       We definitely need to take in all of these sources, you just have to try to parse out spin and make a list of the facts for yourself.  Eventually state-actors will figure out that they can just create enough noise and then we won't be able to find anything useful anyways.
