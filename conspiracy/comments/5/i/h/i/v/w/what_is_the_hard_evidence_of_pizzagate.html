       That would come from bringing folks in for questioning, executing search warrants, and doing a full investigation. But that's not happening, so we're doing the best we can -- which is pretty damn good if you ask me, given our constraints.

       Yeah lack of evidence of a crime, no investigation, and a reputation for feeding the delusions of angry gunmen must be quite a constraint to the imagination.

       Plenty of circumstantial evidence, plenty enough for a formal investigation. Here's a start:

       And any person with any sense, guilty or not, wouldn't agree to questioning in something like this. In addition, even if the CJ system weren't crooked, there is no way a judge would sign off on a warrant. And the biggest reason why this fails? You people actually believe that puppets of the global elite are willing to arrest, indict and convict their puppetmmasters based on 4chan ramblings. NOT. GONNA. HAPPEN.

       Skeptics never respond when I explain that pizza is clearly used as sexual symbolism by those people, and that then pizza is used in art/jokes with kids. Never. Even when I show them a video like this:

       Band that plays at Comet Ping Pong and combines children with pizza and adults masturbating as the themes for the video.

       A band that plays at a family/kid friendly business.

       I've gone over the use of Pizza as sexual symbolism and traced the first use of it, on the net as a meme and joke, to 2004-2007 when a guy on HTCAP offered the host a pizza to let him go. I posted that here a week or so ago. Any evidence of it being used in such a way before then? Well, if you count the guy who told me that his girlfriends sisters boyfriend (or some shit like that) had some disks that he couldn't identify, yet his brother had the "disk reader" (his words not mine), and it contained CP and they turned it over, then yeah, it was used before then. But that is laughable in and of itself. The type of disk would have been stated over and over by the brother and investigators, and CP is a harmful thing that you don't forget, yet that guy can't recall what type of disk it was...

       Yes. Hard evidence is what convicted Jeffrey Epstein (witness testimony and pics withheld from public view). Yes, hard evidence convicted Laura silsby of child trafficking (being caught red handed at the border with 33 kids who she had told their parents would be back in a few hours).
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of these people have deep ties to the Clinton foundation. Both of these people committed the most heinous crimes imaginable and spent less than 6 months in jail combined. And if you didn't know it, Laura silsby now has an executive role at alertsense, the company responsible for the entire amber alert system.

      <p>
       No it doesn't. I had a mod openly telling me, in another thread, that it was not against the rules for an alt-right nut job to call me a cuck. However, the same mod told me it was against the rules for me to tell the alt-right nut job to "fuck off" after I politely asked him to move on and after he called me a cuck.

       I'm not sure what specifically you mean when you say the pizzagate situation, and I'm not sure what you consider to be weak/hard evidence and everything in between. I also honestly don't know what to pick when people want the most (whatever) evidence that something bad might be going on with certain people. It's like it's just a lot of little things that add up into a mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like this video by musicians that performed at Comet Ping Pong, mixing children, people masturbating on pizzas, etc like just what the hell, why are children added to a lot of this stuff? It makes me suspicious of these people.

       The new stuff is circumstantial. Everyone acknowledges that. But there are decades of witnesses. Epstein was convicted of child enslevment and rape and didn't go to jail. The same witnesses that fingered him named many more people but they didn't go to jail. Laura silsby, etc etc.

       Pizzagate is just another crack and the big satanic pedo dam. And when the dam finally breaks , ie an undeniable video finally comes out, who knows what kind of chaos will happen. Read the book "trance formation of America". It was written in 1995 and has all the info you'll ever need to know to realize the depths of these disgusting satanist pedos.
