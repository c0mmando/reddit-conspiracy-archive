    <div class="md"><p>The point I was trying to make is that CNN has this aura of being unbias.  Of course, that is not the case, but the average unthinking american does think that CNN is telling them the truth which makes them even more dangerous in my opinion.  The New York Times also has this, as someone else mentioned.  Everyone knows Fox is bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bad information is better than no information.  If you want to truly be informed it&#39;s better to get your news from <em>multiple</em> locations.  Not ignore them all.  What CNN and the likes report is always true, but only a part of the picture.  Whatever portion which paints things in the way they want them painted.  Getting parts from multiple sources with multiple motivations is the only way around it.  And let&#39;s be clear: all sources have a motivation.  It&#39;s impossible to not include bias, as it&#39;s simply human nature.  </p>

<p>And <em>we</em>, the people, have no power in starting or preventing another world war. e.g. (not to say these are realistic concerns) If putin wanted to fight over our placing defensive positions around russia, then he would have.  And if he wants to go ahead and reform the USSR because we aren&#39;t setup to prevent him, then he will.  Either way, there was nothing we could have done to prevent it.  </p>
