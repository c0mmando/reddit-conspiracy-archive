       Podesta was duped by a childish gmail phishing scam to change his password - Not sophisticated hacking!! Google can prove the origin of that hack since the password was changed from the hacker in their servers.

      <p>
       it's not some highlevel hack by a intelligent source. Every dumbfuck on Hillary's team  has the IQ of 10 regarding network security. I mean Google servers are backed up to NSA servers. they probably did it.

       It doesn't matter what thin veil of excuse they use right now,  it's the fact that Assad will not be overthrown and Syria won't instill a puppet government for a Saudi pipeline. Russia is standing in the way of the petro dollar right now and they want you to believe it has something to do with hacking emails. Honestly,  remember WMD in Iraq? Don't be surprised, they are setting the stage for full on proxy war now because they will not stop until they get what they want.

       Note that a new account will pop up with response to WMD in Iraq to state that it was really GWB/Cheney administration that misconstrued what was said, from which we are to infer that the CIA holds no responsibility for that outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you'll point out that the CIA website hosts their October, 2002 white paper on Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction.

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Iraq has continued its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs in defiance of UN resolutions and restrictions. Baghdad has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of UN restrictions; if left unchecked, it
probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade.
       </p>
       <p>
        Baghdad hides large portions of Iraqâ€™s WMD efforts. Revelations after the Gulf war starkly demonstrate the extensive efforts undertaken by Iraq to deny information.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since inspections ended in 1998, Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort, energized its missile program, and invested more heavily in biological weapons; most analysts assess Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program.

       But by that time conversation will move on and the next round of gaslight is being rolled out in another submission. This boiler plate response has been thrown at me a few times the last few days.

       "Gaslighting is a form of psychological abuse in which a victim is manipulated into doubting their own memory, perception, and sanity. Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim."
      </p>
      <p>
       You're the first person I've seen on here to use the term gaslighting and it's something I've been talking about to friends off the net. That is exactly what they are doing. I hope more people become familiar with this term, so they can see it when it's happening... although, I think most here get it already.

       Although more focused on male sexual strategy, the sub called theredpill touches on this sort of thing in far more detail. Particularly the top 100 posts of all time and the sidebar links; as quality of recent submissions has dropped a bit recently on the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend it often because I consider it essential reading, as I've seen similar parallels with the application of things like gaslighting as touched on brilliantly by

       It's frustrating. Being yelled over and unnecessarily labeled/namecalled during this election cycle was one of the primary factors that left being alienated from the party I usually identify with (Democrats). Treatment of Bernie was shameful and did not improve as time went on. The amount of vitriol thrown, then projected onto everyone else including their own team has caused huge rifts for the future.

       it's dumbfounding...even if one were naive enough to buy that story, you'd have to believe that the cia sat by silent and twiddled their thumbs while the entire mass media and Bush admin officials repeatedly "misinterpreted" their intel, and
       <em>
        stayed
       </em>
       silent until recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like the mirror image of Iran-Contra: the cia is claiming plausible deniability that they had knowledge of the Bush NatSec Council's activities.

        Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency
       </a>
       is a good read. Beyond restructuring so that all intelligence briefings would go through Cheney first and he had opportunity to control what was shared with Bush, there are claims that the administration would recommend replacement of agents until getting the intelligence they wanted to take desired action.
      </p>
      <p>
       That intelligence was then relied upon to share with the press and influence the public toward accepting war. The CIA has a group of talented people working for them and may have disagreed with the actions every step of the way. End result was intelligence whitepapers such as the one linked were use to sway government officials and the public toward poor actions. It can happen again. Hopefully if such a thing does we'll have someone in the agency willing to take a stand and put out their official statement regarding what their stance is so we can avoid this wishy washy unconvincing feeling where we wonder if it's really happening or not.

       See here's the problem right now with you and conspiracy theories. You're now in direct contention with the United States of America. You are against US interests. It is in the best interests of the United States to oust Assad and continue support of Saudi Arabia right now. It makes you a dissident and if you're a dissident working with Russia that makes you a spy or traitor. Right now they've put anyone who works against US interests on US soil into a spot to be arrested for treason since a foreign government is now heavily involved. Trump hung all conspiracy theorists. Think about it, he'll be impeached, you know he will be and he's the biggest conspiracy theorists there is, than they'll move against other conspiracy people. He has financial ties to Russia, his Secretary of State has $40 billion in oil in the arctic circle waiting for sanctions to be lifted. This is all bad news. Russia was heavily involved. All our intelligence agencies are saying that now. A few cyber-security think tanks have discovered that our election machines and systems have shown signs of being vulnerable and being tampered with. You put the pieces together.

       Well there's a slippery slope.
      </p>
      <p>
       I liked the analogy floating around today that the US works like a number of satraps competing for funding, influence, and so forth. There's a powerful satrap holding a terrible hand and leveraging connection with the press and any other tool at their disposal to not be the one without a chair to sit when the music stops. They want to trade up for something but there is a decent shot there will not be a bailout after the high-risk play they made this election cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the long-tail event an actuary may have pointed out ahead of time. Or maybe any of the Democrats that were shouted down for asking questions and asking for alternatives. There are times you dice up the pie and portion everything out before the win then realize that the people you need to complete the task were locked outside of negotiations. Hindsight is a bitch.

       The problem with that thinking is if the current satrap is being supported by a foreign country. I'd suggest scrapping both rather then trust that Russia has our best interests. Which to be very frank they fucking don't. Russia is corrupt at it's core. I know a lot of problems we have in the US are based in corruption but not to the level of Russia. The fact that Trump might have had communication with them and that Russia's own foreign minister claimed they did, should be the absolute biggest red flag ever. I don't think we should sit on this or accept it at all on any level. I think we should fight against this presidency. I don't want a Russian-backed executive branch.

       I'm just responding to what you're saying. I guess I'm also doling out advice, to chill out. If you feel like I'm marginalizing you, that might be something to discuss with your therapist. I didn't seek out making you angry or anything. That just kinda happened in response to the question (or "half-question") I asked, and not even one directed at you.

       Democrat for my voter lifetime. Biggest disappointment with Obama is not going after the Bush administration on taking office. The purging of presidential records as Bush/Cheney cleaned up their personal email channels would have been solid precedent that could have saved much hair pulling / poorly thought out behaviors.

       Assume the Russians are behind every ill experienced by the Clinton coronation. I keep asking what is the path forward that does not involve rewarding the corruption in the Democratic Party revealed by the leaks. The only thing worse than a Trump presidency is handing the win to a corrupt campaign.
      </p>

       I'm collecting many downvotes but I remain unclear what the plan is other than the coronation is back on.

       This is actually a great case study to provide segway into what has gone so off the rails with our 2016 election.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Good guy" Joe Biden can be counted on. Elections are expensive. Back when intellectual property was a boring word Joe and Obama were elected and in short order packed the DoJ with lawyers from the RIAA (
       <a href="http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/joe-bidens-problem-music">
        source 2009
       </a>
       ). This resulted in a massive shift in intellectual property law. The EFF and digital rights organizations called out the Obama administration of packing the DoJ with so many RIAA lawyers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funding for Biden's campaigns leading up to the VP role came primarily from law firms / lobbyists involved in intellectual property. As VP it was natural for Biden to take lead on copyright issues for Obama. He was the point person on SOPA / PIPA for example. This is likely a good example of how politics works, industries that benefit from strong copyright bankrolled the Obama/Biden push and they in turn provided a favorable legal climate for the entertainment industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The overreach in the intellectual property chapter of the TPP ties back to these early actions of the Obama administration. The argument goes that this relationship between the administration and RIAA became far too close, usually citing the raid on Kim Dotcom's mansion in New Zealand as a direct favor for support over the years (US heavily pressured New Zealand to carry off the raid).
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this bad? Wrong? Morally questionable? It's more likely the nature of politics in the Citizens United world. Elections are expensive. You spend a lot of time as a politician on the phone fundraising in order to campaign and win influence. In return for the funding you go to work for your constituents. That's the nature of politics in the US today. Personally I think it would be fun to explore a heavier lobbying tax. All political donations are taxed to fund a public-interest lobby as a means to off-set the
       <strong>
        extra loud voice money brings to the table
       </strong>
       . That's another discussion.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       So back to my original point. Where the US is off the rails in 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a normal election cycle the chaos has converged on an orbit of  two political parties fairly balanced in terms of political strength. We oscillate Democrat, Republican, then back without too much change. Because of similar strength between parties big ticket donations are randomly distributed between the two parties with some parity. One party strongly represents the interests of their donors, while the other the interests of the donors that came to them. The voting public is caught in the middle of this press of interests. The choice faced is one of which political party has donor interests that offers the most favorable mix of potential positives for the public. Politicians spend their time speaking of these positives while minimizing discussion of the unfavorable outcomes that must be handed back out to interests bankrolling their campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       The collapse of the Republican Party establishment broke this dynamic. There is no longer an orbit of two major parties in parity. The random distribution of donor interests did not get split between two parties. There is no press of interests to pick and choose the least uncomfortable outcome. The entire pool of major donor interests lined up behind the HRC camp. The public is left with no choice. With every major donor lined up behind HRC there is no wiggle room to make meaningful promise.
      </p>
      <p>
       This changes the game. Hard reset.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first sign was Bernie Sanders. His camp recognized the fundamental choice available to the voting public was missing from the equation and provided that option through a public funded campaign and making promises to the public in the traditional sense, making deals with the major donors. HRC campaign had to pull all the stops and scramble to avert losing there. That was the opportunity to recognize the equation had changed and an additional benefit was required, the voting public won't go your way if you withhold all the spoils.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Trump win can be predicted. HRC doubled down on the strategy. She had no wiggle room to make promises because she had too many donors to appease in her corner. It does not matter how much division is sewn. It does not matter how much paid to send people to disrupt and derail online communication. It does not matter if every newspaper is in your corner. You've got to have something to offer that might improve the lot of the voting public, they have to be invited to the negotiating table or you get nowhere. Trump ran, HRC made no modification after lessons provided by Bernie, Trump won in not much of a surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the host of donors that aligned behind what was expected to be the last standing and only major political power are left with nothing to show for the investment. Worse, they stand to lose massively over the next four years. We are seeing a mad scramble to not be the last one standing when the music stops and there are no more chairs. And there are a lot of major players who may find themselves without a chair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Queue the media in full panic mode trying to spin stories based on 3rd hand accounts to insist a do-over.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR
       </strong>
       - An election can't be won in the US without the public cut in on the deal. In a normal election year political donors line up between two major political parties and the public picks the less shitty deal. When a major party collapses, all the political donors line up behind one major party and there is no choice available to the public. Best negotiate with the donors to provide choice or clear benefit to them, or they will go for the outsider.

       The highside is a closed system.  You can only log in to the highside from a dedicated terminal and you can't email anything from the highside to a regular email either government or otherwise.  In fact, you couldn't even send a classified email from the DoS classified servers to the DoD servers.  Hillary actually got in trouble for transmitting classified information that she got in meetings via a lowside non-government server.  As far as I know, if they were privy to the same information, none of her staff committed a similar security violation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary's staff at the DoS did use their personal email and lowside interchangeably.  Personally, I don't think that anyone who hasn't worked in the Government can criticize them for doing so.  First, government servers aren't necessarily anymore secure than Google or Yahoo.  Unclassified Government servers get hacked all the time.  Just do a quick Google search if you don't believe me.  In fact, when I worked at Commerce, the division which worked on China had been hacked so many times that the DoC set up an internal network with no connection to an external network.  All communication on China was done in person or was printed out and physically handed to the Principle.  Second, Congress doesn't give enough for IT, so IT in the Government sucks.  For instance, the highside terminal which I used during Hillary's tenure was purchased when Colin Powell was Secretary.  It was replaced only because  Windows stop making updates for XP.

       Not only that, but they're claiming that Russia influenced the elections through misinformation! Am I missing something, because leading up all the way to the day of the elections, all MSM was reporting that Clinton was leading in every state that ended up going to Trump! Unless, of course, all of the MSM is also being controlled by Russia and used whatever information they got from the hacks to influence the elections. Nearly every channel and FB was laughing at the possibility of Trump becoming President, saying that this was a slam dunk for Clinton, she had it in the bag. So unless there was some sort of covert misinformation going on that I couldn't catch, I am very much confused.

       Certain rogue elements are threatening Russia,   and certain gullible neoliberal are falling for fake news and lies,  not questioning any proof.

       Most people in the US probably don't want to go to war with Russia and remember we were lied into Iraq,  Syria,   Libya,  etc.

       The Democratic Party and its corrupt officials including Hillary and Obama have been exposed,  are pissed,  and are afraid of losing power/greedy for more power.   To the degree they are allowed.    It has been shown there are people who have had enough of them.

       Unlike a lot of these smaller countries, Russia has the reach, numbers, and logistics to get us if we're really stupid enough to try something. Not exactly something Iraq or Libya could do. Also our typical military doctrine that has communications as a primary target is exactly the kind of thing that could set off dead-hand. (And after the whole Cuba thing, Russians were clever enough to ensure MAD worked from their end as protection.) To go forward and push an aggressive doctrine and deny that such a system is still in operation really is playing Russian roulette.

Trump wasn't born in the USA?

       Many Democrats have gone to "Prestigious" colleges which are predominantly Very Liberal, and teach Cultural Marxist Techniques. Democrats perception is that many Republicans especially in the middle of the country have not attended college, or went State school instead of universities. The problem is that the quality of education has dramatically decreased in the last few decades and so we have 2+ Generations of Multiple Choice test taking graduates who believe they are of superior intelligence/education and that their opinions are more qualified. When in reality, most of what students who didn't major in engineering,physics,business related courses are is, simply indoctrinated with the teaching of people who were smart, but manipulative. The lack of critical thinking and ability to debate opinions that differ than yours in an intelligent manner is their downfall. My Roomate has a Masters from Cal-Arts and is a very intelligent guy who voted Bernie, and is a very left leaning liberal, the guy has tons of books on socialism and feminism and despite being very intelligent, and relatively decent debater, he is 100% confirmation bias and the cognitive dissonance is remarkable. I can show him empirical proof that undermines beliefs that he has, and yet he fails to concede. It's time to show him Yuri Bezmenov's How to Brainwash a Nation. I will admit that Liberal's in general are better with verbal speech and writing skills and many of them took upper division English Writing courses, but there is more to being intelligent than punctuation and a large vocabulary.

       Just like the Bush and Obama presidencies. Bush wasn't that bad but Obama is a better speaker therefore people ate up whatever the heck he said even though just like the past presidents, he failed to deliver on more than a few campaign promises.

       It's all bullshit. This is the beginning of a type of soft coup. It's bullshit but the dems, media, most republicans don't want Trump. More importantly, the rich elite don't like him taking a leading role over their assembled crew of puppets. This is their attempt at sabotage, and Russia is the usual scapegoat. For the record, I did not vote for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: Don't forget the ironic reality is that the US has meddled in more elections and sabotaged more popularly elected governments than any other nation by far. Also, Israel meddles with our elections by a huge amount.

       That's right, you listen to u/admiralcuddles and leave those facts out of here. Whether or not you voted for the one-party system 12 and 14 years ago is more important!

       Democrat for my voter lifetime. Biggest disappointment with Obama is not going after the Bush administration on taking office. The purging of presidential records as Bush/Cheney cleaned up their personal email channels would have been solid precedent that could have saved much hair pulling / poorly thought out behaviors.

       IT security sucks

       .  People fall for phishing scams no matter how much training they've been given to recognize them.  Almost nowhere - government or private - funds IT security as much as it needs to be funded.  I'm saying this as someone who works in IT.  I don't know how many news stories about major breaches have to occur before people get this.
