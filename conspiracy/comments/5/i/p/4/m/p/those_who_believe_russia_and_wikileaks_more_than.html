    <div class="md"><p>How is it a psy op getting people to actually care more about their own country than international bullshit. Putin is a nationalist, he cares more if you attack russia than anything else &quot;what is rightfully russian&quot;. Ukraine should give a shit about russia but the US shouldn&#39;t. You are part of the problem with the do-gooder society. Russia doesn&#39;t give a fuck about a country whos nukes are already pointed at them. But i think the psy-op is the US establishment pretending that he does give a damn and that we &quot;need a reason to nuke&quot;. The US sticks their dicks in so many stupid places, iraq, syria, libya and the damage is done to others but I don&#39;t see people screaming psy-op on that shit no, they don&#39;t care about the millions being killed or displaced, all they give a shit about is how someone is a woman hater because they didnt vote for hillary or a racist, or a homophobe. Not WHAT THE FUCK IS OUT GOVERNMENT DOING TO THESE POOR COUNTRIES. Note: I am not from USA, but I can see what your government does to others, I see it every day. Complaining about russians is just another bullshit excuse to hurt people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly don&#39;t come here often if you don&#39;t even understand the reference to the Clinton Body count. While none of it is hard, confirmed evidence connecting the Clinton&#39;s directly to murder, there are dozens of mysterious or suspicious deaths and &quot;suicides&quot; involving people close to the Clinton machine, typically those going against them.</p>

<p>I highly recommend that you take some time and actually poke around this sub, and look at the information (personally) that has awoken as many people as it has. Before you just write the entire sub off as crazy, you may find some things that don&#39;t sit right even with you.</p>

<p>This sub&#39;s distrust of the CIA (and FBI for that matter, personally I&#39;m not even sure what they are doing right now), mainstream media, and the elites in general did not come simply from &quot;crazy fake news conspiracy theories&quot;. Just simply re-learning US history accurately will open your eyes to a lot of the themes and ideas currently seen here on r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you are wrong - we are in the middle of an information war right now; if we had more info, we would know exactly what the story is.  But we don&#39;t, which is why we have like 5000 different conspiracy theories.  But based on the info we have, your scenario is just as likely as many other scenarios, but I am personally leaning more towards our incompetent government is trying to cover some shit up and is trying to interfere with a power transition.

    <div class="md"><p>No one is on &quot;Russia&#39;s side&quot; though. If anything, we are on Julian Assange&#39;s side. The dude hasn&#39;t been wrong in the 10 years since founding Wikileaks, nor has he ever before acted in a way that benefited Russia. What motive would he have to lie to the people about his sources and cover Russia&#39;s ass? It just makes absolutely zero sense to me.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t seen it yet, I suggest you check out the interview he did yesterday with Sean Hannity. SUPER interesting. Listen for yourself, and just see what you think (rather than listen to the MSM tell you that he&#39;s just a lying rapist).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly don&#39;t come here often if you don&#39;t even understand the reference to the Clinton Body count. While none of it is hard, confirmed evidence connecting the Clinton&#39;s directly to murder, there are dozens of mysterious or suspicious deaths and &quot;suicides&quot; involving people close to the Clinton machine, typically those going against them.</p>

<p>I highly recommend that you take some time and actually poke around this sub, and look at the information (personally) that has awoken as many people as it has. Before you just write the entire sub off as crazy, you may find some things that don&#39;t sit right even with you.</p>

<p>This sub&#39;s distrust of the CIA (and FBI for that matter, personally I&#39;m not even sure what they are doing right now), mainstream media, and the elites in general did not come simply from &quot;crazy fake news conspiracy theories&quot;. Just simply re-learning US history accurately will open your eyes to a lot of the themes and ideas currently seen here on r/conspiracy.</p>
