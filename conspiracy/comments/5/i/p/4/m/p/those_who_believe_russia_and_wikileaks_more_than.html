       How is it a psy op getting people to actually care more about their own country than international bullshit. Putin is a nationalist, he cares more if you attack russia than anything else "what is rightfully russian". Ukraine should give a shit about russia but the US shouldn't. You are part of the problem with the do-gooder society. Russia doesn't give a fuck about a country whos nukes are already pointed at them. But i think the psy-op is the US establishment pretending that he does give a damn and that we "need a reason to nuke". The US sticks their dicks in so many stupid places, iraq, syria, libya and the damage is done to others but I don't see people screaming psy-op on that shit no, they don't care about the millions being killed or displaced, all they give a shit about is how someone is a woman hater because they didnt vote for hillary or a racist, or a homophobe. Not WHAT THE FUCK IS OUT GOVERNMENT DOING TO THESE POOR COUNTRIES. Note: I am not from USA, but I can see what your government does to others, I see it every day. Complaining about russians is just another bullshit excuse to hurt people.

       You clearly don't come here often if you don't even understand the reference to the Clinton Body count. While none of it is hard, confirmed evidence connecting the Clinton's directly to murder, there are dozens of mysterious or suspicious deaths and "suicides" involving people close to the Clinton machine, typically those going against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly recommend that you take some time and actually poke around this sub, and look at the information (personally) that has awoken as many people as it has. Before you just write the entire sub off as crazy, you may find some things that don't sit right even with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub's distrust of the CIA (and FBI for that matter, personally I'm not even sure what they are doing right now), mainstream media, and the elites in general did not come simply from "crazy fake news conspiracy theories". Just simply re-learning US history accurately will open your eyes to a lot of the themes and ideas currently seen here on r/conspiracy.

       Aside from terrible foreign policy including Benghazi, the Clintons have been surrounded by the largest number of suicides and heart attacks of any politicians I can think of. Seth Rich and Monica Peterson are just potentially the latest on a very very long list. But surely its all just a coincidence.

       I'm not saying you are wrong - we are in the middle of an information war right now; if we had more info, we would know exactly what the story is.  But we don't, which is why we have like 5000 different conspiracy theories.  But based on the info we have, your scenario is just as likely as many other scenarios, but I am personally leaning more towards our incompetent government is trying to cover some shit up and is trying to interfere with a power transition.  Makes more sense to me, and feels more strongly evidenced

       I'm not stating that I'm right, as I don't have any answers (none of us do really).

      <p>
       What I am stating though, is that there is far more evidence to suggest that the MSM lies to the people on behalf of TPTB, than there is to suggest that the DNC leaks came from Russia and that they are telling you the truth this time.

       Lets get the facts straight...

      <p>
       The email leak exposed the DNC rigging the primary against Bernie and other corruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this bad? Why should we hate whistleblowers?

       It matters not who exposed it, even though the Russia thing is the most obvious propaganda ever.

       No one is on "Russia's side" though. If anything, we are on Julian Assange's side. The dude hasn't been wrong in the 10 years since founding Wikileaks, nor has he ever before acted in a way that benefited Russia. What motive would he have to lie to the people about his sources and cover Russia's ass? It just makes absolutely zero sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest you check out the interview he did yesterday with Sean Hannity. SUPER interesting. Listen for yourself, and just see what you think (rather than listen to the MSM tell you that he's just a lying rapist).

       On that we can agree.  Hillary Clinton should be in jail.

       Aside from terrible foreign policy including Benghazi, the Clintons have been surrounded by the largest number of suicides and heart attacks of any politicians I can think of. Seth Rich and Monica Peterson are just potentially the latest on a very very long list. But surely its all just a coincidence.

       Do me a favor - try doing something illegal then say you didn't realize you were doing anything wrong. If they let you walk then Hillary is innocent as well. If not, then why the fuck is she special?

       You clearly don't come here often if you don't even understand the reference to the Clinton Body count. While none of it is hard, confirmed evidence connecting the Clinton's directly to murder, there are dozens of mysterious or suspicious deaths and "suicides" involving people close to the Clinton machine, typically those going against them.

       I highly recommend that you take some time and actually poke around this sub, and look at the information (personally) that has awoken as many people as it has. Before you just write the entire sub off as crazy, you may find some things that don't sit right even with you.
      </p>

       This sub's distrust of the CIA (and FBI for that matter, personally I'm not even sure what they are doing right now), mainstream media, and the elites in general did not come simply from "crazy fake news conspiracy theories". Just simply re-learning US history accurately will open your eyes to a lot of the themes and ideas currently seen here on r/conspiracy.
