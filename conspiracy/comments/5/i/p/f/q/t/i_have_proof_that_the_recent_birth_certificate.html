<p>When someone&#39;s name or city/state of birth are typed on a birth certificate, they are all printed in the very middle. Go and check if you don&#39;t believe me. What these &quot;investigators&quot; did was take the birth certificate of someone born in the same place as Obama and around the same time (so the format of their BCs is the same). They then dragged some text and placed it over Obama&#39;s BC, claiming that this means it&#39;s a forgery, except all birth certificates have that text in the middle!</p>

<p>Then, they took some stamps that were put down at similar angles (but not in the exact spot) and claimed this meant they were used as &quot;sources&quot; to forge from. </p>

<p><strong>Imagine if I took your driver&#39;s license and the driver&#39;s license of someone born on the same day as you. Then, I scanned them and dragged the driver&#39;s license number and DoB of the other person on top of your own driver&#39;s license, perfectly matching up the text. And then suppose I claimed this was proof YOUR driver&#39;s is a forgery! I&#39;d be laughed out of the room!</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t like hyperbole very much, but seeing these kinds of videos go viral makes me lose faith in humanity. How can people be so gullible?</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>EDIT #1:</strong> Some people are mentioning &quot;anomalies&quot; in the scanned document the WH provided. Here is the original uploaded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate-long-form.pdf">https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate-long-form.pdf</a></p>

<p>It should be immediately obvious why the text looks strange. The scanner software they used automatically tried enhancing the text in the scanned document. This is obvious because the text is much sharper than it should be and has more contrast. This is done to make the text more readable, if the scan is of poor quality or if the source document itself has poor printing. This is why you see a white glow behind the text - that&#39;s the software bumping up the contrast. It&#39;s also why the letters themselves are unnaturally sharp - that&#39;s the scanner colouring black over the text to make it sharper. </p>

<p>For evidence, consider what you see when you zoom in very much into the text, like <a href="http://imgur.com/a/nCCt4">this.</a> Notice how the bolded letters in the image are blurry and unsharp:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>County an<strong>d</strong> <strong>S</strong>tate or Foreign <strong>C</strong>ountry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These letters were skipped over by the software and were not enhanced. They are how the original text would have appeared if it weren&#39;t enhanced. They look completely normal and do not display any  anomalies.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>EDIT #2:</strong> Some are questioning why the .PDF has multiple layers. Very simple explanation.</p>

<p>Open the original .PDF I linked and double click on the actual document (not the random green stuff that makes the border but the middle square). When you do that, notice how only that square gets highlighted. Likewise, when you double click on the green border, the whole page gets highlighted blue.</p>

<p>Now, try double clicking on the stamped data &quot;April 25 2011.&quot; See how <em>only</em> that turns blue? Same goes for the &quot;I certificate this is a true copy....&quot; text. Only that part turns blue when you double click.</p>

<p>This is because all of them are in different layers. The actual BC is the middle square (notice the folding on the left side of the square). Everything else is separate. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why its in layers.</p>

<p>If you still don&#39;t believe me, read this:</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>EDIT #3:</strong> MUST READ. I figured it all out now. <strong>I have irrefutable evidence that all this is fake news/a hoax.</strong></p>

<p>Ever wondered where this &quot;Johanna&quot; birth certificate first came from? I have found that it originally came out in 2011 via a reader of WND.com:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A professional typographer with 50 years experience in the business has confirmed that the typeface in an authentic Hawaii Department of Health long-form birth certificate issued in 1961 is consistent, and concludes the document released by the White House as Barack Obama’s 1961 birth certificate – with its typeface anomalies – is anything but genuine.</p>

<p>The breakthrough making comparative analysis possible came only after a WND reader born in Kapiolani Hospital in Hawaii within about two weeks of Barack Obama’s birth voluntarily submitted to WND her own known-to-be-authentic birth certificate for analysis.</p>

<p>As seen in Exhibit 1, the known-to-be-authentic birth certificate, shown here in redacted form so as to eliminate all personally identifying information, was issued for a baby born in Kapiolani Hospital on Aug. 23, 1961, exactly 19 days after Barack Obama was born at the same hospital, on Aug. 4, 1961.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2011/09/342937/">redacted BC</a> of the reader.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2011/09/342937/">How Does Obama&#39;s Document Stack Up Against Genuine BC?</a></p>

<p>So, this BC was first released in redacted form in 2011 with WND claiming it was from one of their own readers. The article used this redacted BC as a point of reference to compare to Obama&#39;s recently-released BC.</p>

<p>These new &quot;investigators&quot; claim they suddenly found this BC after a &quot;years-long&quot; investigation, except they had it all long. They then took the BC of Johanna who they claimed in 2011 was born in the same hospital as Obama and now claim this was used as a source forgery, when in reality, <em>they themselves used it as a point of reference back in 2011!</em></p>

<p>Now, read the following post from 2014 of someone who has the full version of Johanna&#39;s BC:</p>

<p><a href="https://rcradioblog.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/ahnee-birth-certificate-generates-layers-when-scanned-on-a-xerox-workcentre-just-like-the-presidents-lfbc-does/">Ah’Nee Birth Certificate Generates Layers When Scanned on a Xerox WorkCentre Just Like the President’s LFBC Does</a></p>

<p>Read the entire post. It debunks all &quot;layers&quot; and &quot;anomalies&quot; garbage.</p>

<p>I believe we have successfully debunked this disinformation. The End.</p>

<p>Readers of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> should ask themselves how they fell for such obvious partisan/fake bullshit considering they&#39;re supposed to be &quot;open-minded&quot; and &quot;awake&quot; compared to the rest of the &quot;sheeple&quot; masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stamps are done by hand, and the data entry on typewriter (remember the time this certificate was made - pre printers). While statistically possible, its very unlikely the angle of the stamp and relative position of the entries would match. Your statement is absolutely correct making a drivers license using today&#39;s technology, but not when creating a certificate using 1961 technology.</p>

<p>I think the video presents interesting opinions and should be looked at further, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough to convince me of forgery (yet). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stamps aren&#39;t even exactly the same. Some are a little higher than the other. What most likely happened is that these &quot;investigators&quot; searched for someone born in the same place as Obama AND who had some stamped text at a similar angle. They then used this as proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so I took the images I could find of the BCs and threw them into Gimp. I adjusted the scale to match as close as I could, and I also adjusted the rotation so the two BCs were roughly on the same angle. </p>

<p>I then overlaid the two images as close as possible (I used the headers for alignment). I then looked at the stamps, and yes the  rotation of the stamp seems to be identical <em>(if I had better images or photoshop I probably could have matched the rotation of the BC&#39;s better and it looks like I would have gotten a cleaner result).</em> Because the stamps are done by hand matching the rotation on one stamp is definitely possible, but matching both left and right stamp rotations is extremely unlikely.</p>

<p>I have two images I made showing my results.</p>

<p>In each image I show the original Obama stamp, the original Ah&#39;Nee stamp, and and overlay of both with the top image set at 50% opacity.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/C7ER5I.jpg">This is the left stamp</a><br/>
<a href="https://i.sli.mg/SYUO6Q.jpg">This is the right stamp</a></p>

<p>Anyhow, in my mind this definitely verifies editing was done on one or both of the BCs. It&#39;s equally as likely the Ah&#39;Nee BC is a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still think it&#39;s mere coincidence - or the Johanna BC is fake. Read my latest edit. Seems like WND was given this other BC in redacted form back in 2011 by one of their readers. They claimed back then that they wanted to use it to compare with Obama&#39;s recently released LFBC, and that this was an ideal BC to compare with since the person had been born in the same hospital as Obama only a few weeks before him. The WND article then claimed that there were significant discrepancies between the two and concluded that Obama&#39;s BC was a fake. Then, in 2016, they dug out this old BC and pretended that since they were so similar, it meant Johanna&#39;s was used as a &quot;source.&quot; That&#39;s why all this is a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the only way to prove this isnto view either the original Obama BC or Ah&#39;Nee original BC. I personally have no doubts one or both are fake. The stamping convinced me of this and it only took me 15 minutes to verify using shitty old Gimp. I didn&#39;t bother verifying the 5 blocks of typed fonts the show in the video, but if the stamps lined up I have no reason to disbelieve the typed fonts won&#39;t show up either.</p>

<p>The lineage of the Ah&#39;nee BC is suspicious for sure. The claim it was a random submission from a fan sets off serious alarm bells. The odds of a random submission lining up as perfectly as this BC does are astronomically remote. Odds are the Ah&#39;Nee BC is a forgery based on the Obama sample. </p>
