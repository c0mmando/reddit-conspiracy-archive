       Fair enough.  It was totally in bad taste, but it doesn't have to necessarily be taken as some sort of "definite pedo" reference.

       That "Pizza Fucking Party" though?  That one

       crossed the line of "just a silly kids joke" area.  That's "time to call Child Protective Services" level bad.

       Oh snap.  It's been removed?  Wow.  Yeah.  That
       <em>
        totally
       </em>
       shows how inappropriate the initial poster (not OP, but the person who initially put it up) knows it is.  That's perhaps even more incriminating still.

       It was basically

       Holy shit... I've gotta see that myself. Not that I don't believe you, I just need to see it before I can personally use it as another fucked up point in this whole thing. Thanks man!

      <p>
       If anyone can find an archive I'd appreciate it.

       Edit: Yea, cannot find a single thing even referencing a picture like that. Super suspicious.

       Edit 2: Finally found it after removing pizza, gate, comet, ping pong, alefantis, and james from my search terms.

       Oh, there isn't much to it. When you do a lot of drugs for years in a kind of specific way, there is a great deal of bullshit and nonsense. But there were a few extraordinarily rare golden moments, that I think were genuine experiences where I could

       synchronicity. It was overwhelming, and terrifying, and beautiful.

       I've been sober a long time, but I will probably ponder the meaning of those moments for the rest of my life.

       I was just watching season 7 episode 1 of The Next Generation. Check out this dialogue.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then Lore came along. When you're lost and frightened, you listen to any voice which promises change. Even if that voice insists on controlling you. That's what we wanted. Someone to show us the way out of confusion. Lore promised clarity and purpose. At the beginning, he seemed like a saviour. The promise of becoming a superior race, of becoming fully artificial, was compelling. We did everything he asked. But after a while, it became clear that Lore had no idea how to keep his promise. That's when he began talking about the need for us to make sacrifices. Before we realised it, this was the result. What happened to them? Lore began to experiment, trying to remake us in his image.

       That's their shred of plausible deniability. However- how authorities can arrest people from incendiary posts on other forms of social media- threats of taking an action or "hate speech" and this has no attention? Insane

       I went through some of the instagram accounts these came from and found nothing except millennial party pics, some cross dresser shit, and otherwise boring nonsense. It seems like 1 or 2 pics were chosen out of a bunch, and telescoped to make it look like something more is going on. There really isn't much here that I can see that can be called evidence of anything but retardation and poor taste.

       Perhaps that's all it is.   I don't think anyone really disputes that.   It's the context that matters.   These guys hang out with Alefantis and Kleinman, both of whom have a strange habit of making sexual comments about kids and music videos about child rape and murder.   Tony Podesta's house is full of pedo photos and artwork.   Sorry but you get judged by the company you keep.

       That fair enough. But remember Alefantis is a rich gay guy, and these types have thousands of friends, just know a shit ton of people. A lot of these friends of his aren't going to be the brightest bulbs, and will say and do shit just to get attention. The key, I think, is to hone in on the people Alefantis hangs out with the most and look at those people.

       Yeah I hate to be the bearer of bad news here but A LOT of pizzagate "evidence" comes off to people as a gay smear campaign.  Like, have you met many urban gay guys?  They are some of the least sexually repressed people out there.  They have a high threshold for camp and kinky shit in the most fabulous way possible.  I'm just not seeing any thing to do with kiddie porn.  This is the kind of shit you can find on millions of hipster's instagrams across the country.  Every time this shit gets posted I keep expecting some rural church lady to come out of the wood work clutching her pearls screaming, "Won't somebody please think of the children?!?"

       You don't actually know that though.   In one context it could be disgusting but benign, in another it could be a "nudge nudge wink wink."  Interestingly Alefantis' birthday tradition is to eat a cake shaped like a baby's penis.   There are pics online.

       Looking at the last 6 pages of your post history shows youve been working hard on damage control for the couple weeks. Post after post, entirely devoted to undermining pizzagate.  How much do you get paid for this? It would be easy to dismiss pizza gate if it were just one thing, but everyday theres something new. The picture of the kids with condoms and liquor is fucked up. Where there is smoke there is fire. Right now we all see a lot of smoke, and youre running around telling everyone to dismiss it all. Based on your comments it seems youre a crude, morally corrupt shill pos.

       Exactly the response I'd expect from someone who  dismisses valid concerns of pedo activity. I think you're a real pedo for dismissing this shit so intently.  It makes much more sense that the dismisser of pedo activity is a pedo. Verses the guy calling for investigation..

       Actually covering for pedos Makes you look suspect.  You are dismissing this shit like we saw one piece of evidence and developed a conclusion. Nobody did what you just described . There's so much to this story. Maybe your part of it that story now. Working hard to do damage control.  You are a pedo defender pos

       Lemme tell you, I've been through every single piece of "evidence" you guys have dug up, and I can honestly say there is not
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       compelling item.  You guys started with the narrative that kids are being abused by Podesta/Clinton/CPP, and worked backwards from there.  That's not how "investigations" work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the title of this post, for Christ's sakes!  "Horrifying Comet Instagrams".  You gotta be fucking kidding me.  Every one of them is edgy hipster bullshit,
       <em>
        and they aren't even posted by people associated with CPP
       </em>
       .  That's not evidence, it's a witch hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why I'm going after you [edit: removed insult].  You've dragged
       <em>
        at minimum
       </em>
       50 people into this, doxxed their real identities, found out where the work, who their families are, etc, etc.  None of these people are related to this so-called "scandal".  Now, whenever somebody googles their name, they're going to be presented with these disgusting, revolting theories that have sprung out of the latent-pedo minds of pizzagaters.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I maintain my position, that you are a latent pedo POS, and I wouldn't let my own kids within 100 yds of you or your ilk.

       I do see where your coming from. However you are being dismissive. It's obvious that these people ar fucked up . You call it hipster bs, to me that's dismissive. I don't think there's enough evidence to harass them,which would be a law enforcement thing. However I think the FBI should look into it even if there is just a slim chance of this activity . I guess you think the spirit cooking , the photo with babies picking up condoms and liquor like its candy is hipster too and harmless? Nothing strange about grown men repeatedly and oddly  talking about pizza killing babies, rape and abuse? if you post shit that can be interpreted as language referring to such things people are going to be whole over you. That's understandable. At this point they have done nothing to defend any of the questionable emails or posts other than the Russians did it. It's not hard to understand at this point why people are pushing this so hard.  We have hrc on Jeffrey epsteins lolita express landing on pedo island. Then the emails, the posts , pictures , and the language and phrases used. One release after another all circle the same themes. It's too much smoke to just dismiss. That's why im the majority and you are one of a few doing damage control or just being overly dismissive.
       <br/>
       Just saw Ryan Dawson posted this putting the whole pedo topic into perspective with past revelations if you've been keeping up all this time you can understand where people are coming from. If you can't you're either one of them or stupid, neither of which are fixable.

       Cool.  Now that we've dispensed with the hyperbole (from both sides) maybe we can have a rational conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also make some very valid points.  My whole issue with all of this is that you guys are casting with such a wide net, not to mention that nobody is ever "cleared" in this investigation.  Once a lead doesn't pan out... you guys just drop it, and move on to your next victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want a prime example, just google one of the little girl's names from the
       <strong>
        "heated pool"
       </strong>
       email (I'm not going to post it here).  I think it's universally accepted at this point, even amongst the most hard-core pizzagater, that this e-mail turned out to be nothing.  It was an invitation for like 17 people (almost half of them women) to come to a farmhouse for a get-together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever that little girl googles her own name for the rest of her life, she's going to see the
       <em>
        trash
       </em>
       that pizzagaters have posted about her family allegedly pimping her out to the DC elite.  Whenever she applies to a college, goes for a job interview, starts to date a boy... they're all going to see this garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       For an "investigation" that is supposed to be all about protecting the children, you guys have sure done a number on this little girl's life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for catching predators and locking them up forever.  In fact, I'd dare to venture that I'm one of the few people on this sub who was actually instrumental in getting a pedo locked up.  When I was about 14, a scout leader took a suspicious interest in me.  He would invite me over to his house, and show me borderline porno-type photographs (legal, but inappropriate, and in an obvious attempt at grooming).  My parents started to have a bad feeling about this guy, they confronted me, and I told them everything, and they went to the cops.  The dude ended up doing 15 years for sodomizing another boy scout.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this topic is one that is quite close to me.  I have been impacted personally by pedophilia, and I like nothing more than to see them locked up.  That said, dragging 50 people through the mud in order to find the one suspected pedophile (who may or may not exist) is not the answer.  It's a witch hunt, pure and simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  And as far as the pinata pic with condoms and liquor.  It was
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       in poor taste, and I agree with you 100%.  It was funny as hell, but in undeniable poor taste.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you imagine how bummed out those kids were?  "Hey!  This isn't
       <em>
        gum

       Yes, because if they actually were cooking and eating babies they would take a screenshot of their admission of guilt and post it on IG.  Nevermind the fact that no ones reported a missing baby associated with these people.  Yours is clearly the most logical conclusion.

       Have you ever heard of Gille de Rais?  He fought with Joan of Arc and became the richest man in Europe.  In his spare time he raped, murdered and ate children.   There are serial killers who have engaged in such depravities.  Eg Nathaniel Bar Jonah raped little boys, ate them, then fed the leftover meat to people at cookouts.   Some of our elites are least as depraved as your average serial killer.  They have no problem supporting policies that kill
       <em>
        millions
       </em>
       of children.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also an interesting infatuation with these people toward cannibalism and pigs aka longpork. (human flesh).   John spoke fondly of his time working at a slaughter house for pigs in college; he used to have a picture of a butchered pig as his screensaver until colleagues demanded he remove it; he has cannibal artwork on his wall; Tony Podesta has a sculpture of a half-human half pig creature giving birth to little piglets in his living room (along with the artwork of dead children and photos of nude children in his bedroom); Tony forwarded John an email of a butchered pig from Alefantis with the text "party time!"; Kleinman references both pedophilia and cannibalism in her music videos; and both Alefantis and Tony are friends with spirit cooker Marina Abramovich, who is obsessed with cannibalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I think the people in this pics are cannibals?   Probably not.   But it's really only class and normalcy bias that's preventing you from acknowledging the possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Franklin scandal included testimony about cannibalism, and the pedo scandals in Europe included testimony about VIP's murdering children.

       You are using a common pizzagate tactic: saying that it has happened before means that this is worth investigating. That's not how it works, with that logic you have just as much reason to investigate
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       . You don't go destroying reputations and putting people in danger with that kind of weak argument.

       Sure, many of these people have artistic tastes that I find inappropriate, but that does not mean they are pedophiles. Think of it this way: if someone put your browser history for the last 3 years on the web and cherry picked only the worst things you viewed or said online, what conspiracy theories could be made up about you?

       Wtf does that have to do with a couple of risque IG posts?  No lie, researching serial killers is one of my favorite past times.  I'm more well versed in the depravities of human nature than 99% of the population I can assure you.  If pizzagate had even a shred of coherent evidence I'd be all over this puppy.  I swear to fucking god.  Don't fucking post pictures of random kids holding cats on the internet and tell me this somehow relates to infamous child cannibals and torturers.  You know as well as I do this looks fucking retarded.

       Neoliberal democrats are already fairly close to establishment republicans minus the religion. Many democrats never really lost. Their portfolios are all going to do just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The losers are the anti-establishment folks on both sides really. The right got swindled, or at least, forgot they weren't voting for a libertarian, and the left, the actual left and not the moderate right that calls themselves the left, they lost big time. After the DNC worked with Hillary and the media to help steal the primary, many on the left were without someone to vote for. Some voted for Hillary to at least end up with a better supreme court, but many didn't vote, or only voted in local elections like myself. The moment Hillary won the nomination I knew Trump won the election. What a shit candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, young people are, or were largely secular, and so largely very progressive and socially libertarian. Pizzagate is pushed by mostly young naïve people that grew up sheltered and never really went out much. I was once a socially awkward teen and had socially awkward friends and none of us were religious, but we also had no problem with weird things and counter culture. We loved them! I don't know what's happened that has made some of the young of today so crazy as to see some of the things they do in these e-mails and instagram pictures. They surely have never had queer friends or been to the queer side of their town, and they surely have never been to a punk show or a dive bar or counterculture in general. They are obviously not artists of any sort. All humor is lost of them and they are interpreting every single thing they see literally and without considering context or anything. It's weird seeing a new generation of young right wingers happen all of a sudden. It has me a little worried about the future.

       I read your comment, and I agree with what you say.

       However, regarding Pizzagate, the issue I have is the seeming inclusion of underage children.  I am very liberal, and I have several gay friends, but I have never seen any of them make inappropriate comments regarding children.  I have been to punk shows and dive bars, but I never say sexual innuendo involving children.

       I have. It was relatively easy to joke about that stuff before pizzagate. Maybe it's because I'm morbid and childfree. I don't know. None of the jokes I see are outright talking about sex with children. Honestly? Seeing kids hit a piñata full of condoms and lube is pretty damn funny because they were expecting candy and don't know what any of that stuff is. Parties for little children are mostly for the adults anyway. At least they were before everyone was a helicopter attachment parent. People forget that.

       If you examine the "hotard" posting, it's pretty easy to see that they definitely are not calling the baby a "hotard".  The user @joewills tells @jimmycomet that he is his new favorite hashtagger, and then tags that comment with #hotard.  @jimmycomet tags him back with #hotard.  They're pretty clearly talking to each other, and not commenting on the baby (which is the goddaughter of Alefantis, from what I understand).

       exist on the original Instagram posting.  A pizzagate investigator overlaid that on to the original photo in an attempt to make it look like they were referring to the baby as a "hotard"
      </p>
      <p>
       The "baby for sale" pic was not a baby at all, it was a doll.  And $1200 is way too expensive for a doll, which is exactly what is stated in the comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       "chickenlover" is tougher to dismiss, but I'm still more inclined to think that it's an inside joke (even if it's a pedophilia joke in extremely poor taste) than to assume that Alefantis is alleging some kind of sexual attraction to the toddler.  That is just my interpretation, though.

       Most of these aren't that bad. Someone jokes about a dead baby once or twice? Eh. 
The only one I find creepy is the condom pinata one. Little kids shouldn't be used in props for jokes like that. It's exploitative.

       That's the problem.   It's not just "once or twice."   The people in the comet circle are
       <em>
        constantly
       </em>
       making "jokes" about pedophilia and worse.   They are literally obsessed with the topic.   Now maybe it's true that they're just a bunch of depraved weirdos who have never acted out their fantasies, but when you add in the Podestas and other aspects of the case it becomes more difficult to dismiss.  I I
       <em>
        hope

       this is all smoke and no fire, I really do.

       Nah. You are curating these posts and you can only pull a few off of their instagrams where they have tons of pics. 
Many of the pics you are posting in this topic aren't about pedophilia. Dead baby jokes do no equal pedophilia, and joking about dead babies is actually a fairly common thing to do because it is fun to joke about breaking taboos. That one with the girl who has a cat on her also just appears to be a pic a dad is posting of his daughter with a cat on her chest because it is cute.

       Again, the only one that I find really dodgy is the condom pinata one. That is too "edgy."

       You may be right (I didn't assemble these pics, some guy on voat did).   I think the reason people are concerned is that the people they hang around with
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       have a really weird habit of making "jokes" about pedophilia (about kids they
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       ) and dead babies, make art about cannibalism and pedophilia, collect art about cannibalism and dead kids and pedophilia etc.   It's just not something most people do.   So when it's happening in high places and there is a history of law enforcement covering up pedo rings people are naturally suspicious.   They could easily dispel all these rumors by simply explaining themselves instead of lying about "fake news."

       You say you are getting the pictures through voat, this is probably why you think they have an 'obsession' with this stuff. Think about how much stuff there is on alefantis, there is like 3 or 4 photos on his Instagram people have pulled but how many pictures on his Instagram did he have. Careful about throwing accusations around  like saying people have an 'obsession with pedophilia' when you don't even have the proper knowledge to say something like this.

       Curating? Its a common theme or you wouldnt be able to curate it. Curating can mean Evidence management, the administration and control of evidence related to an event so that it can be used to prove the circumstances of the event. If we could hack into a hard drive for any of these degenerates and found a few child porn images, would you defend them saying its only a few files out of the 7 million files on the harddrive?

       You missed the point. there is plenty of circumstantial evidence for people to see everyone involved in pizza gate is sick and fucked in the head. the kids with condoms is enough for investigation. you and youre buddies are overly dismissive . at what point does this circumstantial evidence add up to the point where you see reason for concern? Personally I think some of you fuckers are here just for damage control on this shit.

       I have no buddies here and I am not overly dismissive. If you are claiming there is a massive satanic pedophile ring involving Hillary Clinton and a pizza shop in DC, you better have some strong evidence because that requires a high burden of proof and a few pics from a drag queen's Instagram of a still of gay porn photoshopped with pizza or an instagram pic of some\ random person making a joke about a sign in McDonalds that says "hanging station" instead of "changing station" is not very good evidence.
Condom pinata pic is a tasteless joke and it makes fun of sexual abuse and the person that posted that has a warped sense of humor and he shouldn't use kids as props like that. The rest of this stuff is not very compelling though.

       There's not enough for prosecution but there's enough for investigation.we know that pedo rings exist in D.C. , it seems the pizza gate crew are perverts who have a thing for kids based on their own posts. Call it bad taste but you can't dismiss it all. At some point you need to realize these creeps opened themselves up to criticism.  If you had kids would you let any of these freaks babysit them?

       This is stupid. He was posing with his nephew. They both like eating chicken. For fuck's sake, there's

       lol.   Are you serious?   Alefantis is gay.  Chickenlovers is well known slang in the gay community for a homosexual pedo.   Also Alefantis used the patron Saint of pederasty for his instagram image.

       If you weren't a pedophile you wouldn't know that phrase just like most people don't. It's such a simple and innocuous phrase to put together without talking about pedophilia just type chicken lover into Google and you will see.  There's a restaurant, shoes described as 'chicken lovers shoes', 2 Facebook pages about chickens both called chicken lovers.
Also kids just like chicken you might call them chicken lovers.

       I admit it, you're right.  The "hotard" definition occurs more than once in Urban Dictionary.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why would an obviously obscure term like "hotard" occur so many times on Urban Dictionary, and common slang like "chickenlover" would not occur once?
      </p>
      <p>
       So now let's dive deeper into the meat of the subject, no pun intended.  What are you trying to posit with your explanations of "hotard" and "chickenlover"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think two grown men would be calling one of the guy's infant goddaughter a "hotard"?  Is she promiscuous, is she retarded, or is it both?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think Alefantis would comment "chickenlover" on a picture of a man holding an infant?
      </p>

       I'm curious to hear your explanations.

       Well, if Alefantis and the Comet crew and the Podestas want to explain what they meant (and in the case of John and Tony, provide proof of where they were on the date of the McCan disappearance) then no one's stopping them.   It's entirely in their hands.

       Why would they lend any legitimacy to this nonsense? And even if they did provide proof of where they were, be honest, you would just say, "The proof is clearly faked" or "That just means they had someone else do it" or "That doesn't explain all of these other things".

       Well, it's worth a shot.   I for one would be happy to learn that people are just making false connections.   The pizzagate stuff isn't going anywhere.   Instead of lying about "fake news" they should just explain themselves.   Talk specifically about the concerns people have.   Shouldn't be that difficult.   I am willing to bet that a lot of the people currently researching this issue would cut their losses if they offer compelling explanations.   I know I would.

       I agree with you that this isn't fake news. Fake news is deliberately publishing false stories you know will get posted all over Facebook and generate clicks and ad revenue. This on the other hand is baseless conspiracy theory. Why would anyone feel like they have to respond to a bunch of college students and neckbeards who came up a theory based on some emails that didn't make sense to them?

       It's not baseless.   We have a bunch of people at the upper echelons of the Democratic Party who have a weird infatuation with pedophilia.   Naturally people are suspicious.   Whether there is any fire here to go along with the smoke is a different matter.   The pedo who designed the "girl lover logo" (butterfly) actually did an AMA on voat.   He said that after looking at the instagram images he is "100 percent" convinced that these people are pedos.   Apparently the FBI symbol for the butterfly logo derived from a female pedo web forum named "butterfly kisses."   I'd post the link but apparently people are being shadow banned for linking to Voat.

       There are a lot of people posting on the Vote forum who are survivors of pedo rings.   I don't think it's fair to describe everyone pursuing this in derogatory terms.   Unlike the pedo I am NOT "100 percent convinced" that pizzagate is real.   I just find a lot of this stuff really fucking suspicious.   If the alleged perps simply explained themselves then the whole thing would probably fizzle away.   Saying "fake news" is merely making everyone even more suspicious.

       And yet, about 99% of the countless replies to John's tweet were pizzagate related.  The top one was the police efit of the Podesta bros in the Maddie McCann case.   No one's gonna hire the guy ever again even in the unlikely event he's innocent.   A fitting end for a rotten scoundrel of a man and his pedo obsessed brother.

       Sorry dude but the wisest decision for the Podesta bros is to stay the fuck of the limelight and retire.   No one in politics is gonna want to associate with those creeps lest the stink of pedophilia wash over them.   Perhaps they can get a job with with Dyncorp or the Saudis trafficking little kids or something.

       Well, I'd say the utter cluster-fuck he made of the Clinton campaign is enough to disqualify him from that line of work forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you have to remember that pizzagate is (as of right now) a miniscule blip on the radar.  I know when you hang around here and voat and the other blogs that it seems like a big thing, but it's not.

       Consider that 90% of people still get their news from the MSM.  The only thing those people have learned from the MSM is that some fucktard took his gun into CPP "looking for child sex slaves".
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, you guys have probably made people in his line of work
       <em>
        more

       sympathetic to him.  They see him as a victim of a vicious smear campaign, put forth by anonymous neckbeards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm wrong, we'll see.  I really don't have a dog in the fight... I barely knew who the guy was before this campaign season.  I do, however, think you're missing a key piece of human DNA in your chromosomes if you think that ruining somebody "even if they're innocent" is honorable.  You should really go and fuck yourself for that.

       Podesta is human slime.   He helped rig the primary to get a war criminal elected.   He aided Bill Clinton in his atrocities in Serbia.  Also, have you looked into his history?   Abby Martin did a segment on him.   He and his brother are filth of the highest order.   He's about as "innocent" as Karl Rove.

       At the very least he must have known about what Hastert was up to and said nothing.   "Fleeing to a certain unnamed Japanese island."  Uh yeah.

       Unlike you guys, I'm not willing to troll through 600 pages of drag queen photos to cherry pick the ones that fit my narrative, but it looks to me like it's more like:

      <p>
       Alefantis -&gt; CPP employee -&gt; "Ms Summer Camp" -&gt; "Be_Resetta"
      </p>
      <p>
       ....so we're actually talking 3 degrees of separation now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that "Be_Resetta" appears to be a flamboyantly gay man, and there isn't a single photo on his Instagram that could be remotely connected to pedophilia... unless you're a jesus-jerker, and you think
       <em>

       iunno most of these are kind of a stretch. Definitely poor taste, but most are just pictures of stuff that anyone would find weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also the two cakes are clearly babies coming out of a vagina, not dead or anything, still gross but ive seen plenty of other people post pictures like that on FB and I did not assume those people ate babies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also confused who actually posted these pictures. Every picture linked to are different Instagram accounts. I may just be understanding this post wrong, but in a situation where we are looking for actual evidence and facts, I am curious to understand all the context.

       One or two pedophile or child killing jokes or pedophile art works or pedophile music videos I can understand.   But combined with the other Comet people we're now talking in the dozens.   These people are obsessed with pedophilia.   Let's hope it's just fantasy and nothing more.

       So if the media ignores a conspiracy it is because they are covering it up, but if they are not ignoring it is because they are afraid of it? Don't you see that in this what you are always confirmed on your conspiracy suspicions? Perhaps better to just ignore the MSM if you don't trust them.

       I can confirm this is the products of 2 decades of hardcore promotion of mediocrity, not always pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soon, there will be lot of videos of kids crying when receiving an empty box or a box of condoms, and the parents will be ROFLing in the background. Those people are sadistic morons but they're not all pedophiles though (just to add a precision.)

       That's the problem.   It's not just "once or twice."   The people in the comet circle are

       making "jokes" about pedophilia and worse.   They are literally obsessed with the topic.   Now maybe it's true that they're just a bunch of depraved weirdos who have never acted out their fantasies, but when you add in the Podestas and other aspects of the case it becomes more difficult to dismiss.  I I

       Why would they lend any legitimacy to this nonsense? And even if they did provide proof of where they were, be honest, you would just say, "The proof is clearly faked" or "That just means they had someone else do it" or "That doesn't explain all of these other things".

        Then Lore came along. When you're lost and frightened, you listen to any voice which promises change. Even if that voice insists on controlling you. That's what we wanted. Someone to show us the way out of confusion. Lore promised clarity and purpose. At the beginning, he seemed like a saviour. The promise of becoming a superior race, of becoming fully artificial, was compelling. We did everything he asked. But after a while, it became clear that Lore had no idea how to keep his promise. That's when he began talking about the need for us to make sacrifices. Before we realised it, this was the result. What happened to them? Lore began to experiment, trying to remake us in his image.

       But you have to remember that pizzagate is (as of right now) a miniscule blip on the radar.  I know when you hang around here and voat and the other blogs that it seems like a big thing, but it's not.

       Consider that 90% of people still get their news from the MSM.  The only thing those people have learned from the MSM is that some fucktard took his gun into CPP "looking for child sex slaves".

       If anything, you guys have probably made people in his line of work

       sympathetic to him.  They see him as a victim of a vicious smear campaign, put forth by anonymous neckbeards.

       Maybe I'm wrong, we'll see.  I really don't have a dog in the fight... I barely knew who the guy was before this campaign season.  I do, however, think you're missing a key piece of human DNA in your chromosomes if you think that ruining somebody "even if they're innocent" is honorable.  You should really go and fuck yourself for that.

       It's not baseless.   We have a bunch of people at the upper echelons of the Democratic Party who have a weird infatuation with pedophilia.   Naturally people are suspicious.   Whether there is any fire here to go along with the smoke is a different matter.   The pedo who designed the "girl lover logo" (butterfly) actually did an AMA on voat.   He said that after looking at the instagram images he is "100 percent" convinced that these people are pedos.   Apparently the FBI symbol for the butterfly logo derived from a female pedo web forum named "butterfly kisses."   I'd post the link but apparently people are being shadow banned for linking to Voat.

       There are a lot of people posting on the Vote forum who are survivors of pedo rings.   I don't think it's fair to describe everyone pursuing this in derogatory terms.   Unlike the pedo I am NOT "100 percent convinced" that pizzagate is real.   I just find a lot of this stuff really fucking suspicious.   If the alleged perps simply explained themselves then the whole thing would probably fizzle away.   Saying "fake news" is merely making everyone even more suspicious.

       Lemme tell you, I've been through every single piece of "evidence" you guys have dug up, and I can honestly say there is not
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       compelling item.  You guys started with the narrative that kids are being abused by Podesta/Clinton/CPP, and worked backwards from there.  That's not how "investigations" work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the title of this post, for Christ's sakes!  "Horrifying Comet Instagrams".  You gotta be fucking kidding me.  Every one of them is edgy hipster bullshit,
       <em>
        and they aren't even posted by people associated with CPP
       </em>
       .  That's not evidence, it's a witch hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why I'm going after you [edit: removed insult].  You've dragged
       <em>
        at minimum
       </em>
       50 people into this, doxxed their real identities, found out where the work, who their families are, etc, etc.  None of these people are related to this so-called "scandal".  Now, whenever somebody googles their name, they're going to be presented with these disgusting, revolting theories that have sprung out of the latent-pedo minds of pizzagaters.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I maintain my position, that you are a latent pedo POS, and I wouldn't let my own kids within 100 yds of you or your ilk.
