      <p>
       There is much wrong with the happenings and public mindset right now.
       <em>
        I'll try to illustrate a couple points simply.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        DNC:
       </strong>
       "Russia hacked us and exposed all our corruption; this led to trumps win.  This isn't right.. we must deny Trumps win.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Reality check:
       </strong>
       Whether or not Russia did the hack... the DNC's bad behavior and corruption was exposed either way.  Russia being the source or not SHOULD NOT OVERSHADOW the fact that the DNC/Hilary campaign are proven to be very very dirty.  There should be no argument for their favor here. Yet in smoke and mirrors we disregard the exposed corruption and still listen to the DNC narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Another absurd stance on things:
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        General HRC supporters and or Trump haters:
       </strong>
       "Wikileaks just hacked Hilary and not Trump.  This isn't fair and caused trump to win."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Reality check:
       </strong>
       This inherently is a broken mindset suggesting that you believe and accept corruption on BOTH sides.  Instead of reacting appropriately to the corruption exposed on the DNC we wonder where the exposure is on the RNC... Why do you accept corruption from the DNC? Why is your argument "well, we should have exposed the corruption on the RNC side to be fair.. but we didn't.. so Hilary should still win.."  What if there is no comparable corruption on the RNC side?  Accept the DNC corruption; react accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let your personal distaste for trump outweigh your understanding that the global elities controlling the DNC are corupt af!
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop living in a world where you accept corruption from both parties in your two party system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Convert "Why wasn't the RNC hacked tooooooo"  Into "Fuck, the DNC and Hilary are nasty... we need an alternative solution."
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        This whole moment in time is very confusing:
       </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         -MSM/DNC made the general public fear and hate trump prior to election.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         -DNC/Hilary exposed for being corrupt and players in the global elitist narrative prior to election.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         -Trump wins, traditionally, democratically.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         -General public (taught to fear and hate trump) freak out.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         -DNC "align" with the general public and try to secure their win with a failed recount attempt (displays that Trump has MORE votes than originally counted)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         -DNC's control over the narrative weakens as alt media and communities unravel the thread in this VERY messy situation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         -DNC pushes propaganda/censorship/fake news. (legislature including)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         -DNC/MSM label real news as fake and fake news as real.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         -Everyone in the country is confused.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         -A complete undermining of Democracy (peoples choice) underway as the DNC try to take the victory using an electoral change of heart.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         -Our democracy is on the verge of a literal failure.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Further more, if the DNC are trying to change the outcome and be reconsidered due to "rigging" of the outcome... CAN WE JUST INCLUDE BERNIE SANDERS IN THE MIX?  THE PRIMARIES WERE RIGGED BY THE DNC... if we are going to reconsider and take "rigging" into account... lets start with the primaries and hold another election with Sanders and Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I hope Trump and his cabinet of generals are just "playing nice" at the moment.  I hope that if/when he takes office they lay the smack down on evil/corruption in this country and prosecute Hilary/Podesta/and other global elitist puppets.

       Stay woke.

       Hey peeps thanks for all the thoughts.  This thread rocks.  I didn't really realize that I was suppressing all the real good conspiracy meat from the picture of the game above... so lets kick it!

       WTF is going on down there?... closed off for public excursions... 35 year treaties to stop fishing the waters (no witnesses)... Base 211, was it?  Nearly wiped out everyone in an american investigation A LOT of german submarine traffic and possible base.  An account of the event was that ships came straight up out of the water and flew faster then anything the americans had. ( relevant link:

       Is there some kind of meeting/arrival/awakening that has happened or is happening or is gunna happen in

       Buzz Aldren being the face of a first big jigsaw moment when we discovered whats on the dark side of the moon?  Some sort of old business face deal maker?

       Did that whole Buzz Aldren

       tweet post and quick deletion get debunked? Or was that some real human quick tweet of warning?
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeeze people, what if there is a big ass fight/business deal/sacrifice/contact between some Atlantian Aliens possibly based in
       <em>
        An Tart I CA/the dark side or inside of the moon
       </em>
       with humans and possibly another alien population riding in fast on Planet 9?
      </p>
      <p>
       Im personally hoping that there has been secret mind control illusion bull over us... So that way I will be blown away by our existence when a righteous species of Aliens rides into the skies on chariots of fire and remove the whole illusion.  It will feel so amazing restoring our most awesome human bodies and spirits to regain effectiveness in a whole new world of wonder, magic, and galactic communities.

       Yo so, whats up with these markets?  Dow nearly clearing 20,000 today?  Does this seem inflated?  Those global elites love a good market crash... well, looks like we have to rebuild it? Ah yes this "one world" currency idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is gold part of this?  Ok I'm reaching... but I recall like a decade ago while researching Nibiru (might be our Planet 9?) that a race of aliens have a natural home where the atmosphere is made of gold.  Was there a "booby trap" on the moon to alert some alien race that space travel was achieved by a lifeforms on earth and thus have refined the gold.  Was fort knox cleared out for a deal with these Aliens?

       THE FAR SIDE SLEEPY YARD: what if we can see some galactic happenings at certain times in certain places as the sun goes down.... The elite want to mask that so they we have chemtrails dropping the material for a canopy projection screen.  Im not talking your bulb loaded cinema projector... Im talking a
       <strong>
        Project Bluebeam
       </strong>
       something very much like what is used at the Starfire Optical Range for lidar and laser guide star experiments.  (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfire_Optical_Range">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfire_Optical_Range
       </a>
       &lt;---Really cool tech to see here btw)  They have a Lidar that is tuned to the sodium D2a line and used to excite sodium atoms in the upper atmosphere.  Seems easy enough to fake the stars at night... Maybe some
       <strong>
        chemtrail
       </strong>
       conspiracy leads there.  Pair it with a nice touch of
       <strong>
        HAARP.
       </strong>
       *oh yeah, datz real guud.  What was it today?  An aerosol in the atmosphere could cause a cool in temperatures...
"Yeah, we can't have any backlight for our projection screen.  oh? You're cold? Yeah the sun was nice there for a bit huh? Well why don't you just go put a coat on sweetheart!  The projection show is starting!"

       Trump is a part of the same system as Hillary.  That's the only disagreement I have with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the whole Trump vs. Hillary is being used to disguise the fact that there is no REAL difference in left vs. right.  Just what lies they tell their supporters they care about, when in reality, they're making backroom deals and inflating eachothers' pocketbooks and egos.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that whoever is president will preside over an economic disaster the likes of which have never been seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that the longer we spend time fighting Trump vs. Hillary, the less time we spend trying to fix a broken system that doesn't give a fuck about you and yours or me and mine, regardless of party lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, this is all reality TV meant to keep you entertained and placated and to give you something to talk about that's not the coming resource squeeze and economic crash.

       I'd rather it was that way too, for the record - even though I wrote in "no vote" on the presidential pick.

       We have a one party system in America that has a multiple personality disorder with the shadow government controlling it. Those people who believe in the illusion that elections matter are delusional. Trump might stir things up hopefully he'll straighten out this fake news bullshit but one can only hope.

       The establishment rigged the election.  Trump won anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over this period, we've learned that the establishment has their hands in child sex rings, regime changing soveriegn nations, and have been exploiting the US public for two or three decades.  Also, the establishment has ~1 billion in bribe payments from this election season alone they need to start getting square on that failed when Clinton lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides that, everyone is playing it cool like they aren't going to be going to jail, but then behind the scenes they are doing everything they can to stop Trump because they know exactly how much trouble they are in.  First the recounts failed, now they are saying the whole process was "hacked".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you know why they are playing it cool in the media but doing everything they can to stop him from actually taking office.

       Haha "Bernie". Didn't you read the emails? He was planning his campaign in conjunction with Hillary's. He existed for the sole purpose of getting millennials excited to vote. Trust me Bernie was not the savior you were looking for... look at his track record. Spoke nice, full of shit really, even Trump is better by quite a bit, policy wise.

      <p>
       Much of the current Conspiracy's are surrounding the global elite..  There is much surrounding "fake news" conspiracy's and "Russia propaganda" conspiracy's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had some thoughts on the grounds of these conspiracy's.. thus it has political points.

       I feel you.  Sorry to add to the torrent that is distracting us from the more fun conspiracy's.
