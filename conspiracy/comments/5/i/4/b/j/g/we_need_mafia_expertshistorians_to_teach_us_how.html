       There must be a way. I remember people in Italy (I think) posted up green signs or something like that to display their dedication to NOT paying anymore Mafia tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, we need to learn how to defeat the Mafia. It would be beneficial and can accelerate things for the people. If there are any historians here, please do tell.

       The "Mafia" AKA "The Organization" moved into Government.  They were never removed. They simply took over.  While Americans were busy fighting World War 1 &amp; 2, they moved their people into positions of power.  The only real opposition to their regime came when JFK was president, so they took care of him and have maintained their complete dominance and control ever since by controlling the position of president.  That is, until the internet came along and a new era of the peoples' press emerged resulting in the emergence of an outsider, Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the organization, and it's rule by pedophila-blackmail, is threatened.  They see their days are numbered.  And, as everyone knows, there is nothing more dangerous than an injured frightened wild animal.  These are truly amazing unprecedented times.

       Trump is supposed to look like an outsider to keep you distracted.  As long as you're fighting the Hillary vs. Trump battle, you fail to see the rich vs. you battle, and you're going to get buried just like the rest of us.

       At worst case, Trump should be looked at like a symbol.  Even if he is full of shit, he still ignited a spark in many American people that reminded us "yea.. We dont have to live this way.  We can stand up and do something about this."  Its a catalyst

       Yes, but so many people are hanging their hopes on Trump that they're left docile and without a real fight against the system.  Some of the loud ones are rabidly racist (not totally sure those people aren't still CTR in some cases and pumping up the already latent racism in the country) - but the point is Trump is a symbol, but we can not stop there.  If we leave Trump, the symbol, to his own devices, we're not any better off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think he's likely a part of the system, though.  I think that the whole Russian hack thing is propaganda to keep the left subdued, but in the end Trump will retain the presidency, and he'll keep the swamp filled.  We voted for someone different, we need to hold him accountable to truly be different.
