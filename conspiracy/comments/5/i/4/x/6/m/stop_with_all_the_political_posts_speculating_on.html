<p>tell me how are Trumps picks are a conspiracy?</p>

<p>the fact that DNC are trying to desperatly to dismantle the election is a clear sign to me he is not one of them. If anything I am worried he is unknowingly being inflitrated by NWO stooges that will do their best to destroy him from within.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to agree with OP - the speculation isn&#39;t going to go anywhere.  There simply isn&#39;t enough information.  If somebody leaked some emails from Trump / his staff, then maybe I could see some formulation of a conspiracy.  It is important to publicly vet the people that Trump appoints, for sure - but beyond that, there really isn&#39;t much substance to speculate a major conspiracy beyond &quot;he will / will not be establishment&quot;.</p>

<p>i understand what you are trying to say, but you&#39;ve really oversimplified these concepts in your mind.  that comes across as a very &quot;low information&quot; thing to say.</p>

<p>His appointees (including his VP) have a history behind them.  Even though Trump himself can make excuses as &quot;a businessman&quot; we&#39;re talking about people who can be evaluated at face value for their actions.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a waste of time to evaluate the team of &quot;very very smart people.  very very smart...&quot; that he is putting together to run his administration.  Ignorance is not an admirable quality. </p>

<p>Throughout his campaign and throughout his life, he has touched on some topics that have been prevalent among partisan and/or political conspiracy theorists for years. His campaign team also made some statements/tweets on the same notes. </p>

<p>Some conspiracy theories are of a political nature, in some cases directly and in some cases loosely. And then there are additional conspiracy theories that Trump has essentially tricked millions of people by pretending to believe in certain political/economic conspiracy theories. So theories based on theories based on theories sort of tunnel. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s even using conspiracy &quot;theory&quot; loosely as a term itself, since in some cases it&#39;s theory, and in some cases it&#39;s simply observations of something that few want to acknowledge. </p>

<p>And then anyway, on top of all that, he won the vote for presidency, so now he&#39;s an even bigger deal than he was even just a few months ago. And now there are additional conspiracy theories being rolled out in regards to Russian involvement, as well as the CIA and FBI throwing down covertly over the election, etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also not really used to conspiracy theory communities receiving so much attention or traffic, although I&#39;m fairly new to this place in particular. But if it was like what I&#39;m more familiar with, a smaller community that gets almost no traffic/attention and mostly discusses aliens, secret society, ancient civilizations, etc and then is suddenly, utterly flooded with political conspiracy theory talk, then I guess I can see how that would be really obnoxious to long-time regulars. </p>

<p>Oh totally.</p>

<p>I&#39;m <em>so</em> fucking sick of hearing about the damn election. Honestly, the guy could fucking get us nuked and I could deal with it, as long as I don&#39;t have to see a billion posts about it every day.</p>
