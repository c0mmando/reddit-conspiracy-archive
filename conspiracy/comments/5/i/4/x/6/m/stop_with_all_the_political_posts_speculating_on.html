       Given that Trump is the first president-elect to even question 9/11, WMDs, MSM bias, The Federal Reserve, Corporate Lobbiests, etc - I'm not surprised to find Trump-related conspiracy theories.

       the fact that DNC are trying to desperatly to dismantle the election is a clear sign to me he is not one of them. If anything I am worried he is unknowingly being inflitrated by NWO stooges that will do their best to destroy him from within.

       I have to agree with OP - the speculation isn't going to go anywhere.  There simply isn't enough information.  If somebody leaked some emails from Trump / his staff, then maybe I could see some formulation of a conspiracy.  It is important to publicly vet the people that Trump appoints, for sure - but beyond that, there really isn't much substance to speculate a major conspiracy beyond "he will / will not be establishment".

       there's plenty of information.  look at his appointees and their history.  why do you want to judge people on what they say rather than what they do?  these are salespeople.

       I already addressed this - it only leads to two avenues: either he will be establishment or he won't be.  I see the argument that he will be establishment, for sure.  But I also see plenty of evidence that he may not be (and it is more than just "he said this"; its about reading the behavior of the whole system, not just one person).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, that is ALL of the information we have right now and it is inconclusive either way.  We are just wasting bandwidth arguing over it until we get some more information.

       i understand what you are trying to say, but you've really oversimplified these concepts in your mind.  that comes across as a very "low information" thing to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       His appointees (including his VP) have a history behind them.  Even though Trump himself can make excuses as "a businessman" we're talking about people who can be evaluated at face value for their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a waste of time to evaluate the team of "very very smart people.  very very smart..." that he is putting together to run his administration.  Ignorance is not an admirable quality.

       My guess is that this is a tactic being used to keep certain topics from being exclusively focused on. I mean, there is suddenly a political thread a minute and strangely people are discussing candidates as if they are separate entities. Remember,  if you think politics matter you are in the wrong sub. Politics is nothing but a smoke screen for small minds to argue over

       Throughout his campaign and throughout his life, he has touched on some topics that have been prevalent among partisan and/or political conspiracy theorists for years. His campaign team also made some statements/tweets on the same notes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some conspiracy theories are of a political nature, in some cases directly and in some cases loosely. And then there are additional conspiracy theories that Trump has essentially tricked millions of people by pretending to believe in certain political/economic conspiracy theories. So theories based on theories based on theories sort of tunnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's even using conspiracy "theory" loosely as a term itself, since in some cases it's theory, and in some cases it's simply observations of something that few want to acknowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then anyway, on top of all that, he won the vote for presidency, so now he's an even bigger deal than he was even just a few months ago. And now there are additional conspiracy theories being rolled out in regards to Russian involvement, as well as the CIA and FBI throwing down covertly over the election, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not really used to conspiracy theory communities receiving so much attention or traffic, although I'm fairly new to this place in particular. But if it was like what I'm more familiar with, a smaller community that gets almost no traffic/attention and mostly discusses aliens, secret society, ancient civilizations, etc and then is suddenly, utterly flooded with political conspiracy theory talk, then I guess I can see how that would be really obnoxious to long-time regulars.

       Same shit, different day, no matter what the twatwaffle does with his new power, I doubt it could be any worse than W's reign of terror, the world will keep on turning regardless.

       I just don't get why people latched on to this dude so much. (Note: I'm not American, so no horse in this race either way)

       Entertainment value alone? Perceived wild card factor?

       In all seriousness, the absolute worst I would have expected from a Clinton presidency would have been more of the same. We survived Obama and Bill ok.

       I already addressed this - it only leads to two avenues: either he will be establishment or he won't be.  I see the argument that he will be establishment, for sure.  But I also see plenty of evidence that he may not be (and it is more than just "he said this"; its about reading the behavior of the whole system, not just one person).

       The fact is, that is ALL of the information we have right now and it is inconclusive either way.  We are just wasting bandwidth arguing over it until we get some more information.
