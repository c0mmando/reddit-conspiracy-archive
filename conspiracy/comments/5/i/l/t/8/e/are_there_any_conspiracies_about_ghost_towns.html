       Hey all, first time poster. I grew up outside a former lumber company town by the name of Selleck in Washington State. After being mostly burned down in 1930 and then all the Japanese people interned during World War II, it's now a ghost town with only 15 homes and about 100 people living there. The whole town is owned by one man, who has no online presence whatsoever and none of his official business filings include a number of contact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never met anybody from this town, I've never met anybody who knew anybody from this town and its official town signage claims there is only a population of 1 person, despite people obviously living there. My only connection to the town is that I have been chased out of the town while driving through their in the middle of the night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly enough, the town is located right outside the fence of the King County (Seattle Area) water shed and from multiple angles there are night vision cameras posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is, are there any known instances of the government hiding facilities in ghost towns, especially on the pacific coast? My thinking is that if they wanted to have weapons pointed at Russia, towns like this would be the perfect hiding space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any information is appreciated.

       That's the really strange thing, there is no information whatsoever besides what is known up until about 1940.
      </p>
      <p>
       The person who owned it now inherited it from his father, who bought the town for the purpose of opening both a Christian University and a logging theme park, neither of which ever happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only other known information about the owner is that King County sued him for building on a historical site without a permit. Aside from that, the guy is basically a ghost.

       Meh. From what I can see the place folded in 1939. But the current owner at that time was said to have revolutionized the practice.

       So unless they had the same problems that Schaefer had....

       Well take it with a grain of salt. The wiki (I know.) states that the town was a logging company owned by Pacific States Lumber. Searching this directs you to the Pacific Lumber Company.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1931 the president of the company Stanwood Murphy takes over and tells his guys to basically not rape the land. They wouldnt cut down every tree they saw, and save the younger ones to be cut down at a later date to maximize profits from that area. 8 years later Selleck folds.

       Correct, there has been no logging in the area since then. After it was sold by the IRS to the Schaefer family, it stopped being a town and is now a part of Unincorporated King County, but has a Ravensdale Address. Ravensdale is a sister city of both Hobart and Maple Valley, the three of them make up the Tahoma School District. However, Tahoma School District's jurisdiction ends right where the watershed begins, so the children who live there (which there are some who live there, they can be seen on street view in gmaps) have no school district which covers them.

       It's not a true deserted town. The Schaefer family lives in what was the schoolhouse back when it was still a company town. They rent out the remaining 15 remaining homes. The town's signage officially says "Population 1" but it's more likely about 50-75 people live there.

       My friend and I were hiking in Wyoming, near the border of Colorado a few years ago. After hopping a chicken wire fence near a highway, we did some light rock climbing up a big hill that had two big, monolithic, stones that could be seen from the road. But once we got to the top, we discovered the stones were made from drywall and paint and cheap paint. All they were was a prop blocking some electrical conduits and what seemed like an airduct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Behind it was a small dirt road that couldn't be seen from below. On one side it lead down to a big silver dome like thing that we could see of in the distance in the desert, and the other lead to a big building. We didn't go all the way to it, but we got close enough to see that the building was fake. No windows, despite being newer looking. From our perspective it looked like four walls propped up to look like a house from the distance with a roof over it, but hollow inside. And no, it wasn't under construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a few minutes we saw a guy come out from this structure and appear to be looking our way. He scoped us a bit before getting into a truck that was parked near by and started driving toward us. We turned around and started making our way back down the hill. We would have been nearly halfway down by the time he reached the fake stones we found.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOTE: I do have pics of all this, but I'll have to get them off of a flash drive. This happened back in 2011.

       There is a website listing the Washington ghost towns and you can search by county. I live in Richland Washington and the only ghost towns near me are white bluffs and a few others. That land is now part of the Hanford nuclear site, and civilians cannot access it unless given permission.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to live on the west side and I can tell you that a lot of towns there were abandoned because they became obsolete due to their economy changing or simply where a train station/ tracks were built.

       Found this link here talking about a completely fake city created specifically to hide the Manhattan Project testing. Interesting article. More so I'm interested in finding out if the government has ever repurposed cities instead of just creating them.

       No idea about ghost towns in the US, but they definitely exist in Australia. Not only that, but ancient ruins exist deep in the outback and the bush..Only a few aboriginals know how to find some of these places but I doubt that the elders would ever take white men there.

       Living in one of the next towns over, we had no culture whatsoever. When it was too cold to smoke weed in the woods, we would drive out there at night to creep ourselves out. Everybody who was ever chased out was always chased out by a white truck.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, it's in the middle of nowhere. It's located at the very end of Kent Kangley, which is an intercity road that roughly cuts from Des Moines (on the Puget Sound) to Selleck. The road ends in Selleck, but the final portion of it is blocked off.

       What do you mean when you say chased out? Like he said to leave? Blocked the road? Pulled a gun? Can't really give meaningful feedback if you don't give meaningful answers.

       We drove through the roundabout one night about 11 pm (about 10 years back). As we pass the school and around the curve back towards Four Corners, a white truck begins following us, and it's speeding. It followed us all the way out to the Ravensdale Post Office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another time, my buddy was chased out of town by this truck and when going around a corner, crashed into a person's fence.

       Oh yeah, pretty much everybody who went to Tahoma has stories about getting chased out of Selleck, all of them by the white truck. Most kids I grew up with were forbidden from ever going there.

       For a town where nothing suspicious is happen, they sure do enjoy filming and chasing outsiders. I have been through many other poverty stricken towns, not a single other one besides Selleck has night vision cameras recording you as you enter the town and pass the schoolhouse.

       Have you ever tried going back now as an adult? I wonder if the guy has bought a new, white truck. Maybe go in the middle of the day, with a friend who's filming?

       I haven't gone back since I was maybe 21, just drove through there as a lark. Selleck is exactly the same as it was then, but the surrounding areas all are different. Twin Peaks is pretty accurate for how that area used to be. Now it's just the same as everywhere else. 
That whole area has undergone a spiritual death that is depressing to see.

       I know I'm 3 months late to this post but I have to mention something. My ex boyfriend grew up in Hobart/Maple Valley and he told me a couple of stories about when he was a teenager (late 1980's-early 1990's) and him and his friends would go exploring in the area. He said they were "chased" out of weird area near the watershed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't thought about this is such a long time, I remember he seemed honestly shaken up over it when retellling the story, like him and his friends were pretty spooked.

       Interesting that you mention hidden facilities because my ex's dad worked for Boeing on a lot of confidential projects and the only thing my ex knew was that the projects had to do with underground structures.
