        just curious. since it's night in hong kong and day in new york, what is your brilliant idea for how a flat planet would accommodate that? giant curtains? and how does the sun set over this giant plate of a world when people in new york are looking at a sunset and in hawaii it's noon?

       A crescent moon is caused by the moon's own form shadow, according to globe earth theory. 
Even for the theory of which you are a proponent of, you don't even have the details straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       day night cycles on a flat earth could be caused by a relatively low moving sun close to the earth's surface, which would give rise to perspective convergence as the sun moves away from you. also intensity of the sun light could factor, as light has exponential falloff of intensity the further from the source you are.

       I remember when it started. Some guy made a joke website ala "dihydrogen monoxide" and a few people joined for the lulz. Fast forward two decades and it's a serious thing.

       Lol.
It started when people could make observations and form logical conclusions. So, from the beginning of humanity.

       The flat earth conspiracy. I remember the first website, it was written tongue in cheek and was funny. Now people actually expect others to take it seriously. It was never meant to be taken seriously. Ahh the good old days of the net.

       In my post above, I should have clarified: the modern incarnation.

       So some random person, once upon a time, mocked the flat earth theory on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing else to be inferred from your experience. Any other conclusion you made, like "it all started there", is unfounded.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is most certainly the case that another random person on the internet wrote about flat earth in a different light.

       why would someone deny that the sun and moon are round, when you can look into the sky and clearly see that they are round?
      </p>
      <p>
       why would someone deny that the earth is flat when they can look at their immediate surroundings and see that it is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the burden to prove the earth round, if you believe it to be so. When the evidence of simple observation around you says the earth is flat, and only second hand knowledge sways you to think otherwise, why wouldn't there be doubts?

       sigh. when they post stuff like this you know they're not even trying.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Shadows and Sticks
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you stick a stick in the ground, it will produce a shadow. The shadow moves as time passes. If the world had been flat, then two sticks in different locations would produce the same shadow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the Sun's rays hitting two sticks, some distance apart. If the Earth were flat, the resulting shadows would be the same length, no matter how far apart you place the sticks.
But they don’t. This is because the earth is round, and not flat."

       These structures were the tallest in many towns back in the day, and some still survive. Liquids assume a perfect spherical shape, i assume because of surface tension and gravity interacting, but I actually dont know the real reason why. If The earth is composed of significant amount of water, then, despite the accompanying lithosphere, the globe shape would be assumed in the same way the lead shot is formed in the shot towers

       Every time someone brings this up I say:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Earth was flat everyone would see the same stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are in New Zealand you cannot see the North Star.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason you don't see the North Star is because the world is round and blocks the view of it.

       But no one ever replies back to me.
