<p>Post any document you wish, even the Declaration of Independence. Anyone who knows shit about photoshop or any editing program can make all kinds of edits, floating fields, add dates, change wording, add people. Anything.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be happy to add Gilbert Gottfried as a co-signer of the Declaration to prove the point.</p>

<p>Image editing, word editing, and photo editing are very advanced.</p>

<p>In fact, you can even edit videos or live streams of actual people and their responses and facial movements.</p>

<p>It is very hard to find truth these days.</p>

<p>Yeah this one is different though. It&#39;s the &quot;original,&quot; but it&#39;s not the <em>original</em> &quot;original.&quot; The one that was up years ago actually had the photoshop layers still programmed into the file, so you could see the (poor) edit job they did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you mean. The original &quot;original&quot; didn&#39;t even load all at once and you could see the different edits layer on top of eachother as you opened the document. The original &quot;original&quot; was also in higher resolution so you could zoom in until the pixel variations were extremely obvious where the edits were done.

That&#39;s the link you just posted. Honestly this doesn&#39;t mean anything. Could&#39;ve been scanned to pdf with OCR on. Do you happen to have a link to the original original so i can check it out? There are incredible wide claims here by people who seem to know very little of pdf&#39;s and image editing. </p>
