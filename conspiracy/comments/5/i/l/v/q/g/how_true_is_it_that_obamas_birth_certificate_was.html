       It was not that the Birth Certificate was fake. It was that the image offered as documentation of the existence of an original long form Birth Certificate was contrived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not even the lady who ran the records office in Hawaii seemed able to come up with the actual original or certified copy thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       The digital form offered by the WH was clearly a forgery.

       I'm no expert in PDF's or photoshop, but even I know enough to flatten an image when you're all done with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't even finish their work and released that document with all the fields floating and able to be swapped at leisure.  You can tell I don't know all the technical stuff anymore but I do remember that simple idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       There should be no way a document that old should have any possibility of modification, especially after all the pressure to release it, when it comes out....

       You also, then, would know that ANYONE can later alter a document and create their own layers and floating fields without hindrance?
      </p>
      <p>
       Post any document you wish, even the Declaration of Independence. Anyone who knows shit about photoshop or any editing program can make all kinds of edits, floating fields, add dates, change wording, add people. Anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be happy to add Gilbert Gottfried as a co-signer of the Declaration to prove the point.

       Image editing, word editing, and photo editing are very advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, you can even edit videos or live streams of actual people and their responses and facial movements.

       It is very hard to find truth these days.

       It's one thing when some "whistleblower" anonymous emails you a copy, or you find it online in a dodgy forum link... but it's another matter entirely when it's a direct download from WH.gov.

       You believe that even if the president of the United States releases a document and posted on the Gov't website, no one should bat an eye at the fact that it could have been forged?

       Yeah this one is different though. It's the "original," but it's not the
       <em>
        original
       </em>
       "original." The one that was up years ago actually had the photoshop layers still programmed into the file, so you could see the (poor) edit job they did.

       The copy was quickly replaced after it was discovered.

       I know what you mean. The original "original" didn't even load all at once and you could see the different edits layer on top of eachother as you opened the document. The original "original" was also in higher resolution so you could zoom in until the pixel variations were extremely obvious where the edits were done. The edits are still obvious to anyone that has eyes.

       That's the link you just posted. Honestly this doesn't mean anything. Could've been scanned to pdf with OCR on. Do you happen to have a link to the original original so i can check it out? There are incredible wide claims here by people who seem to know very little of pdf's and image editing.

       I have it backed up.  I checked and laughed, I thought it was over for Obama at the time.  Then when Brietbart said he would release something in 1 week, turned up dead.....I changed my tune a bit.

       No, Breitbart announced he would release Obama birth certificate information and turned up dead after that.

       It was an obvious fake to anyone that bothered to scrutinize it. Totally acceptable for the masses. The MSM makes people believe the obsurd and disregard the obvious. Talk about "fake news"!

       I don't know but they only have 2 experts on their side.  I'm going to want at least 98% of all experts to weigh in on their side or I'll find at least 3% that side with me and I'll plug my ears and close my eyes.

       Both of you disappoint me. First watch the presentation that covers how the forensics were performed,it was on fox given by the lead investigator not a fox talking head .  Don't wait for someone else to tell you. It's easy to understand if you're u watch. Go look. There's absolutely no way it can't be a fake manipulated document. Second, scientific consensus does not exist nor is it needed when the fraud can be dissected forensically and proven. They have far more than two experts on their side. They had two different teams loooking at the evidence independently. Both found for fraud .

       You don't need mass consensus for something to be true. You won't get that mass consensus if it goes against the narrative.
