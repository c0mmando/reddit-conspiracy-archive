       The more the MSM implies Trump needs the CIA's intel briefings and the more he refuses, I feel like he's on to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA is in effect a shadow government that to date has been beyond any one president's control. Trump won't fall in line. Why should he?
      </p>
      <p>
       Truman warned us about the CIA years ago. You think all the shady stuff stopped after Iran-Contra? They just got better at hiding it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump should gut, even abolish, the CIA as far as I'm concerned.

       Interesting point - the vocal part of the cia seems to be trying to sabotage trump.  I hadn't drawn the connection between Trump not doing the intelligence briefings and the cia leading the Russia hacking claims.  Good catch

       Trump has to be controlled opposition, he acts like he's anti CIA yet his cabinets consists of a few Skull and Bones Members. Trump acts like he doesn't care about the Bushes yet G. Bush SR is a skulls member.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump bashes Obama yet Obama and Trumps cabinet both contain a few members from Goldman Sachs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Trump is going to be the false flag/sacrificial lamb that brings NWO a step closer.

       Nice catch. Also on that same line of thinking, Trump wants to try and work with Putin, and the CIA has been fighting proxy wars against Russian influence since just after world war 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA cant have total control of the drug trade in and out of these various regions if we suddenly start working with Russia in some sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       This ties together their blaming of Russia for the alleged hacks, despite the widespread agreement that it was an internal leak. They are trying to position Russia as a villain so Trump won't be able to build a working relationship with Putin without strong criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The seeds have already been planted to imply Trump has financial interest in Russia. This way they can blame his cooperation with Putin on corruption as opposed to trying to resolve a long standing conflict.

       Proxy wars is similar to cold wars, they bring money into thrMilitary Industrial complex cycle. The CIA budget is massive. They need perpetual growth to keep it going.

       After seeing his picks for cabinet you still think he will in any way do anything other than fall in line? His only plans are to fuck the american people in a slightly different way than hillary would have.

       Jesuits are parasites that infiltrate religion, governmenrs, media etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the CIA, it's origins came from the OSS, but then the Jesuit order dismantled and infiltrated the OSS. One CIA was established in the 40's, it was time to for them to bring other Jesuit leaders into America (Nazi leaders) known as operation paperclip. The shills at Wikipedia won't say nazi leaders but rather covert them as 'engineers, scientists, etc..'.
      </p>
      <p>
       TRUE some were actually anti Nationalist Socialist -Zionists (NAZI),  but few squeezed in under job titles.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have now is a satanic cult that uses catholicism as it's parasitic host, while migrating to many hosts such as the CIA and other entities.
