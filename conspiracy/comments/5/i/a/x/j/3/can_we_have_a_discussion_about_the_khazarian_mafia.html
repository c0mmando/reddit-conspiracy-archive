       My thought exactly, it's like the missing puzzle piece that connects everything together. Just like we are seeing people in power connected to satanism. The Khazarian mafia is so deeply linked to Satan that you could say that it's their
       <strong>
        identity
       </strong>
       . So if this is true it could give a whole new meaning to "Pizzagate".

       But this is why I'm weary and what more sources.

       There's definitely a lot of truth to that article, but also a lot of hyperbole.  It is omitting some major historical players that are also part of the "satanic elite."  If you're willing to go down another interesting rabbit hole you should research the Knights Templar.  Around the time of the Crusades the Templar travelled to Jerusalem, apparently looking for the Ark of the Covenant.  Historical evidence shows that there was a massive templar excavation under the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which apparently was the location of Solomon's Temple and the Ark.  They found something, returned and quickly became one of the most powerful and exceedingly wealthy forces of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just speculating here, but I believe they found a massive amount of gold and manuscripts containing ancient Egyptian mathematical/architectural knowledge (whatever the Ark was, it was smuggled out of Egypt).  For shortly afterwards there was an explosion in architecture in Britain and France, Chartres Cathedral being a good example.  The Templar used gold lending to increase their wealth and soon had multiple kingdoms indebted to them. There was also rumour that they began practicing occult rituals (possibly obtained from ancient manuscripts).  When their power became great enough to rival the King of France and the Church this would be used against them, as they were branded heretics and a massive witch-hunt began (on friday the 13th, the reason for the stigma around this day).  They went underground and it is speculated that the Freemasons emerging from Scotland were their successors.  It is interesting to note that many Freemason rituals involve worshipping the Ark of the Covenant, and a lot of other ancient Egyptian/Babylonian practices.  Since the most Ancient civilizations, it has always been extremely important to pass down mathematical/architectural knowledge as it has always been a clear path to power.  Kings require castles to retain their power, religious leaders require monuments to influence the public, banks need vaults to store gold.  This was how the Masons came to power.  Eventually the Bavarian Illuminati sook to unite the Masons and other secret orders such as the Priory of Zion which practiced occult, pre-christian religion.  Of course, the reason they were underground was for fear of persecution from the church, they united with the common goal of destroying Abrahamic religion, as they never forgot the fateful day of friday the 13th.  The "Satanic elite" you see today is the result of this centuries-old plan, no doubt the Khazarian Rothchild's are part of it, but they're just one of the many bloodlines involved.

       First I want to take you to this email
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
       I believe *
       <em>
        Gray Steven Fuller *
       </em>
       is some genetically engineered human
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Gray Steven Fuller is the creation of this man,
       <a href="http://archive.is/DrBuH">
        Steven Fuller
       </a>
       (read the article, it's strange.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The article says things like " We were noisily arguing about something—let's say Fuller's call for a fusion of Kantian ethics and utilitarianism"
      </p>
      <p>
       "In his public talk, Fuller defended transhumanism, the idea that humans should embrace genetic engineering and other technologies that can help us transcend our biological limits.""
      </p>
      <p>
       At various moments, he sounds like a socialist, Jesuit (and in fact he was raised Catholic
      </p>
      <p>
       His Book, The Intellectual was selected as a Book of the Year in 2005 by the UK liberal-left magazine, New Statesman. He periodically contributes a column to the Project Syndicate, associated with
       <strong>
        George Soros' Open Society project
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       For Fuller, transhumanism offers humanity the prospect "to
       <strong>
        re-engineer the human body
       </strong>
       to enable us to
       <strong>
        live longer
       </strong>
       so as to work and play harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe his goal was to Combine the genetics of these two men (hence the name Gray + Steven's Fuller. Look at the blog below.

      <p>
       Remember the article does say he said

        "but my version of paradise calls for radical social and cultural changes, and especially the end of militarism"

       It gets weirder trust me. Moving on from Steve Fuller.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the guy Gray Steven Fuller sends that rant to a guy David Frederick McCullar (still need to investigate who he is)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, David Frederick McCullar sends a weird email to

       Khazarians aren't real Jews. They pretend to be Jewish because Russia, in the ancient era, forced them to change religion from Baal worship to either Christian, Jewish, or Muslim. Most of them chose Jewish but there are fake Christians/Muslims around the world right now. I think Obama is faking his religion too. Later in history, they exterminated many of the real Jews through Hitler and the Nazis so they can totally take over the blood line. Then they formed Israel which is run 100% by the Khazarian Mafia and America/UK are basically colonies of Israel. Many people like the Bush's pose as Christians but they are pure blood Khazarian Baal worshippers. Mossad did 9-11 because Mossad is control by the Khazarian Mafia. They needed an excuse to trigger a war in the middle east that would eventually lead to a 3rd world war between Zion and the Arabs but things have gotten a bit sloppy. Ultimately, they want to spread so much misery that the world will fall to its knees and they will jump in to save the world. This is all laid out in the 25 Protocols of Zion which they claim to be a forgery. All of the major Western governments are Khazarian controlled but I believe Trump duped them and took over IF he is one of us. If not, then he is just a Khazarian plant. Also, the Khazarians are shitting bricks right now for all the exposure they have had this past year in general so that's good news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Khazarians specialize in infiltration. Even 1900 years ago, they had infiltrated every single country and taken posts of authority all over the place. They would sacrifice humans, loot, rape, and do every vile thing imaginable. This is why Russia had to step it. Russians are probably the most anti-Khazarians out there and have repeatedly thwarted the Khazarians in history so the Khazarians hate them although they had infiltrated Russia many times (IE Soviet Union era). These people are simply insane when its all said and done.

       David Ike refers to them as the Rothschild Zionists, but same thing. Maybe he didn't connect the dots to Khazar.

       Replied this to a comment but I'm also going to put this here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most astounding fact is that the people of Israel call themselves "gods people" and claim ownership over Palestine, you see whats happening there now
       <strong>
        BUT
       </strong>
       the fact is that they are not who they claim to be and they have been committing horrible atrocities that would put the holocaust to shame to lay claim to Palestine and hide the fact that they have no bloodline to the biblical Israelites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gamal Abdel Nasser, former president the United Arab Republic stated on television:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        you (the Jews) will never be able to live here in peace, because you left here black but came back white. We cannot except you.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The present day Jews are descendants of the Khazars. This has been shown many times over but the evidence is always either forgotten or actively sought out and hidden. See for example Henry Fords book that he spent millions on
       <em>
        The International Jew
       </em>
       . In the book the research shows that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Jews were
        <strong>
         NOT
        </strong>
        descendants of the Biblical Israelites.
Further in the book he claimed that:
 These Jews, committing all sorts of crimes while under the cover of being called "chosen people of the Bible", were rapidly taking economic and political control of America.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is easy to see. Israel has
       <strong>
        immense
       </strong>
       political power over America. Just one force for instance is AIPAC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at geopolitics with this in mind and you will start to see what is going on. The way America acts in the middle east can be explained with this and only this for Jews don't think highly of Islam. There is genocide going on in Palestine and nobody thinks that it's time to do something about it. The American media(which is almost wholly owned by Jews) has held a firm grip on American opinion on this matter, see
       <a href="https://youtu.be/w0LyN3ERpxo?t=1234">
        here

       It is right on the money. But i'm just concerned about the lack of citations coupled with the fact that finding info on this on your own is very hard. So if anyone has anything to back this up I'd really like to see it.

       They're supposed to cover all the important Empires when they teach ancient history in school but there's nary a mention of the Khazars or the Khazarian Empire during the time when they were a major force to be reckoned with in any of the basic textbooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were parked between Christendom and Islam in what is now the Ukraine and in order to avoid and not get caught up in the hostilities that were going on between those two empires decided to make Judaism their official religion and imported rabbis from Jerusalem to teach them.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be sure they were the source of many if not most of the Jews that spread across Europe when their empire fell as well being the source of most of the ones that moved to Israel who really had no hereditary claim, much less any right to steal the lands of the people who owned and had inhabited them for well over five hundred years.

       I researched a lot of the Khazarian Mafia history and I personally believe it to be real. It all comes together when you look at the big picture. They worship Baal and this is why you see so much satanic rituals and sacrifices to the God of Baal. They are the ones ruining the world because they believe all non-Khazarians were made by Baal to be slaves to the Khazarians so they do as they please. They don't want anything outside of power. It looks like Bush, Netenhyahu, Rothschild, and many others are high ranking members. There a few thousand of them max.

       After you read about the KM, you should be ready to read about the Jesuits &amp; the Black Pope. Here's a quick read which is one of the best I've found:

       You learn that this Jewish cabal everyone thinks the buck stops at, is just the cover for the Jesuit NWO. The cabal are just the thugs. If Satan had a throne it would be in the Vatican and he would be whispering in the black popes ear.

       Well you're right about them morphing into Jews but I'm unsure if they changed it to much, the Talmud is a quite disgusting piece of literature that is from Judaism. Talks about justified rape and such like.

       According to the article the KM use the Rothschild's as one of their front men. But then again this isn't necessarily as simple as that. But I mean the Khazarians are supposedly the founders of interest banking so called "money magick". The fiat and fractional reserve banking we have to day is only an extentsion of that. And I mean the Federal reserve which is a giant ponzi scheme wasn't even inducted normally.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1913, the Rothschild KM was able to establish a beachhead by bribing crooked, treasonous members of Congress to pass the illegal, Unconstitutional Federal Reserve Act on Christmas Eve without a required quorum. The Act was then signed by a crooked, bought off President, who was a traitor to America, like the members of Congress who voted for it.&gt;

       No, it's not a fact. It's wrong. In 1913, there were 96 senators, so a quorum is 49 sentators. 68 senators voted on the final bill. It passed
       <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04E3DB173DE633A25757C2A9649D946296D6CF&amp;amp;legacy=true">
        43 to 25
       </a>
       . An earlier version of the bill passed the Senate 54 to 34, and we know that if all senators voted, there would be an absolute majority for the final bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bill passed the House by an vote of 298 to 60. Woodrow Wilson ran for President with monetary and banking reform as one of his campaign planks. It was a very popular measure.

       It was Arthur Koestler's "the Thirteenth Tribe" that finally brought some public attention to the historical existence and importance of the Khazars and the Khazarian Empire that was strangely missing from the vast majority of history texts, especially those used in all the public and high schools. That, of course, became even more curious with the revelation that those Khazars from eastern European stock, had converted en masse to Judaism and Koestler's contention that this is where the vast majority of European Jews actually came from. Koestler's father was a Jew and it was in researching his own ancestry that Koestler stumbled upon those facts and led in turn to collecting as much information as he could about them that became the book which you can skim or read in it's entirety here...

       Further to that and as something of an update to it is what is perhaps the most banned book of all time, written by no less an author than the Nobel Prize winner Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn entitled "Russia and the Jews" that details amongst other things the never mentioned history of another and vastly larger holocaust perpetated by Bolshevik Jews against Russian Othodox Christians that resulted in the deaths of some sixty million of them in the gulags.

       The whole article has absolutely no sources quoted. It's like someone wrote a story and posted it as fact. Now of course anyone who's dug into ancient societies understands that there was even more control over society back then than there is now. However with nothing to back up his story it isn't even really worth commenting on it's validity.

       The book of Revelation is principally prophetic in form, which means it is interpreted to show what will happen in the future or at the end of days. It's the only book of the Bible that is prophetic rather than historical in nature. The title "Revelation"'comes from the Greek word "apokalypsis" which roughly means the showing of something previously unrevealed. This book comes from an author named John who describes the visions of the future (end of the world) that he receives from God.

       True but the thing is that for me the most astounding fact is that the people of Israel call themselves "gods people" and claim ownership over Palestine, you see whats happening there now
       <strong>
        BUT
       </strong>
       the fact is that they are not who they claim to be and they have been committing horrible atrocities that would put the holocaust to shame to lay claim to Palestine and hide the fact that they have no bloodline to the biblical Israelites.

       Gamal Abdel Nasser, former president the United Arab Republic stated on television:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        you (the Jews) will never be able to live here in peace, because you left here black but came back white. We cannot except you.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The present day Jews are descendants of the Khazars. This has been shown many times over but the evidence is always either forgotten or actively sought out and hidden. See for example Henry Fords book that he spent millions on
       <em>
        The International Jew
       </em>
       . In the book the research shows that:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Jews were
        <strong>
         NOT
        </strong>
        descendants of the Biblical Israelites.
Further in the book he claimed that:
 These Jews, committing all sorts of crimes while under the cover of being called "chosen people of the Bible", were rapidly taking economic and political control of America.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is easy to see. Israel has
       <strong>
        immense
       </strong>
       political power over America. Just one force for instance is AIPAC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at geopolitics with this in mind and you will start to see what is going on.

       I remember reading that Israel really had no specific claim over that territory. I dug a little but didn't hear they really are the descendants of the Khazars. I just thought they were some international money and power group that decided they wanted their own country.

       Thanks for some more info and the link. I wish more would be interested in subjects like this.

       My thought exactly, it's like the missing puzzle piece that connects everything together. Just like we are seeing people in power connected to satanism. The Khazarian mafia is so deeply linked to Satan that you could say that it's their
       <strong>
        identity
       </strong>
       . So if this is true it could give a whole new meaning to "Pizzagate".
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is why I'm weary and what more sources.

       The book of Revelation is principally prophetic in form, which means it is interpreted to show what will happen in the future or at the end of days. It's the only book of the Bible that is prophetic rather than historical in nature. The title "Revelation"'comes from the Greek word "apokalypsis" which roughly means the showing of something previously unrevealed. This book comes from an author named John who describes the visions of the future (end of the world) that he receives from God.
