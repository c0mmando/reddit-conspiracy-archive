    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll have to check that out thanks. Ya agreed although I don&#39;t like using the term fake hoax I prefer false flag but I mean that&#39;s just semantics. For me the major things are the video and audio of multiple suspects (which makes it a conspiracy by definition), the video of the area of evacuation that doesn&#39;t show any children, the reaction of the parents and the DNA evidence of the principal and teachers found all over the guns including on unused bullets that were in the magazines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The definition I have always understood for false flag is when there is an actual attack, but not by the person blamed for it. The JFK assassination would be a false flag technically.  9/11 was a false flag, if  you believe many people actually died (some do not). Sandy Hook was a complete fabrication built around a FEMA drill where all the deaths were faked and probably no shots were even fired. For that reason I call it a hoax; in other words it&#39;s all an imaginary scam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely understand and respect your opinion and can&#39;t really argue it. I tend to believe people did die that day but it wasn&#39;t because of Adam (or Ryan since there&#39;s reason to believe they were the same person) it was because of undercover agents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard that, it&#39;s an interesting theory, but there&#39;s just literally no proof anyone died and no actual grief shown by any families. No reason to think anyone was shot or even injured as this was not necessary for the goals of the $cam.</p>

There&#39;s souch about that day that&#39;s doesn&#39;t make sense and there&#39;s so many questions left over. Watching the first video right now. Thanks again fellow free thinker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This entire interview is unsettling, to say the least. For the sake of argument, say this &quot;medical examiner&quot; is some sort of crisis actor; wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to have him perform more conventionally? It seems to me that his behavior is not only unbelievable but just draws attention to the antic nature of the entire event. I&#39;m not discounting any of the theories - these press conferences and interviews are specious enough to protect almost ANYTHING from being ruled out. Just food for thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think about the enormity of this hoax, and how wicked it really was, it takes a true greedy scumbag to participate in it. Probably hard to find someone that depraved who also happens to be a great actor. The truth is no one related to the story is convincing, even the children. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwAH5AD0k-I">One of them even says &quot;it was a drill&quot; while on the Dr. Oz television show</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was the first real &quot;conspiracy&quot; thing I got into and there is no shortage of ways you can go about debunking it as a hoax, but I keep coming back to that press conference he gave as the most obvious. Anyone who has any medical experience or really common sense can tell he&#39;s not really a doctor. Not a chance. Can&#39;t answer simple questions, jokes about dead children, doesn&#39;t wear identification, seems outright nervous and evasive, uses no terminology that would distinguish him as a medical expert, describes what they&#39;re wearing as &quot;kid stuff,&quot; can&#39;t say the ages or sexes of the victims, apparently didn&#39;t even examine the suspect&#39;s body (&quot;I&#39;ll do it tomorrow&quot;).... and the whole idea that parents would be kept from seeing their children&#39;s bodies and shown pictures instead is 100% unbelievable <strong>garbage.</strong></p>
