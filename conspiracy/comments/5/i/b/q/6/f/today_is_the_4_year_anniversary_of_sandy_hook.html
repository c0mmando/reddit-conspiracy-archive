       I'll have to check that out thanks. Ya agreed although I don't like using the term fake hoax I prefer false flag but I mean that's just semantics. For me the major things are the video and audio of multiple suspects (which makes it a conspiracy by definition), the video of the area of evacuation that doesn't show any children, the reaction of the parents and the DNA evidence of the principal and teachers found all over the guns including on unused bullets that were in the magazines.

       The definition I have always understood for false flag is when there is an actual attack, but not by the person blamed for it. The JFK assassination would be a false flag technically.  9/11 was a false flag, if  you believe many people actually died (some do not). Sandy Hook was a complete fabrication built around a FEMA drill where all the deaths were faked and probably no shots were even fired. For that reason I call it a hoax; in other words it's all an imaginary scam.

       I completely understand and respect your opinion and can't really argue it. I tend to believe people did die that day but it wasn't because of Adam (or Ryan since there's reason to believe they were the same person) it was because of undercover agents.

       I've heard that, it's an interesting theory, but there's just literally no proof anyone died and no actual grief shown by any families. No reason to think anyone was shot or even injured as this was not necessary for the goals of the $cam.

       Very true which is why when asked about it I say I really don't know because I don't. There's souch about that day that's doesn't make sense and there's so many questions left over. Watching the first video right now. Thanks again fellow free thinker.

       It truly is unfortunate that the crisis actors couldn't take any of it seriously. I don't get why they didn't press the importance of staying in character.

       That same sort of thing happened in regard to the Boston Marathon Bombing too from what I understand. I remember Reddit actually was getting pretty close to debunking that thing and then an FBI stooge was like "don't pay attention to any pictures except the ones we are showing you" and basically just misled everyone into believing the Tsarnaev brothers were
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       the culprits.

       This entire interview is unsettling, to say the least. For the sake of argument, say this "medical examiner" is some sort of crisis actor; wouldn't it make more sense to have him perform more conventionally? It seems to me that his behavior is not only unbelievable but just draws attention to the antic nature of the entire event. I'm not discounting any of the theories - these press conferences and interviews are specious enough to protect almost ANYTHING from being ruled out. Just food for thought.

       If you think about the enormity of this hoax, and how wicked it really was, it takes a true greedy scumbag to participate in it. Probably hard to find someone that depraved who also happens to be a great actor. The truth is no one related to the story is convincing, even the children.

       This was the first real "conspiracy" thing I got into and there is no shortage of ways you can go about debunking it as a hoax, but I keep coming back to that press conference he gave as the most obvious. Anyone who has any medical experience or really common sense can tell he's not really a doctor. Not a chance. Can't answer simple questions, jokes about dead children, doesn't wear identification, seems outright nervous and evasive, uses no terminology that would distinguish him as a medical expert, describes what they're wearing as "kid stuff," can't say the ages or sexes of the victims, apparently didn't even examine the suspect's body ("I'll do it tomorrow").... and the whole idea that parents would be kept from seeing their children's bodies and shown pictures instead is 100% unbelievable

       Personally speaking, when they first mentioned multiple shooters, then completely changed the story, I thought it was bullshit and avoided the incident. So I'll watch these vids when I have free time. Thanks for posting.

       snopes says this is false.
one of the many reasons i don't trust snopes as a source.
got severely downvoted for expressing that opinion.
