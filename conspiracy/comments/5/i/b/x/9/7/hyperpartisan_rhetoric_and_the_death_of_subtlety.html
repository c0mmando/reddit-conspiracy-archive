        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It has become impossible to escape. Everywhere you turn, the rhetoric in the media and the culture is becoming hyper-partisan. </p>

<p>You either hear pro-Clinton/anti-Russia/anti-Wikileaks/anti-pizzagate/anti-Republican stories, or you hear anti-Clinton/anti-CIA/anti-Democrat stories. There&#39;s no middle ground any more. There are two &quot;sides&quot; and you better damn well pick one. And even if you haven&#39;t picked, people will pick for you if you voice any opinion on <em>any</em> issue. Because every issue has been projected down in to this 2-sided dichotomy. Regardless of the issue, every stance on every issue has an assigned &quot;side&quot;, even if it shifts over time. You&#39;re even made to be divided within yourself, because no one person ever holds views that perfectly line up with one side only. All this division steals away focus and energy from solving other, bigger problems. This is by design. This is divide and rule. This is how it works. </p>

<p>If you say &quot;People suddenly trust the CIA narratives?&quot; then people who are pro-Clinton assume you&#39;re pro-Trump (which I&#39;m not) and anti-American. That because you question the CIA you want America to fail. Are these not the same group of people who just weeks ago were suggesting the FBI was just being used as a political tool against Clinton and had no validity in investigating her? But there I go, casting things in to &quot;sides&quot; again, and grouping all those people together. </p>

<p>And if you say &quot;Why is Trump appointing all these Goldman Sachs people, and Exxon people, and republican big-names in to his cabinet?&quot; then the pro-Trump people will assume you&#39;re pro-Clinton (which I&#39;m not) and not a &quot;Team player&quot; and that you don&#39;t really &quot;get his strategy&quot; because it&#39;s too high-level. What I see him doing in reality is lining up a Republican cabinet to shove things through a Republican congress, despite the fact he was a life-long Democrat until not too long ago. I see him giving himself more power, without giving a fuck about what ideologies he has to pretend to believe in to get it. I see a power-hungry psychopath. It&#39;s not like something radically changed his ideology in his late 60s... he just wants power. </p>

<p>What scares me, is seeing the gray area disappear thanks to the media and everyone&#39;s heightened emotions. Everyone is so partisan, including myself despite my best efforts, that anything anyone says that is slightly important or controversial, is immediately cast in to a &quot;are you on the Clinton/CIA side or the Trump/Russia side&quot; sort of paradigm, which does humanity a disservice to itself. We cannot have honest conversations when we are pitted against each other like this. But people cannot change the course we&#39;re on without first obtaining power, so they must adhere to the ideology of their &quot;side&quot; to gain it to make changes. It&#39;s a lose-lose. It&#39;s a positive feedback loop that is self-reinforcing. The only way out is a non-political revolution of the many against the few. We must abandon the left-right paradigm, because it does not serve us.</p>

<p>People are defensive, upset, and angry. I am too. I understand it. We just got screwed really hard on this election, on both sides of the aisle. But instead of that anger being projected at the election system, or the big money that has taken over politics, our media has expertly diverted our attention in to thinking the only thing that matters is this R v D conflict we&#39;ve been hearing about endlessly for the last year. As long as all attention is on that conflict, the <em>real</em> conflict of how the few rule the many against their will, will not come to light and will not be publicly discussed or accepted. </p>

<p>On facebook one of my friends said &quot;It&#39;s laughable that anyone can trust some random guy trapped in an embassy more than the CIA&quot; and a different friend, on the same day, said &quot;It&#39;s laughable that anyone will listen to the CIA over what wikileaks is saying.&quot; Both are so far gone to their &quot;side&quot; that they can&#39;t even <em>consider</em> the opposing viewpoint, it is literally a source of laughter out of ridicule. They could never arrive at a middle ground. They talk right past each other. </p>

<p>By the media placing 24/7 emphasis on this red herring conflict and being able to cast any issue as a sub-issue within this conflict, people&#39;s attention and energy is diverted away from upsetting the <em>actual</em> power structure that runs our government, the deep state. People are tricked in to thinking something mildly important is the most important thing ever, and worse, that the <em>actual</em> most important things are portrayed as literal foreign propaganda. For every thousand people hacking at the branches, there is one person hacking at the root. Try to be that one person. And when you find the root, <em>speak up about it.</em> </p>

<p>&quot;The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent full of doubt.&quot; - Bertrand Russell</p>

<p>It is upsetting that so many people are falling for the pied piper hyper-partisan rhetoric. It&#39;s upsetting so many people are claiming to know what is true, when they don&#39;t know, simply because they&#39;re emotional and need an ideology to lean on. They need a horse in the race. They need to pick a side. They need some media to watch and feel at home. We&#39;ve been trained to be this way, it&#39;s in our culture and in our genes to want to fit in to the group, and unfortunately that propensity is being exploited to the fullest extent in the current US media. </p>

<p>Regardless of what side you pick, if you didn&#39;t get to frame the conversation then it doesn&#39;t matter. This comic illustrates the point quite well: <a href="https://www.subjectmoney.com/The%20Illusion%20of%20Free%20Choice%20democrats%20republicans.jpg">https://www.subjectmoney.com/The%20Illusion%20of%20Free%20Choice%20democrats%20republicans.jpg</a></p>

<p>“The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.” - Noam Chomsky</p>

<p>If you want to pick a &quot;side&quot;, pick the side of the many vs the few. Don&#39;t pick these pre-made sides that are designed to divide us perfectly in half, make us fight each other, and be distracted while the powerful make off with the loot. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like everyone is Pepsi vs Coke, and I&#39;m over here drinking water. </p>

<p>edit: A more accurate TLDR would be:</p>

<p>The media is trying to kill out subtlety in political conversations, which makes people easy to control and predict. They are getting away with this because people are emotional, because the middle class is disappearing, and people are looking for solutions so they absorb the media narratives. The media offers them two competing solutions, neither of which solve the actual problem but keep people in conflict, thus preserving the status quo. </p>

<p>That is quickly disappearing. The media is very un-free for a developed country though, and has been for several decades</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just want to say I agree with you and see it too.  There seems to be alot of hatred towards the other side also in addition to the divisiveness. 
It reminded me of this quote from Robert Anton Wilson&#39;s Cosmic Trigger (Really interesting book if you haven&#39;t read it yet). </p>

<p>&quot;Out of the hundred million buzzing,  bright,  busy signals received every minute, the human brain ignores most and organizes the rest in conformity with whatever belief system it currently holds. One can select lawful-and-orderly signals and claim that all is projected by a Cosmic Intelligence as in Thomism,  or select chaotic signals and claim God is a Crazy Woman as in Discordianism. The Brain will adjust incoming signals to either belief system... or to dozens of others.</p>

<p>...one way to double your practical intelligence (awareness of detail) is to try to receive as many signals as possible from other humans,  however wrong-headed their reality map may seem,  however dumb or boring they might sound at first.  Our usual habit of screening out all human signals not immediately compatible with our own favorite reality-map is the mechanism which keeps us all far stupider than we should be. &quot;</p>
