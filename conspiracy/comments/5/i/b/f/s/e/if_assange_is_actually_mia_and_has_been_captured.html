    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s one possible scenario of what&#39;s occurring. There&#39;s a war being waged between elements of our own government. For simplicity&#39;s sake I&#39;ll call them the cabal and white hats. The white hats were originally using Assange to leak information until the cabal was able to silence or kill him. Assange was silenced because he had much more damning information that could expose the cabal, and don&#39;t forget the odd messages from the DNC shortly before the election. They said something to the effect of, &quot;If you see any crazy claims from Wikileaks tomorrow, it&#39;s probably not true.&quot; I consider this strong evidence that the cabal is deeply concerned about what is in Wikileaks&#39; possession. But now that they&#39;ve been compromised, the white hats are resorting to plan B and will find another avenue for releasing their information prior to the electoral college selecting the next president</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be right. The director of National Intelligence just testified before the House last month, basically disagreeing with CIA about Russia hacking the election. He said there&#39;s little evidence for it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also strange that two employees of Booz Allen Hamilton infiltrated the NSA and leaked documents while working on ... wait for it ... an NSA contract. You would think our government shut these guys down already or at least stop contracting with them, but no. Ask yourself why? I think it&#39;s an inside job - NSA outsources &quot;leaks&quot; to Booz so they can get the information out there while at the same time NSA dodges blame for the leak.</p>

<p>Is NSA playing white hat?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been on the fence about Snowden. My suspicion was that he&#39;s a limited hangout. Even though Snowden&#39;s leaks showed how the US government spies on its own citizens (the limited hangout part - we already knew all this), the leaks also showed how the US government spies on BRICS nations. They were spying on Petrobras (Brazilian gas company) to expose and oust Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. The Brazilian citizens turned and got her impeached, but no evidence of her involvement has ever been made public according to Wikipedia. Actually, Snowden&#39;s leak from the NSA is the foundation of corruption charges against Brazil&#39;s leaders.</p>

<p>I know of one three letter agency who has been toppling foreign governments since the dawn of time. Is Snowden CIA? If true, where does that put NSA and Booz?</p>

<p>I noticed Wikileaks had some stuff on Dilma Rousseff back in 2005. Hmmm....</p>

<p>Is Wikileaks a joint CIA/NSA venture that went sour?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Good question. From everything I&#39;ve read, it definitely seems like there are white hats in the NSA and FBI. I&#39;m sure there are some in the other agencies as well, but I&#39;m skeptical that they&#39;re working together. Regardless, I think the next six months will be a flurry of activity, and I&#39;m looking forward to watching it all unfold</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s Anthony Weiner and the FBI.</p>

<p>When Weiner was a congressman, he stood up against the establishment. Shortly thereafter he tweeted his junk to a follower, which was archived by a nobody and later published by Breitbart.</p>

<p>Because of his connection to Huma, Weiner was just set aside, rather than destroyed. He decided he could run again, this time for state-level politics (Mayor of NYC.)</p>

<p>Again, tweets from &quot;Carlos Danger&quot; are leaked.</p>

<p>Finally, after Huma bailed on him, Weiner had enough. He downloaded Huma&#39;s emails and went to the FBI to explain that someone hacked his twitter and that he admitted this stuff just to keep Huma and power around. The FBI hesitated to work with until they reviewed the emails. After review, the FBI knew that Hillco can&#39;t become president, so they plan to discredit her. Meanwhile, either FBI or Weiner leaked the emails to Wikileaks.</p>

<p>The CIA/NSA is pissed about this. They destroyed Weiner&#39;s credibility by tweeting his junk to a teenager. The CIA/NSA took Assange and infiltrated the channels so Assange can&#39;t easily say who provided the emails, and is working with the establishment to frame it against Russia, knowing that the FBI had the emails before they were leaked. The FBI can&#39;t say, &quot;oh we had these emails&quot; or &quot;we leaked these emails to wikileaks.&quot;</p>

<p>So, the FBI helped keep Hillco out of office, and is not terribly excited about Trump, but is now trying to figure out how to move forward against the CIA/NSA, perhaps by causing a Constitutional Crisis<sup><sup>TM.</sup></sup> </p>

<p>I believe there is a war being waged. I just hope Russia doesn&#39;t become part of our internal struggle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange was involved in promoting the establishment, and complicit in making the populace fall for the Great Leader, the establishment&#39;s wet dream. They pulled the 2Pac disappearance trick on him, and now he&#39;s chilling somewhere on a private island with them all.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just kind of funny that you mentioned <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a>, <a href="/r/dncleaks">/r/dncleaks</a>, and <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>, but didn&#39;t mention <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> which has been taken over by the pro establishment shills just as much. Who do you think all these new members are? Why do think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods have been hard at work silencing members like myself for seeing the forest for the trees, instead of blindly worshiping the Great Leader? I finally gave up on posting new threads, for none have been allowed to go through on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, because they exposed the Great Dealer for who he is.</p>
