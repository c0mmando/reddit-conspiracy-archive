        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>UPDATE: The connection presented here is far from concrete, but there are powerful people and institutions involved nonetheless. This story wasn&#39;t being talked about in a broader sense, which is why I wanted to compile these links and start a dialogue that I didn&#39;t see happening and to potentially create a starting point for further investigation.</p>

<hr/>

<p>For those unfamiliar, a young girl named Yuliana Samboni was kidnapped outside her home last Sunday in Bogotá, Colombia¹. Police traced the car through CCTV footage and found her body, tortured and abused, at the residence of wealthy architect Rafael Uribe Noguera. Lots of mainstream coverage on the news here and hundreds of vigils in her honor. </p>

<p>A few things about this seemingly independent case have struck me as odd. Some articles are in Spanish and may need to be translated through Chrome.</p>

<p>1 - FBI involvement in the case²</p>

<p>Why would FBI agents come to Colombia to aid a seemingly isolated child abduction case? This article states that officers will focus on deciphering forms of communication from before, during, and after the kidnapping.</p>

<p>2 - Rafael Noguera &amp; his family³</p>

<p>Rafael Noguera comes from a wealthy and distinguished family. His father Rafael Rivera is Dean of Architecture at Javeriana University in Bogotá, his mother Maria Noguera is a legal representative for Lascaux Constructions Company, and his brother Francisco Noguera works at prestigious law firm Brigard &amp; Urrutia.⁴ Carlos Urrutia, founder of the firm and former Colombian Ambassador to the United States, was forced to resign after investigators uncovered his involvement in the illegal purchase of protected peasant land holdings by multinational companies (including US food giant Cargill Inc., Colombian sugar company Riopaila, and financial firm Grupo Aval).⁵</p>

<p>Investigators have since opened up an investigation into Rafael&#39;s brother Francisco Noguera, stating the crime scene was manipulated by more than one person.⁶ Police are looking at what involvement the family played, as Rafael&#39;s siblings were present after the kidnapping and before police arrived.⁷</p>

<p>3 - Javeriana University and the Clinton Foundation</p>

<p>Rafael Uribe Noguera attended Javeriana University, where his thesis titled ‘Sustainable Housing Complex For Low - Income Families’ focused on the Calderon Forest neighborhood, the same neighborhood where Yuliana Samboni was taken on the morning of December 4th.⁸ Previously mentioned, the father was Dean of Architecture at the University, with one former student calling him ‘a totally evil being’ who ’viewed the poor as animals, without any rights⁹.’ </p>

<p>The wikipedia page for the University states that they participate in ‘volunteer programs with Mission Country Colombia, working in the areas most affected by social inequality and armed conflict in the country.’¹⁰</p>

<p>And lastly, a 2014 initiative by the Clinton Foundation (with a budget of $250,000) committed to developing programs that would ‘devote at least 50% of its coverage to girls and women involved in the social impact space.’ Among the small list of partners is the Javeriana University.¹¹</p>

<p>4 - Areas of interest</p>

<p>Fernando Merchen, the doorman of the Rafael Noguera&#39;s building, was found dead 5 days after Yuliana was murdered. Although police found a suicide note, they have not ruled out foul play.¹²</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest area of investigation should be the Clinton Foundation and their previous involvement in Colombia. One article, titled ‘Clinton Foundation’s Toxic Legacy in Colombia,’ investigates the unscrupulous dealings of the charity - with one union official saying he’s unsure of their involvement ‘other than exploiting poverty and extracting money.’¹³</p>

<p>Final person of interest is Frank Giustera, one of the wealthiest donors to the foundation.¹⁴ Giustera is close with Bill Clinton, who reportedly set up meetings with Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, after which Giustra obtained permission for his timber company to log in Colombia.¹⁵</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>At the very least, Yuliana’s death is the result of an isolated case that will test your faith in humanity. At the worst, her kidnapping is indicative of the human trafficking ring perpetrated through the complex inner workings of the Clinton Foundation. Let me know if there’s anything I missed, any organizations or corporations which may have direct or indirect involvement with the Clinton Foundation. This includes any corporations operated by the Noguera family and their associates. Anyone who speaks Spanish would be particularly helpful in the investigation, as most articles are from Colombian websites.</p>

<p>They can silence, censor, and discredit our claims, but they can not remove what has now become part of the global lexicon. #NiUnaMas</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard of this. Supposedly when he was arrested, he confessed to everything and mentioned a high society pedo sex trafficking ring. For some reason, the Colombian police investigating contacted US Secret Service when they found out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be because they are suppressing as much information as they can. Almost all of the US articles on the huge Norway pedo bust have been wiped too. Could they all be connected?  </p>

<p>Like you, I have questions. If this was an isolated kidnap/rape/torture/murder of a 7 year old girl then why would they contact US secret service? Why is fbi getting involved? I&#39;m glad the Colombian people aren&#39;t letting this slide or falling for some &#39;fake news&#39; diversion. This guy obviously knows something. Could he be the crack in their armor?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suppose this: most major scientific breakthroughs have been controlled releases to keep control of the forefront of advancement.  It has also cultivated a &quot;religion&quot; with doctrine diametrically opposed to faith.  This isn&#39;t coincidence.  They have been stripping the merit from religion for a long time because they have infiltrated it to do so.  We only have access to what they&#39;ve already changed.  </p>

<p>Smoke and mirrors.  Too many legendary scientists have more history that doesn&#39;t get talked about.  Many of them have secrets.</p>

<p>Magic is real and it&#39;s based on intent, I&#39;m convinced.  Occultists specify that intent is what makes their spells work.  Loose hearsay, but there&#39;s merit to it imo.  </p>

<p>Meme magic is all about intent and we see how that manifests...I think we&#39;re about 2% unlocked right now.  New scientific findings suggest that the quantum field is magic.  We have access.  </p>

<p>They keep us so stupid and uninformed.  The information is spread so far and thin that it&#39;s just beginning to be realized through the web.  </p>

<p>Love this. I absolutely believe it&#39;s possible. How then do we use intent to change our lives? Is this as simple as Law of Attraction, or something else entirely?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always thought we have a very backward approach to life. We try to solve our inner problems with external solutions and rarely ever, at least in the mainstream, talk about how important thought and language is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the law of attraction is just the beginning of what we are capable of.  Energy frequencies travel through our DNA and intersect with the double helix much like an antenna.  The higher the frequency we stay in, the more times the smaller waveforms intersect the helix and activate DNA.  Love activates us and increases our frequency. </p>

<p>After being on conspiracy long enough I believe that they have dumbed down our abilities with poison all around us.  Water food air and information have all been corrupted to keep us from knowing our true potential.  </p>

<p>Yogis and mystics wouldn&#39;t be around for so long if they were founded on nothing.  Most people are content with the hive mind which doesn&#39;t believe anything.  I believe that the key to unlocking the next step is questioning everything that we have taken for granted, including our knowledge.  </p>

<p>I believe that we come back in the same frequency that we leave in.  It&#39;s a part of the enlightenment that every single religion seems to aspire for. Aboriginal Indians from South America said that spaceships drop Whiteman back on earth after they die.  How would they have seen spaceships?   But the other aboriginals stay in heaven because their frequencies are higher and more pure, like children. (As per Jesus saying it&#39;s the key to heaven)</p>

<p>The third eye has been calcified, mocked, and forgotten.  It is the source of our power.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s kind of like the force in Star Wars where the good emotions raise your frequency and just like exercising the more you focus on trying to feel happy the more happy you are able to feel.  I believe this inevitably unlocks abilities that we are not aware of.  It is my opinion that the system shuts us down and hides them from us. </p>

<p>I try to be objective about how I feel separately from what causes it and almost make a game out of catching the red flags when feeling the emotion and instead I try to focus on canceling it out and addressing the cause separately.  Doesn&#39;t always work but meditation helps master it because that is a time for practicing climbing the happy emotion.  Seeking &quot;God&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Vatican and European Royal family members have scheduled child sacrifices for this August 15 and on the new moon in September at the Carnarvon Castle in Wales, Balmoral Castle in Scotland and Marie Reine du Monde Cathedral in Montreal according to eyewitness testimony before the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. Yesterday’s ICLCJ Court press release stated top Catholic and Anglican Church officers including Pope Francis have been named by eyewitnesses as participants in this ritualized murder of children. “We have a list of nineteen top Catholic and Anglican church officers who may have participated in these ritual murders of children during the past year.”</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor provides a very reasonable answer to this question; US &#39;authorities&#39; were called <em>because</em> US citizens were involved, and very possibly  &#39;people of very high standing&#39;</p>

<p>After all, the <em>last thing</em> Colombia would want is a &quot;diplomatic incident&quot; with the US, <em>so</em>, they go to the people who can &#39;arrange&#39; a &#39;solution&#39; to such problems, e.g. Capitalism&#39;s <em>Invisible</em> Army aka CIA ,,</p>

<p>They probably first contacted the FBI via contacts they already had who, upon hearing &#39;who was involved&#39; contacted the CIA. </p>

<p>[<em>dental records = bite marks imprints?</em>]</p>

<p>This could indicate that Mr. Rafael would be accompanied by someone else, it could be one of your brothers or a close do not know. At least this is what he said Jorge Hernán Peláez columnist for the newspaper La República.</p>

<p>&quot;Yuliana, 7 year old girl, was found dead in an apartment owned by Rafael Uribe Noguera, after being allegedly abducted by him on a nearby popular neighborhood and carried in a gray truck high end&quot;.</p>

<p>For this brutal and grisly murder Mr. Rafael Uribe Noguera was captured and his brothers and recognized lawyer Catalina Uribe Francisco Noguera are being questioned for having altered the crime scene and the body of the girl to alter or eliminate evidence. The family issued a statement in which they declare themselves also victims.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the journalist of Caracol Radio, Darcy Quinn, through his Twitter account, suggested that Rafael Uribe Noguera did not act alone, but behind these grisly facts is a <strong>&quot;pedophile ring&quot; in the that would be involved very powerful and wealthy of the capital of the republic personalities</strong>.</p>

<p>So far the identity of the other possible involved is unknown, however, Darcy said that &quot;soon the country will be surprised&quot; by additional revelations emerge, implying that in the coming days new names appear.</p>

<p>For the Attorney General, the caretaker of the building Equus knew what happened &quot;at that time on the floor where this situation occurred and of course would co watchdog&quot;.</p>

<p>In this regard, the Attorney General explained that Legal Medicine makes detailed analysis to establish whether there is a causal link between antidepressant use and death.</p>

<p>According to the station, citing sources CTI of the Prosecutor, Merchan went into a severe depression after learning of the death of the child. A source said the prosecuting body Merchan had 5 days without sleep and had gone to a house of a relative to try to rest.</p>

<p>Apart from that situation was very concerned about the internal investigation of the security company to which he belonged.</p>

<p>Colombia ex-secret service chief jailed for murder</p>

<p><a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20110915-colombia-ex-secret-service-chief-jailed-murder">http://www.france24.com/en/20110915-colombia-ex-secret-service-chief-jailed-murder</a>
15 September 2011 - 00H07 </p>

<p>AFP - Colombia&#39;s Supreme Court Wednesday sentenced a former secret service
chief who served under ex-president Alvaro Uribe to 25 years in prison on
charges including the murder of a university professor.</p>

<p>The court declared Jorge Noguera, the former director of the DAS -- a
domestic intelligence agency that reports directly to the president --
guilty of aggravated conspiracy and homicide in the death of Alfredo
Correa de Andreis, a professor and activist at the Universidad del Norte
in Barranquilla.</p>

<p>Assailants aboard a motorcycle gunned down Correa and his bodyguard on
September 17, 2004 in the northern Caribbean coast city.</p>

<p>The shooters were members of the Self Defense Units of Colombia (AUC), a
right-wing paramilitary group.</p>

<p>Since the early 2000s, the DAS has been repeatedly accused of harboring
paramilitary fighters in its ranks, and of illegally wiretapping the
telephones of magistrates, politicians, and journalists critical of Uribe.</p>

<p>Noguera, who headed the DAS between 2002 and 2005, delivered the names of
leftist activists, including Correa de Andreis, to the shooters, according
to trial testimony.</p>

<p>This is the first time that a senior official appointed by Uribe --
criticized for alleged widespread rights violations during his eight years
in office -- is convicted.</p>

<p>Reacting to the verdict on his Twitter account, Uribe said he had chosen
Noguera &quot;for his resume and his family.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I trusted him, if he committed a crime it hurts me and I ask forgiveness
of the people,&quot; he wrote.</p>

<p>The court ruled that the ex-DAS commander must also pay indemnity to the
relatives of the dead men.</p>

<p>Regional paramilitary leader Rodrigo Tovar Pupo was in May also convicted
of the two murders and sentenced to 26 years in prison.</p>

<p>The murders were the result of &quot;a shadowy criminal alliance between
members of the DAS and the AUC,&quot; the court said at the time.</p>

<p>Correa de Andreis, a sociologist and agronomist, reportedly angered
paramilitary groups because of his ties to Colombians displaced by the
country&#39;s lengthy civil unrest.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Supreme Court began hearing charges against the 2007-2008
head of the DAS, Maria del Pilar Hurtado, and Uribe&#39;s former presidential
chief of staff, Bernardo Moreno, in a case involving illegal wiretaps.</p>

<p>Moreno has been under preventive detention since July 30, while Hurtado
fled to Panama in November 2010 seeking political asylum.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Why would FBI agents come to Colombia to aid a seemingly isolated child abduction case? This article states that officers will focus on deciphering forms of communication from before, during, and after the kidnapping.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The FBI actually has an office in Bogota, Colombia. And the FBI does handle kidnapping cases so not strange. <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/legal-attache-offices/americas/bogota-colombia">https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/legal-attache-offices/americas/bogota-colombia</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 - Rafael Noguera &amp; his family</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well the first article only talks about the brothers. (Shitty translate but I think I got most of it.) Doesn&#39;t really mention the parents. Skimmed the 7th link, says the same &quot;Rafael Uribe&#39;s brothers deny manipulating the body of Yuliana Samboní&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 - Javeriana University and the Clinton Foundation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually no, the Clinton foundation will not be spending any of that 250k in South America, only in North America, according to the link you provided.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 Areas of interest. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doorman suicide. So the doorman offed himself, so what? Was he a witness to the crime? Doesn&#39;t say anywhere that he was.</p>

<p>The &quot;toxic&quot; article. From that article; Editor’s note: The original version of this story did not meet our standards, and it has been revised accordingly. The update includes comments from the Clinton Foundation on its activities in Colombia. We regret that this information was not included at the time of original publication.</p>

<p>My conclusion, you did the best you could to try find and tie a kidnapping case to the Clinton foundation and came up short. If this is the best you can come up with that ties the Clinton foundation to pedophilia you aren&#39;t trying hard enough. (Not that there is one, it&#39;s just that coming up with &quot;theories&quot; like this aren&#39;t hard).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks so much for this, appreciate you checking out the links and doing your own research. </p>

<p>It&#39;s entirely possible the FBI has a recurring partnership with Colombian authorities, I don&#39;t know enough about the judicial system here to make that claim. However, regarding the current climate of the FBI and their connections to Hillary&#39;s emails and alleged evidence of child trafficking, I thought it worth a mention.</p>

<p>As far as the family is concerned, both siblings are being questioned by police. While not immediately incriminating, the excerpt below does link Rafael’s siblings to his flat before police arrived. </p>

<p>“Rafael’s brother Francisco Uribe and sister Catalina spent several hours with Rafael before calling the police, even driving their brother to the hospital for cocaine overdose treatment prior to notifying authorities. Police suspect at least one other person tried to help Rafael cover up the crime scene, but no other suspects have been charged.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/12/family-tried-to-help-wealthy-man-cover-up-brutal-rape-and-murder-of-7-year-old-refugee-police/">http://www.rawstory.com/2016/12/family-tried-to-help-wealthy-man-cover-up-brutal-rape-and-murder-of-7-year-old-refugee-police/</a></p>

<p>Again, not probable cause to assume guilt, but nonetheless interesting as the family’s connections to larger institutions are the initial link to Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>As far as the doorman, police have said CCTV show him having a conversation with Rafael for several minutes when he arrived with Yuliana. His suicide note said he ‘didn’t want to go to jail.’</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kienyke.com/noticias/fernando-merchan-caso-yuliana-samboni-rafael-uribe-noguera/">http://www.kienyke.com/noticias/fernando-merchan-caso-yuliana-samboni-rafael-uribe-noguera/</a></p>

<p>It could be that he was an innocent bystander who felt complacent in preventing the crime and thus committed suicide out of guilt. Could also be that he was a willing accomplice and killed himself to avoid prosecution. Another possibility is he was murdered, perhaps because he knew something or potentially as a scapegoat - it&#39;s worth noting that the first statement put out by the Noguera family focuses on the doorman and what he apparently knew.</p>

<p>As far as that editors note on the article, that means they got a call from the Clinton Foundation. Perhaps threatened with litigation, who knows. If anything, that disclaimer makes the article’s claims more noteworthy. Why defend baseless accusations? Doing some research into Clinton Foundation and Haiti will leave you with little doubt that this foundation isn’t all sunshine and rainbows.</p>

<p>But like I said, could be an isolated case. Could also be indicative of something much larger. I don&#39;t know. I appreciate people like you looking into it though :)</p>

Nikola Tesla knew the powers of 3, 6, and 9.
9 being the supreme number.
Sacred geometry is the fingerprint of our world.
All ancient civilizations knew of these numbers&#39; powers. 
Once Catholicism and Christianity arose it was kept secret and deemed the devils work; all while the elites continued using it. 
Even our government uses it, the Pentagon and the Pentagram used at the White House are just two examples. 
The Illuminati and Rosicrucians were in fact deemed Satanists to keep regular old&#39; people like you and me from seeking these powers further.
Numerology and sacred geometry are everywhere! 
It is about time we start understanding it, noticing it, and using it for good. </p>

3,6,9= Triangle- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abracadabra">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abracadabra</a></p>

<p>Numerology is Yuge in the Hebrew language. The Trump cards (Major Arcana) of the Tarot is based on the Hebrew alphabets&#39; numerology.
It is all connected; language and numbers. 
Sacred geometry is numerology, letters, words, vibrations.
432hz=9, etc. </p>

<p>The more you learn about sacred geometry, the more you will realize it is the fingerprint of our world; embedded and sound (pun intended).
Synchronicity, serendipity, confirmation bias, illusionary correlation, and coincidence will then become a grand illusion; the one that has kept us from being able to harness these most powerful numbers- 3, 6, and especially 9.</p>

<p>&quot;If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have a key to the universe.&quot;- Nikola Tesla
Tesla knew what was being hidden and harnessed that power for the good of the world, only to be met with opposition, theft, conspiracy, and degradation. The verdict is still out on whether he was murdered or died from a Coronary thrombosis. Tesla based his research around these numbers; he was also considered OCD since he had many quirks surrounding these number. </p>

<p>The bottom line is, sacred geometry holds the key to manipulating our world. It has been kept from us and has been used by evil and corrupt power for too long. We the people, need to put down religions, realize that it isn&#39;t evil, and begin understanding how to use it for good. </p>

<p>The Guardian article is interesting in that it attempts to politicize the issue in a way which criticizes the peace deal with the FARC.  But this bit is also suspicious:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As soon as Yuliana was taken, her cousin who was with her alerted her parents, who called the police. The police managed to identify the vehicle, which was registered in the name of Francisco Uribe, a partner in one of Colombia’s most prominent law firms. He told police he had sold it to his brother Rafael but was unable to contact him.</p>

<p>Francisco Uribe notified police hours later that Yuliana’s body was at a vacant penthouse apartment owned by the family, after taking his brother to the hospital for treatment of a cocaine overdose. Prosecutors allege Rafael Uribe consumed a large quantity of drugs after the crimes were committed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So police identified the vehicle and contacted the brother.  The brother said that his brother had the car.  The police didn&#39;t bother going to his brother&#39;s house, but waited for the high powered lawyer to contact them and tell them where the body was, which he only did after he&#39;d picked up his bro and dropped him at the hospital.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the connection isn&#39;t that strong, but just discovered there was more to the case than was being reported and thought I&#39;d put this together if anyone wanted to dig further and uncover more concrete connections. There is definitely something odd about the reported series of events around the brother though. Whether we are being told the truth or not, I have no idea. Apparently he&#39;s being formally investigated.</p>

<p>I just got lost down the reddit rabbit hole and was reading through pro-pedo subreddits and I feel so disheartened. I don&#39;t even know if constantly reading about this stuff is healthy for your mental state. It&#39;s frustrating because the alternative is to completely cut myself off, and I don&#39;t know if ignorance is any better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Colombian here, been following this story closely along with family that live back home. Just a few bits of info to put things in context. </p>

<p>-There has been no mention of a pedo sex ring at all in Colombian media.</p>

<p>-It is being treated as an isolated case, one of many cases of violence towards women/children in Colombia.</p>

<p>-Javeriana University is once of the most prestigious Universities of the country and is up there among the top Universities in Latin America, it is known to be a &quot;rich kid&quot; University, as the tuition can only be afforded by extremely wealthy people. (My personal opinion is this University has no ties with pedofilia)</p>

<p>-Uribe confessed to the crime, he wasn&#39;t caught per say, but more he was taken to the hospital because he was in bad shape as he was under heavy influence of drugs. He admitted he had no self control when he was under the influence and admitted to the crime. The tampering of the crime scene comes with the fact that he and the body of the girl were found by his lawyer who had gone check up on him as the police denounced a kidnap on the license plates of the car. (It was Uribe&#39;s brother car)</p>

<p>-The family in the case is a &quot;powerful&quot; family in the sense that they have many ties with the politicians and they are friends with those in power. These kind of families tend to commit crimes related to money laundering, and drug trafficking and getting out with a slap in the wrist due to their connections. </p>

<p>-There is a lot and i mean a lot of outrage from the entire Colombian citizens and if this guy gets off with a slap on the wrist he will have to leave the country, as it is well known that people take justice by their own hands. If he walks free he wont be alive living in Colombia.</p>

<p>If theres anything you want translated let me know ill help you out.</p>

<p>(My personal opinion on the case is this is an isolated case. with no connections to the Clintons. However it is known that in other parts of the country as it has been pointed out there have been some connections with the clinton foundation and how they have exploited Colombian people along with the mining company pacific rubiales.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate that you have footnotes.</p>

<p>That being said, I think that your connection to the Clinton Foundation is extremely weak. The only connection that I can see is that Rafael attended and his father is a Dean at Ponteficia Universidad Javeriana. The Clinton Foundation once partnered with that university(and 6 other universities around the world). There is no indication that the Nogueras were in any way connected to that relatively small project. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying that the Virginia Tech shooter was connected to the Clinton Foundation because the foundation once donated to Virginia Tech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from Colombia and I have to say that this is the tip of a huge Iceberg! The amount of people that disappear in Colombia is mind blowing, the corruption of the authorities is massive (google Luis Colmenares case).</p>

<p>My guess is that in the end the doorman will be &quot;responsible&quot; of everything now that he&#39;s conveniently dead. This Noguera family is pretty well connected and I&#39;m sure they are moving their influence to get this guy free, they&#39;ll wait until things quiet down as always.</p>

<p>A little correction the participation of the FBI is not that rare in high profile cases, because the FBI labs is far superior to any labs in the whole south america, so is kind of normal. Not even the government trust our ME office.</p>

<p>Pedophilia in Colombia is fairly common I&#39;m sad to say, even in some poor or rural regions is a way to escalate social positions, in Cartagena exist a big ring of prostitution that includes children (remember the Secret Service scandal a few years backs when Obama visited Cartagena?) even grandmas taking their grand children to &quot;work&quot; at night, is horrible and it&#39;s in front of everybody.</p>

<p>In Colombia everything and everyone can be bought.</p>

<p>&quot;Yuliana, 7 year old girl, was found dead in an apartment owned by Rafael Uribe Noguera, after being allegedly abducted by him on a nearby popular neighborhood and carried in a gray truck high end&quot;.</p>

<p>For this brutal and grisly murder Mr. Rafael Uribe Noguera was captured and his brothers and recognized lawyer Catalina Uribe Francisco Noguera are being questioned for having altered the crime scene and the body of the girl to alter or eliminate evidence. The family issued a statement in which they declare themselves also victims.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the journalist of Caracol Radio, Darcy Quinn, through his Twitter account, suggested that Rafael Uribe Noguera did not act alone, but behind these grisly facts is a <strong>&quot;pedophile ring&quot; in the that would be involved very powerful and wealthy of the capital of the republic personalities</strong>.</p>

<p>So far the identity of the other possible involved is unknown, however, Darcy said that &quot;soon the country will be surprised&quot; by additional revelations emerge, implying that in the coming days new names appear.</p>
