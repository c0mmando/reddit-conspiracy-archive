I feel it made good points throughout and tried to present factual information not mere opinion or hearsay; however, it is very hard to tell fact from fiction these days. For those of you who have seen it or heard about it I would love to hear your thoughts on it. Their source credibility is the first thing that comes to mind in terms of questions I have about it. Also just a general discussion of their theories would be awesome. Any thoughts you have on it really. Thank you in advance for your time!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sigh!....ok..as a person that went &quot;full ham&quot; nearly a decade ago when this dropped I will do my best to organize your focus.</p>

<p>first, watching the zeitgeist in 08 created a whole new level of questions</p>

<p>first let me tell you there is a thing called analysis paralysis and curiosity killing the cat..can stress u out.</p>

<p>based on my peace of mind I will say &quot;the circumference of your understanding is limited by the diameter of your perception/perspective&quot; ... take a moment and let that sink in.</p>

<p>now i am no philosopher nor do i comment too often because i have grown tired and like steve buscemi character in &quot;the island&quot; said...&quot;nobody cares&quot; </p>

<p>As a living being you have to understand the metrics of measurement for self and to others.  I like to classify these using the 7 deadly sins...not a faith pusher but I do believe in meditation and calming ones mind from time to time.  Balance is key to every person..I use the 7 deadly sins and the mirror opposite to practice a balance within.  so sloth(lazy) and the opposite which is to overwork I would try to find a balance in between and make sure not to be too overworked or too lazy...you get the picture.</p>

<p>I have traveled all over the US and the world and immersed myself in many cultures. I also learned the post production video editing process since 2002 and see how emotions are sold and shaped through the medium of television, worked with many famous actors and musicians and they sell you emotion for a financial profit.  You cannot really understand unless you work in the clockwork of hollywood.  I was praised for my creative ability but as I saw it as normal I slowly realized these people have little basic empathy for others if at all.</p>

<p>100-120 years ago sugar was not consumed daily, and life moved slower as all knowledge came from books.  With the advent of television information and fiction come at you faster.  So now you have sugar combined with fast emotion bending programs that make reading a book hard to do as it cannot hold your attention by comparison...leading the so called condition called ADD.</p>

<p>The concept of money!..we all are raised with it and in early video games getting points/money is programmed into us.  Think of the movie Kung Pow..it is a ridiculous comedy but one thing always stood out...&quot;this is wimp lo, we have trained him in kung fu incorrectly as a joke&quot;...now imagine you and 9 other people are born at the same time and around 12 years old 2 of those people figure out how to control the other 8 with resources how would they maintain their control?, by training them to be cogs instead giving them what they need to challenge..ie creating a system that keeps you off balance.</p>

<p>emotions are a funny thing..as a former hollywood video editor(transplant, not born into that culture) i can tell you the reason movies seem to be recycled is because they have little or no ability to feel only to manufacture emotions in an equation but without people that want to watch they dont make money.</p>

<p>I ask many question and it comes down to feeling and the extremes the people with(or born into) unlimited resources go to simple feel.</p>

<p>If you and I were watching someone win the lottery we would anticipate a show of great joy and enthusiasm as they have gained a great sum of money but what if I told you that is the feeling you are supposed to have without the artificial intervention of money.
ex: in an alternate reality we live in a tribe in the woods, men wake up and hunt women child rear and maintain nest(or whatever cause i know some hard core dames) but lets say a wild animal attacks someone and another rescues and saves the person..that person is now &quot;famous&quot;..the whole tribe saw it the person is grateful and the hero is praised for a time...now &quot;fame&quot; is a produced thing..these people have no real ability except to mirror emotions like a parrot and sell them in an equation...this is how an actor can make a bad movie.</p>

<p>the point I am trying to make as I feel i have tangented is peace of mind is paramount.  There are many films that can give you insight but you have to prepare your mind to receive information.</p>

<p>While i make many movie references i care not about hollywood and fame I use narratives as metrics of measurement...if you and I were architects sitting on a bench observing a building we would speak in terms of structure, length and weight to compare insight on the building...so here is a list of films that can offer clarity in fiction.</p>

<p>{What Dreams May Come - Fragility of mind}
{Branded - Influence of Marketing}
{The Informers - heights of power/lack of emotion}
{Animal Farm(cartoon) - Generalization of personalities amongst people and postion in the world and physical strength vs mental capacity}
{Swimming With Sharks - a sort of reality of what the world wants from you in high profit places}
{The Neon Demon - Vanity is not a &#39;thing&#39;...its the only thing..crazy flick but extremes not too far off}
{Snowpiercer - Society from peasant to ruler comaprisons of empathy}
{Overnight - Troy Duffy Documentary of new ego vs old power}
{Looper - short sighted mindset of instant gratification at own peril}
{Tron Legacy - Clu vs Flynn - if the devil is real the one thing he(it) cannot do is create}</p>

<p>That last one while entertaining shined a light on some confusion for me.  There are generally two kinds of people..the &quot;looper&quot; type that care not about others and are totally internal and seek to gain power(very lord of the rings ish) but no matter how high you climb ur face will never be on the money(jedi vs sith kinda)
and then the selfless..the bleeding hearts that care...these are the ying yang personalities that fill this world...the metric of measurement i will use is the monopoly board...you can own it all..born into it you wont feel feelings much(Jamie Johnson documentaries) if you strive to be the boss &quot;you can&#39;t play god without being acquainted with the devil&quot;-westworld quote
but unless you are immortal it is counterproductive emotionally to live this way...its like a successful drug dealer leaving his mansion to go somewhere and wondering why all the drug addicts live around him...he does not care..not that they know they should care and don&#39;t..base programming and survival instincts in environment created a fight or flight agenda.</p>

<p>There is a UK film called PIMP...and the first line in it is &quot;Killers are bastards with no imagination, because if you could imagine the consequences of your actions there is no way you could kill&quot; so the creator vs the ruler...kind of like the vogons in Hitchikers guide to the galaxy...all buildings are grey, they only run stuff and if you have an idea on their planet you get slapped in the face....the only squares that really matter on the monopoly board are water and power...5 elements of life air earth water fire and the force of magnetism but like wimp lo, these things are taught in a way that makes you a cog in a wheel and never a new wheel creator.</p>

<p>I have many thoughts and they are a jumble so I hope these words dont tangent and you get the core of what I am trying to say.  Peace of mind, long life and everything in moderation.  Peace</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im reading some peoples comments and i fear they missed something.  I wish i could put into words the scope of perception i have had access to...closest reference I can say is watch &quot;The Final Cut&quot; with Robin Williams...i could show better than i could type where your understanding disconnect is but you have to understand emotional programming through experience and not books....in short priest are pagans like James earl jones in Conan...most of them are gay others are worse(the deception is the problem not the gayness btw)..the zeitgeist entertained the notion that what if you have been lied to...and you can reference books and texts and relate something to a feeling but the creator would not demand worship but for people to strive to be like him...unless you met the pope or worked in the heights of power you can&#39;t understand.....its like you believe the noble cops are fighting gangsters and bad guys...after 2000 years of rule of law i can tell you the gangsters figured out to be the cops.  So read your books and believe what you want but book references vs a real time experience are not the same so unless you meet the author and get to know motivations you cant refer to any texts meant for mass consumption..if these books were true why would there be the need for something to hide in the vatican vaults...im out...good luck!   ....here is a Futurama reference that while in jest makes a point <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPopSBUpQ_4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPopSBUpQ_4</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s entertaining, though I wouldn&#39;t take it for gospel (derp).</p>

<p>I read this review from Skeptic Magazine a number of years ago, which I thought was insightful. Admittedly, it&#39;s been quite a while since I&#39;ve either seen the movie or read the article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PERHAPS THE WORST ASPECT of “The Greatest Story Ever Told,” Part I of Peter Joseph’s Internet film, Zeitgeist, is that some of what it asserts is true. Unfortunately, this material is liberally — and sloppily — mixed with material that is only partially true and much that is plainly and simply bogus. Joseph’s main argument is that Jesus never existed and is in fact a mythical character based on earlier sun gods. He sees all the motifs and characters of the New Testament as coded astrological or solar references. The argument that Jesus was a mythical construct has been made before — for example by Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy in their 1999 book, The Jesus Mysteries, though Freke and Gandy made their argument with a far greater level of scholarship. In reducing Jesus to a sun god, Joseph ignores — as Freke and Gandy did before him — the powerful current of messianic apocalypticism prevalent in first century Judea. The fact that there were references back to earlier dying and rising gods in the Christ myth can lend an air of spurious scholarship to Zeitgeist, as long as one ignores the equally important messianic myth and the fact that there is a viable basis for an actual historical Jesus. Joseph totally ignores the messianic/apocalyptic aspects of the New Testament writings and erroneously asserts that there is no evidence for a historical Jesus. I will return to this issue later. For now, let us consider Joseph’s solar deity argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  Maybe it means &quot;So be it.&quot; now.  However, it was translated as &quot;the Amen&quot;.  </p>

<p>And there is a sun god called Amen and there is a sun god called Ra. You seem to not dispute this.  </p>

<p>There are several mentions of Egypt in the Bible, and that is where these sun gods are from.  </p>

<p>In the overall context of the Bible, the interpretation I present is consistent.  </p>

<p>Whether if you personally accept it or not is up to you.  I do not tell people how they should worship.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The filmmaker himself says quite clearly that his first film &quot;zeitgeist the movie&quot; is basically a waste of time for those who wish to change anything for the better. It was a <em>cathartic expose of cencepts rolling around in his head at the time and isn&#39;t to be used as a super succinct or relevant critique of our world.</em> In fact, it was a musical and overhead projector live presentation that he eventually turned into a film, so admittedly it was not organized well.</p>

<p>If you want the real good stuff, with well thought out and 100% science grounded logic, watch the 2nd and 3rd ones. </p>

<p>As far as the first movie, he points out that it is likely the most sourced film ever made, but sourcing things (take part one for example; comparative religion) based on opinion and the ideas of comparative religion is like sourcing g John Madden on what he thinks of football; it&#39;s largely irrelevant in the grand scheme. Oddly enough,  the number of people thinking they&#39;ve &quot;debunked&quot; anything regarding this first part, are kind of off base, as comparing the fact that one Egyptian gods creation myth with, say, jesus&#39;s creation myth isn&#39;t really &quot;debunkable&quot; to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am glad you posted this because I also recently watched it.   </p>

<p>I have been doing some reading about the first part of it.  </p>

<p>I found Bill Donahue&#39;s videos on youtube and have been watching them.  He interprets the Bible in terms of an internal struggle that is fought using meditation.  It is a very, very interesting take on the Bible, and he explains it in a way that makes sense.  I am a hardcore Atheist, by the way, and I believe the Bible is an allegory.  The Bible includes stories written by men, but the message of the stories are hidden so the &quot;profane&quot; do not discover the real message.  </p>

<p>Anyways, here is a short 15 minute video by Mr. Donahue that gives you a taste of what he thinks.  </p>

<p>He has other videos in which he discusses the pineal gland and how it it affected by meditation.  </p>

<p>Regarding the monetary system, I recommend reading The Creature from Jekyll Island.  There are several free .pdf&#39;s about the Illuminati.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>im reading some peoples comments and i fear they missed something.  I wish i could put into words the scope of perception i have had access to...closest reference I can say is watch &quot;The Final Cut&quot; with Robin Williams...i could show better than i could type where your understanding disconnect is but you have to understand emotional programming through experience and not books....in short priest are pagans like James earl jones in Conan...most of them are gay others are worse(the deception is the problem not the gayness btw)..the zeitgeist entertained the notion that what if you have been lied to...and you can reference books and texts and relate something to a feeling but the creator would not demand worship but for people to strive to be like him...unless you met the pope or worked in the heights of power you can&#39;t understand.....its like you believe the noble cops are fighting gangsters and bad guys...after 2000 years of rule of law i can tell you the gangsters figured out to be the cops.  So read your books and believe what you want but book references vs a real time experience are not the same so unless you meet the author and get to know motivations you cant refer to any texts meant for mass consumption..if these books were true why would there be the need for something to hide in the vatican vaults...im out...good luck!   ....here is a Futurama reference that while in jest makes a point <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPopSBUpQ_4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPopSBUpQ_4</a></p>
