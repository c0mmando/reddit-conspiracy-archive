    <div class="md"><p>Same. Most Americans are too lazy to go to war, and most that aren&#39;t are in the military already. We have grown accustomed to our current standard of living and people living in cities and suburbs, no matter which side they support, would be almost hilariously inept at keeping themselves alive if a full blown war were to break out. Plus, there&#39;s enough geographical desegregation between population centers and where the &quot;rebels&quot; would be that a civil war between liberals and conservatives in the US would barely make any sense. </p>

<p>For example: if the liberals rise up because they hate trump so much that they would rather have Hilary, then the big cities along the coast would have to try and hunt down all the conservatives, or move to somewhere to create a consolidated singular state. However, New York City and San Fransisco are on opposite shores and one&#39;s in the North while one is in the South. There is no geographical area that is terribly advantageous in either situation; since area near New York City and the North East is all forest/no farmland other than fishing, and the area near SF is a desert that relies heavily on water that could easily be redirected/turned off/poisoned to cause mass death. Similarly, the conservatives have more guns, total military backing, farmland for food, oil reserves for gas, and metal for weapons manufacturing.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: People are lazy, and geographically speaking the war is already won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but I think the UN normally would support the leaders of current members in cases of civil war; in this case Donald Trump being current leader. Unless the state starts committing war crimes against the insurgents from the left; the UN either cannot, or will not participate in the feud. I personally can only imagine the UN inserting themselves into the conflict if one side threatens the use of nukes on the other side (and other such threats of equal weight).</p>

<p>Huh? There is no desert area here. And we get the water from the bay and a lot of lakes so there is no turning the water off or redirecting. It&#39;s the ocean basically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah....I think the mass of  US peoples realize this is a class war not black and white or the patriots vs. democrats. True we hear and see a lot of MSM news focusing on the elites&#39; useful idiot college dropouts. The SJW&#39;s are loud and obnoxious, but they&#39;re a yapping chihuahua who hasn&#39;t had to face the K9 of the majority .  Social
Another SJ dilemma , I like most try to not stereotype individual races but have no problem with stereotyping cultures or religions, and yeah that&#39;s okay with most people. Not so for the angry mobs of wet noodles .</p>

<p>The only serious way to take down America from the inside would be to immigrate Military Age Islamic Men in massive numbers .  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, as soon as money starts to flow, people will forget all about that other person...Same as with Reagan. Who did he run against?...besides, a &#39;civil war&#39; is a ridiculous thought. States have national guard and would close up shop in 2 seconds. No travel, no war. I would be more concerned about mass suicides...but at the same time, the only violence I&#39;ve seen in this whole election was at the hand of unstable democrats. Maybe more stringent psychological screening is necessary for the purchase of a firearm...or just put all democrats on the no buy list. Problem solved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Bannon focused on the key aspect of their theory, the idea that every 80 years American history has been marked by a crisis, or “fourth turning,” that destroyed an old order and created a new one: The great crises identified by Strauss and Howe included the era of the American Revolution and the Constitution (1774-1794); the Civil War and its immediate aftermath (1860-68); and the Depression and the Second World War (1929-45). Doing the math, they predicted another great crisis sometime in the first 15 years of the 21st century.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt there will be a civil war soon.. but I will say that this depends a lot on how severe the next economic downturn is (happens almost every time a two term president finishes in office and growth has been anemic, not to mention interest rate forward guidance and debt levels around the world).  The worse the downturn then the more likely there will be unrest and potentially a civil war.</p>

<p>Also worth mentioning that the current divide seems to be along the lines of partisanship as apposed to things like national identity- with the latter being more likely implicated in causing a civil war (just assuming, though).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Regarding a depression I&#39;m on the opposite end, I think a depression would stall any ideas if civil war, people would be worried about food housing and jobs, in the past that&#39;s mean an increase in unity and family, public works, and charity. Foreign war maybe </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But lots of uprising/revolts are preceded, if not catalyzed, by negative economic conditions.   The French Revolution seems like a classic and well known example of this..</p>

<p>Edit:  I could definitely see a Whiskey Rebellion kind of thing happening again if it is decided that the pay-down of the national debt becomes a priority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By all accounts we <em>should</em> be on the brink of civil war. But we won&#39;t because the divide is so fractal. There&#39;s no Mason-Dixon line this time. It&#39;s kind of coastal. But then some states are divided upstate vs. downstate. And then there are even finer divisions between metro areas and surrounding rural areas.      That kind of geographic breakdown makes a civil war hard to manifest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Clinton becomes president, then yes.  Civil war will happen (more like erupt) 100%.</p>

<p>If Trump gets in, then there&#39;s a possibility that a race war might happen, but quite possibly not.</p>
