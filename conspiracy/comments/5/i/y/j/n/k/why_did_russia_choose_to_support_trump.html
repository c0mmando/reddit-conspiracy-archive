        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Alright, first off I&#39;m not entirely convinced that it was Russian intelligence that hacked the DNC and released the emails to Wikileaks. But for the purpose of this post I&#39;m assuming that they did. I can think of four reasons why.</p>

<ol>
<li>Putin is trolling, he wants America to be divided, lose faith in their government and electoral process etc</li>
<li>Putin thinks that trump&#39;s policies will benefit Russia more. Less American globalism will allow Russia to regain influence throughout Eastern Europe and the rest of the world.</li>
<li>Putin has plans to invade the Middle East. Honestly, middle eastern society is defunct. Their people are hateful and intolerant, there is slavery, sexism, terrorism and their only allies are bought with oil money. If Putin framed it as a war to end terrorism, nothing in Trump&#39;s MO suggests that he would intervene, while a liberal like Hillary would definitely stand up for the middle eastern peoples &quot;freedom&quot;. A successful war would give Russia huge oil reserves and once again make them a world superpower.</li>
<li>The Russians also hacked Trump or the RNC and found information more damaging than in the DNC hacks. In my opinion as an American, this is the most sinister scenario. There is no reason Russia wouldn&#39;t at least try to hack into trump&#39;s personal records and we all know there are things about his life that he is not sharing. For 4-8 years, Putin would have a big upper hand in all negotiations with the United States. </li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;s probably a combination of these reasons, but regardless, it doesn&#39;t look good to me. I think that we need to remain the UNITED states of America and instead of attacking our own political parties, do the best to appreciate what we have and work to put our country in the best position for the long term future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia stands to gain from Trump&#39;s presidency because of the perception that relations between the two countries (and other alliances and nations doing business with Russia) will likely be normalized, going forward.  The first example that comes to mind for me is the current economic sanctions on Russia that have been impacting the economy there pretty substantially.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of other possible examples that could be used, as well..  like an improvement in collaboration of US/Russian efforts to stymie global terrorism- focusing on Syria, in particular because of its proximity to Russia.</p>

<p>This is all in addition to the fact that the alternative to Trump was the Secretary of State under Obama.  Considering the extent that bilateral relations between the US and Russia devolved the past few years I think it&#39;s safe to say that Hillary wasn&#39;t intending to try and reset relations between the two countries if she was elected president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk about him respecting Tump- that&#39;s a personal question, obviously.  The rhetoric would point to Putin probably respecting Trump but who knows what he&#39;s actually thinking inside his head.</p>

<p>But, yes, I do think that Putin would like to &quot;work with the United States&quot; so as to get sanctions lifted as well as achieve some deescalation of potential military conflict between NATO and Russia.  Trump&#39;s campaign rhetoric regarding NATO is historic and may lead to relatively large-scale shifts of geopolitical variables in Russia&#39;s favor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia will not try to start a war with the US any time soon, imo.. that would be a losing proposition and the leaders there know it.  </p>

<p>Also, when comparing economies don&#39;t forget to include a nations debt into the conversation.  The <em>debt</em> issue will become paramount in the near future if the Fed follows through on raising interest rates and if Trump pursues the relatively large scale fiscal stimulus policy that is being proposed.</p>
