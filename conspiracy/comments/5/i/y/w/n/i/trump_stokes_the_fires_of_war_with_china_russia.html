      <p>
       Long post, I apologize. I think this is very important regarding the coming geo-political situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald J Trump has repeatedly expressed goodwill and even admiration toward Vladimir Putin and Russia. He has called Putin a strong leader and Putin has called him a 'genius'. (The 
actual translation can be read as smart or, perhaps, just clever).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has suggested that he will have the USA march in lockstep with Russia to solve the
problems in Syria. And the larger Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin has been playing Trump's ego the entire time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, Donald has been saber rattling against China. The Chinese are not at all
amused. Trump has signaled recognition (unofficially) of Taiwan, which China considers
to be a breakaway state that is still under Chinese rule. This stalemate has lasted since
the end of the Chinese Civil War.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has doubled down and tripled down, calling out China on currency manipulation,
Taiwan, stealing American jobs and many other claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       China is ramping up for war against the USA. Because of Trump's bellicose posturing.
But Trump is not in power yet and in no position, currently, to do any damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, China is preparing. They are in the midst of their largest live fire drill in history
in the South China Sea. Where they captured a US Navy submarine drone. Trump said, let em keep it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the drone possibly carrying Top Secret software and capabilities, this is just NOT
how you conduct diplomacy with an adversary. Trump should know this. Defenders will say that he is using Nixon's Madman Theory. Which only works on the most gullible of people. If you are 
dealing with an actual madman, it goes out the window. Doubly so if you are dealing with a 
government like China, which is deliberate and concentrated in their decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is NOT fooling China.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are beginning to prepare for war. Trump has deeply offended their sense of honor and their perceived place in the world. Nothing good can come of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump may think he can cow them by placing a few divisions of US Marines in Taiwan.
      </p>
      <p>
       China will answer by placing a MILLION troops and an equivalent naval force nearby.
      </p>
      <p>
       This showdown will result in blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       For no other reason than this: Trump is absolutely convinced he knows more about diplomacy than the entire world over the last 60 years. He knows better than all the generals, all the presidents, all the diplomats and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a dangerous man, out of his element.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this brings me to Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the USA is provoking China, Russia is eyeing Eastern Europe with a hungry eye. Putin is already in Ukraine and has made no secret that he wishes to retake Finland and expand his 
influence into other Eastern European nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USA cannot defend Eastern Europe and Taiwan simultaneously while also engaged in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, with Brexit, and Trump's threats to NATO, the EU may not even want us there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The European Union, facing the exit of United States forces under Trump, is scrambling to make decisions about what to do. There is talk of a unified EU military force. But there is stronger talk of each nation arming, on their own, to defend individual nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, while the USA is staring down China and fighting in the Middle East, we will witness an arms race among the European nations. All the while, Russia and Putin are licking their chops as they finish off Ukraine, seize the Crimean Peninsula and ready themselves to march toward Western Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing to worry about, in other words.

       Both nations have serious concerns. Neither are friends in any sense.

       Russia will happily stand by if we battle China. Then, Russia can swoop on Eastern Europe.

       China would stand aside no matter what. They want to be left alone for the most part. They are not provoking US. It is Trump provoking THEM.

       China is happy with the status quo.

       That was under Stalin. Should we continue to distrust Germany because of what Hitler did? As for your original post, I think there are some good points, but they're drowned out by the conclusions drawn. I agree with putinlovescats about Putin's intentions in Eastern Europe. I would like to see any evidence that Putin himself wants to invade Finland (or the Baltics, or any other country). And Crimea did hold a referendum to join Russia. I'm not doubting that Russia played a major role covertly in all of that unfolding, but I do think the desire to join Russia was genuine. The vast majority of people living in Crimea are Russian, and Crimea has historically been a part of Russia for centuries. Plus, the economic benefits were considerable. For example, there are many retired people in the area, and their pensions nearly doubled as a result of joining Russia.

       Ya I close with Tiananmen square because I watched it happen on TV. The purges from Russia were done under
       <em>
        the Soviets
       </em>
       . You know, those guys who aren't around anymore? I can't say the same for the leadership in China. Those greedy cunts have been running that place since before I was born, and for some reason we in the English speaking West gleefully ignore that fact so long as we get cheap Tv's and Iphones while Chinese workers leap off stairwells to end their stress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont forget also, the other option was provoking Russia. I don't know about you bub but I grew up in the cold war and frankly it wasn't fuckin fun waiting for nuclear annihilation every day of school.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I would rather pay $2000 for my iphone rather than figure out if I would prefer Vault 101 or 110.

       Ok, obviously you don't know your history... Or maybe you are posting from China? Because thats the only way you couldn't know about Mao's great leap forward. I've read death tolls between 40-80 million dead (depending on how you crunch the numbers) all because of Mao. This doesn't count the deaths communist expansionism in North Korea has caused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those guys
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       run China. Let that sink in for a little bit. The
       <em>
        same
       </em>
       'government
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       runs China.... And we deal with them as one of the largest training partners in the world. Those guys. Yes, the 40-80 million dead guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       China also stated very loudly they dont believe in "the western concept of human rights".
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia, on the other hand, has reformed. True they have a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of blood on their hands but at least they have made attempts repeatedly to join the western world in business and poltics.
      </p>
      <p>
       My statement was...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Well, if I had to choose Russia or China, I'm choosing Russia.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If
       </strong>
       our nation has to pick one over the other Russia is the one we should pick.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's absolutely insane that the losing candidate in the election insisted on no-fly zones over Aleppo in the October debate, despite the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff insisting in September that a no fly zone would mean war with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's insane that with just over a month left in his presidency Obama is threatening Russia with retaliation over a hack that never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       You hate Trump? Fine. I'm cool with that. At least he has never called for direct conflict with China like Obama and Clinton have with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't think many people today realize how goddamn dangerous it is to poke the Russian bear.

       Trying to compare the 'Great Leap Forward' to Stalin's purges is a neato trick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it was a terribly attempt at policy. And, as you say, millions died. Of starvation, mostly. Certainly thousands died in violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stalin's purges killed tens of millions of people with guns and imprisoned their families in gulags.

       Both are terrible nations. Both are dangerous the the USA. Only Russia, though, is where Trump and his cabinet can vastly increase their fortunes by selling out American interests and influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does Trump feel it necessary to provoke China? The end result, if this continues, is a guaranteed skirmish in the South China Sea. Which could easily bring full scale war.

       While Putin stands back and laughs. And moves further into Ukraine and Eastern Europe.

       I agree with your final statement, and it's pointless for us to argue back and forth over who is more evil because I suspect neither of us will agree on that topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me go back to my original statement, that if we
       <strong>
        have
       </strong>
       to pick one or the other Russia is the better choice. I'm not saying I would like to be going to war with either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps provocation of China stems from his campaign promise of returning jobs to America. That's an appealing message for many Americans and a large part of the reason he got elected. Unfortunately the Bush's, Clinton, and Obama have all made very comfortable beds with their Chinese trading partners. Pulling away from that relationship is what China is interpreting as provocation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the Bush and Clinton provoked China also, don't forget. There is an aircraft carrier fleet (maybe two now?) cruising near the South China Sea as we speak. That fleet wasn't sent there by Trump. There has been constant friction with China over Taiwan. Even though it's considered a sovereign state under international law China refuses to accept this. My point here, is that China itself provokes the west in return.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Russia, they see Ukraine in much the same light China sees Taiwan. Just as it's unacceptable for China to fail recognition of Taiwan, Russia needs to accept Ukrainian sovereignty.

       Okay, this is an outright lie. Have there been some questionable deaths of a few opposition leaders? Yes, but they've never been tied to Putin directly (and I'm not discounting the possibility). But to make Putin sound like Stalin sending off thousands or millions of people is extremely far from the truth

       If so, do this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Write a bunch of editorials critical of Putin to your local newspapers and television stations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call everyone you know to express those views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call Russia Today and DEMAND time on screen to express your views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call ALL of the people close to Putin who you can think of and tell them you think Putin is a fool, idiot, or whatever, for opposing your view.
      </p>
      <p>
       And keep doing so.

      <p>
       In your 'professional' expertise, do you think this will go well?

       Now, the rest of what you said is fear mongering bullshit. Russia is not going to invade Europe, and does not want to invade Finland.
