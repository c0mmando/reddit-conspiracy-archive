       It started out, in June, as a way for the Clinton campaign to deflect from the Wikileaks publications that were coming. Now it is a way for Clinton and her supporters to deflect from the real reasons for her defeat. The intelligence community has been only too happy to come along for the ride, and to help out with bogus "evidence", because they're worried about an incoming President who is skeptical of their activities and might put a spoke in their plans for continuing endless conflict with Russia.

       The ramp up against Russia is old payback for the US getting cock-blocked in Syria. They never forgot, are losing their proxy war and are royally pissed. It also has to do with a battle for top position in the global hegemony.

       I was thinking that too. We also were trying to do regime changes in the Ukraine, which was an obvious effort on our (us govt) part to screw with Russia. Sort of funny how the news just dropped coverage on that one day.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, Russia is less of a big bad wolf now seeing how much they put up with from us. They obviously know they don't have any chance of getting the upper hand over us. Putin had to do what little he could to persuade Americans to go with Trump (like his statements that if trump were elected, relations would be restored and such).
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I don't like Trump. It's been difficult for me seeing his cabinet choices and the like. But I just have to keep reminding myself that this outcome of the election was truly way preferable to The warhog, Hillary. We truly dodged a bullet there. And I am thankful every day.

       I concur 100% with you, and thanks for adding the Ukraine. The US and western powers definitely did not like how Russia got back Crimea, in addition to when they put down the western backed proxy war they tried to foment using Georgia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between the US and Russia is that the US plays poker strategies with their foreign policy empire building, versus the chess game that Russia plays. You can actually see it played out live day to day in the news concerning Ukraine, Syria and Iran. Putin was KGB and knows how to play a patient long game, whereas the US and UK war administrations act like bullies and tyrants who react with embarrassing predictability. Putin knows that the respective citizenry of the US and UK hate their respective governments which have long ago abandoned any allegiance to the country or heed any mandates of their hostage populace. He knows the citizens don't want war and definitely DO NOT sign off on any further regime-change imperialism for bankers.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have NEVER been closer to a WW III nuclear conflagration than in these times, and I don't think people have actually internalised this. Putin knows that this option is not like a video game that can be won, and appears to employ strategies that don't let it get to the checkmate stage. However, there are US and UK psychopath warhawks and chickenhawks, that delusionally believe that this is a winnable gambit. That's what's terrifying and it seems that Putin and Lavrov are the adults facing spoiled children willing to destroy the whole world, rather than give an inch or give up imperial games for resource domination and profit.

       It's all about China &amp; Russia wanting to get away from the "Petro Dollar" any country that attempts this will be destabilized, (war) the stuff you've been hearing lately, the "Hacking" stuff is just the precursor and programming of Americans. If Clinton were in office she'd be planting Russian passports around the False Flag she was getting ready to blame Russia on right now lol.
