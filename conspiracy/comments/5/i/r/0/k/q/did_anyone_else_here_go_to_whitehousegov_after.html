       I did, to disprove my father, and was blindsided with all these layers in the document. The green print background was its own layer. Random clumps of text had its own layer, signatures had their own layer, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what they show in the forgery video is the exact layers that were in the doc posted up on whitehouse.gov by Obama's administration years ago. I remember look it at it for hours, baffled as to why some clumps of text were together, and other text was on a different layer. It all makes sense now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone have the original whitehouse.gov document? I might, and will be trying to find it on my hard drive. I believe whitehouse.gov has changed it since and all they layers have now been flattened and no longer show up.

       Why in hellz name would they publish an editable photoshop file including the layers?
      </p>
      <p>
       They are trying to convince the public of some elaborate plot that Obama is legit, naturally got into the White House and was not groomed by Colin Powell and friends, and is not actually Barry Sotero.

       So they published a clear source Adobe file? How stupid are they?

       Publish real fake... then once it has reached a certain # of downloads, publish the flattened version.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope it turns into some sort of conspiracy... and make conspiracy minded people look like fools, because obviously anyone that goes to the site and downloads it can see it doesnt have layers and all these silly things the conspiracy people are talking about.

       BUT honestly, at this point I am pretty sure it was actually just incompetence. I used to think it was some master plan maybe. Now, I can only assume incompetence. Like setting your password to "password".

       You can also open this open in Photoshop (if you don't have Illustrator) and upon opening you can import the PDF as "Images" and you can see the original. (Otherwise open in Illustrator)
      </p>
      <p>
       But I mean like most of the stuff that has been "redrawn" looks like it was already there anyway (the white stuff (unless thats something else, but that looks like the original)), but in saying that, I'm not sure why they had to edit it.

       Yeah, I mean, the background is clearly not part of the original, and the fact that elements of the text itself has been split up like that doesn't make sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work a lot with these tools, and if I had a document, I wanted to publish, where the
       <em>
        perception
       </em>
       of veracity was highly important, I'd just scan it, not mess around with it in Illustrator. I don't  get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not like this is normal operating procedure when gov't docs are published or given out under FOIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why have they treated this document like that? Aesthetics? I cannot conclude much, but I can certainly say, that this document is not a copy of an original document, and it doesn't tell us anything about whether Obama was born in Hawaii or not.

       Absolutely remember this.  It was incredible that their "proof" of genuine birth was nothing more than proof of forgery or the document.  Scanned images most definitely do not OCR into their own scattered layers.  SIGNATURES included.

       Other threads talking about this says Adobe's OCR stuff
       <strong>
        does
       </strong>
       create layers.

       However other threads also mentioned that behavior is surpassed with layers that were digitally added from different source documents to forge the certificate.

       To be honest. How stupid do they have to be to provide a file that can so easily be revealed as fake? Like, why not just flatten the layers in the PDF!! It's not hard at all. It's almost as if they wanted people to download it and try to decipher it. Wtf. Whoever was in charge of that should have been fired.

       I work with PDF files every day. The quality of software that converts the printed text into shapes (math describing shapes is far smaller than an 8-bit value for each pixel as is the usual format of image files) can vary widely. I've had multi-thousand word documents in which every single character is on a separate layer. I see this in files that were secured with permissions but had the permissions removed with a hack vs. removing security in Acrobat with proper credentials.

       It also occasionally happens with old PDF files. Or documents that have been scanned and set up for OCR. Unfortunately I don't believe there's a technological smoking gun here, as what you've described is not super uncommon. In any event the doc would likely have been forged, printed, then scanned. Digital tweaking can leave a lot of telltales so having the analog step post-manipulation would make the most sense.

       so you're saying that michelle obama is/was a male? right. don't rely on the exact same card used against the last democrat president we had for 8 years and his wife. oh, and that clip, he's clearly mashing the words "my wife" and "michelle" together. quit calling the president a fag. it's very middle school and you could at least call the man a drone murdering pirate or something more accurate than just insinuating he's gay, a muslim and a commie or something.

       What cards were played against former democratic presidents, what middle schoolers say, or that being married to a person of the same gender would make you gay, has nothing to do with whether Michelle Obama (or whatever) has an adam's apple, or male or female body proportions.

       You're mixing apples and organges. You cannot investigate reality by superimposing prejudice about the implications of certain data, allowing your ideas of what a certain piece of information would mean, to affect your collection of data.

       Tentative conclusions are what you should end up with at the end of investigation, while solid convictions about reality are a piss-poor outset for invetigating anything.
