<p>And what they show in the forgery video is the exact layers that were in the doc posted up on whitehouse.gov by Obama&#39;s administration years ago. I remember look it at it for hours, baffled as to why some clumps of text were together, and other text was on a different layer. It all makes sense now.</p>

<p>Does anyone have the original whitehouse.gov document? I might, and will be trying to find it on my hard drive. I believe whitehouse.gov has changed it since and all they layers have now been flattened and no longer show up. </p>

<p>You can also open this open in Photoshop (if you don&#39;t have Illustrator) and upon opening you can import the PDF as &quot;Images&quot; and you can see the original. (Otherwise open in Illustrator)</p>

<p>But I mean like most of the stuff that has been &quot;redrawn&quot; looks like it was already there anyway (the white stuff (unless thats something else, but that looks like the original)), but in saying that, I&#39;m not sure why they had to edit it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I mean, the background is clearly not part of the original, and the fact that elements of the text itself has been split up like that doesn&#39;t make sense to me.</p>

<p>I work a lot with these tools, and if I had a document, I wanted to publish, where the <em>perception</em> of veracity was highly important, I&#39;d just scan it, not mess around with it in Illustrator. I don&#39;t  get it.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not like this is normal operating procedure when gov&#39;t docs are published or given out under FOIA.</p>

<p>Why have they treated this document like that? Aesthetics? I cannot conclude much, but I can certainly say, that this document is not a copy of an original document, and it doesn&#39;t tell us anything about whether Obama was born in Hawaii or not.</p>

The quality of software that converts the printed text into shapes (math describing shapes is far smaller than an 8-bit value for each pixel as is the usual format of image files) can vary widely.

    <div class="md"><p>It also occasionally happens with old PDF files. Or documents that have been scanned and set up for OCR. Unfortunately I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a technological smoking gun here, as what you&#39;ve described is not super uncommon. In any event the doc would likely have been forged, printed, then scanned. Digital tweaking can leave a lot of telltales so having the analog step post-manipulation would make the most sense. </p>

<p>What cards were played against former democratic presidents, what middle schoolers say, or that being married to a person of the same gender would make you gay, has nothing to do with whether Michelle Obama (or whatever) has an adam&#39;s apple, or male or female body proportions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot identify what constitutes and does not constitute a valid argument, if you have not bothered to learn anything about it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re mixing apples and organges. You cannot investigate reality by superimposing prejudice about the implications of certain data, allowing your ideas of what a certain piece of information would mean, to affect your collection of data.</p>

<p>Tentative conclusions are what you should end up with at the end of investigation, while solid convictions about reality are a piss-poor outset for invetigating anything.</p>

<p>In this case, try attacking the data if you want to behave like an adult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Come on&quot; is not an argument either. Or well, it&#39;s sort of a veiled ad hominem, which is of course invalid.</p>

<p>You go look at her fingers, body proportions, and her neck, and then you find out how they relate to what we, as in science, know about anatomy.</p>

<p>Rejecting it out of hand because it sounds absurd to you, is not rational, unless of course you don&#39;t care about it and don&#39;t wish to hold an opinion on the issue.</p>

<p>&quot;Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.&quot; -- Arthur Conan Doyle</p>
