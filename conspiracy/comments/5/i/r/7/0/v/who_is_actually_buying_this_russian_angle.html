<p>The Democrats influenced the Republican nomination so they could go against Trump.  They thought they would win easy, but it blew up in their faces.  </p>

<p>I think they are trying to blame the Russians instead of admitting to themselves and to the world that they are idiots, and their plan backfired spectacularly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  The history books are about to be written, and the Clinton&#39;s, all of their associates and celebrities, the media and especially the DNC don&#39;t want to be remembered for bringing to the fore the worst, forcing on us is more accurate, the most corrupt candidate in history.  They recoil from the truth, because the truth is not an issue.  Saving face is more important, and it will cost them dearly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only ppl that think Russia is involved are the sheep that believe their lies. They always have blamed Russia with no proof. </p>

<p>Even Obama said for hisself... last summer he was notified they were hacked. He found out it was Russia, so last summer he told Putin to &quot;Stop it&quot; and Putin stopped. Fast forward to today, Now obama is upset about Russia influencing the election. 
Wtf? It makes no fkin sense... if you &quot;knew&quot; the election was hacked last summer and you already &quot;squashed&quot; it. what is the purpose of bringing it up now and making a big deal about it now?? 
SIMPLE... he needed to make it believable Russia influenced the election so the electors would flip their votes for Hillary on the 19th </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the Russians were able to hack into Hillary&#39;s private email server, and the FBI knows they did.  However, they will not admit this happened because everyone is covering for Hillary.  </p>

<p>I think the Russians are glad Trump won, but I do not think they did anything illegal that affected the outcome of the election.  </p>

<p>Hillary said she wants more war, but the American voters do not want war.  This is another reason why she lost.  </p>

<p>For the average person, &#39;there is so much we don&#39;t know&#39; and they will give there own guy the benefit of the doubt to a ridiculous degree.</p>

<p>This time around, it was the democrats who had the damaging news come calling. If it had been the conservatives, I don&#39;t suppose the manic denial and loony fabrication we are seeing from Obama and Podesta would have been any different, just a different audience with different performers.</p>

What do you think Obama is going to do?&quot; Sadly, I spend most of my time in these discussions having to explain why the Russian thing is bunk. Too bad for us the people pushing the Russian narrative control 95% of the mass media, and it&#39;s the only angle to the story most people get, so they wind up believing it.</p>

<p>Russia only did that because WE did that.</p>

<p>Can I BE more clear?</p>

<p>Russia always has been, and always will be, the greatest friend the USA has ever known. We will fight, together, to the death to stamp out Islamic Terrorists. Everyone knows this. Everyone, and they all say so. Everyone says so.</p>

<p>Russia is our best friend. THEY even say so. We have an opportunity, with Trump (thank GOD) to rid the world of these Islamists once and for all.</p>

<p>But we can&#39;t do it alone. We MUST have support from the Russians because America is a weak shadow of itself, as Donald says. Our military is wrecked and only Russia can save us.</p>

<p>Take a deep, hard look at the world around you and understand that the USA has been weakened badly by that Kenyan kid who pretended to be president.</p>

<p>Only Trump. ONLY Trump can resurrect this great nation and, with help from Russia, make us Great Again.</p>
