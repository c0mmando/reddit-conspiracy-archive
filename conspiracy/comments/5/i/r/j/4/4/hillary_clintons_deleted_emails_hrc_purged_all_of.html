<p>State dept. just released 100 e-mails today(12/16) about HRC through the Freedom of Information Act. There are some about Haiti and wikileaks and the keystone pipeline... just a couple though. </p>

<p>90% them are just Schedules/Itineraries for Bill Clinton in 2012... almost entirely redacted of information. Except for one tiny detail(aside from the weather)... that one detail is where Hillary Clinton was on that day. Hidden near the bottom of the blanked out &quot;Page Denied&quot; stamps. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pe2HBUk.png">Here is an example of one such occurance</a></p>

<p>Why would they publish these? Not because someone requested WJC&#39;s schedule... but because someone requested HRC&#39;s... and the U.S. Department of State were unable to fulfill the request... Why couldn&#39;t they fulfill it? Because they don&#39;t have it... becuase she fuckin&#39; deleted them all when under subpoena for those records. The WJC info is denied because it wasn&#39;t what the public requested.  </p>

<p>She didn&#39;t want anyone to know where she went and who she saw on a day to day basis in 2012. I went through all of the redacted records and culled out where she was. I don&#39;t know about geopolitics, so maybe someone can tell me the significance of these locations... a lot of her days were spent in Washington D.C... here is the rest I collected. </p>

<p>INTERNATIONAL - Dublin Ireland , Brussels Belgium, Bangkok Thailand, Adelaide/Perth Australia, Vladivostk/St. Petersberg Russia, Helsinki Finland, Cape Town South Africa, Rio De Janeiro Brazil, , Batumi Georgia, Munich German, Abidjan CÃ´te d&#39;Ivoire, Delhi/Calculta India, Beijing China, Cambodia, Israel</p>

<p>USA - Washington DC, Chicago IL, Chappaqua NY</p>

<p>Off The Record - 2 days.</p>

<p>Are any of those places that a Secretary of the State shouldn&#39;t be visiting? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Secretary of State is the presidents mouthpiece for all foreign affairs basicly. Going to any foreign country would fit that job description. There may be something to this but would involve cross checking what her official explanation and what was going on in those places at the time and after she visited.</p>

<p>She was using an unsecure blackberry on these trips, so any or all of these places may have hacked her.</p>

<p>I really hope those emails come to light someday. I would like to know what they were actually up to behind the scenes.</p>
