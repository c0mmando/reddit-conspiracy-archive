    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s harder than it seems. Realizing the alternative view is not just something one readily can throw out there. The prima mater is curiosity, and the sense of right and wrong. Only when this sense is afflicted, one is able to receive. Knowing the nooks and crannies of the world is one thing. But truth is, it&#39;s nooks and crannies of your own brain that is ultimately the great discovery. Spread some seeds, and be sure to leave some valuable trails of good information - and by that, I mean as factual as possible. If your are &quot;only&quot; 17, you still have a long road ahead of you. I was where you are a long time ago, and now, add 15+ years to your own age, I am still understanding and learning. Truth is damn hard, I&#39;ll tell ya. We are a ton of humans here, and the dynamic between us is always present - and even though things are as they are, try to make sure you take the proper precautions - there are plenty of poisons out there. Protect your health, and the health of those you love. Eat healthy. Avoid vaccines. Don&#39;t buy what you don&#39;t need. Stuff like that. Contribute to others, and learn as much as you can. </p>

<p>Here is a list of some people who have helped me along my journey, and I would&#39;ve wished I knew back when;</p>

<p>-Alan Watt. WATT, not Watts.</p>

<p>-Michael Tsarion.</p>

<p>-G. Edward Griffin.</p>

<p>-Mark Passio.</p>

<p>-John B. Wells.</p>

<p>-Dan Carlin</p>

<p>-&quot;For The Record&quot; Radioshow - see archive.org</p>

<p>-Milton William Cooper is also on point, though not a holistic thinker, but worth checking out. Great researcher.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Sorry for not providing links - I have some technical difficulties on my end, but there&#39;s some stuff to get you goin&#39;.</p>

<p>Let me know if other info is needed, I&#39;ll do my best.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT 1: </p>

<p>Important topics:</p>

<p>-Chemtrails/Geo-Engineering, see David Keith &amp; Dane Wigington</p>

<p>-Agenda 21 (UN)</p>

<p>-Project PRISM (surveillance)</p>

<p>-Fukushima</p>

<p>As a general tip, try to keep a log of your findings for future reference. Keep a tab on structures, and Hierarchies, who&#39;s over and under who, and tie the knots. Learn the what, who and know that you will learn more from silent actions than vocal words. This goes for politics and Earthly happenings too. As an example, CIA act, but don&#39;t talk.</p>

<p>Very important people/structures here are:</p>

<p>-The Khazars</p>

<p>-Judaism, and how it is being abused.</p>

<p>-Masonry and Egypt.</p>

<p>-The Black Nobility, Committe of 300, and the Hanovers.</p>

<p>-The Venecians</p>

<p>-Theosophy -&gt; New Age (tread carefully. Use. Taste. Don&#39;t get swallowed)</p>

<p>-which brings me to The Order of the Black Sun, SS, and Temple of Set, which leads to MK-ULTRA -&gt; Cathy O&#39;Brien</p>

<p>-Club of Rome</p>

<p>and if you want some hard tasting, I&#39;ll provide you some advanced material here, but be prepared:</p>

<p>-The Satanic Bible (and the 3 first books of The New Testament. Compare.)</p>

<p>-The Elder Protocols of Zion</p>

<p>-Karl Marx Manifesto</p>

<p>These are for you to get to know who we are up against. We are all people, but some are not very nice. Learn to spot them.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Further read to get perspective: </p>

<p>-Wilhelm Reich, Listen Little Man</p>

<p>-The 10 Commandments.</p>

<p>-The 7 Sins</p>

<p>-The 9 Satanic Sins, &amp; The 11 Satanic Rules of the Earth.</p>

<p>-Learn to Balance.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<p>There you have it in a (complicated) nutshell. Be safe on your journey, and try to stay solution-oriented. Many lose grasp of this, but it all starts with yourself; Be the change you want to see. </p>

<p>Also, always keep a copy of Websters Dictionary (1828) &amp; Black&#39;s Dictionary at hand. They were, and still are the corner stones of the English speaking language and Establishment.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT 3:</p>

<p>I wish to add Lyndon LaRouche to the list of active participants in the fight. Keep him in mind when you are in need of history and understanding of current events.</p>

<p>Also, added the Committe of 300 and Hanover.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to diss, and I probably didn&#39;t need to make my comment.  I just personally find Watts body of work to be much more useful. Watts is cosmic, whereas Watt is global.  I like Alan Watt, don&#39;t get me wrong.  I guess they are sort of apples and oranges. Both are useful in different ways. </p>

<p>I would say say discovering Watts at a young age is part of what led me to questioning everything, especially the prevailing paradigm and consensus reality.  So, in a round about way, discovering Alan Watts may have led me to discovering Alan Watt. </p>

<p>Ultimately though, I think the woke that conspiracy folks speak of is a lesser woke than the woke of  the Buddha, which is what Watts was pointing towards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Intelligence agencies and corporations usurped control of the US following WW2, sequestering advanced energy, transportation, and healing technologies in order to maintain a power differential with the rest of the world&#39;s population.</p>

<p>Eisenhower warned about the military-industrial complex in his famous farewell address. </p>

<p>These same groups killed Kennedy, who 10 days before the assassination had ordered the creation of a joint space program with Russia and a full inquiry into UFO phenomena.</p>

<p>Bush Sr. was a big player in the NWO, as evidenced by his infamous NWO speech 11 years to the day prior to 9/11.</p>

<p>9/11 is just Operation Northwoods updated, a fake terrorist attack designed to garner public support for foreign wars.</p>

<p>The ruling class is involved in the global drug and human trafficking trades. Their cover of secrecy is rapidly eroding, which will lead to an attempted diversion in the near future.</p>

<p>Oh, don&#39;t forget to check out Dr. Greer&#39;s lectures on the possibility of a &quot;Cosmic 9/11,&quot; a fake alien attack utilizing the aforementioned advanced technologies built by the military-industrial complex. </p>

First off, you may not know for certain whatever youre saying is true so you look incompetent. At the same time, no one listens unless they are looking for them selves. Honestly, not doing what we&#39;re doing isnt going to change anything. The only way they can &quot;snap out of it&quot; is by their own choices and willingness to step into something they are uncomfortable with. But trust me, if you are open, your heart will guide you right. Ultimately your heart mau be telling you that its nothing you can do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talk to them only about what&#39;s proven at first. The past 2-3 years have proven a lot of what ppl used to called conspiracy theory. If they aren&#39;t curious don&#39;t push more. You cannot force this knowledge down anyone throat. But you also got to continue educating yourself and distinguish what are conjunction, theory and proven facts. The bottom is way down and I&#39;ve been digging for 35 years and I haven&#39;t found it yet. Keep your mind open, but with a critical eye. </p>

<p><em>&quot;In our obsession with antagonisms of the moment, we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity.

    <div class="md"><p>On one hand, this needs not be a bad thing. Humans are but a part of the whole. Humans are not the center of the Universe, but I know I am walking the Nostradamus-line here, though a perspective can be uplifting, if the issues were not abused and thrown in your face by the other team. Dare to aim high, that&#39;s probably it. And stay grounded at the same time. Hard balancing right there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a rather unsubstanciated statement. As of now, humanity have little information in the current library of accessible information on this subject, but to dismiss such a phenomenon is just as ludicrous as confirming it. </p>

<p>-We simply do not know. And as of now, humanity has yet to prove itself ready to receive such information if such would be true.</p>

<p>We can speculate, and resonate, if one has reached such a level of understanding, and those few who claim knowledge of such are ever supressed, only confirming my statement.</p>

<p>When you look at the universe, and contemplate it&#39;s vastness, it&#39;s age and incedible distances, would you find it logical to assume we are all there is?</p>

<p>This is the one thread of the question, but unfortunately, the question has always, and will be for a while still, polluted by narrow minds, who in turn scare people away from questioning the topic in public in the first place.</p>

<p>The Ego. It&#39;s limits block what it can see. It can not see what it does not want to.</p>
