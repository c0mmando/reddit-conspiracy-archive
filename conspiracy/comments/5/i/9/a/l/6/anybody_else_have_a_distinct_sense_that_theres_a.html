        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just a theory, wondering if anyone else is seeing this unfold. </p>

<p>Russia will be formally accused of hacking our election. But this is <em>not</em> going to be used to make the EC vote differently. </p>

<p>It is going to be used as a pretext to launch a cyber counter-attack on Russia (as Biden already said), a process that will ultimately force Russia into conflict.</p>

<p>How do we know this?</p>

<p>Because the ruling regime will lose a civil war, so civil war is not an option. Assassinating Trump or flipping the EC would both trigger civil war -- which the State will lose -- so that is not an option. (Cross reference &quot;Red Team Planner.&quot;)</p>

<p>But they feel they <em>can</em> win WW3. They have already been preparing. It is something they&#39;ve already been planning. It is a nuclear exchange with Russia.</p>

<p>There is one problem: Russia has the blackmail videos of politicians raping children. Up til now, Russia has used the threat of a leak as a deterrent against conflict. (Confirmed by FBI Anon.)</p>

<p>Now, here&#39;s the only way for the political class to eliminate that threat of exposure, keep Trump out, and go ahead with the conflict that has been planned for quite some time now (the plan that Hillary was supposed to carry out).</p>

<p>It you assume they are thinking logically, it is their best and possibly only available option at this point. </p>

<p>Look at the patterns and you&#39;ll see. Bill Gates suddenly portayed by media as open to Trump. (Thus he (or rather his OS) will not be suspected as involved.)</p>

<p>NYT suddenly saying Russia can plant child porn on computers. </p>

<p>Folks they are setting the stage already.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how they can still win, if.you assume they are rational actors and need to cover up their crimes to maintain power.</p>

<p>Many of our machines will be infected with child porn nationwide. They probably already have been. (Anybody notice your comp acting weird lately? Have you noticed any honeypot links? Increased updates, perhaps? Freezing as if something is being downloaded? Did you get any recent &quot;Amber alerts&quot; on your smartphone?) </p>

<p>Suddenly thousands will be seeing brutal child rape. On their phones, on their computers. Maybe on Televisions. It will sicken the nation. If it involves a child being killed, it will be big. Very big. It may absolutely traumatize the nation. It will be made to look as if it is Russia planting snuff films/child porn on machines. There might be massive concurrent DDoS attacks as well, which again will be pinned on Russia. </p>

<p>Why something so insane like this? Why a false flag of this nature, as opposed to one which, say, shuts down the power grid?</p>

<p>Well, you&#39;ve got to place yourself in the position of a rational politician who risks being exposed to appreciate how it would function as the best exit strategy. Its function is to dilute any attempt by leakers to release the REAL footage implicating the political class. If it is on all of our machines, or even just a sufficient number of machines, it will be impossible at that point for Americans to distinguish between a real leak and &quot;Russian cyber attack.&quot; </p>

<p>It will be a crisis. And the frame is set so that anything released must be a cyber attack from Russia.</p>

<p>It will be pinned on a Russian cyber attack. Russia plants child porn, remember? The NYT said so.</p>

<p>This is also why NYT and others have all pulled the stories on the Norwegian pedo ring. They don&#39;t want the public to be conscious of the very real precedent that politicians are in pedo rings.  They instead want the public thinking any cp that is found must be a Russian cyber attack.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really the only way they can escape this. An EMP would be too costly and transparent. </p>

<p>The narrative is already in place. It will be the digital 9/11.</p>

<p>The Internet will have to be restricted and mostly shut down, and people will understand once they are convinced Russia is putting CP on our machines. (This will silence most of us and prevent us from accessing info and dissenting.)</p>

<p>A cyber attack will be initiated on Russia (as Biden confirmed in a previous interview) that will be sufficient to force  Russia into a war. People (idiots) will also welcome this, as they will be so outraged by the CP &quot;planted by Russia.&quot; And Russia also &quot;tampered with our election to install that racist Trump.&quot; </p>

<p>The MSM will all be making it appear that Americans want Obama to strike back.</p>

<p>Israel has already mobilized in Syria. US has sent more as well, and ships are also in place in key locations. Mobilization has been occurring for the last six months.</p>

<p>The first round of nuclear exchange will then occur. Why? Because Russia cannot win in conventional warfare, and so must rely on nuclear weapons.  </p>

<p>And you can guess the rest.</p>

<p>You are seeing it unfold now with the saber rattling against Russia. </p>

<p>Can we stop it? Perhaps. Only way is to warn everybody right now to expect a false flag of any form and to provide a range of scenarios that might occur. Pre-emptive exposure might work.</p>

<p>Edit to add: a commenter on Voat posted a similar line of thought regarding the recent &quot;findingassange.com&quot; link that has been circulating. <strong><em>TL;DR:</em></strong> be on high fucking alert for any kind of digital false flag being used as a pretext to attack Russia, check the authenticity of everything you read extremely carefully (&quot;verify everything&quot; ought to be our motto right now). </p>

<p>REALLY hate to be the one to hypothesize this , but here is one possible way that the &quot;findingassange.com&quot; website could be a trap:</p>

<ul>
<li>The website delivers the 15,000 emails and two Insurance Files on schedule.</li>
<li>They appear to be authentic</li>
<li>Everybody goes nuts, using the contents of the data dump to launch the biggest lynch mob the world has ever seen. [perhaps there is child porn as an &quot;attachment to John Podesta&#39;s email&quot;]</li>
<li>Our friendly neighborhood Intelligence Agency (CIA for example) then announces that careful forensic examination of the files proves them to be extremely sophisticated forgeries, such clever forgeries that only a &quot;State Player&quot; would have the financial resources technical capability to pull it off (Russia for example)</li>
<li>Our own careful forensic examination eventually determines that the files have indeed been fucked with. Although MUCH of the incriminating CONTENT revealed in the files appears to be both true and authentic the SOURCES of the files have been altered (in a manner that only a real expert could detect) to make them appear to have come from ..... you guessed it ...... Russia.</li>
<li>To make matters worse, SOME of the most outrageously salacious content ( the kind most likely to spread out through the internet social networks fastest and hottest ) are just straight up bullshit forgeries.</li>
<li>The FORGED (false) documents will be the ones that our friendly neighborhood law enforcement agencies actually investigate, and of course the alleged crimes will be quickly PROVEN to be total frame-ups.</li>
<li>These FALSELY alleged crimes, now exposed as total forgeries, will then be used to discredit  * ALL of the evidence in the 15,000 emails and 2 insurance files.</li>
<li>The bad guys can now cast serious doubt on any and all crimes exposed in all of the documents.</li>
<li>The good guys look like gullible assholes.</li>
<li>CIA puts Hillary in the Whitehouse.</li>
<li>Our job becomes infinitely more difficult, sifting the wheat from the chaff and being forced to find NEW evidence for everything, because the old evidence has been rendered pretty useless.
Is this scenario plausible ? </li>
</ul>

<p>There&#39;s only one other way that the political class could be in absolute checkmate right now, and that is if the leak clearly shows an <strong><em>identifiable politician</em></strong> on video raping a child. For example, if it is clearly Podesta in the video, then at that point nobody will care if Russia or whoever leaked it, nor can the political class use anything close to the exit strategies outlined above -- the crime would be so heinous it would spark rebellion. </p>

<p>A response like &quot;but Russia leaked my pedophilia so we should attack Russia&quot; would not even be resorted to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wondering if they would actually go to war with nukes over a cyber attack. What do you see as a cyber attack big enough to force Russia&#39;s hand? </p>

<p>I have to say I feel that &quot;everyone&quot; is very cautious of using nukes because it would be very hard to make money from, and control people that are dealing with nuclear fallout. Also they could achieve total internet censorship and avoid civil war just by planting the cp as you said, and claiming they needed control just to prevent it from happening again. </p>

<p>Other than that though I definitely do feel a sense of impending false flag and your theory is completely plausible in a lot of ways, thanks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the problem is russia is in a position where if a direct confrontation is inevitable their only option is to go nuclear.</p>

<p>they simply do not have the numbers to counter USA/NATO, so if it goes to the stage where a direct conflict is unavoidable russia only real option is to go nuclear and hope they come out of their bunkers in better shape than the US. </p>

<p>russia has a lot more shelters for their population than the US does which is something the US population needs to think about.</p>

<p>backing russia in to a corner gives them only one option, that imho is the whole reason they are doing it. overpopulation is a big problem why not fix it with a nuclear war you can blame on russia? you get to depopulate and blame the boogeyman for it.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well first the drills are a scheduled thing, but hey good on russia for caring enough about its people to actually have shelters for them, america... not so much.</p>

<p>second the calling nationals home iirc was debunked and was some UK tabloid that got that going.</p>

<p>that said they certainly do, putin has said it a few times in speeches that the US has been threatening them for years now, russians are on edge, hell half the world was holding its breath when turkey shot down that jet. that was a direct NATO attack on russian personnel in a foreign country NATO had zero right to be acting in. that right there was justification for war, but russia didn&#39;t react because at that point any reaction would have spiralled in to the nukes flying.</p>

<p>i think Putin is just going to take it on the chin until trump takes office because the other option is we all get to play fallout 4 IRL...</p>

<p>you&#39;re forgetting that any conflict with Russia is also a conflict with its allies, including China. They are not to be fucked with. It would be a terrible idea to go to war with Russia, nuclear or conventional. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>im definitely not i just didnt mention it because its already an everyones fucked situation with out them involved. the US has also been directly meddling with that alliances whole BRICS initiative, and all this bullshit in the south china sea and afghanistan is to try and stifle the Silkroad 2.0 project theyve been working on for years.</p>

<p>if you arent aware of silkroad 2 it basically is a mega transport corridor across china/india/afghan/iran  that leads up in to Russia and eastern Europe, essentially the US has been messing with it because it would make their stranglehold on the ocean shipping lanes irrelevant and put a final nail in the need for fossil fuels in transporting good across the continent completely leaving them out of the goldrush there</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prepare before an EMP? </p>

<p>my god yes - the only really feasible way to do this would be a missile launch which would set off a fuck ton of alarms. They may not know what kind of warhead is being carried also - they would probably guess it would be a nuclear strike to be safe so they would have to alert the public. Additionally, any missile launch against mainland US would likely get shot down by AEGIS and subsequently trigger a massive, potentially nuclear response. If you were going to do this, you&#39;d likely have to target most of the US - even then you&#39;d feel the wrath of our Navy that didnt get hit, and then you&#39;d see the global economy completely fail.

Other major cities, Austin, San Antonio - Check</p>

<p>Texas is quickly becoming the &quot;center&quot; of the Americas when it comes to transportation - crippling the infrastructure would be a major hit... </p>

<p>would be curious to see others opinions on where they would strike, love these kinds of threads. </p>

<p>9/11 ended up being a means of enforcing a police state on our physical lives, so whatever happens next will likely be a means to enforce a police state over the internet. The internet has been a powerful tool to share truth and circumvent the MSM.</p>

<p>MSM is already shitting themselves over &quot;fake news&quot; so its highly probable they are setting the stage to moderate and censor ALL content &quot;for our protection.&quot;</p>

<p>Russia fucks with NATO airspace all the time, they&#39;re merely escorted out.</p>

<p>Because they are directed away from such issues. Mass entertainment is designed to direct the attention of the masses away from what the elite are doing and this has been the case for decades.</p>

<p>USA has 3 $2B blimps with shit we don&#39;t even know about tethered around DC - one of them got loose and came down in PA not too far from where I live. There was entire interstates shutdown, cops on side roads, guys with no ID but many guns blocking back roads that could lead to access to the site. </p>

Knowing lots of people are more skeptical now about big events since 9/11. It could enormously backfire, I guess those who are wicked realize that as well. Or they are really detached from reality like you hear often about great powers in the past being deluded with their own rhetoric. </p>

They want it all to be used up so that they can keep making more stuff and make more money as well as destabilize and control more and more parts of the world that they are interested in controlling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This actually is something the US has been known to do. The malware is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">Stuxnet</a> that specifically targets a nuclear power plant&#39;s industrial control systems created by the German based company known as Siemens. The virus was first discovered in Iran&#39;s power plants and was successful in damaging Iran&#39;s limited nuclear equipment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually a pretty clever virus as it takes control of the overall system and keeps the power plant running as usual but slowly will start to execute wear and tear on vital equipment with unnecessary protocols that look like everyday glitches in the system. </p>

<p>Siemens has a history of illegal activity. In 2007 they were brought up on charges of bribery in exchange for contracts in multiples countries including Russia. </p>

<p>In 2009 Simiens formed an alliance with Russia for nuclear-power activities. So we know that Russia uses these specific industrial control systems created by a company that is known to act illegally for it&#39;s own benefit.</p>

<p>It just so happens that these same industrial control systems are the only kind that Stuxnet will attack. Otherwise the computer virus will simply lay dormant.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I see with using an attack like this on Russia, is they have the capacity to repair their nuclear power plants unlike Iran with it&#39;s limited resources. So the overall affect would be a temporary issue not a long term detrimental problem. But for that short time-span that the Russian nuclear power plant is down, they would be vulnerable and that might be all the time needed to execute whatever plan they have in mind to sabotage Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stuxnet required physical access, in Iran&#39;s case it was a USB stick brought into the actual facility. It also relied on multiple unpublished zero day software exploits which are now long since patched. In addition it made use of a forged digital certificate that is now definitely blacklisted. Even if none of this was true, or if all its penetration tactics were updated with equally sophisticated tactics, just the details of how Stuxnet functioned being publicly known is more than enough for any major players to take preventative actions and guard against its methods, which Russia and anyone else is definitely already doing. For these reasons, Stuxnet in present day is 100% useless.</p>

<p>Iran and Russia use nuclear power plant hardware/software by Simien. We have solid proof from Iran that Simien hardware/software can be compromised by Stuxnet malware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not hearing what I&#39;m saying. Yes, its penetration tactics can be updated, I mentioned that in my post. However, now that Stuxnet is publicly known, the specific manner of its attack can simply be countered. Stuxnet did its damage by causing the reactor centrifuges to spin at unstable speeds while reporting back to their monitoring software that they were spinning normally. So all it would take to guard against this completely is something that measures the centrifuge speed accurately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The centrifuges were being carefully monitored. What would be the point of using a control system like Simien if it didn&#39;t inform you of basic data like centrifuge speed? Stuxnet was feeding the software false data.</p>

<p>Even if monitoring the speed was the simple solution, Stuxnet infected and attacked with two different methods.</p>

<p>An early version of the malware manipulated valves on the centrifuges to increase the pressure inside them and damage the devices as well as the enrichment process. Iran repairs this damage and progress is made creating uranium. </p>

<p>Fast forward a year and a more effective version of Stuxnet has been created. Third party computers using Simien&#39;s software were infected with the malware that they would inevitably pass onto the nuclear facility itself. This second version of Stuxnet is the one that forced the centrifuges to excessively spin.</p>

<p>Top Russian military thinkers indicate that Russia’s geographic proximity to NATO will leave Moscow with little time and few options for responding in the event of a NATO attack. Likewise, the United States’ ability—at least as perceived by Moscow—to launch a successful strategic first-strike using ballistic missile defense and prompt strike capabilities imperils Russia’s nuclear deterrent. </p>

<p>For example, if it is clearly Podesta in the video, then at that point nobody will care if Russia or whoever leaked it, nor can the political class use anything close to the exit strategies outlined above -- the crime would be so heinous it would spark rebellion.</p>

<p>&quot;The evil Russians edited the video! It&#39;s CGI! It&#39;s not real!&quot;</p>

<p>That would probably be the Western MSM response. And sadly, I think most sheeple would buy it. A rebellion seems unlikely to me. Some people might rise up, but those will be labeled as &quot;insane conspiracy theorists&quot; and &quot;Russian agents&quot; by the MSM and the sheeple. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. My theory is that there will be a nuke or some big explosion in the middle east, perhaps in Syria, that will be blamed on ISIS or Russia, but will actually be done by the same people who did 9/11 (CIA/Mossad). It will be used as a pretext for the US to invade Syria and overthrow Assad, and will be used to denounce Russia internationally and hurt their standing. </p>

<p>Or the exact opposite scenario is also foreseeable, where the US/Israel is blamed for the explosion in Syria against the Syrian government but Russia actually did it. This would give Russia a win in Syria as they would gain international support and the US would look like the bad guys and begin to lose more and more territory. But they would have to literally nuke their only Allies in the region, which seems unlikely. Unlike the other scenario where the US would be able to covertly nuke an enemy and blame it on ISIS, which seems more likely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really don&#39;t think the us is going to go into direct to war with russia. It&#39;s insane for two nuclear super powers to actually fight. Whatever side won the war would be immediately thrown in to revolution for the vast destruction of innocent lives. china would probably play neutral, and come out on top in that scenario anyway. russisa and us don&#39;t want an emboldened third competitor. The proxy wars aka war on terror have been working fine. Both us and russia have made strategic gains in the middle east. Both sides are getting what they want still.</p>

<p>There could be a simulated false flag and a simulated war. That could easily be done. It&#39;s just like making a movie. &quot;Wag the dog&quot; Is a pretty relevant example. After a censored internet that would be very easy to do. You&#39;re absolutely right about the child porn mechanism.</p>

<p>All this stuff is meant to look like a fight, as they work together to oppress the growing social movements that are rising up to combat centuries of colonization. Part of putting down anti-colonialist movements world wide requires very heavy handed censorship of the internet. It&#39;s government vs citizens first, government vs non-citizen second, then the last third alternative government vs government. Government vs non-citizen is colonization, and it&#39;s been working great. So much so that colonization of other planets is on the table.</p>

<p>They are going to keep working together until most things are automated, at least. After they no longer need workers, then a full fight for total control of earths surface could commence. Although they will probably find a workable alliance during the process of eliminating of the workers that could extend indefinitely. Competing financially and diplomatically makes the most sense.</p>

<p>my god yes - the only really feasible way to do this would be a missile launch which would set off a fuck ton of alarms. They may not know what kind of warhead is being carried also - they would probably guess it would be a nuclear strike to be safe so they would have to alert the public. Additionally, any missile launch against mainland US would likely get shot down by AEGIS and subsequently trigger a massive, potentially nuclear response. If you were going to do this, you&#39;d likely have to target most of the US - even then you&#39;d feel the wrath of our Navy that didnt get hit, and then you&#39;d see the global economy completely fail.
