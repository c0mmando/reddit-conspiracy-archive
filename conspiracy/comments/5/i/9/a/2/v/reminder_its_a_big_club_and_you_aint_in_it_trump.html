       I hadn't heard of Steven Mnuchin before he was picked to be Trumps Treasury secretary. He has some very interesting ties.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-08-31/steven-mnuchin-businessweek">
         He was initiated into the exclusive society Skull and Bones in 1985
        </a>
       </li>
       <li>
        While at Yale Mnuchin was publisher of the Yale Daily News
       </li>
       <li>
        He was a partner at Goldman Sachs, just as his father was
       </li>
       <li>
        He is a business partner and close friend of Media and Gambling mogul, billionaire James Packer
        <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.756072">
         (who boasted to friends he helped write Netanyahu's speach to the UN)
        </a>
        .
       </li>
       <li>
        Mnuchin’s entertainment hedge fund, Dune Capital Management, financed 20th Century Fox movies between 2005 and 2012, including one of the most successful films of all time, “Avatar.”
       </li>
      </ul>

       I wonder if he is going to be the first 'bones man' to have his signature printed on cash currency.

       Not only that, but he is a big proponent on Carbon Credits (this one has been part of Exxon's playbook for years.  Deny anthopogenic climate change while pushing the "solution") Meanwhile he wants to strip down actual environmental regulations- not talking about carbon, talking about laws that say you can't dump your toxic waste into the watertable.  Oh and he's all about the TPP.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people don't understand the climate change perspective around here- we're skeptical because it's going to be used as the excuse to implement a carbon tax administered by a new international financial institution which will be able to pass harmonized regulations with no accountability to the sovereignty of nations.  Donald Trump conflated two truths to make a lie when he said Climate Change was a Chinese Hoax.

       He was playing CEO AND Chairman of the Board.  The Rockefellers tried to split those positions to save face because he was seen as not investing in green technologies.  It's a political move, not an ideological one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is exactly what I'm talking about.  Tillerson speaks out one side of his mouth like a climate change skeptic, while speaking out the other on the carbon credits issue.  the Rockefellers have been doing that for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're playing a political game while pushing their real solution down our throat and asking us if we're hungry.  Who do you think founded the Club of Rome to push "sustainable development"?...

       I think the Rockefellers put enough pressure on him to change his tune.  It was essentially the entire family putting pressure on him.  The Rockefellers are getting beat in the oil game by Texas oil.  Rest assured the Rockefellers play a big part in everything else.

       Climate Change is real in that the climate is changing (and always has been).  Anthropogenic Climate Change is controversial even if there is a "scientific consensus" on the process.  But regardless of your feelings about the veracity of the theory (That human caused gas emissions- largely carbon dioxide and methane are the primary contributors to climate change and that global temperature elevations are predictable based on carbon levels, as are the cataclysmic results...), the proposed solutions are demonstrable and also highly controversial.  In particular the "carbon credit scheme" which will impose taxable regulations regarding carbon outputs, which ultimately favor certain large conglomerates in terms of competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's one thing to discuss the "science" behind the theory and the predictive model.  It's another to discuss the proposed solutions (among which, I also should note in this sub- is the proposal to spray aerosol chemtrails via airplane to aid in "solar radiation management".  Don't let asshats tell you that chemtrails arent real.  Geo-engineering is real and deserves a debate rather than being dismissed by arrogance).
      </p>
      <p>
       So for a "business man", who ran one of the most notorious polluters on the planet- Exxon (See the exxon valdex oil spill and their environmental response as just one example), to deny anthropogenic climate change while pushing its controversial solution, while simultaneously pushing back on ACTUAL environmental regulation (not some bullshit financial scheme built to benefit conglomerates like Exxon and their financiers- the Rockefeller Family) is an in-your-face egregious violation of the "ideologies" Trump appealed to in his bullshit election campaign.

       I mean, it sorta falls under "correlation is not causation," but at a certain point, you have to acknowledge the correlation is pretty fucking huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Denying it's anthropogenic is like yanking your steering wheel to the left and wrecking into a barrier, then claiming you might not be culpable because it
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       have been caused by a ball joint failure in your suspension at the same time as you yanked the wheel. After all, you can't tell if it
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       fail at the same time, since your suspension is now destroyed because the car is wrecked.

       I disagree with your analogy, but I'm not going to argue with the premise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would, however, note that there are there are very real environmental concerns that are NOT controversial, that are easily addressable, and that are frequently ignored in lew of the climate change debate.  And that Trump's SOS pick embodies the wrong side of the argument here.

       Pollution of resources used for food and agriculture- top soil, the watershed and the ocean, as well as the the creation of dangerous bi-products and toxic gases/ VOCs.  Overfishing coupled with overpollution in the oceans.  The energy industry is a MAJOR contributor to these things and NOTORIOUS for not being held accountable and responsible for proper remediation when a spill occurs.

       Interesting how scientific papers are behind paywalls and controlled by a tiny group, similar to the way the majority of media is owned by 6 corporations. Don't worry, we'll tell you everything you need to know - priests were once the authorities who doled out the official story, today it's "scientists" and news anchors.

       of course scientific gatekeepers are the "priest class".  That's pretty well accepted in philosophy and is perhaps the primary critique of the thesis driving "new atheism"- Dawins/ Harris/ Hitchens etc (which also appears to be affiliated with secular judaism and cultural marxism)...

       There's a lot of great writing on this topic and the ethics of Scientism.  I'd recommend Jaques Ellul's Technological Society-

       Edit: I stand by my OP, as I said, global warming was renamed to climate change so it couldn't be argued against.
       <em>
        OF COURSE
       </em>
       the climate is changing, but not in the manner which it is claimed regarding CO2. I like to see someone talk about the evils of NH3 slip and discuss if the ramifications may more be more dire than CO2 (negative effects of which are yet unproven, and arguebly there are positives).

       Paul Giamatti is a total shill, and probably one of George Clooney's NWO handlers.  I realized this like 10 years ago, before I even did my due diligence and figured out who his father was.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's true that it seems like some skulls members are just there for entertainment and diversity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone here needs to read Sutton's book on the Skull and Bones.  He's legit and if you have any doubt about the conspiracy, that book will knock you on your ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: since I'm being downvoted here- presumably for my comment on Paul Giammatti being a shill for the NWO rather than my insistence that people read Sutton, I want to point out something about his father rather than go on a diatribe of Paul's actions which have led me to this conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at this article which attempts to paint him as an everyman, the child of lowly academics who decided to delve into the difficult world of entertainment rather than the follow in their footsteps:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Raised in Connecticut, the youngest of three children, Giamatti comes from a family steeped in the liberal arts. His older brother Marcus acts, his Irish mother taught English and "was very briefly an actress", and his half-Italian father was a professor of comparative literature at Yale. Did Giamatti consider an academic career? "I thought about that. But it didn't happen. I had other interests – acting and animation, though that always seemed like a pretty tough racket." He still draws now, making his casting in American Splendor spot on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following his father to Yale, Giamatti graduated with an MA in drama, but never felt confident in his abilities. "It took a long time for me to feel like I could call myself an actor," he says.
       </p>

       it makes it sound like this dad was just a shlubby literature professor.  look at his wikipedia:
      </p>
      <p>
       When Paul was 11, his father (a member of Yale's Vanderbilt secret society Scroll and Key) was PRESIDENT OF YALE.  That's no joke.  He then went on to be THE COMMISSIONER OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL!  WTF, Independent?

       It's one of many orders in a German death-cult which seeks to bring about the New World Order, of course!  I'm not being tongue in cheek. As Alex Jones would say- "It's Real!"

       Read Antony C Sutton's 1983 book- America's Secret Establishmentpublished with leaked documents and interviews.  The only reason we know that Mnuchen is, in fact a bonesman.

       If you want the real context for the book (which Sutton considered to be his capstone project, linking his other research together), you have to read Sutton's other work on how shadowy US Banking interests deliberately funded the bolshevic revolutions, the technological growth of the soviet union, and the rise of hitler, in conjunction with the US war machine- as part of their World Order ideological strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lest you think he is some conspiracy theorist crank- Sutton was an oft cited academic- a Hoover Institution historical scholar whose work is discussed favorably by Zbignew Brzezinski and Richard Pipes among other shadowy geopolitical strategists.

       Ingrained hypocrisy and double standards are the building blocks of the so called "conservative" lifestyle. As long as you don't show NIPPLES or POT SMOKING, and nobody CUSSES, you can call any kind of ultra-violence or demeaning pornography "family entertainment." Drinking beer and watching a girl in a wet T- shirt and a G-string rub her butt against a pole at one of those bars with a name like "HOOTERS"...that's GOOD CLEAN FUN, and you can bring the kids. Yet you can be thrown in jail for simply possessing an inanimate book, if it has the printed words or pictures that "go too far."
      </p>
      <p>
       But you watered-down so-called "liberals," you young soi- disant "Slackers" with your tie-dyes, Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts and bitchin' hairdos, you who think you're on our side, are even worse. The rest of the brain-dead idiots have an excuse. But YOU KNEW from the beginning what was happening, and yet you bent over HAPPILY, offering up your aerobicised buns to the Alternative Conspiracy, saying, "HERE! TAKE ALL YOU WANT! WIDEN IT TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT!" You sorry simps think you're so aware and radical while doing your best to conform to the norm defined by Normal non-conformity! You are your own worst nightmare: A DUMBASS. FACE IT: all this New-Age clap-trap means is, now when you shaft the next guy, you've got to have a smile on your face when you do it.
      </p>

       At least conservatives always have that hilarious total assurance that they're right. Liberals indulge in too much mealy-mouthed, wishy-washy DOUBT before they sell you out. They always think, "Surly that other person is human, like me. Too bad we HAVE to KILL you." At least the conservatives have the good sense to WANT to KILL us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I've HAD IT with these goody-two-shoes, politically correct, New Age, namby-pamby, hand-wringing do-gooders, who presume that THEIR brand of The Conspiracy would be ANY LESS HIDEOUS than that of the right wing fascists who've been running/ruining this country since the 63 coup. The conservative Glorps may be enslaved by greed and the dollar, but the Tragically Hip-Hop Wimps and P.C. Pinks are enslaved by bottomless guilt, and by pretending NOT to be enslaved by the arty dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Trendy Liberal Con is the Unfashionable Conservative Con's slickest trick, a Black Hole that absorbs anything "cool" and "anti-conspiracy," anything revolutionary that may later become a threat, and then spits it back out as cutesy, watered- down trivia, mass-produced and mass-marketed, packaged to move, paraded as another triumph for the Culture Dish of the Universal Beehive - something any normal can enjoy when it gets tired of masturbating Smurfs.

       If I was Trump at this point I would just be concerned on staying alive and making it to the presidency. If I had to throw a bone here and there to buy me time that's what I would do. No one wants to end up like JFK. He needs to make sure he got the right support before making any moves that would make the globalist completely desperate.

       You can't at the same time believe there is a shadow government and that one person could just show up and dismantle it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give Trump the benefit of the doubt,pretty much every time people doubted him they were wrong so far.

       Funny you should mention that...
      </p>
      <p>
       Mnuchin's roommate at Yale was one Sam Shalabi, whose uncle, Ahmed Shalabi, provided most of the false information that ultimately led to the war in Iraq to US intelligence agencies e.g. information like reports of weapons of mass destruction and alleged ties to al-Qaeda. Shalabi later ran the Iraqi National Congress after the US led invasion.

       Sure thing, but first, another interest titbit about Shalabi:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Before the Iraq War (2003), Chalabi enjoyed close political and business relationships with some members of the U.S. government, including some prominent neoconservatives within the Pentagon. Chalabi was said to have had political contacts within the Project for the New American Century, most notably with
        <strong>
         Paul Wolfowitz
        </strong>
        , a student of nuclear strategist Albert Wohlstetter, and
        <strong>
         Richard Perle
        </strong>
        . He also enjoyed considerable support among politicians and political pundits in the United States, most notably Jim Hoagland of The Washington Post, who held him up as a notable force for democracy in Iraq. He was a special guest of
        <strong>
         First Lady Laura Bush
        </strong>
        at the 2004 State of the Union Address

       Sure there is.  In fact there are many things we can do about it both as individuals and collectively.  One of the first things we can do is realize what's happening.  One of the next things we can do is to stop buying in, stop falling for propaganda, stop working within corrupt systems, etc.  Use your imagination, we aren't defeated yet.  If we were, there would be no reason for all of the lies and propaganda and everything else.

       Are you bitter he didn't choose you? Did Obama not promise change, right before he flooded the white house with Chase JPMORGAN and GS employees? Has this not been going on since the 60's?

       Maybe you realize now this dog and pony show is nothing but a popularity contest. Or maybe you're trying to stir people up needlessly. Most real seekers of truth would have already been wise to the fact that the face in the Oval Office is irrelevant to the policies that are put through.
