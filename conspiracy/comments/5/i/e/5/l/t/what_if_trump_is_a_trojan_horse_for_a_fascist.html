        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>His cabinet picks look a little ridiculously full of CEO-types. I find this sub&#39;s support of Trump a little perplexing (unless its solely anti-clinton).What if the conservative appeal to the conspiracy/&quot;anti-establishment&quot; is on purpose? What if the corporations use media outlets to get conspiracy theorists looking in the wrong direction - making government larger - as what is bringing in the &quot;NWO&quot; when they should be looking at the merging of big business interests into government?  It makes sense as controlled opposition. That way no one&#39;s looking out when they want to sign away your rights and access to a decent human life to the corporations; they&#39;re the most vocal supporters when it happens. </p>

<p>The working class used to vote for the democrats out of union membership and fighting for their personal working rights. Before, no one looked out for them, and you had &quot;The Jungle&quot; type stuff. Now they vote for the same rich people that used to fight against them that want to take away their rights in the workplace, because the conservative media tricked them somewhere down the line. What if the same is true about the conspiracy theory demographic? </p>

<p>Trump picked the CEO of Exxon Mobil as his Sec of State. Is the US army going to be the armed faction of american corporations without even making it indirectly so anymore? That&#39;s not draining the swamp. That&#39;s the opposite (and its all ogre now). </p>

<p>Are you guys worried about this and his other cabinet picks? Why are conspiracy theorists so conservative? I&#39;m personally more afraid of someone doing terrible things if they can make a buck off of it. Corporations left unchecked scare me more than big government...to an extent (totalitarian pseudo-communism being that extent). Thoughts on why this sub is so conservative/Trump-thumping? Hardly anyone is talking about anything from an anti-corporate stance since its all pizzagate and pedophile stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, most conspiracy theorists (that I have ever known online or in person over nearly a decade) just see the establishment left and the establishment right as two masks worn on the same face, two puppets whose strings lead to the same hand, etc. </p>

<p>Politicians who see it the same way, like Ron Paul, have never stood a snowball&#39;s chance in hell at becoming the president.</p>

<p>Then Trump steps onto the political scene and speaks like he is very anti-establishment, like he agrees that there is a NWO in the works and that powerful globalists are conspiring to push for that NWO. He talks the talk and claims he will walk the walk. And he actually becomes president (well assuming the electors don&#39;t go rogue).</p>

<p>So that has fractured a large portion of the conspiracy theory community, between those who think he will walk the walk, and those who think he is full of shit. There are also people like myself who hope that he will walk the walk, but we&#39;re not holding our breath for it, either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is correct - I think it is very much still a big unknown situation.  His picks could be the worst people for the job, or they could be the best.</p>

<p>I think its good to have some faith.  And i think its good to stay vocal and keep pressing - Trump is a drama queen and he like responds to shit when he is provoked - if the american people make themselves heard in a loud way, I think you will get better reception from trump than you would from hillary or obama</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can already see this in how welcoming he is being to members of the black community. Atmosphere over at r/t_d is insanely welcoming and celebratory, even if it is a giant circlejerk. The man seems open to all kinds of ideas. </p>

<p>I wonder how the conspiracy community feels about AJ supporting him all the way. I was never a fan of AJs tone or delivery style, but I always respected his work ethic, and especially his openness to work with anyone he truly feels is working toward exposing corruption, regardless of their political leanings. It was surprising to see him come out so hard for a candidate...</p>

<p>As far as a corporate fascist coup, that has been underway for decades and is progressing quite nicely.  Both presidential candidates offer an inflection point for expansion and consolidation of corporate power, as has every president before them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he&#39;ll end up being worse, simply because so many in the conspiracy community are already giving him free passes for things that they&#39;d never allow Hillary to get away with. The diverted eyes will allow him some serious wiggle room to do as he pleases. The alternative media might eventually catch on instead of carrying water, but it may very well be too late by that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point, it feels like they were gearing up for war this whole time, and  Trump&#39;s victory seems to have thrown a monkey wrench in the whole thing. </p>

<p>I debate the whole Trump trojan horse thing. It&#39;s a really big stretch, extremely paranoid. Not every single rich person, military general, politician is a psychopathic black occultist pedophile working for the luminutty. It&#39;s the same generalization people on the left use against people they disagree with, just in a different form.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not perfect, but who is? He busted his ass to get into office,  had every debate rigged against him, all for show? At the expense of his business empire, his reputation? Possibly his family?</p>

<p>I&#39;m much more worried about a silent coup through flipping electors at the moment. The investment in HRCs campaign involved decades of lies, lives, promises to big donors. I have a hard time believing they&#39;ll go to prison quietly.</p>

<p>Expect bloodshed if that&#39;s the case. Let&#39;s just hope it&#39;s short.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>White Americans associate government with helping poor people who aren&#39;t like them, i.e. blacks and Hispanics, therefore they resent, if not altogether hate, what they perceive as government. Corporations, on the other hand, they subconsciously associate with white economic power and might, and when they can&#39;t, as in the case of Asian ones, only then do they express anything approaching vehement anti-corporate criticism. It seems most white Americans would be satisfied (at least theoretically) living in a country of extremely shrunken government power and agency and totalizing corporate private power, which they inherently associate with/view as the apex of white cultural, economic, political power--and surely they would not, in an inherently restricted sense, be wrong to do so, although for the majority of them sharing in that power would be largely, if not exclusively, vicarious.</p>
