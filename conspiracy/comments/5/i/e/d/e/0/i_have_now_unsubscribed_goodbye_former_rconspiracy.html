       OK guys, I'm outtie. r/conspiracy used to be a special place on the internet for people to share information on deep truths in a supportive environment. No longer! r/t_D has continued to leak into other subs, like a cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day a new sub will rise that will be dedicated to conspiracy theorists. I look forward to that day.

       Here, I'll help you with this. In English, as in many languages,
       <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/garner/documents/section5.html">
        words are left out, or omitted
       </a>
       .
       <a href="http://www.grammar-monster.com/lessons/all_of.htm">
        Here's a handy reference
       </a>
       , part of which I'll note for your benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word 'all' is used as either an indefinite adjective (e.g., all the people) or an indefinite pronoun (e.g., all of the people).
      </p>
      <p>
       As indefinite adjectives are not generally used to modify pronouns, terms like all us are wrong. With nouns, however, you have a choice of constructions:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Choice 1: All the people
(This is all as an indefinite adjective.)
Choice 2: All of the people
(This is all as an indefinite pronoun.) 
</code></pre>
      <p>
       For many, 'all the people' seems less clumsy than 'all of the people', but both are acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pronoun 'who' can be left out or omitted when its use as a function word to introduce a relative clause is replaced by a verb ; used especially in reference to persons but also in reference to groups &lt;people who voted for him&gt; &lt;people voted for him&gt;   .
      </p>
      <p>
       If your native language is, then, not English, now you have the chance to improve your ability to comprehend it better than you do.  If your native language is, in fact, English, then I have had to return you to your advanced English class, and although I have helped you better understand your English, I surely can appreciate that you may resist my help and perhaps even be offended by it.

       It seems like you're letting your own political dogma influence you too much.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       That's political.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard for me personally to be too upset with a politician who has talked about conspiracy theories. That means he's willing to entertain ideas outside of the mainstream and has the balls to talk about it. His positions are very much "anti-government," depending on how you define that.

       Have you done any research into the people and groups opposing him? Or all the shady tricks that were pulled against him in the primaries, media, and election? We're talking about the most corrupt of the corrupt. If TPTB are all in agreement on opposing him, do you not think that there may be a reason for that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly have a bad feeling that something big is going to happen before inauguration. False flag? Assassination? There is so much going on that I can't see how you've lost interest other than dogmatic political beliefs. Even then, there's still the "Russian propaganda/Fake news" stuff going on. There are leftist groups calling for revolution.
      </p>

       I mean if you're bored or burned out, that's fine. If there's something you want to see discussed instead, why not submit it yourself?

       I find the occasional conspiracy theory entertaining, but many users take things way too seriously. And I do think the stereotype of paranoid schizophrenics has some truth to it, in the case of the users I'm referring to above.

       r/The_Donald was actually pretty well informed in its early days, people would talk about legitimately intelligible politics and debate over the credibility of both parties prior to and a little before the election. That's when it became an absolute cesspool, unsubscribed reaaaal quick from that.

       It's not on anyone...  I'm sorry we're not censoring pro Donald material but this place is not the_donald.  The_donald is a memefeast and rarely does it present news type information without the signature the_donald shitpost spin on it.  Which is alright for the_donald, I'm not complaining.  But at /conspiracy, we DO allow negative commentary about Donald Trump, it's simply not tolerated at the_donald.   We don't allowe memes and we don't allow tricky shitposts

       This place isn't anything like the_donald.  And a bunch of people hyperventilating about how conspiracy has become The_donald isn't going force our hand to censor our pro Donald audience members.  We also had Bernie bots and even a few Hillary supporters (shocking right?)

       Click the link to another user's comment which rang true to me and explained the "pro Donald" phenomenon within conspiracy better than I could have explained it myself.

       Donald just won an election where by every measure he was expected to loose, and while running against very definitively-establishment opposition.  Of course people are talking about it.  He does interviews with Alex Jones.. an internationally known conspiracy theorist, he tweets about conspiracy theories, he talks about them on the air...
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly it would be more shocking to me if people here weren't talking about it all the time.

       The job of a mod is not just to delete posts or ban users. Mods are responsible for nurturing the culture of the sub so it is the kind of place people want it to be. Take for example the sidebar photo. Right now it is an image of a time magazine cover featuring Boris Yeltsin (possibly doctored, I don't know). What kind of message are you trying to send with that? If somebody just arrived at the sub, what would they assume? Why not an image of the illuminati pyramid on the $1 bill, or of the twin towers? These decisions have consequences.

       We regularly cycle out sidebar pictures, I'm not sure what your point is about that.  The sidebar pictures accompany the sidebar article,  in this case about the CIA helping Yeltsin win.  It seems pretty on topic considering that people are freaking out that Putin might have influenced our election..
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I can imagine you being upset by that would be that it takes the sting out of Putin influencing the election, if he actually did.

       What if the culture of the sub is exactly as it should be?  Our stats haven't taken a shit.  We absolutely want this sub to be a place where we aren't trying to appease one group over another to virtue signal about how great we are.  It is what it is.  Sometimes it's insightful, inciteful, enraging and other times it's ominous or elevating.

       I wouldn't want it to be the same thing all the time, that would be a sign that the mods are doing too much.

       Exactly this. Imagine if somebody came to the sub to post theories about how communists conspired to kill JFK. Then a mod responds to the OP, saying well US tried to kill Castro, so even if what you suggest is true, it's no big deal and not worth discussing. Shut. It. Down. This is the equivalent of running the Yeltsin sidebar. I think what you're doing is bad for the conspiracy community.

       I think you're trying to change the topic. I'm concerned about a conspiracy sub that is aligning itself with the new administration of the united states government. Go to your own
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/locc">
        link of conspiracies
       </a>
       and see how many of them are connected to the united states government.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were a politician, and I wanted to subvert my perceived threats, I would infiltrate them and bring them into alignment with me. That is much easier than crushing them.
      </p>

       I'm worried about a conspiracy sub that is not antagonistic to authorities with centralized power!!!

       I personally found it to be refreshing that a goodly number of conspiracy theorists have "aligned" with the Trump presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have personally voted in every election since I turned 18, never once has the presidential candidate I voted for won the race until Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Woo-hoo right?  Well I haven't changed, I haven't become any less conspiracy theorist or any less jaded Republicans and Democrats.  I've almost always picked the candidate that should have won but didn't win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I picked the wrong guy this time and he won.  Who fucking knows but the basis of almost all USA centric conspiracy theories is desire to maintain the patriot roots of our country.   It isn't anti-government by default or anti-american by definition.  Maybe try /anarchy.

       The actual conspiracy here is that external actors have infiltrated this sub, likely both at the mod and active user level, and are shaping the conversations away from certain topics. Who is doing this? What are their motives? Who else is implicated? Does it go up to the admin level? Which other subs have been compromised? These are the questions that matter.
