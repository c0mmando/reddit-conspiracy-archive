        NAWAPA.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This project was conceived in the JFK era (was received enthusiastically by kennedy) and promised to divert water from Alaskan and Canadian wetlands to the arid areas in the southwestern united states. The impact of this would have been seemingly unlimited supplies of water and hydroelectric energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       How was he going to pay for this?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/debt-free-united-states-notes-were-once-issued-under-jfk-and-the-u-s-government-still-has-the-power-to-issue-debt-free-money">
        Debt free currency
       </a>
       . It is well doccumented that kennedy issued both united states treasury notes, and an executive order authorizing
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110">
        silver-backed guarantees.
       </a>
       This was to be a great American public works project, just as the space program was. Nuclear desalination plants were also planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump very well could be reviving American manufacturing and appointing energy executives with cross-border negotiation experience to launch this massive public works project which extends from Canada all the way down to Mexico. This will require massive amounts of minerals and energy, both industries he promises to revive. This will also create unskilled labor jobs on an unprecedented scale, and may be the only possible solution when faced with automation for consumer manufacturing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has made very strange statements promising to
       <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/05/28/trump-california-drought-sot.cnn">
        end the california drought
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does the mainstream media fit into all of this? They have already pre-emtively discredited the idea by giving massive coverage to william shatner launching this [ridiculous kickstarter](
       <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/04/21/william-shatner-california-drought-seattle-pipe/26111213/">
        www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/04/21/william-shatner-california-drought-seattle-pipe/26111213/
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Very strange that the Dakota Access Pipeline in particular is getting such massive coverage when national maps of oil pipelines  looks like
       <a href="http://chapelboro.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MapofUSpipelines1.jpg">
        this
       </a>
       . The reason? To set precedence for denying eminent domain through
       <a href="http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/81/8d/75/818d7575741886a290c50ff2cd77fe09.jpg">
        tribal lands
       </a>
       . It seems very convenient that these protestors are called "water guardians".
      </p>
      <p>
       It would seem they suspect Trump of NAWAPA ambitions, and are per-emptively preparing to combat it by priming the public.
       <a href="http://trumpcommission.org/">
        Trump is a known truther
       </a>
       so it would make a ton of sense that he knows about the theory of Kennedy being killed for his debt-free currency and public works ambitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do the corporate bank-backed powers fear NAWAPA?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Obama has repeatedly stated that our standard of living is unsustainable, and that population control and environmental measures need to be implemented.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No longer will we need foreign oil as the hydroelectric and nuclear power will provide energy. Energy prices will be unable to be artificially controlled.
         <strong>
          we will have nationalized energy and water
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Huge amount of unskilled labor jobs for minorities and uneducated whites, both groups who historically (until recently) vote liberal
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Unprecedented amounts of agricultural farmlands will open up, providing huge supplies of food which will facilitate both a lower cost of living and population boom. Two things elites DO NOT WANT.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       To me, the dots connect here and there very well could be something massive going on. What do you guys think?

       We have massive national works projects that promise virtually free energy and unlimited water for agricultural and manufacturing jobs. No unemployment and an unprecedented standard of living paid for by a debt free currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, this goes 100% against the elite's agenda of convincing us of resource scarcity and keeping us in a cycle of debt by steadily increasing the consumer price index.

       The JFK assassination is explained in a leaked cable, where they compare the method to another assassination, where the assassin would be assassinated by someone else.

       Awesome write-up. I have been unashamedly frothing at the mouth over at t_d with the rest of the pedes for a few months, and it's been highly entertaining, but I've missed the thoughtfulness and depth I always get over here.

       Wrote a paper about the NDAPL and after seeing your existing pipeline map it's stupid that this is an issue at all.

       A good theory, I think however the uproar in ND wasnt the MSM, but

       by developers who appear to have been trying to perhaps reclaim or at the least damage the Natural Reservation. Also the police state was revealed when LE turned up in armoured vehicles to 'move' the Natives; veterans saw this injustice and made a bold move as only they can.

       I agree, but I believe this was planned. We had private corporate security sending attack dogs against protesters.  Why let corporate cronies handle something like this? Because they wanted to make this as big of a mess as possible. And they did; in the end both liberals and conservative elements joined in to protest.
