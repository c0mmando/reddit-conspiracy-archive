<p><strong>Powell:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>If we want to do Iraq, we should do it</em> <strong><em>at a time of our choosing</em></strong>. <em>But we should not do it now, because we don&#39;t have linkage to this event.&quot;</em></p>

<p>March 17, 2003 - G.W. Bush threatens Saddam Hussein</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/17/sprj.irq.bush.transcript/"><strong>Bush: &#39;Leave Iraq within 48 hours&#39;</strong></a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. Their refusal to do so will result in military conflict commenced</em> <strong><em>at a time of our choosing.</em></strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On October 16, 2016, Vice President Joe Biden regurgitated the phrase, warning Russia that the US would retaliate against alleged Russian hacking:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/362936-putin-brics-press-conference/"><strong>Putin on Biden cyberthreat: First time US admits such thing on highest level</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Quoting Biden:</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We are sending a message [to Putin],”</em> Biden told NBC. <em>“He’ll know it.</em> <strong><em>It will be at the time of our choosing</em></strong>, <em>and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact,”</em> the US vice president said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yesterday, December 15, 2016, Obama AGAIN evoked the ominous phraseology:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/12/15/505775550/obama-on-russian-hacking-we-need-to-take-action-and-we-will">Obama On Russian Hacking: &#39;We Need To Take Action. And We Will&#39;</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an interview with NPR&#39;s Steve Inskeep that is airing Friday on Morning Edition, Obama said, <em>&quot;I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections ... we need to take action. And we will</em> — <strong><em>at a time and place of our own choosing</em></strong>. <em>Some of it may be explicit and publicized; some of it may not be.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it a mere coincidence that this phrase, <strong><em>&quot;at a time of our choosing&quot;</em></strong> is continually being raised? Perhaps not. </p>

<p>As it happened, the &quot;time&quot; that Bush &quot;chose&quot; to invade Iraq just happened to fall on the <strong><em>Jewish Holiday of Purim</em></strong>, a concurrence that was widely noted among Jewish authors at the time, and had even been PREDICTED by one such author - EIGHT DAYS BEFORE Bush gave his speech:</p>

<p><strong>Media Monitors Network - Posted: March 08, 2003</strong></p>

<h1><a href="http://www.mediamonitors.net/tommysiewicz4.html">Purim 2003: This year in Iraq?</a></h1>

<p>by Tom Mysiewicz</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m thinking of that Purim some 45 years ago and <strong>am afraid the United States may be unknowingly participating in an ancient ritual</strong>--much like I did as a young boy so long ago.  <strong>I have long been afraid that the U.S. might &quot;choose&quot; this time for its invasion of Iraq and the final installation of the Israeli State as the dominant Mid-East power</strong> because of the extremely negative signal this would give to Islamic extremists and even countries in the region and elsewhere.  That <strong>this year, the celebration of bloodshed on Purim might be more than a dream or a ritual</strong>.  That instead of the sounds &quot;graggers&quot;. the night of March 17th may echo with the sounds of a massive U.S. bombardment--the so-called &quot;shock and awe&quot; bombardment of Iraq that we are being prepared to accept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember, the above was written BEFORE Bush delivered his speech - ON THE EVE OF PURIM, 2003. To Jewish Kabbalists, the mystical significance of the timing of the US attack on Iraq cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>Given that the &quot;CHOICE&quot; of words used by both Biden and Obama while threatening Russia were nearly identical to Bush&#39;s &quot;CHOICE&quot; of  words while threatening Saddam&#39;s Iraq 13 years ago, dare we write it off as &quot;empty rhetoric&quot;.</p>

<p>I doubt that Putin will.</p>

<p>As it happens, I was looking into the abyss a bit last spring, and started to compile a few notes and links.</p>

<p>Rough notes from my files:</p>

<p>Fall of the Czar of Russia and kindling of the Bolshevik Revolution:

<p>Purim, March 1, 1953: An “increasingly anti-Semitic“ Josef Stalin suffered a “stroke”, dying on March 5. According to Vyacheslav Molotov, Lavrentiy Beria allegedly boasted that he had murdered Stalin, an allegation supported by anomalous internal hemorrhaging in Stalin’s stomach and kidneys, as noted in the official autopsy. Indications are that he may have in fact been poisoned using Warfain, an anticoagulant used in rat poison.</p>

On the 20th, the protesters burned down a Ba&#39;ath Party headquarters and &quot;other buildings&quot;. The ensuing clashes claimed the lives of seven police officers[148] and 15 protesters.[149] Ten days later in a speech, President Bashar al-Assad blamed &quot;foreign conspirators&quot; pushing Israeli propaganda for the protests.

<hr/>

<p>I should note that Purim 2017 isn&#39;t until March 12. </p>

<p>Channuka begins on Christmas Day this year, but it&#39;s not quite like Purim, which is &quot;special&quot; in that it is a raucous celebration of hatred and vindictiveness - the &quot;conquering of enemies&quot;, ancient and modern, real and imaginary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get it twisted. I support you 100%, I support your brothers and sisters in arms 100% and I want you all to come home safely. But at the same time, our military has become a private security force for the cabal, protecting nothing more than oil and opiates for the billionaires who control the world. I do NOT at all support our government&#39;s reasons for sending you all to fight. I&#39;m not a fan of war, not a fan of seeing young men and women sent to die or fight for the cabal&#39;s financial interests while under the guise of a &quot;war on terror&quot;. </p>

<p>Shit, you said it yourself that the bullshit with Russia scares you to death. We may very well go to war with Russia for absolutely no reason. No reason at all. Has not shit to do with terror, or a Russian threat, but rather a gigantic pissing contest and an effort to get Putin to shut up and stop spouting the truth about how our government really works. </p>

<p>Our military hasn&#39;t been used to protect our freedoms for years now. We support and fund ISIS, we did the same for Al Qaeda. We created the terrorists you are going to go fight. In the current climate of the world, the United States is no longer the good guys. You think you&#39;re gaining freedom? Freedom from being broke? Freedom from feeling useless? Dude, you&#39;re going to a place where you are going to be told what to do every single day. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, I honestly don&#39;t mean to be a douche, and I will await my downvotes, I&#39;m simply speaking how I feel about our current government/military situation. More than a couple friends of my family have enlisted thinking it was their &quot;way out&quot;, only to discover that the ONLY thing they ended up fighting for was the guy or gal standing next to them. Not their country, not freedom...</p>

<p>I sincerely wish you the best, and I hope the experience provides you with what you need in your own life to feel happy. I really do. Furthermore, I hope you are one of the ones who can parlay military service into a fruitful life and post military career. Regardless how I feel, or what my opinions are, I have nothing but love for you and I wish you the absolute best, man. </p>
