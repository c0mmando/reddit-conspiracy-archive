<p>Your moments from your death, armed militia, terrorists, who knows are around the corner and your certain death is imminent. You can hear people being shot, women being raped, and all sorts of horribleness coming your way. BUT instead of running, instead of fighting or trying to escape, you take a second to sit down and go live on facebook?</p>

<p>Like what in the actual fuck? </p>

<p>I know where we all stand on this, I get that its western propaganda, but holy hell this is a new low and people are eating it up. </p>

From CNN saying Russia/Assad were going door-to-door and executing people, to videos showing Syrian children going through painful surgeries hitting reddit&#39;s front page (right now), to facebook videos showing Syrian White Helmets pulling infants from rubble. </p>

<p>The timing is no coincidence.</p>

<p>People who&#39;ve been there says no one coming out from eastern aleppo/rebel controlled have ever heard of the White Helmets.</p>

<p>Also a guy in White Helmets apparantly has been pictured along a Al Queda or another terrorist organization</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are PR firms with government contracts that specialize in producing this stuff.  There was a video floating around that showed footage from a hospital in Syria, but before it begins you can see one of the &#39;injured&#39; men laughing and joking, then becoming incredibly serious and putting on his &#39;pain face&#39; when he realizes he&#39;s on camera.  Perhaps someone saved it and can post in this thread.  For additional information, check out the movie &quot;Wag the Dog.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Atlantic Council&#39;s Digital Research Forensic Lab got on these Aleppo videos really quickly to package and push them.</p>

<p>The Atlantic Council is funded by Ukraine, Bahrain, UAE, USA, Sweden, the Turkish Ministry of Energy, Lockheed, Raytheon, etc. The DFRLab steps in as &quot;neutral&quot; experts to verify claims by the Ukrainian Security Service. They go online hunting for &quot;Russian&quot; &quot;fake news&quot; and research how images and videos online can be geolocated using landmarks.</p>

<p>A lot of the Aleppo videos just happen to not have any landmarks and are just a close up of the person&#39;s face. One, at the end, randomly panned around to a street for a few seconds. No landmarks or sky of course.</p>
