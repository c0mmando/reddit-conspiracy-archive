    <div class="md"><p>People researching/investigating due to pizzagate are unearthing all manner of corruption that they cross in their investigative path. If it was just a few really shady people in one little business, then there probably wouldn&#39;t be any attention paid to the issue. But people are looking into all the connections, the money trails, and every dot is connecting to more dots, more people up to suspicious shit, etc. And on top of all that, it&#39;s causing a resurgence in public interest about past corruption, scandals and coverups that were of the same nature. And on top of all <em>that</em> it is a non-partisan effort (not that some people don&#39;t have partisan leanings, but they are set aside, and people get called out for it when they try to push a partisan motive). This is uniting people against corruption, and people uniting is the worst possible thing for a corrupt ruling elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right on the money. The people <em>uniting</em> is the greatest pathway to their downfall, hence all the division and manufactured partisan narratives. They keep each side believing the other side is the embodiment of evil when in reality there is one common enemy, the serpents at the top breathing lies to perpetuate the division and hate so that they can maintain power and control.  </p>

<p>PG is opening up people&#39;s eyes to the truth, the utterly foul and disgusting and inhuman practices these people partake in just to stay as close to the top as possible. Theirs will come one day. Til that day comes we all need to keep working to get the truth out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck yes. Just 5 years ago I was in a pit of despair at the state of the world - having personally researched so many things - it doesn&#39;t help that my personality type is one of wanting to take something with full force. I watched Ring of Power in one sitting, that Kenney Doc that&#39;s like 12 hours or something in one sitting, etc. I hit a very muddy, cloudy bottom. One that has you truly questioning the point of maintaining moral absolutes, or even the merit of caring about people in general.</p>

<p>But the collective consciousness is lowly rumbling from its slumber.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be great to see real unity absent petty differences for the greater good of our nation. Although, I have to say it still feels like we are far from it as so many are unable to engage in conversation with open ears and mind that goes beyond &#39;what&#39; they believe. Why someone believes something is so much more powerful than making statement about what you believe but the conversation never seems to get productive traction. It seems as of the last couple months operatives are everywhere you turn in favor of supporting a story line that makes absolutely no sense to me. Someone might say - &quot;that&#39;s a simplistic view that isn&#39;t worthy of conversation&quot;.  [For context, this is in reference to not having anything to go off of other than a series of statement from &#39;officials&#39;.] To which you might say &quot;ok. What is it that discourages you from engaging in this conversation so I can try to find a middle ground bc I might be able to learn from your position?&quot; Nothing. Crickets. Is it just me (and many others seen here on Reddit) or have we really reached a point where swallow pride is no longer acceptable?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please, give me proof. Not opinion pieces like the NYTimes&#39;s, where their &quot;investigation&quot; is <em>asking the guy accused if he did it</em>, but ACTUAL proof.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to believe it either, but I have heavy suspicions because of how much all TPTB are bending over backwards to say it&#39;s fake. It&#39;s a <strong>pizza joint</strong>. Why do all the media and even Congress care so much?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one has provided any proof that anything is going on or that there are any victims of Pizzagate.  You can&#39;t ask for, nor provide, proof that <em>Nothing</em> has happened.  <em>Nothing</em> happens anyway all the time.  You have to provide proof that <em>Something</em> has happened.  That is the nature of proof and truth.</p>

<p>&quot;real news&quot; about pizzagate would be &quot;Child victims of Pedophilia ring rescued, perpetrators arrested&quot; but we don&#39;t hear any actual proof of anything happening.  It&#39;s all a bunch of fictional assumptions.  &quot;Real news&quot; about pizza gate was indeed limited to, &quot;Nut job enters pizza restaurant with assault rifle and fires it&quot;</p>

<p>Find a line from the emails or an innocent social media account
/ Repeat the line with a sarcastic inflection
/ Call it proof that something untoward is happening</p>

<p>The whole thing was made up on 4Chan when someone suggested that common foods like &quot;pizza&quot; and &quot;hot dog&quot; be substituted <em>arbitrarily</em> to fabricate a <em>fictional narrative</em>.  And it worked.  </p>

<p>This is a huge, sick game of Mad libs.</p>

<p>Those word choices are totally arbitrary, selected mainly for obvious comedic effect.  That&#39;s what makes it fictional and this is what pizzagate &quot;investigators&quot; trip over when describing it.    </p>

<p>For example, just the word Pizza.  &quot;Cheese Pizza&quot; has been used as a code word to refer to child porn because it has common initials CP.    <strong>But There Is No Mention Of <em>Cheese Pizza</em> In The Wikileaks Emails.</strong>  &quot;Pizza&quot; as a code word is not specifically linked to anything: if you dig around in urbandictionary you can see it used as a code word for weed, psychedelic mushrooms, sex, etc. etc.  The selection of Pizza to be substituted is totally arbitrary and therefore fictional.  </p>

<p>You can even go and see photographs of pizza parties, <strong>with pizza</strong>, attached to the podesta emails.....  but I guess the &quot;investigators&quot; missed those photos because they don&#39;t show any child abuse.</p>

<p>What many people today view as &quot;Communism&quot; is mostly Bolshevism. However, over the years it was used not just to label and target actual communists, but rather anyone who was anti-capitalist in any way.</p>

<p>The concept is as old as civilization itself. As long as there have been empires and ruling classes, there have always been those who defied them.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve been called &quot;blasphemers&quot;, &quot;heretics&quot;, &quot;traitors&quot;, &quot;rebels&quot;, &quot;communists&quot;, &quot;terrorists&quot;, etc. etc. etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am worried that the response to pizzagate as it relates to CPP is an effort to delegitimize any further investigation into elite pedo rings in this country.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m referring to all of the Instagram &#39;evidence&#39; which I believe is aimed at discrediting us. Everything I&#39;ve seen from this investigation about those photos hinges on the assumption of guilt. If these people fuck children it&#39;s disgusting that he posts photos of child, freezers etc... almost all of it can be dismissed by seeing these locations and producing the parents of those children (who have been identified already). As for the art, It&#39;s not a crime or even that strange for rich gay men to like weird art and again without the assumption of guilt it falls apart. <a href="http://imgur.com/dwmJgtU">As an example, that child&#39;s coffin photo is a Halloween coffee table.</a> This is America, we&#39;re free to like weird shit and not have it used against us. It scares me how easily this tactic could be used against literally anyone of us. </p>

<p>The corruption and connections from the Wikileaks is compelling and could lead somewhere, it scared them, so what do they do?  If i was running a giant elite human trafficking ring how would I discredit my investigators? Perhaps by using twitter bots to amplify an easily picked apart hashtag/narrative and then push back against it with their media?  And guess what, it&#39;s working, anyone looking into these rings now has to get past the crazy #pizzagate label to get anywhere and those who are running things are laughing in their private jets. Thoughts?</p>

<p>TLDR: The gunman wasn&#39;t the false flag, he was only the lever to get the real false flag into the media spotlight to discredit the investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that most of the instagram photos appear to be circumstantial and some of the comments appear to be just dark humor.</p>

<p>However, I would contend that because a lot of the art and music surrounding Comet Ping Pong appears to be kiddie porn adjacent, we should be scrutinizing Alefantis and Podesta.</p>

<p>Pedophiles know that their sexual urges are not socially acceptable and they go to great lengths to keep it hidden.  They also take time to find the right victims, such as children from foster homes, or any child who is likely to become passive and not speak out against sexual assault, or someone who authorities may not believe if they were to speak out.</p>

<p>For everyone saying that this is just kooky art people expressing themselves, I say we need to be vigilant that a few in this community are not actively exposing children to these themes in order to cherry pick a few out to molest.</p>

<p>It may be a few people who were molested as children and are using art and music as an outlet/coping mechanism, but often these victims become the abusers themselves.  It is not a great leap to go from art about having sex with children to actual sex with children, especially when powerful political figures with the means to do this and get away with it are involved.</p>

<p>Interesting point, and one i hadn&#39;t thought of, is it the normalization of these themes that you think would make kids more susceptible to abduction or that the abductors would notice those kids not phased by the art?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I would argue that an inconsistency such as this when compared to the use of a public instagram account to brag about their crimes is exactly the kind of confirmation bias that undermines the investigation. For people not seeing the connections Occam&#39;s razor is law. </p>

<p>*EDIT, 7:28PM ET. I just want to point out how hilariously many downvotes I got with this comment, BEFORE even the FBI came out to agree with Russian involvement. The Russian shills that have taken over <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are too obvious.</p>
