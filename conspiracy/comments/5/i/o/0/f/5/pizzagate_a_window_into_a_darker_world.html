        tl;dr
       </strong>
       <em>
        A large Internet following has developed surrounding the idea that human trafficking rings are being allowed to operate at the highest levels of government as part of a blackmail/bribery scheme to control politicians in power, all over the world.
       </em>
      </p>
      <h1>
       <strong>
        Why Should You Care?
       </strong>
      </h1>
      <p>
       The first reason Pizzagate should be of interest to everyone in the world because of the way the USA is treating the topic; Censorship. Misinformation. Hired Internet shills. Disinformation. Attempts to infiltrate. Death threats. And Worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second reason is that, through the lens of Pizzagate, it can be deduced that the average person is being lied to about the level of corruption within our governments. All of our governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most immediate reason everyone should be concerned is because slavery is alive and well in the world and it can only flourish with the cooperation of government officials and the media. Forced labor. Domestic servitude. Sexual Servitude. Political servitude. And Worse.

       For many people, Pizzagate is a jumping off point. It started with spirit cooking, the pizza code and the Instagram account of jimmycomet. However, these accusations have been around for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Andrew Breitbart accused John Podesta, specifically, of running an underage sex slave operation:

       Guccifer attributed his work to the personal mission to reveal that Hillary Clinton and others were occult ritualists who were sacrificing children:

      </p>
      <p>
       There is something so concerning that people have been dedicating their lives, even in the face of imprisonment and death, to attempt to bring the truth to the light of day. Whatever you believe about what goes on in the basement of Comet Ping Pong, the money trail still leads back to human trafficking in 100 different ways.
      </p>

       Let's follow the trail of the average Pizzagate Investigator:

        Convicted Pedophiles:

      </p>
      <p>
       That was enough for most people to be convinced that the Podestas and James Alefantis are 100% confirmed to be hanging around and being supportive of convicted pedophiles, have a penchant for art involving pedophilia and known symbology from pedophile culture and that they cast spells by writing on the wall with blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Alefantis immediately reacted by calling everyone racist, homophobic before switching to 'conspiracy theorist.' Insults without addressing the evidence. Trump supporters were treated exactly the same way, watching the media “swiftboat” Trump 24 hours a day, while being called homophobic and racist. People are tired of 'victim status' being used as a shield against common sense. So, the investigation digs in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately, it is revealed that
       <strong>
        Alefantis is connected to David Brock, who works with Hillary Clinton to astroturf the Internet
       </strong>
       by paying people to post pro-Hillary comments, infiltrate Trump groups to create concern, anxiety and doubt, and to insult people on the Internet, if they disagree with Hillary. It is part of their script.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the Pizzagate investigators have zeroed in on a media machine that is, apparently, connected to all of this protected political pedophilia.
       <strong>
        Maybe even at the heart of it.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason you have so much confusing information regarding Pizzagate is, one, there is so much damning evidence that it is impossible to sum up in a single post. Two,
       <strong>
        Correct the Record and similar organizations have infiltrated investigating groups to intentionally insert false leads to discredit the movement.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been trained to trust the media and avoid looking at primary sources. However, the primary sources that have been leaked over the last couple of years overwhelmingly reveal
       <strong>
        a massive web of organized crime of a type that is difficult to comprehend
       </strong>
       without digging through it, yourself.

        What About The Human Trafficking Connections?
       </strong>
      </h1>
      <p>
       Here are a lot of leads: voat.co/v/pizzagate/1466894
      </p>
      <p>
       What we are looking at, though, are political NGO's (like the Clinton Foundation or American Security Council Foundation) that pretend to be charities, but actually are only designed to cut deals with whoever is necessary in order to help mining interests extract raw materials from the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=human+trafficking+mining">
        https://lmgtfy.com/?q=human+trafficking+mining
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What we see is that these mining operations that the Clinton Foundation are involved in ALL REQUIRE SLAVES. aka Forced Human Labor. Frank Giustra. Marc Rich. VCS Mining. Uranium One. Glencore.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of illegal activities that use the same exact infrastructure to funnel people across the world for the purposes of slavery. Pimps. Pedophiles. Construction contractors. People are willing to pay for people and sellers don't care what it is for.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does Comet Ping Pong tie in to human trafficking? Other than seemingly participating in the pedophilia, Alefantis has a web of small businesses to launder money through. He is breaking down larger sums of money to disguise the source. He sells crappy satanic art through Transformer and other fronts far above their value. All of their money is flowing through each other. George Soros, Podestas, the Kremlin, the Clinton Foundation, Saudi Arabia, Qatar... the list goes on and on. The financial web is the most revealing because it suggests that there is a lot more to this than just having sex with kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why everyone needs to keep investigating.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The manipulation of public perception has occurred on a massive scale to convince people they need to be worried about conflicts that have nothing to do with solving the basic problem of eliminating slavery.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is a window into how the 'elite' utilize the media and government apparatus to distract, confuse and help people forget what is important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is a window into the existential crisis of humankind; organizing a society without slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, keep raising awareness. Please, keep investigating.

      <p>
       The pieces are coming together.

       Total silence on the Trump, Epstein connection as well...
      </p>
      <p>
       “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine for a 2002 profile of Epstein. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” Donald Trump

       The Trump connection is hazy at best. From what I've seen, most consider him a person of interest who either knows or has participated but covered his tracks. Def worth keeping an eye on, but it's not as solid and undeniable as the Clinton connection.

       No doubt. But as the saying goes "where there's smoke...." eh you know the rest. My argument all along has been that Trump was always the selected choice. It wasn't hard to tell that the American public was begging for an outsider. The MSM knew this and played it perfectly. If they didn't want him to get attention they would have Ron Paul'ed his ass and never mentioned his name.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you said Trumps tracks are covered better and I believe this is why. No doubt the Clintons are pure evil but they are the scapegoats this time around. Trump and Clintons attended each others family weddings and Trump has donated to the Clinton Foundation. It's like when Bush and Kerry ran against each other. Either way they had a skull and bones member as president, same idea. It's an illusion, and a great one. The fully scripted MSM had Newt Gingrich "slip up", AJ ran with it and the rest is history. What's the use though, how do you tell all these well meaning people that are full of new found hope that they've been duped once again...Fuck it downvote me to hell, "whose coming with me man"

       I honestly think whoever is in control has complete control of the election, trump was chosen to serve a purpose, he's a savior figure for white middle class Americans and at the last second he was deemed more likely to be able to control more Americans. No one becomes president unless they are meant to.

       Maybe...or maybe trump is the ultimate controlled opposition and it's all part of the plan. You're idea only makes sense if you don't believe the MSM is capable of lying in a way that gives the impression they aren't happy and scared. You either believe the MSM narrative or you don't. Right now the narritve is that they are scared. If you believe they are totally scripted as I do than why couldn't they have come up with this script? Seems more likely than Trump still being alive if he was really a threat to me. But what do I know.

       Seen as you dole out red pills, could you maybe she'd some light on the 'bloodline' vs 'illuminati-esque' battle. I read it here before and always keep it in mind. I think it goes with the real world approach of competition in business, where by we think it's one entity trying to be in control, but instead there's two. Any thoughts?

       I have looked into the idea of bloodlines and believe they are important to at least one faction of tptb. I have also looked into the illuminati and their history and believe it is important. I also believe it is likely more than one group fighting for control, but which have similar belief systems. The exact way in which the web of secret societies tie into all of it is hard to say and is mostly speculation because information is hard to come by. However they way around this is to try and analyze their particular belief systems. For example it seems that the majority of these secret societies have spiritual roots in Babylonian Talmudic teachings. These are a mish mash of beliefs from the time when the Jewish pharasies re wrote Jewish laws to help them assimilate better into Babylonian culture when they relocated there. I have always had a suspicion that multiple groups were fighting for control but which ones is hard to say. Are there ones fighting for good vs evil ones? I doubt it because the very act of being secretive tells me their intentions are selfish. As for a group fighting to protect their bloodline I assume you mean the bloodline of Christ? Which would be refering to the Templars and all the groups who branched from them. It is a theory that the "dark" illuminati infiltrated the Masons and Vatican for example as well as other societies. How true this is I'm not sure because reliable information is hard to come by. I would love to find out that there was an underground vigilante type group fighting evil to gain total human freedom and liberty but I have yet to find one. In my opinion while they may be different groups they all seem to have similar agendas and if they are fighting each other it is simply because both groups want total control. In essence the ultimate greed. That is how I identify an evil person or group is whether their intentions are selfish or generous. If you have any other info on in fighting between secret societies I'd be very interested to read it.

       That's a very broad assumption. Secrecy is merely a tactic.

       You should check out a book called

        "Morning of the Magicians"

       I understand what you mean and I should have clarified a bit more. What I mean is that secrecy by a group who's actions always indicate an attempt to control or for personal agendas. You are right though, it makes sense that a group who is working for good would have to keep their activities quiet. Until now I had never heard of such a group. I am definitely interested in learning more

       Wasn't it that this election was a supposed "choice" between the two? Like, I get how we all deep down think that 'they are all the same', but it genuinely looks and feels as if it was the dems election to lose and that it was taken from them. You can argue that it was the plan and to make it seem real etc. etc. But with everything looking as if it was destined to be (Obama - Hillary, change without change) I think there was a genuine upset in the balance. On top of that I dint think Donald trump is all his own man, there's always something. Here's what I think though: what if "their" idea of how to control us, is more people friendly? They have a different idea of control. Not pizza, and worship but straight up control through desires met? Please tell me what you think, I'm not sure if I explained it well enough.. question everything though. Bloodline - Hillary. Illuminati - trump. Is what I was kinda getting at earlier

       While I like the idea it sounds a bit too good to be true in my opinion. I just think that anyone truly going against the establishement would never have got the air time trump did. Think about it, if they knew the average American was fed up and wanted an outsider, to promote him all they would have to do is act like he's an outsider and they don't want him in. It sounds so simple but most people arent in the right mindset to think about that. Anyway don't get me wrong, I do have hope and lots of it. You won't find it from the MSM. It's one of those things where you know it when you look in your heart. Cant you feel it too? We all pretty much know what's right and wrong in our hearts and the universe will give it back to the people who deserve it. Its part of the cycle I believe

       I think this election was planned to pit the MSM versus the alt-right to see who is more effective, or to gain ppl's trust again. Basically make the MSM so horrible that people trust the alt-right without question. Then the elites can get back to their psy-ops and brainwashing through infowars, breitbart, etc. Just an idea.

       So ok, I'm all in on the possibility of an elite pedo-ring in our country(see jimmy saville, cosby, epstien etc). However I worry that we are being misdirected by some aspects of pizzagate in order to discredit investigation into legitimate leads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you please speak to:
      </p>
      <p>
       The pizza code: 
I've looked into the handkerchief code and white isn't related to pedo stuff but mutual masterbation in every source I've seen including the link mentioned, am I wrong?  I keep seeing this perpetuated and it makes it very easy for others to dismiss the allegations if I'm right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Comet connection:
Aside from having dated David Brock and having weird shit on his Instagram what connects Jimmycomet to this ring? I ask because I believe all of the Instagram 'evidence' is junk aimed at discrediting us. Everything I've seen from this investigation about the photos hinges on the assumption of guilt. If these people fuck children it's disgusting that he posts photos of child, freezers etc... almost all of it can be dismissed by seeing these locations and producing the parents of those children (who have been identified already). As for the art, It's not a crime or even that strange for rich gay men to like weird art and again without the assumption of guilt it falls apart.  As an example, that
       <a href="http://imgur.com/dwmJgtU">
        child's coffin post is a Halloween coffee table
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not writing this to change your minds but to ask what if. If i was running a giant elite human trafficking ring how would I discredit my investigators? Perhaps by using twitter bots to amplify an easily picked apart hashtag/narrative and push back against it with the media? It's working anyone looking into these rings now has to get past the crazy #pizzagate label and those who are in charge are laughing in their private jets.

       Money is what ties Comet Ping Pong to a wider web involved in human trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comet Ping Pong gets money from all of these players. So does Transformer and Alefantis' other businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis is tied to underground tunnels, the occult and pedophilia imagery and so are a large portion of his friends on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong are also tied to a number of convicted pedophiles/traffickers. Dennis Hastert, Jeffrey Epstein, Christopher Kloman, Richard Harding, Laura Silsby, ARK employees, Glencore trafficking, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The money is what tells the story.

       Ok so follow the money and find where it's coming from and for now ignore(but not forget) the social media aspect because to people who don't know the connections it looks ridiculous and is used to discredit us.

       Basically, I'm worried that the gunman wasn't the false flag but merely the lever used to get the media attention to the larger false flag which moved the investigation away from those at the top of this and could be more easily discredited than the questions about those emails/connections.

        The pizza code: I've looked into the handkerchief code and white isn't related to pedo stuff but mutual masterbation in every source I've seen including the link mentioned, am I wrong?

       You have to look at the whole context, not just one word in the code. "It seems pizza related" is the pedo part of that sentence.

        The Comet connection: Aside from having dated David Brock and having weird shit on his Instagram what connects Jimmycomet to this ring? I ask because I believe all of the Instagram 'evidence' is junk aimed at discrediting us. Everything I've seen from this investigation about the photos hinges on the assumption of guilt. If these people fuck children it's disgusting that he posts photos of child, freezers etc... almost all of it can be dismissed by seeing these locations and producing the parents of those children (who have been identified already). As for the art, It's not a crime or even that strange for rich gay men to like weird art and again without the assumption of guilt it falls apart. As an example, that child's coffin post is a Halloween coffee table

       I agree that CPP should not be the focus and on the chans it never was. I don't know when or how the distortion happened but it definitely threw people off the Podestas. It is weird how in that shopping center (the 4 stores, not sure what to call it)  3 stores have pedo symbols in their logos and the 4th store is also owned by Alf.

       I agree it's a weird email and the podestas should be looked into further but get rid of the disinformation to be credible.

       As for the symbols...I honestly think it's a stretch. triangles are everywhere and crossed ping-pong paddles are a very understandable logo for a ping-pong restaurant. The hand in the heart logo was from a cancer fundraising org or something. Also besta and cpp are polar opposites, a trump supporter and a gay man working together??? i agree it is a very unfortunate coincidence but i think that's all it is

       Fair enough, i'm just going to note those connections and focus on the meat of the podesta connections. If it as I do that more connections to these shops surface I'll revisit their involvement. What i won't do is be distracted by what I think is misdirection at this point.

       I believe humans can sense truth directly, but most are seriously out of tune with this ability. When you say "It's a coincidence" you are basically saying "I see a pattern here, and I sense that it's true, but logical processing tells me that I must be making an error here"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important to recognize that we are error-prone, but I don't think that's a problem for most of us anymore - it is drilled into us in school that humans are error prone, can have false memories, and our perception is limited, so we actively self-police and I am happy to see a lot of that on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I think an intended side effect of this is to disconnect us with our sense of truth. Coincidences do exist, but they are much rarer than this, and everyone knows it...

       It truly saddens and frightens me that much of the hysteria is a misunderdtanding of the gay or art scene. A kneejerk reaction to Puritanical ideas. I feel like the 90s have been erased. Alternative groups have been recloseted. PC awareness went into hyper-drive. Actual political activism has become slacktivism. And here I am complaining online about it... sigh

       ...it is a revolving location and was quickly wiped clean. There's a secret door which leads to Buck's Fishing and Camping, which has a basement with tunnel access so it was easy to quickly clean house without being detected. They probably did so before the Podesta emails were even released. And of course at each location they have a brilliant but expendable front man (Alefantis) with a funny not-so-subtly revealing name...

       They do use revolving locations and number of them have been identified. A number are known publicly, and some investigators have learned to keep a lid on new finds until they are fleshed out more.

       I agree with this 100%. Yet, how many of us choose to do so, especially the kind of stuff Alefantis and co. have been caught putting up? More importantly, if we were to be accused of something for doing so, would people in media and high levels of influence be coming out of the woodwork to speak in our defense? With Alefantis' alleged connections, you'd think he'd be smarter about this stuff. But then again, his buddy Podesta fell for a phishing scam, so perhaps they aren't too bright.

       I believe 'pizza' in the pizza code is merely a loose term for illegal activity. I have encountered people who believe it is 'pussy,' which actually works pretty well, if you just need a one word translation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just feel like it is an intentionally non-specific code. Kimdotcom suggests that 'pizza' is weapons and 'ice cream' is money.
      </p>

       He could be right in some instances, and everyone else could be right in other instances.

       In my social circle, when we are talking in front of kids, we use 'donchyaknow' as a catch all.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Hey, wanna run over to the donchyaknow?'
      </p>
      <p>
       'Hey, let's go take care of that donchyaknow.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of that, I think it is folly to attribute one specific word as a translation for any of those terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the handkerchief code goes, white could mean a variety of things, virginity, safe sex, etc. Only their social circle knows. Still, the handkerchief code is a thing and it is almost certainly something sexual.
      </p>
      <p>
       The connection to Jimmy Comet is money and personal relationships. He has a personal relationship with convicted pedophiles. He has a personal relationship on social media of people who are posting pedophilia related themes. Some are super overt and clear, others are more subtle.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the money is the key. Alefantis runs a number of small businesses that are low-tech and poorly run. He is laundering money. He gets it from George Soros, the DNC, art sales, pizza parties, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone says Alefantis isn't supporting pedophiles in a material way, his money laundering requires another explanation. Castellum and Pegasus are a couple of his other businesses that overlook a playground in a residential area that doesn't seem to serve any purpose. Purportedly, they transport horses, but there are no trailers anywhere near the property.

       I agree that paid shills are trying to disrupt the investigation and the narrative. Right now, there is a concerted effort to demonize Jews over the whole thing. The tactics continue to get more sophisticated, but just documenting evidence provides innoculation.

       Primary source to primary source investigation.

      <p>
       I'd say that the pizzagate movement is growing based on the number of subscribers to the investigative communities. They keep growing.

       The first half of your response is what I'm talking about with easily dismissed evidence. We're assuming these words mean something and most skeptics would look and say that's ridiculous, that's all you got? that lets them dismiss any further connections and label the movement crazy.

      <p>
       Can you show me an example of this that doesn't require assumption of guilt to see the themes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis's businesses are odd and i don't know how they are so profitable but again, and i sound like a broken record, without the assumption of guilt people can dismiss it as corruption at worst.

       There are definitely shills posting discrediting 'evidence' but to play devils advocate (perhaps literally) there is far to much repeated 'canon' evidence that relies entirely on the assumption of guilt to be believed. This undermines the investigation into the big players who seem to have been overshadowed by the false flag of CPP. These are just my feeling on it, I've heard in order to have a strong position in a debate you must be able to articulate the best argument the other side can make against you and then just as articulately refute it. I don't see that happening with our cause.

       <strong>
        central

       to everything crazy happening in the government today. Money, power, corruption, trafficking, slavery, cult worship, and a raging, incessant need for
       <strong>
        control at all costs.
       </strong>
       These are our leaders. We the people need to wake up and get angry. Demand answers, transparency, accountability. There is power in numbers and even greater power in good. Stop letting fear of whatever- social rejection, harm, even death- prevent us from speaking out for what is right, advocating truth. It's a critical time for us as human beings.

       Anyone have a decent argument for those who "don't care" and believes that "corruption is everywhere you look, and is a part of life here and everywhere else in the world"
      </p>
      <p>
       I talked PGate with my brother in law who was curious about it. Coming from China, he's well aware that corruption flows through government, but insists that there is little that can be done to fight it so why bother. PGate doesnt affect him personally now and may not in his lifetime, so who cares if the 1% want to have sex with kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told him what if it were his children or family members who got dragged into this. What if there was political policy that directly affected him being put into place by a political candidate that didn't represent him. But since the only people who do stand for what he believes in don't fuck kids, they aren't allowed into the club and leveraged into not being elected. All I got off of that was apathy; that nobody will do anything about it and that the general public is powerless (which I don't feel is the case with America. The state/federal government is still mostly on a equal playing field with armed civilians)

       With someone that apathetic it's hard to get through, because they've lost their way of tapping into the good, noble part that exists somewhere in every (normally functioning) human; the part that allows us to choose the greater path even if it's the  harder way.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are an apathetic generation. Human apathy is what allows evil like this to grow and flourish. People who know and are apathetic are in some degree complicit to what is happening. Tell your brother in law that if people continue to do nothing even in the blatant face of this corruption, it
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       one day lead to the suffering of himself, his family, or his future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes apathy is an offshoot of being jaded from past disappointments or frustration at a lack of perceived control. Almost a "we can't beat it, so give up and detach" disillusioned defense mechanism. In this case there is still hope to tap into the deep recesses of whatever was there before. The more people wake up and spread the message and the greater unity there is between citizens, the more we can cut through the apathy. Never underestimate the power of hope, faith and love on even the deadest of human hearts.

       Well said. You made a lot of great points.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world can be a dark place to navigate. On one hand, we have to show empathy and compassion to form bonds, and on the other we have to be somewhat cold hearted, otherwise we'll be a depressed mess with all the evil going on. I guess that would be the defense mechanism you mentioned. It's like when you see those commercials about dogs being abused and they look all sad in their cages. It takes everything in me not to cry like a baby, yet people are obviously causing these poor animals pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, it's crazy to think that people just accept pedos doing their thing because it's not effecting them. These kids are defenseless. In alot of cases, these pedos have kids of their own, that's what makes it so hard to digest. It's truly EVIL.

       No doubt. But as the saying goes "where there's smoke...." eh you know the rest. My argument all along has been that Trump was always the selected choice. It wasn't hard to tell that the American public was begging for an outsider. The MSM knew this and played it perfectly. If they didn't want him to get attention they would have Ron Paul'ed his ass and never mentioned his name.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you said Trumps tracks are covered better and I believe this is why. No doubt the Clintons are pure evil but they are the scapegoats this time around. Trump and Clintons attended each others family weddings and Trump has donated to the Clinton Foundation. It's like when Bush and Kerry ran against each other. Either way they had a skull and bones member as president, same idea. It's an illusion, and a great one. The fully scripted MSM had Newt Gingrich "slip up", AJ ran with it and the rest is history. What's the use though, how do you tell all these well meaning people that are full of new found hope that they've been duped once again...Fuck it downvote me to hell, "whose coming with me man"

       Ok so follow the money and find where it's coming from and for now ignore(but not forget) the social media aspect because to people who don't know the connections it looks ridiculous and is used to discredit us.

       I have looked into the idea of bloodlines and believe they are important to at least one faction of tptb. I have also looked into the illuminati and their history and believe it is important. I also believe it is likely more than one group fighting for control, but which have similar belief systems. The exact way in which the web of secret societies tie into all of it is hard to say and is mostly speculation because information is hard to come by. However they way around this is to try and analyze their particular belief systems. For example it seems that the majority of these secret societies have spiritual roots in Babylonian Talmudic teachings. These are a mish mash of beliefs from the time when the Jewish pharasies re wrote Jewish laws to help them assimilate better into Babylonian culture when they relocated there. I have always had a suspicion that multiple groups were fighting for control but which ones is hard to say. Are there ones fighting for good vs evil ones? I doubt it because the very act of being secretive tells me their intentions are selfish. As for a group fighting to protect their bloodline I assume you mean the bloodline of Christ? Which would be refering to the Templars and all the groups who branched from them. It is a theory that the "dark" illuminati infiltrated the Masons and Vatican for example as well as other societies. How true this is I'm not sure because reliable information is hard to come by. I would love to find out that there was an underground vigilante type group fighting evil to gain total human freedom and liberty but I have yet to find one. In my opinion while they may be different groups they all seem to have similar agendas and if they are fighting each other it is simply because both groups want total control. In essence the ultimate greed. That is how I identify an evil person or group is whether their intentions are selfish or generous. If you have any other info on in fighting between secret societies I'd be very interested to read it.

       The first half of your response is what I'm talking about with easily dismissed evidence. We're assuming these words mean something and most skeptics would look and say that's ridiculous, that's all you got? that lets them dismiss any further connections and label the movement crazy.

      <p>
       Can you show me an example of this that doesn't require assumption of guilt to see the themes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis's businesses are odd and i don't know how they are so profitable but again, and i sound like a broken record, without the assumption of guilt people can dismiss it as corruption at worst.

       There are definitely shills posting discrediting 'evidence' but to play devils advocate (perhaps literally) there is far to much repeated 'canon' evidence that relies entirely on the assumption of guilt to be believed. This undermines the investigation into the big players who seem to have been overshadowed by the false flag of CPP. These are just my feeling on it, I've heard in order to have a strong position in a debate you must be able to articulate the best argument the other side can make against you and then just as articulately refute it. I don't see that happening with our cause.

       Examples of guilt, like naked pictures of children? Can't post it because it is illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are numerous examples of child porn stashed away on websites. I have reported the ones I have found, using HT Track, to the police.

       Do other people in the social circle take naked pictures of kids? Yes, Rachel Chandler, for starters.

       I get what you are saying, but the investigation is finding convicted pedophiles, non-convicted pedophiles with child porn, and human trafficking links that trace back to Saudi Arabia.

       As far as the coffin goes, two of the social media connections actually own coffin building businesses and work with kids. We aren't just talking about one coffin.

       If you really want me to spoon feed you everything, I suppose I can, it's just that everything you are saying is headed down the wrong track and opposite of the direction of the evidence.

       Also, if you are laundering money, it is because it is coming from somewhere illegal.
