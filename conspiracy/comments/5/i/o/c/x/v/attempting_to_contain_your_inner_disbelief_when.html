I was in Tesco yesterday at the self service check out, putting little silver and gold magic tokens with the high queen&#39;s face on into a machine that talks to you and confirms through an invisible network that you have given enough magic tokens to legally take an allocated amount of food out of the shop... and it just suddenly hit me that absolutely nothing is real and we&#39;re all the imagination of ourselves in an infinite recurring cycle of randomly generated dream worlds.</p>

<p>I turned to the guy using the check out next to me and had a real urge to tell him that nothing is real. I almost did. Like that feeling you get looking over a cliff edge and wanting to jump, I had to fight that urge inside of me to try to pick and peel the edge of reality and pull it back to reveal the truth...</p>

<p>Does anybody else have this problem? I&#39;m being completely serious by the way, even if this post does qualify me to be forcibly sectioned for mental evaluation.</p>

<p>If it looks fake and absurd, it is fake and absurd. That the people around you fail to recognize the automated, robotic, AI is unreality is no reflection on you.</p>

<p>Carry on being real. It really is ok.</p>

<p>There are many people who think facebook is real no? And that their &#39;friends&#39; there are real. And that digits on an internet &#39;bank account&#39; are real money, and that debt is wealth.</p>

<p>We got some kind of junk mail not long ago offering us the opportunity to invest in debt. I was speechless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true about debt is wealth. People keeping up with the Joneses, where borrowing more money, paying more interest, and being a further slave to the rat race, makes someone &quot;better&quot; than their friends. I realized the falsehood of this long ago, and have adjusted my life accordingly. See I have tons of debt, however, I have other people paying that debt down for me, in the form of rental properties. I&#39;m using the banks money to make money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, you&#39;re saying he doesn&#39;t get the original post.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing though. I bought rentals within walking distance of a major university in Canada. For more than a decade these property values have gone up by 10-25% a year in value, while my HELOCs have ranged from 2-6%. I KNOW this is a bubble, and I&#39;m not buying now, but the value of my real estate is increasing my networth by hundreds of thousands of dollars a year; more than I can earn in most careers. I now own millions of dollars of very real bricks in extremely desirable locations, and other people paid for them. I can use the cashflow to buy things and put food on the table, and when I decide to retire in 30 or 40 years, I will sell and profit for more than I could ever hope to spend. </p>

<p>Nobody would have loaned me this much money to invest in stocks. Holding debt backed by real estate has made me wealthy. I KNOW it&#39;s a game. I don&#39;t consider myself a materialistic person; I&#39;ve never owned a car, and I&#39;m 43 years old. Instead I used that money to invest in real estate. I don&#39;t spend my money on status symbols. I just won&#39;t keep my day job as long as others. It&#39;s a real way to exit the rat race. My dad worked his whole life, retired at 64, passed of cancer at 66. Maybe I&#39;ll be able to walk away a few years earlier, and spend a bit of time travelling some more, and spend some time with family. Wealth is not all bad, or always bad.</p>

<p>It is POSSIBLE to use the system to profit, and use the profit to exit the system. If I decide to walk away from my day job tomorrow, I will still have a roof over my head and food on the table from my rental income. I don&#39;t even owe the bank much at all anymore, or anybody anything really. Nobody owns me. It&#39;s a form of freedom,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just ask questions when speaking with people in person. Emotions can run very high on political issues, especially certain corruption topics, and I&#39;m not looking to literally fight anybody and don&#39;t want any stupid yelling matches wasting my time and energy. People like myself can vent on the internet, but in person there is a necessary element of tact if we want to be effective at helping each other as human beings to think more deeply.</p>

<p>Like most recent one was I asked someone if they had seen anything on their social media about pizzagate or the Russian conspiracy theory, casual and curious tone, and they responded in a huffy manner, &quot;Yeah and lot of people don&#39;t even get their facts right, they just copy and paste what they see on the internet, and I have to show them a Snopes article to show them they don&#39;t even have their facts right.&quot; So then I was like, &quot;How did you know Snopes was right?&quot; And right there they had to think, and got huffy/dismissive, and (gently) I asked, &quot;Did you just copy/paste the Snopes article?&quot; They didn&#39;t want to talk anymore lol. But I was nice about it, hope it made them think a little bit. I love it when people do the same for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider the soldier at war who suddenly realizes that the &quot;enemy&quot; who he&#39;s been ordered to kill are all actually his brothers and sisters - that is also called madness. 
The cracks in reality through which the light enters, the flashes which eventually make us wish to minimize the cognitive dissonance. The &quot;crazy wisdom&quot; of the mystics which makes them appear mad to those who inhabit only the surface level of this reality. To dig deeper than the world of football, &quot;reality TV,&quot; and allegiance to political parties is to risk being considered insane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try and fight that feeling as much as you can dude. About 4 or 5 years ago I had it all; good job, money, car, girlfriend, house... But I started thinking exactly the same as you&#39;re feeling and I couldn&#39;t fight it, I fell right off the wagon and spent a long time rejecting society, and ultimately lost everything I had. I&#39;ve only just recently reached the point where I would consider myself properly stable, after having to rebuild everything I had. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reminds me of an acid trip gone wrong. I had one friend who genuinely thought we both had died and we were in purgatory, he kept saying &quot;It&#39;s not real, we&#39;re not real.&quot; I went along with it because we were tripping and I thought we were on the same level, I didn&#39;t think he had gone completely delusional and was serious. He was acting very erratic, eyes wide open with a constant look of horror on his face. I told him lets go outside which was a bad idea because he immediately began asking anybody we ran into if we we&#39;re dead. He runs up to a random jogger and asks him if we were all dead, the jogger looks at me and then looks at him, he smiles and says &quot;yeah&quot;. He knew what was up and decided to have fun with us. I think about that random jogger all the time and how hilarious he must have thought that was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh come on u/yum_kaax we all have those moments where we suddenly consciously process something which is ordinarily subconscious. Whether that be thinking about how to tie shoelaces instead of doing it out of habit or whether it&#39;s noticing the convention of driving on a particular side of the road because of social/legal convention. These experiences are not <em>derealization</em>! OP isn&#39;t saying that the machines aren&#39;t real or that money isn&#39;t real or that Tescos isn&#39;t real. They&#39;re recognising that the concepts have no intrinsic reality other than from the social consensus and that actually the social consensus can make us do pretty bizarre seeming things - like use our fingers rythmically on a piece of plastic or glass in order to sequentially select shapes which in and of themselves have no meaning but with which we can <em>mean</em> almost anything. Furthermore, these symbols can be transmitted through cables and wires and even through the air itself to be seen by someone else who may well be <strong>anywhere else in the world</strong> and they can understand it. Recognising the conceptual layers of our daily existence is <strong>not</strong> a mental health problem but the sign of a meaning searching mind actively engaging with the reality around them, rather than rejecting it. </p>

<p>I guess if you&#39;re reading this OP that you need to weigh up if the controlling yourself element of the equation feels safe and/or sustainable. If <em>not</em> then contrary to my previous post u/Yum_kaax may be on to something, particularly with counselling. </p>
