        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s a sad time on reddit these days. Can&#39;t see both sides of peoples opinions. It&#39;s nothing but left wing tending. I am not republican nor democrat. If anything I am a libertarian. But the point is there is no balance at all. These bots must be working very hard because <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is the biggest left wing circle-jerk I think I&#39;ve ever seen. 
I never thought Reddit would be a site that only shows one side of the story to shove propaganda and hate towards the Republican party. </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s hard to just start browsing a different site, but what other choice is there? </p>

<p>TL;DR : Reddit has a far left wing agenda and I think It&#39;s unfair to have bots filtering out anything reddit decides you shouldn&#39;t see. What happened to the first amendment? Yeah...</p>

<p>Edit: Yes I understand that reddit is a privately owned business who has the right to filter any content, and cater to any agenda they wish. My point is I&#39;ve been putting up with it this whole election and I&#39;ve been pretty meh about it up until they started to silence posts that say things that go against reddits(left wing)agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atheism is part of the problem- bear with me before you judge please.</p>

<p>I am agnostic myself, so I am not condescending. Ultimately, religion (regardless of which variant) offers a moral framework. Yes, religious leaders (or political leaders back when most countries were married to the church) have used religion to control people, kill people, and oppress people. Yes, we have extremist factions of Islam today that strap bombs on themselves and try to kill others.</p>

<p>But religion as it pertains to the masses <em>does generally promote civility, care for one&#39;s neighbors and community, promotes a list of tenets (like the 10 commandments) to be followed, promotes the idea of treating others with respect, etc etc</em>. While religion still exists today, our society is much more driven by the <em>ideology of consumerism, selfishness, and passivity relative to authority.</em> We collectively lack a moral framework that would cause us to stand up to tyranny, to abhor societal systems which promote the ruthless brutality of modern competition, to be governed by honor to follow Constitutional ideals and not try to exploit lingual weakness in the document for personal gain, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>Im not saying youre that way of course. Im just saying that society is so lost in short flights of consciousness, fractured temporary value systems relative to a specific topic, etc etc that we have no overarching ideology to collectively guide us morally. We are materially rich and morally bankrupt- creatures with insane technology but who use this technology without or only with fleeting consideration for whether we should, or what the consequences would be.</p>

<p>Im a millennial, I&#39;m agnostic, and I am most certainly not supportive of censorship nor the destruction of the 1st and 4th amendment; as another redditor once said, science has killed God as the primary moral governing force in society, and we are in deep shit because of it.</p>

<p>I dont have the answers- I dont think any one person can. Its going to take a collective look at our society for that to happen. Worse, despite being better connected than ever before in history, in other ways (mainly in terms of metacognition or the connecting of overarching human direction) we are more fractured than ever before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit was not unbiased 5 years ago. Sorry, but you are wrong about that one. Reddit has always been a haven for soft-minded and soft-bellied liberal propaganda and propagation. They like to, around here, talk about how intellectual they are, but that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. Many of them have been effectively told how to think and find confirmation of their intellects in the shared opinions, but that&#39;s a danger to society at large right now.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is we&#39;re all people. And as such we all typically want to &quot;fit in&quot; or find our community. In one age it&#39;s one religion or another, in another age it&#39;s something else. </p>

<p>There&#39;s always going to be a witch hunt, information is going to be obfuscated, and the actions of people are going to manifest themselves in destructive ways in order to achieve some dominant system of control.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s not witches, it&#39;s hippies, blacks, or christians and now it&#39;s whites/conservatives on the block.</p>

<p>Although it is interesting to see the extent to which social engineering has rendered such a large percentage of a demographic to loathe and act with purpose to eradicate itself.</p>

<p>But the &quot;liberal&quot; influence has been engaged in nations and societies much older than ours, typically to their ruination. Tradition is challenged, that brought health and wealth, and later generations succumb to the excess and all of those qualities transfer to rampant hedonism and the discharge of personal responsibility.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where we are now. Culture is a slow beast to turn over, and it doesn&#39;t typically happen without incident.</p>

<p>If you merely go to places that comfort you with similar values, then you&#39;re doing yourself a disservice and willfully limiting your perception to a vacuum.</p>

<p>Unfortunately you have to mingle with the golems to keep your finger on the pulse, unless you wish to forsake them and their civilization altogether.</p>

<p>There is no easy answer. There is no quick fix. All you can do is figure out how you wish to live as best as you can. Accept but discard the influences that aren&#39;t compatible with you, be the change you want to see (cliche, but true), vote local.</p>

<p>Western society is in a rough place right now, with all sorts of fabricated movements seeking to deconstruct its values: feminism, SJW cults, minority worship, kill your family/kids, government is good, etc etc...</p>

<p>We&#39;ve become incredibly gynocentric to the point that we call this notion of personal responsibility &quot;oppressive&quot; particularly in the cases of gender or any race but white. And through this scope of intolerant tolerance, we&#39;ve fashioned ourselves a corrosive system of life that viciously despises an individual, his ideas, and seeks to suffocate his expression and achievement. </p>

<p>&quot;You didn&#39;t build that.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny thing is 5 years ago up until this election I only came to reddit for entertainment.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I have to somewhat disagree with you;</p>

<p>For my own sake, I think this sub may actually be the middle ground.</p>

<p>As a short attempt at elaborating on this, I&#39;d say r/politics is on one end of the spectrum, and r/the_donald the other. Reddit has many colors of course, but politically speaking, we are smack in the middle.</p>

<p>There are many other issues additional to these I am not too active in myself, but you get the point.</p>

<p>Here at least, it is possible to have a somewhat decent conversation and information exchange w/o being mocked off the table by either camps.</p>

<p>But I could be wrong, though I think I&#39;m on to something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t include r/the_donald into the spectrum of any objectivity. Politics? Yes, certainly. Just like, and I don&#39;t know if such a thing exists and don&#39;t care, but if r/obama existed the type of news and slant you would get is implied.</p>

<p>Politics and its moderators have chosen to slant what should be neutral ground, and THAT is where the problem lies.</p>

<p>The complaint being is that if you go somewhere, especially a place that is supposedly an open exchange of ideas under a label as neutral as politics, you expect a colorless mix and match of ideas.</p>

<p>If I go to breitbart, I expect a conservative interpretation. If I go to salon, I expect a &quot;liberal&quot; slant. I shouldn&#39;t be expecting a slant if I visit r/politics, or WaPo, NYTimes, whatever the case is supposed to be.</p>

<p>And that is actually a problem, which requires me to piece together my own truth, which usually lies in what isn&#39;t spoken, or the subtext of what is spoken. I.E. the television telling me that pizza gate is a hoax and that reading wikileaks is illegal and only they can tell me what they contain. That tells me there&#39;s probably much more to pizza gate and that I need to read wikileaks for myself and turn my attention completely away from traditional sources who are engaged in propaganda and NOT journalism.</p>

<p>r/politics is a discredit to reddit as a whole and an assault upon the entire philosophy of the free market of ideas. That&#39;s why r/politics should be scorned (along with the people who participate in it) and r/the_donald should be left alone.</p>

<p>Some people would misconstrue that statement as a conservative opinion, but they would be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are the one coining the phrase &quot;left-wing circle jerk&quot;. You are the one complaining about a bias against Republicans. You are the one complaining about a privately owned website dedicated to anonymous ass-hats on the Internet (Read: YOU) posting whatever bullshit they like is not First Amendment-y enough.</p>

<p>Forgive me for not being able to divine the particular nature of whatever ill-formed bullshit Libertarian political opinion you have that went unsaid in your post. But it sure fucking sounded like you were complaining about the Right not getting enough time on the soapbox to me. And there&#39;s a whole fucking Internet of right-wing websites you can go fuck off too to get your Libertarian jollies off. In fact there are Libertarian SUBREDDITS you can go fuck off to and get your jollies off.</p>

<p>I stated no opinion. I gave you information. Nothing I said was cancerous.</p>

<p>So you can see the distinction, here are some opinions:</p>

<p>Complaining about what you did on a Conspiracy subreddit is meaningless. 
Calling me a numb-skull is meaningless.
Being completely unable to google alternate social media sites that totally agree with you on everything is not a Conspiracy, it makes you sound whiny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I saw you complain about how reddit is full of left wing circle jerking, I thought that reddit is a website that is privately owned, and is under no obligation to conform to any censorship or lack of censorship at all. And that you said yourself that you were Libertarian leaning. Which tells me that you value private property. Since reddit is the private property of the owners of reddit, you don&#39;t really have any say in the matter as to how reddit is operated. Since you seemed unhappy with the Left-leaning opinion of the voices on reddit, I said you could go anywhere to get a right wing opinion. </p>

<p>And trust me, I enjoy reddit. I&#39;ve browsed it all day every day for the past 6 years. But after recent modifications to content filtering I feel morally obliged to drop this site and go to one that has yet to be corrupted</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s just a huge circle jerk and I feel like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is one of the only places on reddit with people that aren&#39;t fucking brainwashed to the point of no return can talk about what&#39;s going on and where to go from here to obtain balanced discussions at least. </p>

<p>You&#39;re missing the point. Certain subreddits get banned, which creates a false consensus.</p>

<p>THEREFORE, people don&#39;t even realize that they need to check other sources- they just think Hillary is the only choice, and everyone agrees, and it&#39;s obviously just Russian hackers that are exposing pedophilia in DC.</p>

<p>In the real world it doesn&#39;t matter that the smarter among us <em>could</em> go look for something true, as long as the masses keep using the rigged site. </p>

<p>OP&#39;s boycott idea is a good one. I&#39;m a leftist and I tell people to leave here all the time. Don&#39;t buy Reddit gold, use an ad blocker, and leave for good as soon as we have a critical mass somewhere else. (Voat.co, chans, Gab.ai, etc.)</p>

<p>Censorship should be a failing business strategy. Let&#39;s make them pay for trying to control what ideas we&#39;re allowed to study.</p>

<p>Firstly Reddit is not a public service so it doesn’t apply in this context, just like any other forum has mods who remove stuff they dislike.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you want to leave, then leave, why post saying you’re going to do it and then don’t? So far one hour from posting and your account hasn’t been deleted. Perhaps by tomorrow you will have actually left, or is this post just for the drama?
