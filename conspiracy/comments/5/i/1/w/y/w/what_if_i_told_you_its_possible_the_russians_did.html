       News reports have raised a host of potential connections between Donald Trump and the Kremlin, from electronic links to Trump's alleged cultivation by Russian intelligence. NPR takes a look at what is known and confirmed about the potential Russian ties.
      </p>
      <p>
       They range from a report by Slate of a mysterious communications between a Trump computer server and a Russian bank. There's also an NBC report out that the FBI is making inquiries into Paul Manafort's business connections. Paul Manafort we remember was one of Trump's former campaign managers.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       The swirl of revelations and allegations about Russian involvement in the American presidential election, which has been building since the summer, can be difficult to keep straight.
      </p>

      <p>
       There is a lot of smoke here. There is no smoking gun. All U.S. intelligence officials have said on the record is Russia is trying to influence the U.S. election. Another thing that we don't know - this is a point that Mike Morrell made to me today. Morrell is former acting director of the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he raised questions about the people around Trump, the Trump circle, what ties they may have to Russia. And we don't know what questions the FBI may or may not be asking along those lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we have Putin tc openly endorsing the candidate.
      </p>

       The Kremlin in its unprecedented cybercampaign to disrupt elections in multiple countries in hopes of weakening Western alliances, according to intelligence, law enforcement and other government officials in the United States and Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       While American intelligence officers have privately briefed Trump about Russia’s attempts to influence the U.S. election, he has publicly dismissed that information as unreliable. Of course he would! And he showed his ignorance of the cyber by saying you can't catch hackers unless it in the act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the GOP is at odds with Trump over this
      </p>

      <p>
       n extraordinary breach has emerged between President-elect Donald J. Trump and the national security establishment, with Mr. Trump mocking American intelligence assessments that Russia interfered in the election on his behalf, and top Republicans vowing investigations into Kremlin activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wary of being seen as politicizing their findings, C.I.A. analysts had been reluctant to come to that conclusion in the midst of the election.  Mr. Trump has split on the issue with many Republicans on the congressional intelligence committees, who have said they were presented with significant evidence, in closed briefings, of a Russian campaign to meddle in the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, Mr. Trump casts the issue as an unknowable mysteryr to. “It could be Russia,” he recently told Time magazine.

       Then there's the Snowden connection. Background: Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer professional, former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former contractor for the United States government, who copied and leakedclassified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 without prior authorization. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance, with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden went to an undisclosed location kept secret for security reasons. In response to the asylum grant, the White House stated that it was "extremely disappointed," and cancelled a previously scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, who had traveled to Russia to give Snowden a whistleblower award, said that Snowden did not give any storage devices such as hard drives or USB flash drives to Russia or China, and that the four laptops he carried with him "were a 'diversion' and contained no secrets." U.S. officials said they assumed that any classified materials downloaded by Snowden had fallen into the hands of China and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/12/12/is-it-possible-russia-knew-in-advance-edward-snowden-would-spy-on-the-nsa/">
        http://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/12/12/is-it-possible-russia-knew-in-advance-edward-snowden-would-spy-on-the-nsa/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a exclusive, Heat Street (an offshoot of The Wall Street Journal) says they have evidence of a letter that suggests Russia and Ecuador both knew about Snowden’s plan to steal documents from the NSA before he actually did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The note is a record of a meeting between Russian and Ecuadorean spies in Quito, Ecuador. Ostensibly, it appears to have no relevance to Julian Assange or to Wikileaks. However, it was held by SENAIN at the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where Julian Assange has asylum, among files relating to him.
The document strongly suggests that both Ecuador and Russia knew in advance that Edward Snowden would steal highly classified files from the NSA, using his position as a contractor with Booz Allen Hamilton, before Snowden took them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So could he actually be helping the Russians with these hacks knowing later that when Trump takes office he will be pardoned of all pending charges and set free to come home.

       Apparently, this guy has close connections with Russia because he had contracts for Russian oil projects but they haven't moved forward because of the sanctions. I find this one the most absurd and suspicious pick so far, considering the whole Russia topic right now.

       Doesn't matter. If it's anything that's going to make the Donald look bad it's foolishness. But a pizza place that's got secret underground chambers that deal with child porn, canibalism, satanist cults, and Hillary are accepted as gospel. The hypocrisy here is thick.

       Guess you forgot what the definition of a conspiracy theory is. So here you go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy Theory noun
1. a theory that explains an event as being the result of a plot by a covert group or organization; a belief that a particular unexplained event was caused by such a group.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        the idea that many important political events or economic and social trends are the products of secret plots that are largely unknown to the general public.

       I'd argue Trump asking for Russia to hack Clnton's emails in his July 27th press conference is an attempt to derail the election, but that's just me being a rational adult.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of the Russian investigation I'd say something along the lines of "Protecting the integrity of our election process is of paramount importance to me and I will assist the investigation in any way possible." Because that's also what a rational adult does if he cares about his country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to recap your position:
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump - "Russia should hack her emails and help me win the election."
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA - "Yeah, they did that."
      </p>

       You - "That could never happen!"

       I doubt Trump knew that or even what an ethernet cable is. He still asked Russia to hack and release her emails.  There was never any indication her server was compromised (unlike the DNC) so this was an invitation to do so for his benefit.

       But you can't just keep ignoring that what he was asking for was impossible by that point. Whether or not they had previously hacked it, who knows? I doubt that Trump asking for the release was the first time hacking prominent American politicians crossed the Russians' minds. I also doubt that the Russian intelligence community takes it's orders from Trump. It's entirely possible that they had previously hacked the server with the intent of dumping the files before the election. It's equally possible that Russia wasn't involved in it at all. You're seeing causation without any proof.

       The ODNI, NSA, DHS, and CIA disagree with you.  The same staging computer that was used to hack the DNC was used in a 2015 hack of the German Parliament, which the German BfV has traced back to the Russian GRU.

       There are so many articles that confirm whichever side you'd rather believe. I can find articles of Clapper saying it was definitely Russia, and ones from a month later of him saying he's not so sure. There's a lot of bullshit to wade through. And frankly, these agencies don't have the best track record for truthfulness or accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: It's worth keeping in mind that these agencies benefit from stoking this type of fear up in the people, be it through increased funding or powers. A serious accusation should require concrete proof for us to see.

       Beware of both side-ism. Trump will often muddy the waters so the media has to say "both sides are claiming..."  It takes away power from the original claim.  That's why Trump does stuff like this:

       The ODNI doesn't deny it's Russia, they just take a more cautious approach to ascribing if it was specifically to help Trump. The CIA says that the RNC was hacked also, but they only chose to release the DNC's emails because they prefer Trump.

        It's worth keeping in mind that these agencies benefit from stoking this type of fear up in the people, be it through increased funding or powers. A serious accusation should require concrete proof for us to see.

      <p>
       It's worth keeping in mind that the CIA leak came after the election because they didn't want to appear partisan. Also, knowing Trump is going to be President and that they'll suffer for this leak when he comes into office, but still choosing to leak it should show you how serious this is. There are probably CIA agents undercover in Russia right now that could get a bullet in the back of the head if Trump decides to leak their names to his pal Putin.

       If the CIA knew before the election, how are they not obligated to say something at the time? There is no way that a need to look bi-partisan is more important than the integrity of the presidential election.

        n March 2015, it became publicly known that Hillary Clinton, during her tenure as United States Secretary of State, had used her family's private email server for official communications, rather than official State Department email accounts maintained on federal servers. Those official communications included thousands of emails that would retroactively be marked classified by the State Department.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Her server was already compromised prior to Trump asking for the emails. What everyone fails to forget is that her email controversy had been going on long before and her emails were hacked before hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "New" emails happened to be "found" in July but they were compromised well before the election.

       speaking of their collapse, it sounds like a possible conspiracy went down in 1991!
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Gorbachev, the union’s collapse has resulted in the rise of "bureaucrats" who "stole the nation's riches and began to create corporations."
      </p>
      <p>
       Gorbachev’s rule was characterized by a more open approach to the West and the desire to introduce greater democratic freedoms for Soviet citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the summer of 1991, a coup to unseat Gorbachev was attempted by hardline Soviet officials disgruntled with his reforms. Although the coup failed, radical reformers capitalized on the political instability to push for the end of the Soviet regime.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Behind our backs there was treachery," Mr Gorbachev told the BBC. "They were burning down the whole house just to light a cigarette. Just to get power.”

       Ukraine is such a weird one. You have to always remember within the last 80 years over 7 million people were killed during the height of communism. I still remember:

       World peace is a big pipe dream without billions of deaths. But we can definitely move towards a less war area.

       There are so many articles that confirm whichever side you'd rather believe. I can find articles of Clapper saying it was definitely Russia, and ones from a month later of him saying he's not so sure. There's a lot of bullshit to wade through. And frankly, these agencies don't have the best track record for truthfulness or accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: It's worth keeping in mind that these agencies benefit from stoking this type of fear up in the people, be it through increased funding or powers. A serious accusation should require concrete proof for us to see.

       I never said they wrote them. And it's already been concluded that there's nothing there. There were hacks that's also been proven and there were several stories today the link Russia to those hacks.

       speaking of their collapse, it sounds like a possible conspiracy went down in 1991!
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Gorbachev, the union’s collapse has resulted in the rise of "bureaucrats" who "stole the nation's riches and began to create corporations."
      </p>
      <p>
       Gorbachev’s rule was characterized by a more open approach to the West and the desire to introduce greater democratic freedoms for Soviet citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the summer of 1991, a coup to unseat Gorbachev was attempted by hardline Soviet officials disgruntled with his reforms. Although the coup failed, radical reformers capitalized on the political instability to push for the end of the Soviet regime.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Behind our backs there was treachery," Mr Gorbachev told the BBC. "They were burning down the whole house just to light a cigarette. Just to get power.”
