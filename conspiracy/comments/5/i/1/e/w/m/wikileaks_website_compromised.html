    <div class="md"><p>I think WL has been compromised since before the election. FBI/CIA has taken over WL social media accounts and now we are seeing them take over the WL domain (messing with the certs). I believe the switch has finally been activated and we will see the files trying to leak onto the web. As long as WL doesn&#39;t send an official leak notice any fresh files hitting the web will be deflected as &quot;fake news&quot;.. Things are speeding up behind the scenes... Buckle up!</p>

<p>Their twitter account hasn&#39;t been &#39;normal&#39; since mid-October when Assange&#39;s connection went dark. He was obviously taken, given the pre-commits and now their security certificate has expired and can no longer be faked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow this kind of blew my mind, never looked far down this route. </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious as to how it was known the podesta emails were on automated release alg. This means they couldn&#39;t be compromised / posted before wikileaks was allegedly compromised? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to see the information I research is helping others!</p>

<p>You can get some more insight from Assange in his interview on C-Span (of all sources) promoting the book, <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?328099-1/julian-assange-wikileaks-files">The Wikileaks Files</a>. </p>

<p>Not only were they automated releases, their stochastic algorithm scanned publicly available information like social media posts, (they already knew about all the insights before publishing by the way) and was automatically grouping release email ranges, then publishing those automatically in the batches we saw. This is how Assange was able to go on interviews and claim Hillary was going to go down, even though they still thought she&#39;d get elected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so one more follow up question - If the deadman switch an all of that is in effect - where do any new leaks get dumped (If WL doesn&#39;t post it/add to it&#39;s potentially compromised website)? they&#39;re just floating around on some dark web waiting for ppl to stumble upon it?  In other words, how quickly would we know something just went down? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The easy answer is yes. The more complex answer is yes, haha. It would be up to his supporters to download the insurance files while Wikileaks were NOT compromised before Oct 19. The pre-commits as far as I understand were <em>hashes</em>. They are used to ensure the validity and integrity of any specified files. Whoever or whatever is being addressed (in that case, John Kerry for example.) would be some sort of file group, or possibly a zip file within a tar file that the supporter has already downloaded.</p>

<p>Secret keys might be released in any number of ways. I haven&#39;t needed to use them before but there are marketed deadman&#39;s switch web app services, and it seems they are set up to email directly to a few contacts. You might imagine, that if your file has already been downloaded by thousands of people, and you no longer can login anywhere, it will trigger, and you would WANT those in possession of your files to get your passphrase and unecrypt those files. Ideally, they then continue this process, so that truth can live on. Your login/do not trigger intervals could be custom specified, one week, a month, one quarter, one year. So it might be Oct 2017 before we see another really big information release from DKIM verified wikileaks files.</p>

<p>Before Wikileaks broke down, we probably only saw less than 10% of the content they actually knew about and possessed. They were trying to stay relevant by releasing in batches, as far as I understood their strategy to be.</p>
