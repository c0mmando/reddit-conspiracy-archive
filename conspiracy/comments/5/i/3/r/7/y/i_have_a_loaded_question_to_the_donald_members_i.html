We are all Americans so I would like to keep this a constructive ethical thread (or what ever that stupid fucking bot says in every r/politics post).</p>

<p>For one, what is your opinion on Trump picking very corporate people for his cabinet?</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on DAPL?</p>

<p>His position on not having a position on prosecuting Hillary like he said he would do in the primaries?</p>

<p>Lastly, in light of all these things among others, how do you feel about him now?</p>

<p>(The reason why I chose this sub is because I really like you guys. There are all walks of life and I&#39;ve seen allot of good convo on here, this might now be the place for this thread so I apologize. If there is another sub that would be more fitting let me know because I am banned from the_Donald.) </p>

<p>Edit: Not all Americans I know, you catch my drift.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im Banned from T_D as well for calling out the surprising number of israeli moderators for a subreddit dedicated to the most dynamic candidate ever in the USA.</p>

<p>First thing you must realize is a large portion of Trumps votes werent votes for Trump per se, but rather a way to yell FUCK YOU HILLARY in a voice most likely to be heard.</p>

<p>thoughts on his corporate picks:  the dude runs casinos in NJ and is an NYC real estate magnate, hes got shady ties.  People dont read between the lines, his cabinet picks are what is needed to handle the planets biggest bankruptcy</p>

<p>DAPL is fucked.  pipelines across lakes from a company with a history of massive spills is bad juju.</p>

<p>Trump wont prosecute Hillary because Trump is a salesman and he says what ever is needed to complete the deal in his favor.  Too bad people dont see it, he laid it out in his book.</p>

<p>I actually have a better opinion of him now than before the election, primarily due to his words and actions on the Air Conditioner jobs, no matter the real outcome of the issue, and the biggest reason I have a generally positive opinion of him is...the mainstream media hates his guts.  if this dude scares the professional liars so badly, theres gotta be some redeeming qualities there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Indiana so I&#39;ve heard allot about the Carrier deal. From what I have read and heard, he actually saved about half as much jobs from what he tweeted. Also instead of putting massive terrifs on anything they send here like he said he would do in the primaries, he gave them a $7 million tax break. He does have more balls than any democrat since he actually threatened their government contracts. Obama could have easily done this but his balls are sitting on Goldman Sachs mantle as we speak. </p>

<p>That&#39;s actually not a bad point. Petrodollar regime is looking shaky, and the SDR voting rights shift around when he&#39;s taking office. We better hope he sees this coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strongly agree on the amount of time, effort and money that the MSM and establishment are putting into trying to slander him and undermine the election continuously.  They had to have taken the hint that viewers believe them less and less every day, yet they can&#39;t stop themselves because the only alternative would be to talk positively about him lol.  I agree with your other points too.  But I think people underestimate exactly how much energy these people put into vocalizing their hate for Trump, whether it is an illusion or not.</p>

<p>Why is this specious argument still being used? There are countless qualified individuals that work for companies or institutions <em>besides</em> Goldman Sachs/Exxon mobile.  Why is &#39;experience&#39; exclusive to a select group of companies? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I voted for him.. not that I don&#39;t like him and would change my vote if I could but I do think he&#39;s backtracked from some of his campaign rhetoric.  My biggest thing was &quot;the swamp&quot;. It&#39;s still kind of early to tell- but it doesn&#39;t look too good with regards to <em>draining the swamp</em> or anything like that.  Though, to counter, the most knowledgeable people you can have in your Cabinet etc etc are probably also really successful.. if not, then what would they have to show for and how would they prosper from the &quot;outside&quot;.</p>

<p>Because you mentioned Clinton (I think there&#39;s more substantive issues, but this is a divisive one for sure), i didn&#39;t have much faith in her prosecution.  But if he does end up doing it, then he needs to wait until he&#39;s sworn in.  Obama still holds the mighty pen and the DOJ is headed by people appointed by politicians that sympathize with Hillary.  So, with that too, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a little too early to tell the outcome.</p>

<p>All in all, most politicians tend to &quot;come to the middle&quot; once they&#39;re in office.  It&#39;s common in negotiating tactics to push for as much as you would want to get.  In reality, that is just used to make the <em>middle</em> closer towards your views/goals for when you come to the table and sign any deals.  Not sure if that makes sense, but that&#39;s what I think of all of this.</p>

As a Trump voter I can tell you that I&#39;m already severely disappointed in his rhetoric as Donald Trump the president-elect which does not match that of Donald Trump the candidate as well as the cabinet picks so far.
