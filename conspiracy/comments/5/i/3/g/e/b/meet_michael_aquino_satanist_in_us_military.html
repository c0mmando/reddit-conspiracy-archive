        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The following is what EIR / LaRouche publishing had to say about Michael Aquino. It&#39;s not all inclusive.  Nor is this authored by me.  This is not my reportage and I do not endorse or necessarily agree with it.  This is a collection of historical reportage of best-effort factual information on a figure in the US Military Intelligence who drafted MindWar and provided the intelligence community the ideas that they could attack US citizens with psychology, propaganda, media-run strategies of tension, subliminals, bioelectrical weapons, directed energy weaponry from widely deployed consumer and commerical appliances and environs including but not limited to television, kiosk screens, satellites, hidden speakers, etc; and the idea of using directed energy weaponry directly on single targets and possibly the use of even magick systems of divination, sex magick, black magick, (subproject MKOFTEN), remote viewing, telekenisis to the extent that it&#39;s empirically useful (it proved not to be--duh! (or did it???)).</p>

<p>Aquino was also implicated in Satanic Ritual Child Abuse and was fingered by kids as witness but these accusation were dismissed and he was not charged.  However, the police confiscated many pornographic videos because that&#39;s something they do in a state where pornographic videos are actually legal to posess.  The associate of Aquino and his wife Lilith (cute) was actually arrested for child abuse.  But given the context of the numerous sex crime rings at that time (mid 80s, 1988 in particular), it&#39;s widely considered that Aquino&#39;s case was a cover up, not unlike the Franklin pedophile ring in Nebraska.</p>

<td align="left">&quot;On Feb. 5, 1999, in U.S. District Court in Lincoln, Nebraska, an extraordinary hearing occurred in <strong><em>Paul A. Bonacci v. Lawrence E. King</em></strong>, a civil action in which the plaintiff charged that he had been ritualistically abused by the defendant, as part of a <em>nationwide pedophile ring linked to powerful political figures in Washington and to elements of the U.S. military and intelligence establishment</em>.&quot; Larry King to pay 1M in damages.</td>
<td align="left">&quot;During the Feb. 5 hearing, Noreen Gosch stunned the court with sworn testimony linking <strong>U.S. Army Lt. Col. Michael Aquino (ret.)</strong> to the nationwide pedophile ring.... I will say, that was an offshoot of a government program. The MK-Ultra program was developed in the 1950s by the CIA... then there was a man by the name of <strong>Michael Aquino</strong>. He was in the military. He had top Pentagon clearances. He was a pedophile. He was a Satanist. He&#39;s founded the Temple of Set. And he was a close friend of Anton LaVey. The two of them were very active in ritualistic sexual abuse. And they deferred funding from this government program to use [in] this experimentation on children...They used these kids to sexually compromise politicians or anyone else they wish to have control of.&quot;  /// Paul Bonacci, who was simultaneously a victim and a member of the nationwide pedophile crime syndicate, has subsequently identified <strong>Aquino</strong> as the man who ordered the kidnapping of Johnny Gosch</td>

<td align="left">&quot;To the informed intelligence specialist, this charge might have been seen as a signal that 1988 would be a singular year for activation of satanist cults. And indeed, it was. Communications among satanist organizations early in the year de­fined 1988 as a year for public &quot;combat&quot; against Christian belief. Along similar lines, &quot;green&quot; and &quot;ecological&quot; groups worldwide began to more explicitly embrace Roman-model &quot;Great Mother&quot; cultism.&quot;/// &quot;In fact, the astrologers influencing the Reagans were creatures of the World War 11-era British &quot;Occult Bureau,&quot; who, LaRouche stressed, had deep ties to the &quot;overtly Satan-worshiping Theosophical Society of Annie Besant, Madame Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley, and Astor-backed Rudolf Steiner.&quot; /// &quot;OTO has at least 48 offices in the United States. One offshoot is centered around a certain <strong>Lt.-Col. Michael Aquino</strong>, and has managed to infiltrate the U.S. military and NATO. OTO is also under investigation in Britain...&quot;</td>

<td align="left">In the wake of P2 investigations, Milan judge determined that Roberto Calvi, a masonic bigwig found hanging from Black Friar&#39;s Bridge in London was actually freemasonic ritual murder, not a suicide. &quot;The finding in Milan revives what has been described by European and American intelligences specialists as a war between northern [Scottish Rite / British-German masonry] and southern European [French-Italian] rival Freemasonic factions. // Freemasons are behind a lot of cultic satanic abuse</td>
<td align="left">&quot;These brutal conflicts among the Freemasonic elites pale in significance, when compared with what is being unleashed upon the population at large by the same degenerate circles. The frightening proliferation of Satanic and Luciferian cults, many of which are engaged in brutal acts of child abuse and murders, and wild sex-drug orgies, is no mere &quot;sociological phenomenon&quot; brought on by the pro­liferation of Satanic rock videos and the spread of newer and more devastating varieties of drugs.&quot; // &quot;[BBS system,]<strong><em>BaphoNet</em></strong>, is run by a former LaVey disciple named <strong>Michael Aquino</strong>, an active-duty lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, a specialist in psychological operations, who was accused in 1987 by the San Francisco Police De­partment of being involved in child rapes near the Presidio Army Base.</td>

<p>This is a common, telltale acting mistake (betraying rehearsal), to mouth the other actor&#39;s lines.  I&#39;m saying Aquino trained that guy to feed bogus information on satanism on oprah and then use him as a straw man to discredit the &#39;dismemberment murder ritual&#39; angle, and thereby sanitize it as &quot;a harmless religion he and his wife practice in private&quot;</p>

So many people forget the shit is all made up. people who are desperate for answers to the big questions do not always act logically, perhaps because the strength of their emotions might compel them to find relief wherever possible, making them vulnerable to the persuasion of organized religions and cults that claim to have the information people desire, and the relief and security it supposedly brings. </p>
