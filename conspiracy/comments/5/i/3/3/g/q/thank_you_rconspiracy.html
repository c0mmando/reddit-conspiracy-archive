       The conversations I've had in this place have profoundly shaped my world view. I arrived here in the manner of most: cynical to the official version of events, with an innate hunger to exchange and explore the truths in our world, with like minded seekers. I came I guess, hoping to be engaged and informed, to contribute and challenge, with the overarching quest for clarity my end goal: I haven't been disappointed.
Over the last year I've diligently visited the sub and  built on my knowledge of existing conspiracies as well as learning of current and future ones. I've lurked, commented, argued and posted. I took a trip to the murky badlands of 4chan after me and some other users here starting digging into HLIanon &amp; FBIanon. And with knowledge of each  added source, link, article, conversation etc.. new possibilities form. The impossible transmutes to the unlikely, only to become the possible ..
I couldn't have the conversations I have here anywhere else, quite simply because most haven't developed their understanding of the world in the same way: through a gradual increase in awareness supported by sources, tempered through dispute and finally agreed upon collectively. When you speak with someone who takes MSM as gospel, it can be very difficult to have meaningful discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So thanks, for adding some structure and support to my journey, I hope Ive been able to reciprocate.

       The fact that r/conspiracy is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a channel,  that its up to the visitor or subscriber to sift through it and use some judgement,  that the moderation does not try to "solve" this problem,  seems to be part of why the content here manages to reward seekers of truth.   Its a strange paradox,  but those who insist on having their news pre-sanitized are most likely to walk away after noticing that there is some crazy stuff here too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The medium is the message.   People who become accustomed to sanitized channels are most likely to accept BS uncritically,  while a place like this,  not being any particular channel,  trains one to be on their toes,  and attracts people who are used to questioning what they hear,  no matter the source.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this age of fake news,  the ruminants who have given so much power to the corporate media channels have helped to create the seeds of their own destruction,  and remain blind to the real dangers.    Hence,   so many of them treated Hillary's march towards WWIII as innocuous,  so many of them were blind to the genocidal horror the Obama administration initiated in Ukraine,   Syria and Libya on lies.    So many of them blindly supported a neoliberal agenda that had become indistinguishable from a neocon agenda because of the way the corporate media channels had been packaging it through propaganda.    Trump was not a savior,  he was the most convenient possible obstacle to the present trajectory.   That we had no real choice except those two,  this country has drifted to a point of ruin.

       I've said similar things on this sub naively assuming it was near enough consensus and have had to step back in awe at the wilful ignorance/blind zealotry that passes for a counter.  Swamp creatures
       <em>
        et al
       </em>
       are hoisted onto the American people but still people are genuinely convinced he's the change they've been waiting for. Honestly,could you have called it? Donald Trump &amp;amp; his cabinet of billionaires: Champions of working &amp;amp; middle class America. 
Edit- I was very much a
       <em>
        give him a chance
       </em>
       kinda guy,
       <em>
        no evil till evil done
       </em>
       kinda thing, but his unwillingness to offer clarity around any conflicts of interest, coupled with the utter insanity of his cabinet picks, has confirmed glaring suspicions I (and most I hope?) had from the start.

       Wait till January.  I'm a 'give him a chance' person too.  We'll see pretty quickly.  I think he's smart to opt out of the white house.  He needs to live in an undisclosed and run the country by teleconference.  He better not underestimate the level of satanic assholes he's up agaisnt.

       In all honestly I'll give him till he's a few months in, before conferring judgement on his
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       Presidency. To do otherwise would be unfair. What I will do however is analyse and condemn if need be, every questionable thing he does until then. In the spirit of fairness I'll also offer praise to any actions that deserves merit. As of today, I'm heavy on the former, and all but empty on the latter.
But like I said ... he's got some time to even the tally.

       Think of all of the negative emotions you'll have to get past doing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think everything together is suggesting that we stop giving into negative thinking.  All of the speculation beforehand has everyone focusing on thinking about fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Give it time and focus on things that enable you to master your control of your consciousness and at that point truth will be much easier to discern.   Trump will be trump and from what I can tell he doesn't want to die and he doesn't want to throw the country under the bus so there will definitely be some push and pull along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's focus on our individual journeys and control this indoctrinated fear.

       people who take msm as the gospel are just as stupid as people that take Fox News or breitbart as the gospel. I'm really happy that this election exposed how corrupt the dems are, I just wish more people in this sub realized how dumb they are to cheerlead for republicans. Like where you not paying attention the last 16 years?

       It got so bad I during the elections I had to follow Breitbart for some objectivity. Breitbart?!! But I had no choice. The left shilled as hard as any to foist a viscerally disliked candidate onto the Dems. From Obama to corporate media to Jay Z- you couldn't get away from people urging you to ignore the base corruption that is the Clinton machine, and just vote anyway FUCKING VOTE FOR HER DAMN YOU. 
It was astounding, simply unbelievable how the collective assault on public perception transformed one of the most unpopular candidates in history, into Americas saviour, mrs Millennial... the most qualified candidate ever. #Imwithher ... Jesus wept. For anyone who doubts the power of media in shaping opinion, they need to be shown this election as a textbook study in propaganda.

       I'll add it to the list for sure. A good deed goes round so here you go, currently reading this -
       <a href="http://www.julianjaynes.org/bicameralmind.php">
        Origins of consciousness in the Bicameral mind - Julian Jaynes
       </a>
       Cant recommend it enough.
Edit- A very smart man recommended that book to me and asked me to share it with people if I saw truth in it. Here's some reviews from more respected sources than me:
      </p>
      <p>
       "When Julian Jaynes...speculates that until late in the second millennium B.C. men had no consciousness but were automatically obeying the voices of gods, we are astounded but compelled to follow this remarkable thesis through all the corroborative evidence..."
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        John Updike, in The New Yorker
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       "This book and this man's ideas may be the most influential, not to say controversial, of the second half of the twentieth century. It renders whole shelves of books obsolete."
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        William Harrington, in Columbus Dispatch
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       "Having just finished The Origin of Consciousness, I myself feel something like Keats' Cortez staring at the Pacific, or at least like the early reviewers of Darwin or Freud. I'm not quite sure what to make of this new territory; but its expanse lies before me and I am startled by its power."
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Edward Profitt, in Commonweal
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       "He is as startling as Freud was in The Interpretation of Dreams, and Jaynes is equally adept at forcing a new view of known human behavior."

       I'll add it to the list bro- thank you for the recommendation. 
Your journey sounds similar in the sense of focusing on positives as opposed to negatives; and the resultant shift in consciousness that accompanies it? 
I was strongly advised to read this book and can't speak highly enough of it, check it out when you're next in between books:

       Look at the front page of this sub, it is so pro Putin / Pro Trump right now but the top comments are questioning even the narrative of this sub, which is really great.

       To me, the amount of deflection around here regarding Trump/Russia ties is very telling and hopefully people start seeing right through the BS soon enough.

       And Pizzagate... Does anyone think that ANYTHING will become of it? The power families around the world run all the governments, they have intelligence capabilities greater than the best in the world, and our law enforcement work for them, not us. They will let this bubble up. They want us to know what they do so their ritual is more meaningful. But the end game will only be for a military coup of not our gov't but the string pullers above them. They are literally multi trillionaires that have enslaved mankind and even the Clintons, the Bushes, and especially not the Trumps get to partake in the inner workings of their power. The only thing that will come of it, and I guarantee this, is that those who get too close to the flame will burn so brightly even Trump bots will cease to acknowledge it.

       I've noticed that, very worrying trend. It's almost as if the disdain for Clinton has obliterated the walking fuckery that is Trump. Part of that could be due to the litany of conspiracies relating to Clinton that formed the meat of discussion here during the election - maybe what we're seeing is a hangover from that?
At the same time, knowledge of Clintons nefarious affairs should in no way absolve Trump of his, especially when a) they're so evident and b)he's now president. The desire by some in this sub to paint Trump as some sort of Messiah is troubling and definitely demands confronting. As we speak Rex Tillerson aka Mr Exxonmobil aka Mr Order of Friendship has been announced Secretary of State. Draining the swamp indeed...

       He wasn't talking about your comment history. So when you replied to him thinking he was talking about you, it seemed as if you were the person he replied to as well as the OP of this post and had forgotten to switch accounts.
