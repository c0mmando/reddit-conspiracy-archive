        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>That the interview was fake is now apparent to most. Tell tale signs include identical &quot;ahhs&quot; that are pasted throughout, as well as the stilted rapidity of responses. The vocal intonation is awkward as it is a mixed bag of previous statements Assange made as well as new ones created with Voco-like software.</p>

<p>(See how voco works here and cross reference with the voice in Hannity interview: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3l4XLZ59iw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3l4XLZ59iw</a>)</p>

<p>As well as a sudden influx of CTR-sounding comments giving credence to it. Example &quot;Lots of excitement that he&#39;s alive now, this is legit!!! Super excited.&quot; These comments immediately received tons of upvotes the speed of which could only indicate bots.</p>

<p>But even more telling is that the words they put in Assange&#39;s mouth are implicitly confirming the CIAs narrative.</p>

<p>Take a look here: <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/310654-assange-some-leaks-may-have-been-russian">http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/310654-assange-some-leaks-may-have-been-russian</a></p>

<p>Some give aways:</p>

<p>“These look very much like they’re from the Russians. But in some ways, they look very amateur, and almost look too much like the Russians.&quot; - (alleged) Assange </p>

<p>(Note he is implicitly punting to the CIA narrative while being made to suggest a modicum of skepticism to maintain realness. They need just enough from him but not too much that it would give away the fact that it&#39;s engineered.)</p>

<p>“Craig Murray is not authorized to talk on behalf of WikiLeaks,” Assange said sternly.</p>

<p>That the site FindingAssange.com is assigning the label of &quot;legit&quot; to what is clearly a forged interview also leads me to believe that the whole purpose behind the site was to stir us toward the Hannity interview and try to put to rest rumors that Assange is dead or captured, and worse, to make the fake &quot;Assange&quot; say things that are implicitly confirming the CIAs propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is why I don&#39;t think that it is voco: humans use inflection in their voice at key parts of a conversation to stress certain points.  You may say a sentence or similar phrase twice in one conversation; but one of the two times when you say a similar phrase, you may stress it differently to really hit home the point that corresponds with it.</p>

<p>Voco matches waveforms and words together and then, from what I can tell, applies a sort of &quot;match equalization&quot; to fill in the rest of the dictionary of words that you didn&#39;t load into it, that is probably applied to some generic baseline &#39;voice&#39; that already has text-to-speech.   </p>

<p>This means that, if you feed it phrases/words, but you speak them &quot;excitedly&quot;, then the voco will recite those words in the same way with the same gusto as what you gave it to work with.  If you feed it those base phrases spoken sullen, it will recite (at least those words) in kind.</p>

<p>Voco is not artificial intelligence though.   It doesn&#39;t know to start speaking with excitement and changed inflection when you are making a point, or you are surprised or something.   There are several instances in the conversation where JA&#39;s inflection varies all over the place, but it always correlates to exactly the subject/point he is making</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the point that most people are missing. Voco is excellent at synthesis, but it can&#39;t match inflection, rhythm or pauses. People all tend to have very specific patterned speaking and voco isn&#39;t capable of reproducing those patterns.</p>
