<p>I believe waco to be a bigger part of the grand scheme of conspiracies than most theories. My thoughts on the matter seem to all go back to it just being an unjustifiable amount of force being used for what they were claiming it was.</p>

<p>Here is a website loaded with info, showing the autopsy photos of all victims and having a lot of the court documents and testimony from the rangers and FBI. </p>

<p>The Linda Thompson videos</p>

<p>This is the series of video&#39;s put out by Linda Thompson on the topic of waco and goes into great details and breaks down video footage.</p>

<p>The Big Lie #1 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ1b-PHdFZU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ1b-PHdFZU</a></p>

<p>After receiving criticism for her first video she put out another one named The Big Lie #2. </p>

<p>The Big Lie #2 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABiCv_KP1BA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABiCv_KP1BA</a></p>

<p>I have located linda thompsons third video online on youtube. I had seen it referenced in many videos and found what I believe to be the original video.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes fbi video</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n5HP-KlTpg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n5HP-KlTpg</a></p>

<p>At 20:40 the cameraman states that bradley&#39;s are stationed to stop infiltrators and people escaping the compound.</p>

<p>at 30:35 the cameraman states that 2 of the choppers there are army huey choppers.</p>

<p>at 35:35 you start to see the waco fire, and instead of worry and fear you hear from the people at 35:50, you can listen longer and hear laughs and bits of happy conversation. All while watching this place burn to the ground.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s going good now boys
Getting her done</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If anyone is able to try and discern what they are saying at that point in the video I am extremely curious.
~~</p>

<p>This is an article from 1995 criticizing the use of the dangerous CS gas.</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-29/news/mn-7278_1_cs-gas">http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-29/news/mn-7278_1_cs-gas</a></p>

<p>Wanted to highlight these parts of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>specifically the firing of hundreds of rounds of a military-style tear gas into the camp--that may themselves have endangered the children.</p>

<p>The wooden structures were filled with the gas over the next six hours before the building erupted into flames, leaving more than 80 people dead, including all of the children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they literally fired hundreds of canisters of this gas for up to 6 hours knowing how dangerous this stuff is in close quarters? And now there is evidence of pyrotechnic canisters being at WACO. What if someone loaded the wrong one?</p>

<p>The case against David Koresh AKA Vernon Wayne Howell</p>

<p>When the Military wants to do it, any pretext will do. For instance, a missed court appointment was the pretext for the military assault and siege on Ruby Ridge, Idaho in 1992. In the case of David Koresh, the pretext was the suspicion that he had not paid certain firearm taxes. </p>

<p>It is of interest that at the time of the action against the Branch Davidians, there was no legal limit on the number of guns Texans could own. At the time of the raid, Texans owned an average of four guns each; and 16,600 Texans legally owned machine guns. In order to own a machine gun legally, the owner had only to pay a tax to the ATF. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/305c435319.jpg">Proof that ATF agents met with him and saw he wasn&#39;t a crazed gun nut</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.web-ak.com/waco/war/fig/w_fig05.jpg">His church home begins to be called a fortress or compound</a></p>

<p>He is now branded a <a href="http://www.web-ak.com/waco/war/fig/w_fig44.jpg">pedophile</a> and a cult leader having multiple wives just to further his cult family.</p>

<p>Now they commence the raid where 4 ATF officers die and 6 branch davidians.</p>

<p>The videos above do a very good job of breaking down the limited edited video clips the public were given. They can explain the glaring inconsistencies like a 4 member team breaches a window, 3 enter and then after a minute or 2 the 4th member throws a grenade in the windows and fires blindly. </p>

<p>Or that it almost seems like they fired  the first and possibly may have started the raid with a child in immediate danger. They claimed that they jumped out of their vehicles to a &quot;hail of gunfire&quot;.</p>

<p>From the treasury report</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Koresh appeared at the front door and yelled, &#39;What&#39;s going on?&#39; The agents identified themselves, stated they had a warrant and yelled &#39;freeze&#39; and &#39;get down.&#39; But Koresh slammed the door before the agents could reach it. Gunfire from inside the Compound burst through the door. The force of the gunfire was so great that the door bowed outward. The agent closest to the door was shot in the thumb before he could dive for cover into a pit near the door. Then gunfire erupted from virtually every window in the front of the Compound.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But clearly in the video you can see the front <a href="http://www.web-ak.com/waco/war/fig/w_fig21.jpg">door</a> is fine and only has small bullet holes coming from the ATF agents. You do not see their cover being hit, or dust being kicked up. It doesn&#39;t match up at all with what they claim.</p>

<p>This page outlines everything about the way the davidians were forced to stay in their building. How the FBI broke multiple laws by jamming communication signals and also interfering with an SOS signal being sent by the church. And goes into the mind games the HRT FBI team was doing to basically mind fuck these people.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but if you are dealing with &quot;crazies&quot; with children as hostages. You should not provoke them like this. Their church philosophy says they will be attacked by a government. Why validate their beliefs by attacking them?</p>

<p>this seige <a href="http://imgur.com/11G5QYq">cost</a> 5 million dollars!</p>

<p>Fbi eagerly wants to clean up the 2000 gallon <a href="http://imgur.com/B2KLYlC">diesel fuel spill</a>. </p>

<p>Interesting that 2000 gallons of flammable liquid contaminated waco while it was under your control.</p>

<p>So now you can see they used deadly force when there was no need but what does this mean? Why and what are the causes of all this?
~~
My personal theory is the davidians knew something BIG on the government. I think they were saving kids from pedophile elite and knew all about the CIA&#39;s dirty work. But I can&#39;t see any other reason to burn the place to the ground including the <em>KIDS</em>.</p>

<p>The church is in very close proximity to a CIA used airport World War Two buffalo airlines. 
This site does a better job outlining that theory.</p>

<p>This website does a good job explaining a different way the waco tragedy could have played out. Mostly involving the CIA and wetworks kind of situation.</p>

<p>Or they were deeply involved in the trafficking of children to the elites and the elites were covering their tracks. </p>

<p>Maybe the compound was involved in the Franklin scandal and since it got shuttered in the late 80s, funds stopped coming in and they were threatening to leak info.</p>
