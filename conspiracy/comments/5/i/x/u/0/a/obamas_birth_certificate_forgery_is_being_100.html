    <div class="md"><p>But the point is, it&#39;s unconstitutional. I agree it&#39;s not at odds with modern values, but our opinions shouldn&#39;t matter with application of constitutional law. If we can&#39;t expect the president to adhere to constitutional law, we can&#39;t rightly expect other levels of government, or citizenry, to do the same. If social values change then the constitution should be changed to reflect that. Until that time it should hold value over everything else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I came to post. Even if he were born in Kenya, he would still be eligible to serve as president because he would be a natural born American citizen still, or at least he could argue it. For everyone saying that he isn&#39;t natural born because he wasn&#39;t born on US soil, the constitution never clarifies whether or not you have to be born on American soil. It&#39;s never been taken to court, but if it had I&#39;m sure that he a Harvard educated constitution lawyer and professor would be able to have a good case. </p>

<p>Second off, why does it matter any more? He has like a month left. What are you gonna do impeach him before Trump takes oath?</p>

<p>It seems like this is just another distraction to get people arguing about shit. If he forged a document then sure take him to court or something. I really don&#39;t care because it impacts literally no one. He already served two terms. Maybe if this was a thing in 2008 or 2012 or before he had about a month left then it would be worth fully investigating but they are 2 little too late. Let&#39;s focus on the future and things that actually impact us.</p>

<p>If you think he is the worst president to date you don&#39;t know your American history worth a shit.</p>

<p>I agree with you about the drone strikes, but it matters little difference who is president. That shit is not going to stop b/c the Pres is just doing what the MI complex is telling him needs to be done.</p>

<p>And the bottom line is really quite simple. The supreme court ruled on the case -- he&#39;s a citizen -- and thus it is settled. Whining about it makes zero difference.</p>

<p>As Obama is paid a salary, there is the possibility he might be defrauding the U.S. If, however, he&#39;s simply embarrassed about his paternity and the forgery makes no difference in his qualification to be president, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a federal crime. There may be state laws that are applicable that use the stricter standard of mere construction of a forgery to be a crime - I didn&#39;t check.</p>

This is being put out there again so that &quot;birtherism&quot; can be resurrected, a term synonmyous with Trump and associated with the beginning of the &quot;lies of Trump&quot; inevitably ending with the Liberal apocalypse of him becoming POTUS. Long story short, what this is meant to do is to associate Pizzagate research with birtherism, &quot;fake news&quot;, the whole lot.</p>

There is definitely something hoaky about the woman who handled his long form dying in the ocean after a small plane crashed and she was the ONLY casualty.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s proof <em>one</em> of the documents was doctored. I suspect the Ah&#39;nee document was faked and the data lifted off of the Obama document. u/RussianLiberal had a thread on this. He showed a web site where the original <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2011/09/342937/">Ah&#39;Nee certificate was sent to WND from a volunteer</a> in 2011. </p>

<p>The odds of a random volunteer sending the <em>exact</em> document Obamas was forged from is astronomically unlikely. </p>

<p>The 9 point video showed convincing evidence of how data could be lifted from the Ah&#39;Nee certificate and forged onto the Obama. However the opposite is equally as possible and substantially more likely.  </p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> I should add also that there <em>is</em> the possibility the Ah&#39;Nee document was provided to WND from a leak. </p>

<p>&quot;Er . . . uh . . . the Obama birth certificate is real, and . . . uh . . . the Ah&#39;Nee document is the fake.&quot;</p>

<p>Clearly the Powers That Be don&#39;t believe that, because they just &quot;disappeared&quot; all the immigration records in Hawaii from the week when Obama was born.

<p>Both his mother and grandmother die right right when he becomes President (leaving no living witnesses to his past). And all records pertaining to him just selectively vanish.</p>

<p>He&#39;s the world&#39;s most unlucky man.</p>

<p>Almost as unlucky as the Clintons when the murder of Vince Foster came up again recently and all archived files of him became misplaced: <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-08-23/fbi-reports-linking-hillary-vince-foster-suicide-go-missing-national-archives">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-08-23/fbi-reports-linking-hillary-vince-foster-suicide-go-missing-national-archives</a></p>

<p>Lets say 50% of all of the 3050 potential candidates are visitors of the WND website. Of that 1525, assume 50% were supporters of the birther idea. Of the 763, how many would feel comfortable enough to send in copies of their birth certificates? Assume 50% of the total again, and that leaves us with 381. Roughly a 12%.</p>

<p>So given the excessively liberal breakdown of the numbers, there is a 12% chance that a random viewer would have sent in the exact copy of the template for the forged birth certificate. Not impossible but not enough for me to bet $100 on.</p>

But the video showed Sheriff Arpaio hoping to get support for a congressional hearing, which might get traction. After all, to post a false Birth Certificate on a White House website is a federal crime, as he pointed out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fallacious reasoning. First, the birth certificate was not even provided until 2011. Second, Obama has been very good for the Republican donors. Obamacare was the <em>Republican</em> plan, and the Republicans get to blame Obama for everything wrong with it. Obamacare is actually good for big business; it hurts small business more. He has doubled down on the drone war and PATRIOT Act provisions, and has not done anything particularly &quot;socialist.&quot; </p>

<p>And this is just from the perspective that Republicans and Democrats, at a high level at least, are not colluding for the same big goals while publicly bickering over the smaller social issues that don&#39;t really matter for the owners of capital. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I&#39;ve always held my nose up at birther stuff. Never really held water, partly because I never looked into it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t find this evidence terribly compelling. How about an hour long interview with these supposed experts while they explain where they got the documents, their credentials and a better explanation of why it&#39;s faked. A few minutes of a guy placing one word on top of another without great definition doesn&#39;t cut it. Doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not worth looking into though.</p>

<p>People ITT are asking why we should still care at this point. We should care because of the cover up and because of our constitution. That&#39;s why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this is a side convo, but anyway. I can understand voting for Trump, I really can. He vowed to bring change. But I can not for the life of me understand how his supporters  are ok with his cabinet picks being all CEO&#39;s, big bankers, Wall Street execs, and establishment politicians. I would be pissed if Clinton did that shit and I&#39;m pissed at Trump for doing it. The one thing I was actually happy for when Trump got elected was getting big money and corporate influence out of Washington. I actually got a bit happy when he got elected even though I was against him. He kinda spiked my interest as a former Bernie or Buster and made me think he actually would get rid of the establishment. He is literally doing the opposite and his supporters don&#39;t give a flying fuck.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t remember where i read this. But some quotation of some guy was like: &quot;You should be voting for Trump. It is better to make space for other corrupt politicians than having the old corrupt poeple root even further into our governments work.&quot; I&#39;d vote for trump, even now. I simply despise Hillary and her career. And i can imagen that he actually might do something  about the corrupt elite like the obamas, clinton or who ever behind everything is, but only further into his presidency. Years even, if he does not get shot before that by ... mad voters /s CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember pretty well when Trump was bashed by media for saying the same. Now evidence is stacking against Obama. He literally said that he always was american and that his birth certificate is american and real. Turns out to be untrue. This isn&#39;t comparable to Ted Cruz in any way. Gaining citizenship is fine. But claiming having a special  citizenship of some nationality as US-President, that seems to be a blatant lie and illegal forgery is a crime! If he was actually born in Hawaii, his mother is hawaiian and father kenyan why would he have a forged birth certificate? Unless this evidence is false and has no value. Barack Obama is ( and was even before that, in my eyes) a scummy criminal and not american. If the government can debunk the government-funded evidence, then i will agree. Born in america. Mother is american. We good. Now it doesn&#39;t look like it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mike Zullo and Sheriff Joe Arpaio Mike are two old investigators that lost touch with reality and have no idea how to computer. Zullo is talking about some institution in Italy where everybody have PhD and they know math equations he havent even heard of. I can understand that math wasnt his best class. In Previous years he claimed that layers in pdf are proof of forgery, now he sait that they were able to reproduce some layers with Xerox. Everybody knew in 2011 that layers are there becasue of PD optimize function in Adobe Acrobat. He and his world best experts needed 5 years to to figure it out.</p>

<p>I was able to disprove 7 out of 9 Points Of Forgery. Remaining 2 are &quot;more likely so than not&quot; type of proof. Nor me nor Arpaio know what are the odds for document to have two stamps with angle as similar as angle is similar on Obamas and Johannas BC.<br/>
I proved that 2 &quot;box square, X and o.&quot; groups on Obamas BC are not copy pasted (and used twice unchanged as Zullo claims) from Johannas BC.<br/>
Second images are showing how hard it is to determine exact angle of 2 date stamps in such low resolution scans. Mike Zullo said that angles are exactly the same. Which is not true, you can only prove that angles look the same with some tolerance. From my images you can see that ~0.5° change in angle is not detectable. Zullo didnt bother to check what are the odds of two stamps being within those tolerances.<br/>
Last images are about remaining 5 fields for which Zullo claims that were directly copied from Johannas BC to Obamas BC. He claims that all 5 fields are in same position relative to each other. I tried rotating and even changing aspect ratio of pdfs to find if this is true, but I can not reproduce what Zullo claims Mike did in that blurry video. Typewriter words and letters dont match at all. They are way off, not even close.<br/>
Here are my much better proofs made in few hours debunking 5 years of hard forensics work. <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/qB8NG">http://imgur.com/gallery/qB8NG</a></p>

I suppose, just like someone could have stolen everything in your house last night and replaced it with exact copies. Can we give common sense a try?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that part of the problem is that people are so used to debunking the birth certificate forgery issue that they can&#39;t get their heads around this.  I think this is an excellent example of a ruse being played on the American people.  The denials (and support from complicit media) were so effective for so long that people are not able to face the truth. In a way, it is akin to our unwillingness to come to terms with the Kennedy Assassination and the likely involvement of insiders (CIA, Johnson, Warren). Some think the authenticity of the birth certificate does not matter, but it says a lot about the lack of honesty sitting in the White House.  How can people reclaim their country if they look the other way when a fraud is being committed against the public?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media declared it to be a conspiracy theory long ago (even though it is 100% true obama was born in Kenya)
They invented a derogatory term (birther) to qualify people who disagree.
There is even a wikipedia article which calls it a conspirary theory.</p>

<p>So they are very much invested in this shit, they can&#39;t admit now that they lied, because it would discredit them totally.</p>

<p>Besides, most people who were not convinced at first will not change their mind, they will continue to trust the media and call it conspirary theory , whatever the evidence.</p>

<p>So it makes perfect sense for them to ignore the story.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;re just a troll but to line up precisely on a typewriter requires precise lining up with printing marks, like the little X&#39;s you see in the margins of four-color process documents, but that is only done when it&#39;s necessary. </p>

<p>This form is not from a &quot;fine-tuned machine&quot; and did not use that level of precision; we know because other BCs at that time do not line up. So people just rolled the form onto a typewriter (possibly several different machines were used) to generally fit the boxes and hit TAB and ENTER as needed. </p>

<p>Maybe you should have read it, it would take roughly that long to keep yourself from looking stupid. Refer to Section 301, Article 4 on page 235 which covers the Obama situation even if he was born in Kenya.

<p>ive defended trump against bullshit, and hillary</p>

<p>im not biased, just looking at things objectively...and seeing nothing but wild speculation and irrational anger at being asked simple questions</p>

<p>...see your comment here for evidence of that</p>

<p>you WANT to believe this...why?</p>

<p>edit: checked your history...you are <em>rabid</em> about this. Seems you started this account to do nothing but try to convince people this is real...</p>

But it&#39;s cool if you do. Would be more productive to move on instead of confronting different opinions. All comes down to what do you want here. To discuss? To belittle? To confront? Just entertainment? Either way, what comes down to you, comes down to you. But just to you. No one owes you anything. If people want to investigate something you don&#39;t agree with, just don&#39;t investigate it. Don&#39;t like something, don&#39;t do it. But don&#39;t try to impose your ways. First cause you can&#39;t. Second cause it wastes everybody&#39;s time, yours included</p>
