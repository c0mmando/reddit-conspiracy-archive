        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Earlier this year Pope Francis met with Patriarch Kirill in Cuba for the first time in nearly 1000 years. Shortly afterwards Kirill went to Antarctica. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In December of 2015 Russia began to transport Saudi Arabia&#39;s &quot;Ark of Gabriel&quot; which was discovered by a construction crew tunneling under the grand mosque in September. While trying to unearth it, there was a plasma emission which killed the crew and 107 other people. While trying to unearth it a second time it killed 4,000 people, Saudi officials claimed it was a stampede.</p>

<p>On 6 December 2015, this report notes, Federation naval research vessel Admiral Vladimisky departed the Saudi Arabian Port of Jeddah with the “Ark of Gabriel” bound for Antarctica accompanied by a vast naval armada ordered for its protection by President Putin.</p>

<p>Upon his learning of the “grave and global implications” associated with this mysterious “Ark of Gabriel”, this report continues, Pope Francis contacted Patriarch Kirill requesting an “urgent and immediate” meeting while warning that “the end is near”—after which Patriarch Kirill agreed to meet the Roman Catholic Church leader in Cuba on 12 February, an historic meeting between these two leaders that had not taken place between these church’s leaders in nearly 1,000 years. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did the Pope ask Patriarch Kirill for instructions for the &#39;Ark of Gabriel&#39;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His Holiness Patriarch Kirill was then contacted by the Grand Mosque emissaries in regards to one of the oldest Islamic manuscripts possessed by the Russian Orthodox Church that was saved from the Roman Catholic Crusaders in 1204 when they sacked the Church of Holy Wisdom (now known as Hagia Sophia) in Constantinople (present day Istanbul, Turkey) titled “Gabriel’s Instructions To Muhammad”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also interesting is the Prophecy of the Popes which says that there would be 112 popes until judgement day, Pope Francis being the 112th</p>

<p>Richard Byrd was an officer in charge of Antarctic developments project. Byrd&#39;s fourth Antarctic expedition was codenamed Operation Highjump from 1946 to 1947. It was the largest Antarctic expedition to date and was expected to last six to eight months. The expedition was supported by a large naval force, the total number of personnel involved was over 4,000.</p>

<p>In Byrds diaries was this entry</p>

<blockquote>
<p>December 30, 1956 
These last few years elapsed since 1947 have not been kind...</p>

<p>I now make my final entry in this singular diary. In closing, I must state that I have faithfully kept this matter secret as directed all these years. It has been completely against my values of moral right. Now, I seem to sense the long night coming on and this secret will not die with me, but as all truth shall, it will triumph and so it shall.</p>

<p>This can be the only hope for mankind. I have seen the truth and it has quickened my spirit and has set me free! I have done my duty toward the monstrous military industrial complex.</p>

<p>Now, the long night begins to approach, but there shall be no end.</p>

<p>Just as the long night of the Arctic ends, the brilliant sunshine of Truth shall come again... and those who are of darkness shall fall in it&#39;s Light... FOR I HAVE SEEN THAT LAND BEYOND THE POLE, THAT CENTER OF THE GREAT UNKNOWN.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his other entry Byrd reports landing where he could not see the sun</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1000 Hours- We are crossing over the small mountain range and still proceeding northward as best as can be ascertained. Beyond the mountain range is what appears to be a valley with a small river or stream running through the center portion. There should be no green valley below! Something is definitely wrong and abnormal here! We should be over Ice and Snow! To the portside are great forests growing on the mountain slopes. Our navigation Instruments are still spinning, the gyroscope is oscillating back and forth!</p>

<p>1005 Hours- I alter altitude to 1400 feet and execute a sharp left turn to better examine the valley below. It is green with either moss or a type of tight knit grass. The Light here seems different. I cannot see the Sun anymore. We make another left turn and we spot what seems to be a large animal of some kind below us. It appears to be an elephant! NO!!! It looks more like a mammoth! This is incredible! Yet, there it is! Decrease altitude to 1000 feet and take binoculars to better examine the animal. It is confirmed - it is definitely a mammoth-like animal! Report this to base camp.</p>

<p>1030 Hours- Encountering more rolling green hills now. The external temperature indicator reads 74 degrees Fahrenheit! Continuing on our heading now. Navigation instruments seem normal now. I am puzzled over their actions. Attempt to contact base camp. Radio is not functioning!</p>

<p>1130 Hours- Countryside below is more level and normal (if I may use that word). Ahead we spot what seems to be a city!!!! This is impossible! Aircraft seems light and oddly buoyant. The controls refuse to respond!! My GOD!!! Off our port and star board wings are a strange type of aircraft. They are closing rapidly alongside! They are disc-shaped and have a radiant quality to them. They are close enough now to see the markings on them. It is a type of Swastika!!! This is fantastic. Where are we! What has happened. I tug at the controls again. They will not respond!!!! We are caught in an invisible vice grip of some type!</p>

<p>1135 Hours- Our radio crackles and a voice comes through in English with what perhaps is a slight Nordic or Germanic accent! The message is:
&#39;Welcome, Admiral, to our domain. We shall land you in exactly seven minutes! Relax, Admiral, you are in good hands.&#39;
I note the engines of our plane have stopped running! The aircraft is under some strange control and is now turning itself. The controls are useless.</p>

<p>1140 Hours- Another radio message received. We begin the landing process now, and in moments the plane shudders slightly, and begins a descent as though caught in some great unseen elevator! The downward motion is negligible, and we touch down with only a slight jolt!</p>

<p>1145 Hours- I am making a hasty last entry in the flight log. Several men are approaching on foot toward our aircraft. They are tall with blond hair. In the distance is a large shimmering city pulsating with rainbow hues of color. I do not know what is going to happen now, but I see no signs of weapons on those approaching. I hear now a voice ordering me by name to open the cargo door. I comply.</p>

<p>The recent John Kerry 11-7-2016 departure trip to Antarctica by discussing the new agreed upon Nation State Treaty, banning private ships from traveling to Antarctica without advanced authorized permission to do so, for a period of 35 years. Simultaneous to Obama&#39;s secret visit to the South Pole in March, his director of CIA, James Clapper, made a secret trip to Australia, another country with heavy interest in Antarctica. Also worthy of note is Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian clairvoyant who died in 1996 predicted there would be an African American president elected in 2008 and would be the last president.</p>

<p>On top of that Wikileaks published pictures of Antarctica on October 18th <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15503">here</a></p>

<p>One theory is put forth by David Wilcock that the cabal is about to disclose advanced, hi-tech ruins under the ice in Antarctica, and a limited secret space program, to try to save the New World Order agenda. </p>

<p><a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/03/5f/99/035f997b35ea9a0a8bdcbeb3f17b0bcf.jpg">This</a> map of the inner Earth shows where Robert Byrd may have been</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKGL6HcHBT0&amp;spfreload=10">This</a> video does a great job of explaining it all </p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Dr. Raymond Bernard&#39;s book called &quot;The Hollow Earth&quot; he tells of a man who confirmed Admiral Byrd&#39;s story. Dr. Nephi Cotton of Los Angeles reported that one of his patients, a man of Nordic descent, told him the following story:</p>

<p>&quot;I lived near the Arctic Circle in Norway. One summer my friend and I made up our minds to take a boat trip together and go as far as we could into the North country. So we put a months worth of food provisions in a small fishing boat and set to sea.</p>

<p>&quot;At the end of one month we had traveled far into the north, beyond the Pole and into a strange new country. We were much astonished at the weather there. Warm, and at times at night it was almost too warm to sleep. Then we saw something so strange that we were both astonished. Ahead of the warm open sea we were on what looked like a great mountain. Into that mountain at a certain point that ocean seemed to be emptying. Mystified, we continued in that direction and found ourselves sailing into a vast canyon leading into the interior of the Earth. We kept sailing and then we saw what surprised us… a Sun shining inside the Earth.</p>

<p>&quot;The ocean that had carried us into the hollow interior of the Earth gradually became a river. This river led, as we came to realize later, all through the inner surface of the world from one end to the other. It can take you, if you follow it long enough, from the North Pole clear through to the South Pole.</p>

<p>&quot;We saw that the inner surface of the Earth was divided, as the other one is, into both land and water. There is plenty of sunshine and both animal and vegetable life abounds there. We sailed further and further into this fantastic country, fantastic because everything was huge in size as compared with things on the outside. Plants are big, trees gigantic and finally we came to giants.</p>

<p>&quot;They were dwelling in homes and towns, just as we do on the Earth surface, and they used a type of electrical conveyance like a mono-rail car, to transport people. It ran along the river&#39;s edge from town to town.</p>

<p>&quot;Several of the Inner Earth inhabitants, huge giants, detected our boat on the river, and were quite amazed. They were, however, quite friendly. We were invited to dine with them in their homes, and so my companion and I separated, he going with one giant to that giant&#39;s home and I going with another giant to his home.</p>

<p>&quot;My gigantic friend brought me home to his family and I was completely dismayed to see the huge size of all the objects in his home. The dinner table was colossal. A plate was put before me and filled with a portion of food so big it would have fed me abundantly an entire week. The Giant offered me a cluster of grapes and each grape was as big as one of our peaches. I tasted one and found it far sweeter than any I had ever tasted outside. In the interior of the Earth all the fruits and vegetables taste far better and more flavorsome than those we have on the outer surface of the Earth.</p>

<p>&quot;We stayed with the Giants for one year, enjoying their companionship as much as they enjoyed knowing us. We observed many strange and unusual things during our visit with these remarkable people, and were continually amazed at their scientific progress and inventions. All of this time they were never unfriendly to us, and we were allowed to return to our own home in the same manner in which we came… in fact, they courteously offered their protection if we should need it for the return voyage.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another different account about a visit to the hollow Earth was cited by another Norwegian by the name of Olaf Jansen, and was recorded in a book called &quot;The Smoky God&quot;, written by Willis George Emerson. The term &quot;Smoky God&quot; refers to the Central Sun in the hollow interior of the Earth which is smaller and less brilliant than our outer Sun, of course, and hence appears as smoky.</p>

<p>The book relates the experiences of a Norse father and his son who in their small fishing boat attempted to find the &quot;land beyond the North wind&quot;, which they had heard about. A windstorm apparently carried them through the polar opening into the hollow interior of the Earth.</p>

<p>In the book he said that the people live from 400 to 800 years and are highly advanced in science. They can transmit their thoughts from one to another by certain types of radiations and have sources of power greater than our electricity. They are the creators of flying saucers, which are operated by this superior power, drawn from the electromagnetism of the atmosphere. They are twelve or more feet in stature.</p>

<p>One other interesting side note is that in 1942, Nazi Germany sent out an expedition composed of some of its leading scientists in an attempt to find an entrance to the hollow Earth. Göring, Himmler, and Hitler enthusiastically endorsed the project. The Fuehrer was convinced that the Earth was concave and that man lived on the inside of the globe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The concept is to dig tunnels from city to city that descend and ascend in a parabolic path. The tunnels are lined with electric coils to create a magnetic field so the transport vehicle can slide through frictionless like the maglev high-speed trains do on their rails (in France and Japan). The vehicle slides down and then back up at super speed using very little energy since it is mostly propelled and then decelerated by the earth&#39;s gravitational pull. The time of transport should be about twice the amount of time it would take to freefall the depth of the tunnel.
This type of transport has been talked about for decades but it hasn&#39;t happened yet since it is such a huge engineering feat.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The OP mentions Giants in the inner earth. The book of Enoch was left out of the Bible which talks about the nephilim DNA which are the GIANTS. ( Go figures 🙄the elites leave out the part which talks about THEM)</p>

<p>The Giants lived on earth before the flood of Noah. They were extremely destructive, inbred, and hybridization. So, God flooded the earth to start over.  Noah convinced him to save humanity, so he told Noah to build an ark. 
Putting this together with what OP reported... it seems like the Giants escaped into the inner earth when God flooded the world... if they are still there?? 
My guess is the elites and media will push &quot;they are nice and peaceful Giants&quot; in hopes we will give up our weapons in exchange for technology. I&#39;m seeing this everywhere in my research they are &quot;non-violent&quot; and they have technology out of this world I.e. time portals and anti-aging. OP mentioned they live 400-800 years and I read in the Bible that one day we will look for death but will never find it...So I&#39;m sure they are gonna wanna do an exchange there. 
If they are really Giants then don&#39;t let them deceive you bc the book of Enoch, that was left out the Bible, explains in great detail who they are. 
What&#39;s crazy is we have Giant skeletons all over the world that pop up and the media doesn&#39;t cover it. It&#39;s like they know who the Giants are and they don&#39;t want us to know about them. 
<a href="https://sli.mg/QdQ7fa">Check out how big they are </a> </p>

<p>Anyways, this YouTube guy explains the Giants and book of Enoch really well. He even goes over the skeletons held in a museum

    <div class="md"><p>What if some of them are still in the inner earth 🤔</p>

<p>EDIT 
It looks like the Bible does mention the Nephillim (giants) live IN THE EARTH #Before the flood and #After the flood </p>

<p>Genesis 6:4 (Original KJV):
There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.</p>

<p>Bible Probe Note: Note the words; &quot;and also after that&quot;. This probably tells of two &quot;irruptions&quot; by Satan&#39;s seed.  One before Noah&#39;s time and another after the flood.   They were called “The Watchers” in The Book of Enoch.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bibleprobe.com/nephilim.htm">https://www.bibleprobe.com/nephilim.htm</a></p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!!!!</p>

<p>SOLOMON ISLANDS: There&#39;s an entrance to the underworld where the Giants still live till this day!!</p>

<p>Check it out...</p>

<p>After the UN voted to divide Israel 2 weeks ago, earthquakes have doubled and Solomon Islands have been the main place of quakes. </p>

<p>There&#39;s been like 5 small quakes  a day and 3 major quakes in Solomon Islands since the vote took place. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/third-strong-quake-in-two-weeks-off-solomon-islands/story-z262L54UjghrGCyYmUyJRL_amp.html?client=safari">Quakes in Solomon Island</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.alienhub.com/threads/the-7-8-earthquake-that-shook-the-giants-awake.68348/">Forum talking about Giants in Solomon cave </a> </p>

<p>People say Giants still live there today but they don&#39;t live in a cave. The cave is just an entrance to the underworld. </p>

<p><a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/paranormal/2015/02/solomon-islands-giants-why-they-may-still-be-around-2483986.html">Giants in Solomon News article </a> </p>

<p>Damn the Bible says these Giants have 6 toes/finger 10-14 foot tall and reddish hair.
OUR MILITARY KILLED A GIANT...shot a red headed 15 foot giant weighing 1100lbs came out of the caves in Afghanistan. The Giant speared a US solider and killed him. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/yournewswire.com/is-u-s-government-hiding-red-haired-giant-of-kandahar/amp/?client=safari">is US Government hiding Red hair Giants? </a> </p>

<p>HOLY FUCK! Our govt is hiding this shit from us bc they feed these Giants our children and humans!!!! These Giants eat humans and they live in our earth WTF</p>

<p>On one hand, I&#39;m absolutely fascinated with the whole Antarctic theories. On the other, I&#39;m raging mad at the fact the elite are withholding science/secrets from us in regards to Antarctica. If they don&#39;t want to tell us, that&#39;s fine! At least open that shit up so others can explore. The elite think we&#39;re too stupid to know the truth. Well, I&#39;m sure some wouldn&#39;t believe the truth or would even care anyway. I mean they have the Kardashians to watch, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m pissed about that too. We should start a movement and get a hashtag trending on twitter about Antarctica on the following:</p>

<h1>AntarcticaTRUTH</h1>

<p>aliens, reptilians, ufos, Nordics, hollow earth, Kerry, HRC, krill, pope, buzz, clapper, and obama visit to Antarctica, ark of Gabriel, admiral Byrd, operation high jump, Nazi, Hitler&#39;s expeditions, treaty&#39;s, pyramids. </p>

<p>If we get a big enough group together and have certain times and days to start our tweets so we can get a twitter storm going and put pressure on the elites to tell us the truth. This will wake up the masses bc people do look at what&#39;s trending on twitter. The more people wake up... the better. 
Look how PIZZAGATE took off and now MSM is covering PIZZAGATE. Maybe in a bad perspective but atleast it&#39;s getting the word out. PIZZAGATE is part of Antarctica bc these reptilians feed off of children. This is exactly what the elites want hidden... Antarctica, reptilians, and their pedophilia. </p>

And WHY would OUR govt hide this from us?? Maybe bc we feed them out children and humans?? They eat humans and they need food... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at these <a href="http://imgur.com/a/sofPA">pictures.</a>  Most critical thinkers can come to their own conclusions on this.  I believe anywhere in between the 45th parallels is going to get interesting in the next 3 years.  These are things I have felt and experienced while hitchhiking around the US the past 2.5 years.  Some of you will know what I&#39;m saying about a polar shift.  Respect brothers and sisters!</p>

<p>edit:  Why I think the poles are key is what I meant to type.  Alaska has come up so much for me.  Same with Antarctica.  All this stuff just lines up.  I believe by end of 2019 we&#39;ll have to move north or south of the 45ths.  The further north or south the better.  These areas have the least direct amount of sun light.  Something probably going to happen in Florida in the near future to let us know this.  These pole shift anomalies have been going on for a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in the UP :)  Well if I&#39;m correct.  The areas south of the 45th will get too much solar radiation because of the amount of direct overhead sun.  Above the 45th the sun has to pass through more atmosphere to get to the ground.  I really don&#39;t know what the buffer zone would be.  But the further north the better.  Keweenaw Peninsula sounds nice. hehe</p>

<p>Tavistock creates artificial cults, like the Process Church of the Final Judgment. They also create groups to infiltrate environmental groups, political groups, government agencies and non-profits.</p>

<p>They create causes, expertly, because controlling opposing sides of each conflict allows a way to focus the attention of the populace.</p>

<p>The alien thing is a Tavistock ruse to get people focused on something other than protected political pedophilia because that leads to uncovering how bad the slavery problem really is and the existential questioning of what slavery actually is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there is &quot;modern day slavery&quot; all over the world. Americans have no idea. Qatar 60% of their population are slaves. People from 3rd world countries contact agencies to hire them in Qatar. Once they get there their contract is changed, their passport is taken away from them. They have to work for a few dollars a day and live in a shitty run down scummy shelter. If they want to leave back home they have to pay the OUTRAGEOUS agency fee. Some people work YEARS to save up for that fee to get home and some never get the chance to leave. They are straight up labor slaves. They have owners who tells them if they can leave or not.. that shit is SLAVERY. The World Cup they are building is built by slaves and 6,000 slaves will die by time it finishes. Slavery is EVERYWHERE and it runs ramped. If you buy a house in Qatar, it comes with maids, drivers and chefs. 
My friend lives in Qatar and when I researched this a couple months back i was shocked.  America is far from being racist compared to other countries. If your black, paki or Asian in Qatar... you&#39;re a slave and the Russians and kids are into sex slavery. 
It&#39;s very sad bc if you look at the countries that are involved with &quot;modern day slavery&quot; US in on there for Human TRAFFICKING aka sex slaves..</p>

They were then destroyed mysteriously, some believe this was done by the &quot;powers that be&quot;  / CIA. This would fit in with some of the reports. Here&#39;s some info about it...

<p>Also the world&#39;s biggest ancient library &quot;Alexandria&quot; was burnt to the ground. That place held ancient manuscripts that pre-date any kind of history we&#39;re aware of.  You can probably imagine the kind of secrets held at Alexandia library that would have seriously challenged modern day beliefs about religion and our place in the universe.</p>

<p>So for people living on the inside of the earth, they would be subject to the same rate of acceleration because of gravity toward the center of the earth.. just like us. So, can anyone point out how the hollow earth theorists overcome this point? I&#39;m genuinely interested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theoretically, if i could place myself perfectly in the center point of space -- the middle of the ball -- I would just float there. Equally attracted to every point of the inner surface of the shell. Now, something nudges me off my equilibrium towards Canada. As I approach the surface of the underside of Canada I start to experience my normal body weight, and eventually land. Let&#39;s pretend I survive. </p>

<p>Now the mass of Canada&#39;s under side is pulling on me with the same amount of gravity as Canada&#39;s topside -- just like right now in real life. Life is good, your theory checks out. </p>

<p>BUT Australia is still trying to pull me BACK at a reduced force as well. And so is Europe, and south America and every other piece of the shell planet. </p>

<p>This is becoming paradoxical very quickly. </p>

<p>And, what is holding our shell earth together? After all, supposing your theory correct, there is a huge force pushing us top-spiders down, and another strong force pushing the down-siders up.. At every point on the planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah... you would just float if you somehow got into the centre of a solid planet... guess you&#39;ve never seen that idea expressed in entertainment before?</p>

<p>My thoughts still stand, no paradox... if it has enough mass and people don&#39;t get too far away from it... they won&#39;t just be lifted from the inside surface and all get stuck float8ng in the centre  (which is where hades/the internal sun is in case you didn&#39;t actually look closely at the post......)</p>

<p>In the images that Wikileaks released of Antarctic I found an interesting anomaly. In image 17 in the lower right hand corner there is an unnatural black square with some bits of red. Looks like a hole cut into the ice. Judging by the size of the sailing ship in the same photo the hole appears to be fairly large. I&#39;d love to hear some feedback on it. I cannot tell what it is. There is also a name in one of the images. Thorsten BuBelberg &#39;98. He led a scientific expedition to Antarctic in the 90&#39;s. A quick google search and you can find his journal. I haven&#39;t gone through it yet. I can&#39;t imagine that there&#39;d be anything in it. No way &quot;they&quot; would let something like that hide in plain sight. Anyway, I love this post. I am convinced that the key is Antarctic and that Nazis, WW2, Byrd, Kerry, Obama, the treaty.... are all connected </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone know if it would be possible to go from northern Scandinavia to this place? I am absolutely serious. In Januari I will recieve a small sum of money and I <em>really</em> want to go there because I&#39;ve been interested in any theory involving the antarctic. I believe it&#39;s truly something there.</p>

<p>I also live in Scandinavia. If I do this, I will definitely record everything as best as I can to anyone interested.</p>

<p>So if anyone have any info on how this can be done, please contact me or point me in the right direction. If you&#39;re interested in coming and funding, please contact me. Obviously, this will go from Scandinavia and going north since the theory suggest openings on both sides.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think it&#39;s hard to get pass whatever might be put in place to keep people out. But there&#39;s no way to know if you don&#39;t go there, right?</p>

<p>EDIT: If anyone have <em>professional</em> experience of months on the sea, please contact me. I have a lot of questions.</p>

<p>I think the way it works is that the magnetic force in the South pole allows you to enter, and the magnetic force in the North pole spits you out (onto our realm). If you read the Smoky God that&#39;s exactly what happens to that guy.</p>

However this is David Wilcock in a three part file, with intro, narrates what his (arguably) his most important witness to date has written down, then reads out a conversation with Corey Goode and THEN a concluding statement. (Maybe this is what OP is referring to).</p>

<p>Long, talking like about 2 hours, but well worth the listen if it helps you and your friends and family. There are other sources for this info, example check out Corey Goode&#39;s interview transcripts on his spherebeingalliance (dot com &gt; cosmic disclosure) website.</p>

<p>Are there any ways to confirm his accounts other than cross examining his experiences with others who claim the same? </p>

<p>I do think that a secret space program is likely, an intergalactic group of spiritual &quot;alien&quot; entities looking out for humanity, I also believe to be likely, but I need more than his word, you know? </p>

<p>This is fascinating to me. Claims in these types of testimonies like Greer&#39;s old Disclosure project, or what has now iterated to Siriusdisclosure and CSETI are sometimes thrown out, but they shouldn&#39;t be.</p>

<p>Given the propaganda, and amazing drive to supress this information against (what I believe to be) an insurmountable citizen journalism environement, we are left with oral evidence. Most (some?) First Nations people communicate by telling stories, but corruption and lying wasn&#39;t in their culture, so here we stand, having to dig through a mix of both oral evidence, and disinformation coming from Intelligence agencies trying to supress and contaminate the massive body of evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally understand. Wilcock hand holds his audience quite a bit, so for the most part this is a good thing.</p>

<p>The more unbelievable evidence, the more corroborating evidence some of us need. Given the <em>fake news</em> propaganda campaign fully embraced by the legacy stream media, it&#39;s up to us to inform each other - those interested in digging deeper, not just denying information outright.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1lkDOSogl5Q">Watch former CIA officer</a></p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kyx_KD_Sy_w">Watch Ron Garner</a></p>

<p>There are SO MANY of these types of testimonies, like another I&#39;ll try to find of a retired engineer that testified (and his son backed up his story) he designed a machine to help teach air force pilots how to fly anti-gravity saucers (temporally), but the kicker was his expert consultant was an ET (imprisoned if I remember right but don&#39;t quote me on that).</p>

<p>Those are testimonies /interviews, so what about the latest intel as Wilcock and Goode are calling it? Well for that, it also requires cross reference, for example Steve Kuczienich (butchered his name I know) put out those three videos almost giving credit to Bush and Nixon, but was a bit of corroboration, in saying there has been a silent coup. We are sick of their sick games. Many make the mistake that the FBI and CIA are one entity, for the most part that is true, but we can see there are good actors within, fighting the good fight.</p>

<p>FBIanon also corroborates some of these latest intel findings.</p>

<p>Essentially, the bad guys are getting desparate, they are turning on each other to make deals before partial disclosure happens. There&#39;s a slight chance that full disclosure will happen, but that&#39;ll only happen from major unintended leaks, or the &quot;bad guys&quot; make some really stupid moves (again, not likely).</p>

<p>Goode needs financial support and I don&#39;t think Wilcock is doing enough to help him in that area. I obviously don&#39;t know what their situation is on sharing Gaia profits, but I&#39;d be shocked if that totals more than a part-time income.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think something interesting is going on in antarctica, but the earth is not hollow. If people could take a month&#39;s food and travel north and see giants inside the earth who are friendly and invite you to dinner and have electric trains, then I&#39;m pretty damn sure there would be a few pictures of it on the internet by now. </p>

<p>I get the distinct feeling there <em>is</em> something important going on here, but it&#39;s being paired with disinformation to keep people off the real trail.</p>

<p>I think more realistic would be a special architecture project, like a deep underground military base for a post-nuclear war era, or secret space technology. Or a plan to accelerate sea level rise by breaking off ice to consolidate political power through a global warming narrative. All those seem far more reasonable than the earth being hollow and having holes at both poles... that is just nonsense. Literal Tavistock disinformation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Islam we have the Jinn who are strong and powerful race seperate from the Humans. 
The Jinn are shapeshifter and have been on the earth a lot longer than man as they were created first. </p>

<p>They were made of a smokeless fire and have certain powers. Like Humans each Jinn is different and there are more powerful ones and weaker ones. </p>

<p>The idea is that humans in past times coordinated with Jinns and used them for their ill needs as Allah states that man is better than the Jinn. </p>

<p>Anyway it is known among Muslims who have the knowledge of this topic that the Jinns like humans can get married and have kids, this and that and can WAGE WAR. </p>

<p>The Jinn warred with each other and devastated the face of the earth  known back then .
My humble opinion is that God sent down the flood waters to cleanse earth of the filth and and devastation the Jinns had caused to cleanse everything. 
i think the Jinns who escaped fled underground and went into hiding. Jinn can live a lot longer than humans. </p>

<p>How will I relate this to Mythology.</p>

<p>Im pretty sure we are all familiar with the term &#39;demigod&#39; and as the bible states in Genesis 6:4 - There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare [children] to them, the same [became] mighty men which [were] of old, men of renown.</p>

<p>I believe that the Greek Gods were also a representation of these Jinn or advanced race that live under the earth .</p>

<p>There were powerful Gods and smaller gods just like there were powerful Jinn and weaker Jinn.</p>

<p>Zeus was able to shapeshift and thus impregnated Danae ( a mortal)  in the form of a golden shower to create Perseus a demigod.
Achilles son of Thetis (a goddess ) and Peleus (a mortal)
Hercules son of Zeus and Alcmene ( a mortal)</p>

<p>In the epic of Gilgamesh ,  Gilgamesh sets out to visit his cousin Utnapishtim in the underworld  (hollow earth)</p>

<p>The Sumerians worshipped tall gods who were not from this earth . There are stone tablets depicting these gods with little monkey like animals on their laps. </p>

<p>I know what ive said is really mixed but im shit at explaining. 
Oh yes and The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym exaplains that after they journeyed into the Antarctic sea crossing Drakes Passage they travelled and travelled and came across a large human looking being with blonde hair ..</p>

<p>lots of interesting stuff.</p>

The Churches tend to leave to mass hive mentality and general close mindedness to what challenges the narrative that they are 100% convinced of. That can happen anywhere even here but as a rule of thumb I think most try to question everything especially a story of what is bound to be by the word of &quot;god&quot; aka propaganda that people are so sure is meant to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I get what you&#39;re  saying... I feel as there is more that to what is told and we need to have an open mind to search and figure out what is out there. I&#39;m a Christian but I feel like the way these elites lie, cheat and deceive.. they could easily manipulate the Bible to control us and limit our thinking. 
It&#39;s really messed up how the controllers of the world are so evil and fill our brains up with lies. Everything we are taught is a lie. What is reality? And what&#39;s an illusion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah I do think there is definitely more to the human story than we are aware of. I do believe some of what the bible says has some truth to it but yes it was most likely written with an agenda. Not really religious here but I do believe there are positives to some of what is taught even though I find the method manipulative. As far as the reality of it all I have chosen to take an absurdist stance on the whole thing. I still dig and research and try and offer a different perspective than what my friends and family eat up. I cant change someones view on things but I can plant an idea thats counter to their own and encourage critical thought which happens to spread like a wildfire. I don&#39;t let it weigh me down that&#39;s seems like another trap all I can do is live life and I would rather do that with a smile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man things are making so much sense now.  I love this sub lol
So, from my research I&#39;ve learned the reptilians that are in high powers of the govt. feed off of fear &amp; control (which you mention is no bueno) and they need the fear to fill up their energy tank. To switch over to the 4th dimension, it takes up a lot of energy, so they always Need to refill. It makes sense that our media instills fear 24/7 bc the evil reptilians living on our earth need that for their energy. I think the truth is seeping out extremely fast and they are really freaking out. They see us talking about reptilians and PIZZAGATE, and they  bombard us with this fakenews BS to try and cover up. I&#39;ve read the reptilians love children bc they feed off their pure energy and they love Gold too. It&#39;s funny how the Clinton&#39;s are into gold mining in Haiti and Africa. It&#39;s also weird how Trumps condo is PURE Gold 
Hmmm..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what really helped me?  Going vegan.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t quit cold turkey, I worked on eliminating things for a few months but when I finally made the leap to eating whole plant based foods and not eating meat and dairy almost within a week things were clearer. To be perfectly honest with you, my primary reason for trying it out was vanity. I wanted clear skin and to lose weight and didn&#39;t really expect it to open me up spiritually by reconnecting to my sense of empathy.</p>

<p>It really makes me think there is something to consuming meat and dairy the way we do.  The huge amount of animals we eat is not natural and the conditions we keep them in, how horribly they must suffer so we can eat them is so wrong.  If you just really think about what you are actually consuming, the hormones that would be released that you are consuming...  Which is pretty much exactly what these reptilians are allegedly doing. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some info from the cattle industry itself about how stress and fear hormones impact the taste of beef so you know I&#39;m not pulling that bit out of my ass: <a href="http://www.grass-fed-solutions.com/cattle-stress.html">http://www.grass-fed-solutions.com/cattle-stress.html</a></p>

<p>And I know I must sound like a preachy vegan but I truly don&#39;t mean to be, I don&#39;t judge anyone for what they eat. This is really how it looks to me. It&#39;s something to think about.  </p>

One of the things in the bible talks about turning water to wine.  A metaphor.  It also talks about the old wine(natural spring water) better than the new(the tap water).  Water to wine based off intent into the water by emotionally willing an alignment in the water.  No Lemon or Cayenne required.  Just your intent with the natural water you drink.  Things have been manipulated for thousands of years.  Even &quot;organic&quot; can&#39;t really be trusted to disconnect.  Glad you replied!  Its reassurance in what I&#39;ve been experiencing.

Everything we are experiencing right now, aliens, Satanic leaders, NWO is all connected to the Bible.

If you notice a lot of celebs have ppl near them drop dead all the time. That&#39;s why Kanye west is all messed up in the head bc he sacrificed his mom for money and fame.

    <div class="md"><p>You know what really helped me?  Going vegan.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t quit cold turkey, I worked on eliminating things for a few months but when I finally made the leap to eating whole plant based foods and not eating meat and dairy almost within a week things were clearer. To be perfectly honest with you, my primary reason for trying it out was vanity. I wanted clear skin and to lose weight and didn&#39;t really expect it to open me up spiritually by reconnecting to my sense of empathy.</p>

<p>It really makes me think there is something to consuming meat and dairy the way we do.  The huge amount of animals we eat is not natural and the conditions we keep them in, how horribly they must suffer so we can eat them is so wrong.  If you just really think about what you are actually consuming, the hormones that would be released that you are consuming...  Which is pretty much exactly what these reptilians are allegedly doing. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some info from the cattle industry itself about how stress and fear hormones impact the taste of beef so you know I&#39;m not pulling that bit out of my ass: <a href="http://www.grass-fed-solutions.com/cattle-stress.html">http://www.grass-fed-solutions.com/cattle-stress.html</a></p>

<p>And I know I must sound like a preachy vegan but I truly don&#39;t mean to be, I don&#39;t judge anyone for what they eat. This is really how it looks to me. It&#39;s something to think about.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a religious person but I believe in double speak code in everything and I see the bits of truth to my reality in them.  One of the things in the bible talks about turning water to wine.  A metaphor.  It also talks about the old wine(natural spring water) better than the new(the tap water).  Water to wine based off intent into the water by emotionally willing an alignment in the water.  No Lemon or Cayenne required.  Just your intent with the natural water you drink.  Things have been manipulated for thousands of years.  Even &quot;organic&quot; can&#39;t really be trusted to disconnect.  Glad you replied!  Its reassurance in what I&#39;ve been experiencing.  We need to keep communicating with like minded individuals.  There is no bad or good communications.  It&#39;s all grey with purpose and intent!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s the only ones that are &quot;reported&quot; imagine the ones that go unseen or people are afraid to report on. This shit runs ramped. Like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=cFxyP2VfVi0">lady </a> she&#39;s an eyewitness to royalty and SOROS killing children for sacrifices and says they eat they children too. The police won&#39;t touch her story nor will the media bc they cover up for the higher powers. </p>
