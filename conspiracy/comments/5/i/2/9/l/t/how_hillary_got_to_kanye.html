       I believe Kanye was taken, forcefully reprogrammed and on a bunch of meds now. He was taken a shortly after giving a 20+ minute rant against the establishment, Hillary Clinton, Facebook, Google, and Obama for fake news and algorithm manipulation.
       <br/>
       Full 20 minute speech:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKoe_GteC2I">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKoe_GteC2I
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In that speech he believed that people including his former friend Jay Z who aligned himself with Hillary, would assassinate him or attempt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was admitted by his doctor while at his trainers home. His trainer was questioned after Kanye was forcibly taken by police, handcuffed to a gurney. This was his interview
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykjKEATjCDU">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykjKEATjCDU
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The hospital he was taken to, Resnick psychiatric is owned by Lynda and Stewart Resnick. They own companies including The Wonderful Company, POM Wonderful and FIJI Water brands, the Teleflora floral wire service company, Wonderful Pistachios, and other businesses.. The hospital itself has mixed reviews.
      </p>

       They're were included in a "top donors" list I found in Wikileaks Podesta e-mails. (top link in the xls document)
       <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?q=stewart+resnick">

      </p>
      <p>
       " Here is the list of top $1M + prospects. I have sent it before, but it seems you never get it. please let me know that you received it." This was in regards to the donor list to Podesta, Resnicks are in the xls attachment.

      </p>
      <p>
       Of course they'd take Kanye forcefully to a hospital funded by Hillary's billionaire friends after speaking out. Not to mention, Lynda is godmother to Ariana Huffington of the Huffington Post's daughter.
The Resnicks have been called evil people by various independent journalists for their greed.

       None of the Kardashians asked for prayers or positive support on twitter etc. for Kanye (makes me think they're in on it). When Lamar Odom went to the hospital they asked everyone to pray for him. The Kardashian clan largely supported Clinton over Trump other than Caitlyn Jenner. Kendall had an interview in which she was asked if she was praying for Kanye. She says yes, but her body language is uncomfortable and suggests otherwise.

       He looks drugged up to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like to point out Kim hasn't done anything since the Paris robbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Paris robbing happened after the media told stories about Caitlyn Jenner trying to get Kim to vote for trump. The illuminati can't have that. So they fucking "robbed" her and Kanye got fucking woke and pissed and spoke and got locked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're a black man in Hollywood/'music you get treated like shit for speaking the truth.

       no, i believe the way to read it is:
      </p>
      <p>
       "most men with nefarious intentions such as hurting / robbing Kim Kardashian would, given the opportunity also rape her, circumstances permitting".
      </p>
      <p>
       why do you think that murdering / hard core criminals wont stoop to that?

       well in any case, were discussing the 2nd point.
      </p>
      <p>
       what the poster thinks about peoples choices or preferences in non criminal / violent situations is not really part of the topic / conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       nor am i interested tbh in discussing it, its their problem / point / issue / thoughts.  were discussing the actions of the criminally motivated actions against Kim that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       but then again - who knows. maybe nothing even happened and it was all stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       on the other hand ive heard that all of Kanyes staff were actually killed - hence no video evidence leaked.

       The problem with that is he/she said the majority of men, if they had her in a room, wouldn't just tie her up. We already know their intentions are nefarious due to the fact they robbed her and held her against her will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do I think murderers or hard core criminals won't stoop to that? Some will. The type who want to send a message or when you have a rapist that fits one of the four rapist types will. However, these things are not applicable to all criminals. In addition, if you're there to get in and get out, or your entire plan is to get the money and not get caught, then committing another Type 1 crime, that will leave trace evidence linking you to the crime, is a big no no.

       I agree. I suppose I was kind of playing devils advocate because OP made a good post.

       I bet the percentage of men who would commit a rape is higher when the pool is all robbers, but probably still not a majority. OP check your friends, you guys may be degenerates.

       Yeah that would make sense. This guy seems to be saying the majority of guys would be willing to do both. If you care little enough about hurting and traumatizing someone to tie them up I can see it being a shortish jump to rape.

       He's made good posts here, but I think the majority here who like me fundamentally disagree. There is something seriously wrong with the sample he's using to draw statistics from. Or he's making errors somewhere else in the process.

       Yeah. I mean presuming this writer isn't completely autistic (no disrespect just realism) I doubt he poses this question to every man he meets. So there's almost definitely selection bias of not asking the guys more likely to respond with "wtf is wrong with you, no" in the first place. FWIW I'm a radical feminist and, yeah, I don't think most men are rapists, let alone all. Weird to be the one making this point, on reddit (and

       There's probably selection bias that leads to you getting so many responses like that, probably selection bias that makes the idea to me so unthinkable. I'm not arguing with you about whether it happened or not, and I am totally willing to entertain the possibility that most men are would-be rapists if you (presumably a man) are telling me that, but I gotta say I really highly doubt it. I know men are statistically more likely to commit violence and rape but I just fundamentally believe in their humanity...other men reading this please tell me if you think this guy's assessment is on point, it would shake my view of my fellow human beings but I guess if it's inaccurate it needs to be shaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       This reminds me of when theists say "you need religion to provide a moral code and enforcement" and then others (like myself) respond "you mean you'd seriously hurt other people if you thought you could get away with it?" to which the answer is usually "of course not". Which, you know, obviously no one's going to say "yep I'd be out there raping and murdering like there's no tomorrow"...but I still kinda believed most people wouldn't actually want to enact serious violence on others even if they could.

       Imo the fact that you're mostly talking to men with an interest in BDSM definitely affects the responses you're getting. Even if someone is a sub/dom they're really two sides of the same coin (there's a little bit of switch in most of us). I think it goes without saying that people who are already into mixing sex and violence/power play would be more into this.

       No im with you if youre a person. I just also studied persuasion tactics academically once upon a time so i see stuff like this and my mind immediately sees it as an orchestrated event.

       Listen to saint pablo, it's the last song on his new record.

      <p>
       "The media thinks I'm way out of control, I'm just not in their control."
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime" lol I know but he's said that you can't do anything unless you have Jewish friends. Overall the song is praising god n such. Something the illumati hates obviously.

       I've seen a lot of comments around the internet about various artist's song lyrics now after looking up some conspiracy stuff, I'm just curious though, why would the record companies let the songs onto the albums if the lyrics of various songs were actually meaning what we think they mean? I'm not saying people's theories about lyrics aren't true, I'm just wondering if they were, why would they even be allowed to use them in the songs?

       I'm not sure. It's weird because Migos has their own label, but they're the biggest crack/guns/trapping/killing right now it seems like. Besides 21 savage.

      <p>
       21 savage doesn't have a label, but these people do have managers. Jewish ones. lol I could go on

       I felt I had to say something, I've been keeping this to myself for weeks out of fear. These are powerful people he's been speaking out against. He's my favorite artist by far and has inspired my life and art. He spoke up for us so I felt I had to speak out for him. I'm sure there's a lot more I just haven't had too much time to dig.

       In Kayne's case I think he was raised religious... maybe a closeness to God keeps ya a little more awoke? I dunno... I think R. Kelly didn't give a fuck about their blackmail and was like "Whatever... release the video of me pissing on a teen... I don't care."

       lol, please rethink and re-read what you said. If anything, "whitey" has spoken out more, and "hip-hop" is complete utter garbage.... Hood rats get co-opted just as easily as MS "white" musicians. Listen to this band of  "whiteys":

       . Show me one, Blacky touching on anything like this. I'll follow up to, being that I know the "indie" scene. I also know Immortal technique, but even he is a bitch, to MS.... Fuckers do not want to listen. I listen to all... You (majority - do not)..

       Jay Electronica is the most "woke" artist across any genre. Listen to Voodoo man by him. Dude raps about the bi-cameral mind, rothschilds, occultism, etc. Not all the time but he slips those kind of themes in often.

       Could be, but do you disregard? Do you know where nigger actually comes from? I swear mods, if you remove this and ban me (C'mon -really - I do not say this in malice).... I'm trying to teach. Look into the socio-economic meaning behind the word. White's were niggers to other (wealthier) elites (Blacks, Whites, Asians, Persians - you name it). It's about socio-economic classes, and not race.
      </p>
      <p>
       The black man does not know what the white man does not. Ask the Irish about slavery, or discrimination, via the protestants in the US (one example). White Catholics to the White Pagans. Mayans to other LA natives. Fuck.... Natives to other Natives....
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all in this together, and no, it's not about the "haves" and "havenots". It's individuals... Black men, are just as much as cowards and pussies as white men, or others...

      <p>
       There was never a "socio-economic meaning" behind the word. The word "nigger" wasn't just some term someone made up for poor people and then was later applied to all blacks.

      <p>
       Ok, let's ask the Irish about slavery. Let's see if over 20 million Irish died while being brought here against their own free will. In addition, let's see if the Irish have an infrastructure in Ireland that they could fall back on today. The black man does know what the white man, the Mayans, the Natives, etc knows. The black man knows no real identity or culture. The Irish you mentioned? They know their culture and can trace it back to generations regardless of how poor they were. The Natives? Despite the hardships they endure they still have some type of connection to their roots and culture. Now let's look at blacks in the U.S. and see if the same holds true. What culture do blacks have that is their own? What infrastructure do blacks have or can rely on outside of this country?

      <p>
       So if it's not about the haves and have nots, then why are you talking about socio-economics and comparing and contrasting different groups?

       Well, you're just making excuses then for dumb shit behavior, now aren't you? White chick from the burbs, has a dad. Black chick from Chi-Town doesn't... Who's fault is that? Not the white chick, but the father of the Black chick... Stop making excuses.... Blacks need to fix their communities, and it's about time they do so (they have Black leaders leading them to the slaughter - not Whitey). They need a hand up, not a hand out... This is coming from someone who lived in a town you wish you never lived in, and was poor as shit. I'm also white, and have black, brown, yellow, red friends ;)

       Niggers* (See my other post on socio-economic) have no less opportunity. Yea, name your son D'Night'Shaun and don't be surprised if he gets hired over Damon (Black or White). You wanna be "hood rich", yet blame the system for getting turned down for an interview, because you speak and present yourself like your on Twitter? Don't be surprise. God helps those who help themselves. Blacks are not helping themselves, but looking for outside help. That is my problem with Religion. It comes within. There is no help coming for you. Help, yourself....

       It might feel good to let your secrets out... or at least it might feel good to save a little face... you shouldn't be ashamed of your history... acknowledging it will help you move past it.

       Dude , you need to listen to Kanye since My dark twisted fantasy , 'till Pablo , and listen carefully.  They do not call him Yeezus for the fuck of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe start with a

      <p>
       Kanye West - Lost In The World (Explicit) ft. Bon Iver

       What are you even talking about??? Kendrick talks about the hypocrisy that exists within society as well as paths to revolution more than the incoherent musical torture you just posted.  Just because you're a racist holed away from normal society doesn't mean that messages don't exist outside of your sphere of ignorance.

       Dude you talk about white slaves as if it were somehow comparable to what black people went through.  You're ignorant regarding the continuous disenfranchisement they have suffered yet place the blame on "black communities".  If you want to actually have this discussion I'd suggest you read some George Jackson first, so you don't continually come across as a person who is racist due to ignorance.  But hey, keep posting your metal bands thinking that  they are communicating anything close to the societal commentary that Kendrick does.

       Not sure why I'm even engaging somebody who
       <strong>
        doesn't believe that space exists

       .  Crawl back into your cottage, you've already abandoned society because you weren't determined or intelligent enough to actually contribute to revolutionary change, and instead now just troll people on reddit.

       Um, I just did.  I claimed you didn't believe in space, you lied and said there wasn't evidence for that, then I backed up my claim.  Again, are there multiple people running your account?  How do you explain not remembering something from a week ago?

      <p>
       If you need evidence about your ignorance regarding indentured servitude vs. slavery I would suggest reading Irish historian Liam Hogan's piece:
       <a href="https://medium.com/@Limerick1914/the-imagery-of-the-irish-slaves-myth-dissected-143e70aa6e74#.n96i069bt">

       </a>
       .  But I doubt you're actually interested in learning anything as you've somehow avoided it your entire life to this point.

       Goes to me clearly stating my opinion, up to today. I never said space isn't real, just perhaps not how we've been told, same with ET's. My Opinion. I think space is different, along with ET's. I think they are inter-dimensional beings... If so, space would have to not exist, as we know it.. Damn, you're pretty daft. But then-a-again you have a boner for me...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now. Show me some evidence for what you stated about me, because this is not it.... Now, you're just looking like a damn fool...

       The hypothesis is that the elite are engineering a bloodline that is more susceptible to programming. This way they can program their own and maintain control.  They are making designer "pets" of themselves through genetic engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need black celebrities as pied pipers for the masses, but they pluck them from the common gene pool. Look around and tell me that it isn't working.

       Do you really believe that addressing a forum with "shills" and "sheep" is how you wake up the masses? Most people that come here are out to seek info and knowledge. If you want to be an adult and have an adult conversation please continue. But if your agenda is to come here and spout your buzzwords no one is going to take you seriously. If you have something to contribute, by all means please do so.

       These shills are a fucking joke ahaha keep going lads, you can't un see what we've all seen, you should have told Tony Podesta to tone down his art taste if you didn't want to wake us from dormancy. Asides Kanye gave a 35 mind interview on 11/20/16, make of it what you will he doesn't sound nuts.

       I'm all for diving further into this theory but why not engage in an adult conversation with us and not address everyone as shill. Lets all have a dialogue and quit deflecting so much. The more we can work together to address the nuances of this theory the better.

       And there's the cuck. I'm just saying you could convince a lot more people to join your cause if you weren't so childish about it. 
So I'll bite; I stand by the art of Biljana Djurdjevic because, as a fellow artist I think her paintings portray a lot of pain and suffering in a way only a Serbian who was likely affected by Clinton's war could react to what has happened in her country. Are you asking that we start banning and burning art because the pieces fit into some six degrees of Kevin Bacon theory that some collector who might be a pedo likes the art because he likes to see tortured children? I can like her art for the quality and message. I'm not getting a boner from it. Are you? It's funny that you're here on a forum that stands for free speech yet you're got some kind of attitude against it. Do you believe Biljana Djurdjevic was commissioned to do these pieces for Podesta as wank material or perhaps he happened to collect her work because she's a renowned artist? Art is an expression and Biljana Djurdjevic's art is a reflection of a world torn apart by circumstances that arose thanks to American intervention in her country. Part of that result is human trafficking, torture, and crime. If you're to say we are no longer allowed as human's to express that pain through art you need to push your fascist agenda further. Maybe it'll stick
      </p>
      <p>
       As I will continue to say to deaf ears. I am all for having a civil discussion about ALL of these theories but if you're only agenda is to come here and be accusatory and childish about it, why waste your energy?

       In one of the videos during his rant someone is trying to pull him off the stage and he's trying hard to not let it happen which is odd. Everything he said was real shit. Not crazy IMO. So wtf? OP I've been wondering why myself the whole Kanye thing was so strange cause I'm not a big Kanye fan but this was some crazy stuff that went down. To bad we will never know what truly happened when he was sent to the hospital because it couldn't have been from his rant which was pure sanity for once.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do like how someone commented and linked the robbery to when Kim came out confused if she should go for Trump after speaking to Bruce/Caitlyn. Never thought of that. Can anyone source the timeline cause that would make this story much more interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think Kanye got woke with everything going on with the election. Someone slipped him the woke pill. (Woke pill to me is not like the red pill but someone woken up to what they call conspiracies) I'm impressed with this actually cause I used to just think Kanye is an egomaniac dipshit musical genius.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best Kaney quote ever "It's a new world Hillary! Google lied to you! Facebook lied to you!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not think he meant in his rant that Jay Z was really gunna kill him. He said "J I know you got killaz don't send them at my head". So don't fuck with my head and shit see Jay Z and Dash made this kid called Yeezus so if Jay Z wanted too he could kill his career.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now onto the Trump meeting today. In one of Kanye's twitter rants he wanted Facebook CEO to fund him cause (in kanyes words) "I have the vision bro". He thinks he can changed the world I guess one good album and a sucky runway show at a time is not enough or some shit. Anywho Zuckerberg wouldn't give him money so now he's on to Trump cause well I guess he thought "It's a new world Zuckerberg" and Trump is where the money is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look the guy is a musical genius and getting the word out about the fuckery happening is great coming from someone the people will listen too the only problem is people only want to listen to his music and not his mouth run but can't blame a brother for trying right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my 2 cents sorry it's so long. Hell he could just be a nut job but his rant was the truth. So it got me interested. He sure does look drives out now though for sure.

       He asks her how everyone's doing, she volunteers the stuff about praying. She looks slightly awkward but that's to be expected when an interviewer's inquiring about a family member who's just been forcibly hospitalized in a psych ward. I like your theory otherwise, nice work.

       He was having clear mental health issues before he went to the hospital.

       He probably needed that tour financially, but there he was dropping the mic and leaving a concert after 2 songs or something. All attendees refunded. Probably cost Kanye hundreds of thousands of dollars, in addition to the lost profit from the concert.

       Why it is so hard to believe he's mentally ill, and perhaps
       <em>
        needed
       </em>
       to be institutionalized? Had he received proper treatment before that, it might not have been necessary. But apparently, it was. Not because he ranted about Hillary, but because he was

       Thing is, and I've seen this with a couple of friends, the problem is less about what they say than how/why/the manner in which they say it away from the norm. Passion and mental illness blend sometimes. Sure, he was anti-Hillary, and okie doke. But instead of just passionately expressing that, he went overboard into meltdown mode. More than likely, wacky, out-of-character stuff was happening in other areas of his life and relationships, but we only get to see what happened on stage. And if it weren't election season we might not have seen that, or we might have seen him go batshit on something else entirely.

       Do you really believe that addressing a forum with "shills" and "sheep" is how you wake up the masses? Most people that come here are out to seek info and knowledge. If you want to be an adult and have an adult conversation please continue. But if your agenda is to come here and spout your buzzwords no one is going to take you seriously. If you have something to contribute, by all means please do so.
