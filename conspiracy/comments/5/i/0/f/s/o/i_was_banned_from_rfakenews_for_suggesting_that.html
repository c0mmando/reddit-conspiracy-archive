    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you aren&#39;t a regular viewer of  Colbert&#39;s shows. He has always leaned Democratic.</p>

<p>His character on Comedy Central was totally making fun of Republicans. It was the whole point of the show.</p>

<p>Now that he does the late show he does target Trump in long segments on almost every show. However, he took plenty of shots at Hillary as well. He&#39;s a comedian. He makes a joke out of whatever strikes him and his writers as funny. </p>

<p>Real life isn&#39;t at all like the movies. The influence of the evil geniuses who run everything is enormous but it doesn&#39;t micro manage everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he shot himself in the foot with the Democratic Socialist thing. It definitely colored what I thought about him. Americans, at least those who are in the right generation, have been conditioned the socialism is bad. Cold war propaganda runs deep.</p>

<p>Yes, Bernie did have a fair number of supporters. His campaign was all about free stuff. Most people like free stuff... </p>

<p>As I remember Colbert took some whacks at Bernie too. He&#39;s an old guy who doesn&#39;t dress or keep himself groomed all that well. Plenty of ammunition for jokes.</p>

<p>Personally, I think that some form of cooperative Government is the way to go. Socialism and Communism have some good ideas. Capitalism is a little too predatory for my liking.</p>

<p>Seems to me that we need a totally new form of Government. Kinda like how the founding fathers wrote their own constitution. They took what they liked from other forums of Government and created new guidelines where they saw that it was appropriate. They did a great job but it&#39;s rooted in the understanding and mind set of the day. We need to rewrite everything and bring it up to modern times. </p>

<p>Sometimes the truth, especially when politics are involved, is more complex than we know. I will admit that there is most likely much that we citizens don&#39;t know about how things work at that level. </p>

<p>But Podesta writing jokes for Stephen Colbert on a daily basis is obviously just PURE FANTASY. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between believing Podesta writes for the Colbert, and seeing that there&#39;s a nameless group of people who speak through celebrities in order to further their own goals, and that among all celebs, Colbert is particularly controlled.</p>

Hello mods, I disagree with your ban. Would you please elaborate?
Note from the moderators: Trolling
There was no warning, no second chance, and an outright ban?
Trolling is in the eye of the beholder. Also I believe most if not all of my posts have been up-voted.
You surely know what my next steps will be, right?
I plan on telling <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that I have been banned from your sub-reddit.
I shall wait at least half a day though. I am not eager to become a martyr, but I have no problem becoming one.

<p>Ok, well I posted a whole bunch of good links on this sub-reddit before this one. I made a positive contribution to your channel.
How about getting rid of that one and reinstating my account?
