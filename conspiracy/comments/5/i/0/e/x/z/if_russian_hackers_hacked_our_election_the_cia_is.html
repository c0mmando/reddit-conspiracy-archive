       What if the CIA did NOT say that the Russians did it?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the government and their media mouthpieces are LYING about what the CIA said?
      </p>
      <p>
       Happened before:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>

         The CIA Just Declassified the Document That Supposedly Justified the Iraq Invasion
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thirteen years ago, the intelligence community concluded in a 93-page classified document used to justify the invasion of Iraq that it lacked "specific information" on "many key aspects" of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        But that's not what top Bush administration officials said during their campaign to sell the war to the American public. Those officials, citing the same classified document, asserted with no uncertainty that Iraq was actively pursuing nuclear weapons, concealing a vast chemical and biological weapons arsenal, and posing an immediate and grave threat to US national security.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       See? The government and media LIED about what the CIA
       <strong>
        <em>
         actually said
        </em>
       </strong>
       , and took us to war BASED ON THOSE LIES.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it happening again?

       If you look at the process from election through electoral college to confirmation, and you want to attack the process to derail the nominee...  the easiest avenue is to accuse the nominee of being influenced by a foreign power, and assert the nominee is unqualified. It's the main reason the electoral college even exists.... so the attacker can use that to their advantage. Also pretty hard to defend.

       On one hand, our technology increases at an insane pace when we get into a pissing contest with any world power.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, we have enough nukes on the planet to turn it into a pile of space debris if it were all set off at once, and we really don't need something stronger than nukes. Like anti-matter weapons(Anti-matter that blows up/releases energy just from contacting normal matter). Pls no.

       haha I know what antimatter is. I also hope that if we ever do get really good at creating it, we start building antimatter starships. Spread to the stars before we blow ourselves to hell. I don't think humanity would be easily erased from the planet, but civilization sure as hell would.

        War with who?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Last time the goal of the lying was gain popular support for an unjust war (Iraq). This time it looks like those that rule are seeking to tighten their grip on an increasingly insubordinate and audacious population who boldly and brashly question Authority..
      </p>
      <p>
       At the moment, it looks as if the intended goal is to prepare out minds and to gain popular assent for the nullification of a Presidential election - but the consequences of such an upheaval are VERY predictable - and may in turn be used to further yet another, larger goal:
      </p>
      <p>
       To divide the US populace into hostile, opposing groups, creating chaos, ripping the fabric of US society and shaking our present form of government - violent anarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only "solution" to such chaos, it seems, would be for government to don a new mask, and to step in with heavy-handed measures to "restore peace" through extreme repression and violence to put down "rebellious factions".
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem &gt; Reaction &gt; Solution. A new form of government is installed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course such a "revolution" here in the US would reverberate worldwide, and where it would go from there is anyone's guess.

       The plague would be the massive amount of people coming here to comment with &lt; 1 month old accounts not contributing any meaningful discussion aside from cuck, bitch, fag, SJW - you know who I'm talking about. The ones buying into the right/left bullshit and calling everyone pieces of shit and shills. Just look at people that comment under me, you'll find them.

       Instead of having any integrity whatseover, they double down on domestic surveillance, suppression, censorship, they attack and ridicule their own people, they infiltrate our communications medium where we are exercising our constitutionally-guaranteed rights to free speech and then either banning, shutting down, or harassing people into ragequitting, or even threatening them (which is illegal btw)
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of being a real Intelligence network, they are being teenage mean-girls and creepy cyberbullies like the pedos we're trying to hunt down.  They are acting like a sloppy 42 yr old neckbeard eating cheetos and typing with one hand as they troll people online

       Except that's not how it works.  The only people responsible for this hack are the hackers.   When there is an increase in crime cops are not fired, they hire more and increase funding.  When 9/11 happened they didn't fire the anti-terrorist people, they hired more and increased their funding by an order of magnitude.

        That's a comma splice after "rationally".

       I respect your opinions and I agree with you on a decent amount of things especially Pizzagate. However, I do believe pedophilia is rampant in DC just like in Hollywood and the Catholic Church. I just wanted to chime in because I have seen you on a lot of threads recently. I looked at your post history to see if you were maybe a paid shill. A problem that is really overblown here, in my opinion. I don't think you are but holy shit you are a negative, condescending person that spends a lot of time on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to ask anyone this and I try to be self-reflective about it as well because I do it too sometimes. What sort of enjoyment do you get out of belittling people that have different views than you? Even if they are crazy or misinformed. Conspiracy theorists are just as important as any other ideology. If you are searching for the truth than you need to be able to research all viewpoints and extract something out of all of it. From your post history it just seems like you spout left-wing style talking points and talk down to everyone else.

       Only in the past day. Look beyond my first page and you'll find I've only been posting sporadically. This is the first time I've really gone on a tear in months if not longer.
       <em>
        (Edit: OK, so I did also say some shit four, seven, eleven, and fourteen days ago. I guess this has been building).
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm definitely a bit of a dick on the internet. Though you might notice (as I've been noticing it in myself) I'm less of one as I actually converse with people. Part of the problem with the internet is that all too often you face caricatures of people instead of their full selves. I've been seeing various shit from The_Donald and I've been annoyed about the craziness of Pizzagate and it kind of boiled over today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of being a dick is that it's fun and reinforces my own sense of superiority (this is obviously operating at a subconscious level). I think I also find it dangerous and a bit scary to see something so divorced from reality manifest so strongly in people, especially because I believe it's partially egged along by Russia (it matches other patterns of Russian disinfo both within the nation and within European nations it tries to destabilize). So part of it is a raw emotional reaction of fear/anger on my part. I mean, there are some people that are really losing it here, and many of those people are becoming evangelicals, trying to spread it to as many people as possible. That's scary. This is really hurting people (and not just the workers at Comet Ping Pong, but the people who now have fallen into this marginalized reality that's horrifying to them and causes them to distrust people... and maybe worst of all, lose their taste for pizza).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another important part (on a more conscious level) is that I don't have a lot of faith that I can convince people. Logic doesn't work with conspiracy theorists, and it often fails to operate at all on the 'net when you have people approaching the issue from a completely different set of assumptions. So I'm not really trying to get them to change their minds. Instead I'm speaking to other users who are reading through the thread. The mocking and condescension reinforces their views while marginalizing Pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, if you'll read through my posts in chronological order, you'll also see I'm refining my arguments and for the most part doing some moderation of tone as well as speaking to how conspiracy theories come to exist in a way that (hopefully) functions as an actual response to conspiracy theorists. I know that simply trying to disprove a "fact" won't work, but maybe pointing out the general absurdity of the structure of the argument will help lay a framework that will stick in someone's mind and eventually cause them to question things.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, I'll agree with you that a lot of time I'm just being a dick. I like to think I'm better than that, but the truth is I'm flawed and I want to shout into the void. I also saw posts attacking elements of Pizzagate being upvoted, and that gave me hope that a tide might be turning.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while I did "cool story bro" one guy, if you read his post you'll see he was a real dick.

       Thanks for the reply. I do think bringing Russia into this is a conspiracy theory onto itself. There is no evidence Russia is behind Pizzagate just like there is no released hard evidence that Russia is behind any of the leaks. You even admit your evidence is circumstantial. A conspiracy theorist could use the same line of thinking and say that because Tony and John Podesta are good friends with and defend known pedophiles and buy artwork from artists who create pedophilia-flavored art. That is what motivates them to feel fear/anger towards Pizzagate and evangelize the theory. I would check your blindspots on those.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see a lot of left-wing confirmation biases being fed by the MSM and government in the same way I see conspiracy theorists being fed by the Alt. media. The former is a lot more scary as it could actually lead to an armed conflict with Russia. If they do release some real evidence that Russia is behind any of this than I will renounce everything I have said the past two days. As it stands, it is just another conspiracy theory to me. There is a lot of money to be made in a build up to war with Russia even if it never ends up happening. There are also a lot of opportunities for power grabs as we are seeing politicians start to create ministry of truth-type apparatuses to tag "Russian propaganda". Conspiracy subs are the only place I can go where they are actually discussing these things. The government doesn't need to censor anything. All they need to do is claim something is Russian propaganda and the people will police themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see the dems on r/politics have started to radicalize more and more as we get closer to the inauguration. We should all fear that more than some conspiracy theorists on the fringe. The right has already been radicalized. We could really see a civil war in our lifetime.

       I don't think Russia is behind it all (I do think PG was an organic conspiracy theory), but I do think Russia eggs shit like this on. [Here's an example of their action in Sweden, which sounds very familiar](

       Basically, Russia seeks to undermine faith in all politicians, so that one might as well be as good as the other.

       I don't think Russia thought Trump would win, but I absolutely believe they were influencing the election. I think

       No one hacked the election.  Wikileaks released verified E mails implicating certain people were cheating and attempting to manipulate the electiom with the media and DNC connection.  Dont loose sight this whole conversation is a ploy by Democrats as to who told they were cheating lets blame the Russians.  Its not hacking an election its blowing the whistle on corruption. There is no proof where wikileaks got  their information or if Russia was culpable.  This Russia Hack crap was already debunked during the election, two months ago.   The recall failed and do its another DNC, MSM ploy to denigrate Trumps campaign.

       Well someone hacked the e-mails, unless Podesta leaked them himself. No one is saying the Russians "hacked" and magically altered our elections. The claim is that they hacked Podesta's email, and released them to Wikileaks to influence our election.

       It's valid to point out, as your question can be open to the interpretation that any of these allegations involve hacking or manipulating the actual electronic a d paper voting system.  It's important that we don't get that confused.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the voting, yes the individual states have the logistical and financial responsibility of managing these events.  There can also be federal financial aid granted to states for this purpose, but I'm not sure of the specifics on this.  Of course there is also some oversight on the federal level, but again this is going to vary depending on what if any intelligence a group may have, as well as how much it falls into their mandate.

       And all the polling stations are staffed by whom?  Volunteers?  I've seen demonstrations before showing how ridiculously easy it is to hack these machines if you have physical access to them.  How difficult would it be for some hypothetical motivated hackers to gain access to them and reprogram them?

       Well, in MY neck of the woods then tend to be members of the local/city/county level government.  They may or may not be elected officials, and they may or may not be paid positions.  This stuff varies at a county level across the entire country, so I can't really give you an answer there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the models of digital machines (which are only used in some areas of the country, and have vastly differing dates of manufacture and hardware/software involved) have differing levels of vulnerability.  Like most devices with touchscreens, some models have "hidden buttons" to access admin settings of some kind.  Many of them don't, and access requires some manipulation of the internals.  I have not seen anything showing that someone can access settings on one of these without physical intrusion and cause any impact on vote results, but if someone has a source I'd check it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I can speak comprehensively, in my opinion (and I have worked in it, network security, and somewhat related hardware) doing anything other than essentially breaking a device that you have physical access to would be quite hard (any settings you are likely to be able to access would cause an obvious result of a malfunctioning device, if anything).  Manipulating the vote results from a device you had physical access to would be extremely hard, if not impossible.  Manipulating a device that you do not have physical access to should be considered effectively impossible, as most of these devices don't do networking like normal, if at all.

       I was thinking more about gaining access to the code, rewriting it to say flip every 17th vote to Trump,  and then reflashing the machines with the new source code.    Wouldn't something like that be possible in states like Pennsylvania and Florida which have electronic voting and no paper trail?

       Theoretically?  Maybe.  That's not so much manipulating the existing software but completely rewriting it.  The existing software doesn't operate within any kind of parameters to allow something like that.  It would be ridiculously obvious, I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it could brick the machine.  Think of it like rooting a phone; you can do it identically on 10 devices and it might not work on all.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would also have to overwrite it to output the data in the same method, which especially if the machine gets hookup up to another device or network after voting would require very very specific knowledge or guesswork.  And again, even if all of this did work you've only manipulated a single machine.  There's absolutely no way you'd be able to pull off something like that on these machines remotely, they don't have the technological capabilities to allow it.

       Yeah, I realise that they are not networked and they would need physical access to the machines, but most polling stations are in schools and churches, so not exactly high security locations.   To have any significant effect you would have to physically access and reprogram hundreds of machines.   I guess that is fairly unlikely.     How about at the state level where they do the final tabulations?   Could that be an easier or more likely place to be hacked?

       I don't live in an area that uses the digital machines, so I haven't seen how they're housed and secured.  Can't really comment.  However were still talking about likely physical intrusion and obvious software tampering to have any effect.  The amount of effort you would have to invest to swing the votes in just one state is NOTHING compared to the cost and return of a propaganda campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the state level systems: Oh god no.  At that point you're getting involved with systems that have active countermeasures, archives of backups, and system logs.  Half of the systems probably aren't even on a public network (one connected to the internet) because there would be no need for them to be and it's the first step in keeping a system secure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it's in the realm of possibility, but only just.

       Yeah, in all reality tampering with electronic voting machines to an extent where you can produce a noticeable swing in even one state would require a ridiculous amount of effort.  I don't consider it a very likely possibility when as I said there are more conventional ways to manipulate voters directly.

      <p>
       People can talk about vote tampering all they like, but the electronic systems in their current state are substantially more secure than paper votes which can be destroyed or duplicated.

       Basically you gave the correct answer to your own question. There is no 3 letter agency, congress makes the laws stating the conditions that must be meet for secure polling but the implementation is each state's responsibility and the operation is the responsibility of the district judge that presides over that district.

       The world and this country would be a better place without the CIA and intelligence services.  I don't understand how they are democratic in any way.  They make foreign policy decisions on behalf of a country with no transparent process or motives.  They were created a long time after this country was born and there are no checks and balances that are meaningful.  I can't in any way see the founders okayING them

       This doesn't make sense in this context (though many agree with the 2nd).
      </p>
      <p>
       1st it is very likely that Russia was behind Guccifer 2 and the first DNC leak. There was substantial evidence looking at the detected rootkits, only the russian services use.
      </p>
      <p>
       But releasing source documents of criminal wrong doing is not really "hacking a election". It's more a service to the world to prevent from the ongoing corrupt and criminal practices. Well done if so.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what is more likely is that not Guccifer 2 was the source for the wikileaks DNC leaks. More likely a DNC staffer. Guccifer 2 had not that much impact and Guccifer 1 even less, even if he got the best documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       So russian hackers didn't hack the elections, leakers = insiders did. Via wikileaks, which was much more successful than Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they CIA is technically not lying, just spinning. As always. The biggest problem is still media which is not questioning those spins.

       I think we're tunneling too hard on bits and pieces. There's a bigger picture here and I believe it has to do with some inter agency war going on. CIA vs FBI vs NSA (?).

       I've been thinking that the inter-agency conflict is what's driving this and not being reported on.  I think old-guard CIA is firmly in the cold-warrior / anti-russia / pro-hillary camp.  The NSA likely has dirt on everybody and is using that to push control where they want.  I think the FBI is less pro-trump more anti-corruption and also wants more power -- hence the big push for software backdoors in phones / apple iphone dustup.

       The CIA wasn't protecting DNC and RNC infrastructure, or at least they shouldn't have been.  Political parties must have the ability to communicate away from the eyes of government agencies.  Such communications are protected by the first amendment.

       Funny how the narrative has gone from "Russia swayed the election by influencing our media" to straight up "Russia hacked the election". Even if I were to buy into that bullshit (actual fake news) narrative, of course Russia wanted Trump as president. If it were Clinton, the threat of WW3 would be all too real.

       Maybe the whole narrative by the MSM is simply to try to save face after acting like Trump would lose. Maybe step 1 is stop viewing those in power as genius criminal masterminds are start viewing them as average people who don't ever think that far ahead.

       There's a difference between "Russia", "Russian Hackers" and "Russian Government". Notice how they're pointing the finger at "Russia" people in Russia try to "Hack" the US every day. They're being awful vague about it and aren't directly pointing the finger at the Russian Government because they'd have to have some evidence and they don't.

       The are mixing words. The word "hacked" is being used to describe the leaking of information. Whether it was a Russian hacker or that DNC kid that got whacked in Washington that leaked info, it doesn't matter. To the lay person when they hear "hacked", it goes beyond the leak, they start thinking election fraud, voting machines edited....etc. Purposeful misdirection by the entire main stream media. Makes me sick

       It wasn't russian hackers, it was mercenary hackers hired by the russians.   They should be found, tried for treason, and hung in the washington mall.  Nothing anyone likes to see more than a row of treasonous hackers swinging in the breeze.

       Russian hackers didn't hack the "elections", they hacked John Podesta's email. The CIA wasn't in charge of securing his email account. The CIA is however in charge of finding out who hacked Podesta's email.

       Except that's not how it works.  The only people responsible for this hack are the hackers.   When there is an increase in crime cops are not fired, they hire more and increase funding.  When 9/11 happened they didn't fire the anti-terrorist people, they hired more and increased their funding by an order of magnitude.

       Instead of having any integrity whatseover, they double down on domestic surveillance, suppression, censorship, they attack and ridicule their own people, they infiltrate our communications medium where we are exercising our constitutionally-guaranteed rights to free speech and then either banning, shutting down, or harassing people into ragequitting, or even threatening them (which is illegal btw)
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of being a real Intelligence network, they are being teenage mean-girls and creepy cyberbullies like the pedos we're trying to hunt down.  They are acting like a sloppy 42 yr old neckbeard eating cheetos and typing with one hand as they troll people online
