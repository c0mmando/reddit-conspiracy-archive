       Alright boys and girls, I know you're going through Hillary withdrawal now that she's irrelevant but don't despair! There are more conspiracies to explore. I’m being crushed by the weight of the evidence in this juicy conspiracy theory.  It has everything: corrupt government elites, secret plots, false flags, secret societies, war crimes, and state-run media.  Unfortunately there are more leads than I can possibly follow alone but I’ve put together an outline of what we know and what needs to be explored.  Just 4 years after Mitt Romney called Russia the US’s greatest geo-political foe, Donald Trump has praised Russia and disparaged NATO and other US allies at every opportunity.  No political consultant, adviser, or campaign manager could have possibly told him this would be a wise line to take politically, so… why’d he do it?  Why are he and the Kremlin the only ones denying Russian involvement in the DNC hacks?
      </p>

      <p>
       The Trump-Russian Conspiracy Theory:
      </p>
      <p>
       US sanctions have devastated the financial and real estate holdings of the Russian Oligarchy which controls the vast majority of Russia’s wealth.  Putin alone is estimated to have accumulated $40 Billion since rising to power.  Trump is reportedly very friendly with Aras Agalarov, another Russian oligarch, and members of his family.  One theory is that they made Trump a huge financial offer and could have promised him a stake in the $500 Billion Deal between Russia and Exxon that was forced to be cancelled after the US imposed sanctions.  There are hundreds of other ways to make a ton of money illegally by becoming POTUS too so I won’t spend much time on this.  The other theory is that Russia compromised Trump with damning evidence of something that would destroy him if revealed.  A retired Western Intelligence Officer who is reportedly very well-trusted by US intelligence agencies says he came across correspondence that proves this is true
       <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump">
        according to Mother Jones.
       </a>
       -He says Trump was compromised 5 years ago, and they made him entertain a bid for the White House in 2012 to assess his chances.  They also presumably encouraged his public advocacy for the Birther Theory during this time.  Although there is evidence of this, I suspect the first theory is more likely.  We know how much The Donald loves making deals and this would have been the biggest deal of his lifetime, possibly the biggest deal ever made in history.  He helps Russian interests: withdraws military support from Japan, South Korea, and Germany… gets out of the way in Syria… lifts sanctions on oligarchs, turns a blind eye to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its human rights abuses, etc  and in return they help him win the White House and he gets nearly unlimited fame and wealth – a narcissist’s dream come true.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of these connections appear to be illegal on their face but the overwhelming number of them, juxtaposed with Trump’s complete denials, made dozens of times throughout the campaign, of

       connection to Russia makes it seem incredibly suspicious.  In 2008, Trump told NBC news that he was friends with Putin.  Fast forward 7 years and he makes the absurd claim:
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3714527/Putin-begged-meet-Trump-2013-Miss-Universe-left-disappointed-billionaire-arrived-late-Russian-oligarch-s-daughter-deliver-gift-instead.html">
        “I don’t know who Putin is.”
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has expressed interest in building a Trump tower in Moscow for decades but many say his real financial ties with Russia have to do with the many Russian investors his company relies on.  Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,” Trump’s son, Donald Jr., told a real estate conference in 2008 “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia”
      </p>
      <p>
       During the campaign, a group of computer scientists began monitoring activity from a suspicious server located in Trump Tower that was seemed to be communicating with two banks in Russia: Alfa Bank and SVB bank. With the
       <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html">
        information they gathered,
       </a>
       they could not conclusively draw any conclusion but said that it definitely appears to be evidence of a back-and forth correspondence and the possibility that the logs were forged or an anomaly was

        practically zero.
       </a>
       Two different members of the Russian Foreign Ministry, spokeswoman Maria Zakharova and deputy foreign minister Sergei Rybakov,  said after the election that they had been in

       Putin’s daughters are both married to high-level officials in Gazprom, an energy company that Trump’s former campaign advisors Carter Page and Paul Manafort are both heavily invested in.  Carter Page is

       </a>
       and that’s basically why he had to step down in his official capacity from the campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump appeared on Infowars last December where Alex Jones credited Trump for miraculously

        predicting a coup in Turkey

       days before Russia released satellite images showing just that.  It should also be noted Trump has business interests in Istanbul.  It will be reported by Newsweek tomorrow that Erdogan has now had those business partners arrested and blamed for aiding said coup.  Not sure exactly what's going on here but seems nefarious any way you cut it.

       And, apparently, like Trump you don't read.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's everywhere man. Trump is a Russian plant. It's why he won't release his tax forms. They show payments by high ranking Russian Government Officials. It's why he is appointing so many 'Friends of Russia' to his government.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is why he delayed announcing his alleged plan to separate himself from his business.
      </p>
      <p>
       He can't do any of those things without revealing that he is an actual puppet of Putin.

       The evidence is everywhere. Start reading.

       Are you deflecting from Trump's trips on the pedo express with Epstein? That's what you seem to be doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump and Pence (especially Pence) are huge parts of pizzagate and raping children. They should be called to justice just as sure as anyone. Their guilt hangs over them like a cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump once complimented Epstein, saying "He like the same kinds of girls as I do. Young."
      </p>
      <p>
       Quit deflecting and answer this.

       No, I'm asking for your evidence. Because as it stands, all you have are accusations (without evidence).. Now, where is your evidence? Why are you incapable of backing them up? That is the more important question. Like I said, you have a very interesting comment/account history ;)

       Probably, but let's not metaphorically shoot the messenger, makes for a weak response.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory presented by the OP does sound plausible. But I also think our horrible 2-party system makes it difficult to analyze things without any fearful bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that since it's nigh impossible to get most people to vote outside of the 2-party system, it came down to either Trump or Hillary. So you then get millions of people who are
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       familiar with the Clintons' long history of corruption, including long, mysterious trails of dead bodies, on top of everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       And at the same time, most people didn't really know much of anything about Trump, and then the MSM in all of their childish glory wasn't able to offer up any criticism of Trump beyond taking current words out of context and trying to spin him as a homophobe, racist, misogynist, etc and most of the nation wasn't falling for it anymore, those cards have been way over-played by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it makes a lot of sense that Trump won, even if the Podesta leaks had never happened, which is why it's ridiculous, the notion that those leaks single-handedly cost Hillary the election. Not even close.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now that Trump has won the presidency and is filling out his cabinet choices, let's welcome theories and criticisms of the person who is about to assume a lot power over our nation's future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's make a genuine effort to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       throw away the better parts of conspiracy theory thinking just because some among us are emotionally attached to a political figure.

       What was?  There's a number of possible explanations for why someone in DHS could have portscanned a Georgia voter-roll.  It could be what's called penetration testing and is what DHS would do to check on their security.  If any department would be doing that I'd assume it would be homeland security.  The reason the intelligence agencies wanted to make a statement about Russia before the election was so states could respond by bolstering their election processes.  The federal government already has a database of all citizens and voter rolls so it would be pretty silly of them to do a port scan in order to obtain any info.  Of course it could be a lone actor in the US government too, or an infected computer, or a foreign spy.  That is interesting though, hopefully they bring it up when they hold hearings.

       What exactly is the difference?  That's like saying there is a difference between America and the United States.  Russia is an authoritative regime so I feel confident saying that this type of deal, if true, would definitely not happen without Putin's knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       It very well could be that Trump really is putting America first by moving towards a less interventionist foreign policy and Russia helped because his policies would be more favorable but it still seems weird that is is surrounding himself with so many people tied to oil/energy interests in Russia, denying any connections, and bluntly saying the CIA is wrong about Russia.  But again, it could all be innocent.  Maybe he just has a fragile ego and resents the notion that he may have had any help in winning.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with him backtracking on his promise to establish a blind trust for his business and not taking briefings because he thinks they're boring, it doesn't seem like he's putting the country first.

       They attacked our democratic system and those of many of our European allies.  They murder dissenters, control their media, and make homosexuality a crime.  They invade their neighbors (Georgia and Crimea) who aren't strong enough to resist.  They are not America's friend and if Trump accepted help from them in any way to win the election, he should be hanged for treason.

       Donald Trump is as corrupt as they come.

      <p>
       He is not just part of the Swamp. He is the Chief Gardener.

       Trump has yet to reveal anything about his taxes. He swore he would announce divestment of his companies, and then declined the day before.

       Trump is hiding something.
