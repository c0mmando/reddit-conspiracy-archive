        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>While reviewing the franklin scandal again, I remembered that Paul Bonacci had said that he was forced to participate in a pornographic snuff film that was directed by Hunter S. Thompson. When I first heard this, I thought &quot;wow, that&#39;s crazy&quot; and moved on. But the other day something caught my eye that made me reconsider this detail. In the Wikileaks Global Intelligence Files, there is a deranged sounding email from one David McCuller ranting about how he wants to marry Barbara Bush, and how he blew up the pentagon and WTC buildings with Dubya, among other things:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/34/348460_re-gray-if-you-ever-so-much-as-criticize-me-again-i-will.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/34/348460_re-gray-if-you-ever-so-much-as-criticize-me-again-i-will.html</a></p>

<p>This email is coming from someone who is clearly unhinged, and the people responding to him treat it that way, but he definitely says several things that ring of true events, albeit coming through a distorted filter. Then I saw the line &quot;You&#39;re not going to smoke my pineal gland&quot; and I suddenly remembered that in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas there is a scene where they talk about getting high from human glands:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHbuaED5TwYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHbuaED5TwYouTube</a></p>

<p>Dr. Gonzo starts talking about how he got a client that is a SATANISM FREAK who couldn&#39;t pay him with money, and gave him an ounce of pure adrenochrome instead, which they then go on to say is only possible to get by extracting it out of a living human. Gonzo then talks about how his client is being accused of CHILD MOLESTATION and might try to rip out his pineal gland if he didn&#39;t accept the offer. They then talk about getting extract of human pineal and what would happen if they took it, and Dr. Gonzo says you would turn into something out of medical encyclopedia, and then he transforms into a demon. There is also an earlier scene in which a group of well dressed lizards have a blood orgy. Watching this film again with the knowledge of Hunter&#39;s connection to Bohemian Grove, satanism and child trafficking gives it a whole new meaning. It may be a much more literal depiction of reality than it seems upon first viewing.</p>

<p>So we know that these people are sacrificing children, eating the bodies, drinking the blood and worshipping dark gods. But why? I think this is the question that everyone investigating pizzagate is burning to know the answer to. Why would someone commit the most vile and atrocious crimes against humanity for promises from disembodied entities that may not even be real? Well, Hunter may be telling us indirectly that these entities may not be so disembodied after all, at least to them.</p>

<p>Anyone who has done any research into DMT knows that it is a ubiquitous aspect of the experience to have contact with non-physical entities, regardless of whether you believe they are real or not. I think it&#39;s very possible that these people are not only drinking human blood to stay younger, but eating human pineal (and other) glands in order to have intense psychedelic trips that bring about the experience of communicating with dark &quot;gods&quot;. Their agenda is not only to control the masses through occult knowledge, but for the few in the ruling class to reach ultimate spiritual enlightenment. The all seeing eye on the pyramid that we know so well is the symbol of this goal, but the all seeing eye, also called the eye of horus, is the symbol of the pineal gland as well. The third eye is a spiritual concept, but it also literally refers to a piece of our anatomy. Considering everything that I&#39;ve learned in the past few months, I would say that it is not at all a stretch to assume that the rulers may have learned something about how to have the ultimate drug trip that the rest of us are too human to ever have any knowledge of.</p>

<p>If anyone has any more info on rituals that involve eating specific body parts for a specific effect, it may be worth looking in to.</p>

<p>but eating human pineal (and other) glands in order to have intense psychedelic trips that bring about the experience of communicating with dark &quot;gods&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few thoughts. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>One, how much DMT is in a single pineal gland?</p></li>
<li><p>Two, eating a pineal gland is a shitty way to get DMT. Why? Because the monoamine oxidase enzyme in your gut metabolizes monoamines (like DMT) while still inside your digestive system.</p></li>
<li><p>The only way to make DMT orally active is to first ingest some sort of MAO inhibitor. Interestingly enough, there are a number of botanical compounds that do this.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now for a personal theory (yeah I know, here he goes again... roll your eyes)</p>

<p>In the Bible (bear with me for a moment) it says that God told Adam and Eve they could have every fruit except for the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s also referred to as the tree growing in the center of the garden.</p>

<p>So what if this is a metaphor? I suggest that the tree of knowledge is a fancy way of describing the human nervous system. The motor and sensory nerves are the roots. Spinal cord equals the trunk and the brain is the leaves/branches. Your body is the garden and your brain is the tree at the center of the garden. The pineal gland is the fruit growing on the tree.</p>

<p>The pineal gland is a pine cone shaped gland centrally located in your brain. The ancients knew about the pineal gland too. </p>

<p>So maybe we have a warning not to mess around with the pineal gland. On one hand, it has something to do with godlike knowledge and higher levels of awareness. On the other hand, serious negative consequences go along with this knowledge.</p>

<p>I could speculate and take this even further, but I want to hear what other people think about this idea first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of eating body parts for their effect on the diner is a common and ancient one. Eating a lions heart was supposed to confer courage and strength in some sub-Saharan African tribes and I&#39;m sure people have experimented with eating all kinds of things to see what happens..</p>

<p>A few thousand years ago, when taboos about taking human life and cannibalism didn&#39;t really exist, it&#39;s practically certain that people ate bits of other people for exactly this reason.</p>

<p>We know Neanderthals and early humans ate each other; there&#39;s lots of evidence for that. And it may actually work. Wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if the explosion of human consciousness about 40k years ago was the result of dining on Neanderthal brains?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mammals are different from many other animals. We don&#39;t do well with cannibalism. Perhaps it&#39;s because we&#39;re descended from herbivores. Engaging in cannibalism puts us at risk for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jun/19/research.science3">autoimmune</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/09/06/482952588/when-people-ate-people-a-strange-disease-emerged">prion</a> diseases.</p>

<p>So no, it isn&#39;t as simple as all that.</p>

<p>Also, you forget that our &quot;life&quot; as multicellular organisms consists of the collaboration of trillions of beings within us. Understandably, every one of them is willing to die to preserve the whole, just like with any other multicellular organism. That seems to give the survival of the whole a sort of primordial sanctity, does it not?</p>

<p>I mean, why would life exist at all if the universe wasn&#39;t selecting for it? Self-reproducing forms are the most selectable forms in nature because <em>reproduction is selected for</em>. This is so basic it might not be obvious but inanimate matter can also go through reproductive cycles with far less specificity. Life is a whole new threshold of resolution and specificity in reproduction. Perhaps you think that insanely complex chemical beings such as us are no more important than the relatively elementary rock on which we walk, but I would argue there is quite a clear divide that has nothing to do with religion, and everything to do with the most basic laws of nature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No lunch is free. </p>

<p>This reminds me of the story of General Butt Naked. General Butt Naked was a guy who fought in the Liberian Civil War. He and his men were known for eating humans and running into battle naked. He claims that one day before a battle, he ate a child&#39;s heart for spiritual protection against bullets. Right after he ate the heart, he had a psychedelic experience where a man and woman made of light visited him and told him to change his life. </p>

<p>After that battle, he turned to Christ. He is now an evangelist pastor in Liberia, helping former soldiers to become better people. </p>

<p>His whole story is quite fascinating. I first heard of him from this Vice documentary:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRuSS0iiFyo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRuSS0iiFyo</a> his segment starts atht e29 min mark, although the whole video is worth watching. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Liberia is the edgiest of all their pieces. The Sewers of Columbia was terrifying in it&#39;s own way, but there&#39;s something about a lot of that stuff in Liberia where you know that one wrong turn and they could have turned West Point into a huge riot over the group of rich Westerners.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Once symptoms set in [for the Papua New Guineans], it was a swift demise. First, they&#39;d have trouble walking, a sign that they were about to lose control over their limbs. They&#39;d also lose control over their emotions, which is why people called [kuru] the &quot;laughing death.&quot; Within a year, they couldn&#39;t get up off the floor, feed themselves or control their bodily functions.&quot;</p>

<p>This kind of sounds like HRC&#39;s symptoms of illness throughout the presidential campaign, except for the timeline.  I wonder how much Western medicine could help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. A couple of points.</p>

<p>1) you think bacteria and other ultra-simple life forms in our bodies are &#39;willing&#39; to die for the good of their host? </p>

<p>First, they don&#39;t have that kind of cognitive ability. At all times they are responding, without the luxury of choice, to biochemical signals that trigger specific reactions.</p>

<p>Secondly, the notion that they&#39;re choosing to act to preserve the host organism is clearly false. Not just because they&#39;re not capable of that, but because the system within which they exist is dictating the terms of their existence. They are able to live and reproduce in that system well enough to ensure the continuation of their genetic material. That&#39;s all.</p>

<p>So no, I do not accept there&#39;s some kind of inherent sanctity of life by that argument.</p>

<p>2) regarding the idea that the universe selects for reproduction.</p>

<p>Reproduction selects for reproduction. If you look into the origins of life, as our current understanding goes, you&#39;ll see that a particular set of geochemical circumstances enabled the development of extremely simple organisms, which, incredibly slowly, evolved into the life we know today.</p>

<p>We&#39;re essentially biological machines that, like the bacteria mentioned earlier, respond in set ways to given stimuli. There&#39;s plenty of neurological evidence emerging that suggests our thoughts, while they may seem &#39;real&#39;, are actually ghosts or images thrown up by deeper processes in the mind. Google &#39;does free will exist&#39; if you want to know more about this. </p>

<p>The reason I mentioned the strong anthropic principle should be obvious now. Your argument is essentially the same - that the existence of complex life implies the universe wanted there to be complex life. There&#39;s no good reason to say that, and it is a circular argument. </p>

<p>1) you think bacteria and other ultra-simple life forms in our bodies are &#39;willing&#39; to die for the good of their host?</p>

<p>You assume to know a lot about something the cutting edge is <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352289515300370">just beginning to understand</a>. </p>

<p>Scientists are discovering that the microbiome is an indicator of one&#39;s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19901833">obesity risk via direct influence on metabolic factors such as insulin resistance</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A microbiota with greater energy extraction efficiency resulted in less energy left over in feces and greater levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the cecum. Furthermore, when the luminal constants from the ceca of obese or lean mice were provided to lean germ-free recipients, the mice receiving the microbes from obese donors gained more weight in a 2-week period than recipients of the lean microbes, despite equivalent food intakes [3].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The microbiome is being considered as a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352289515300370">direct determining factor in the makeup of our personality</a> through a complex interface with the CNS via interactions in the ENS (enteric nervous system), a complex of nervous, immune and neuroendocrine cells in the gut that is specifically designed for this interface and easily rivals the complexity of the CNS:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The general scaffolding of the brain-gut-microbiota axis (BGM) includes the central nervous system (CNS), the neuroendocrine and
neuroimmune systems, the sympathetic and parasympathetic arms
of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the enteric nervous system
(ENS) and most importantly the intestinal microbiota (Mayer,
2011). These components interact to form a complex reflex
network with afferent fibers that project to integrative CNS
structures and efferent projections to the smooth muscle (Grenham
et al., 2011). Through this bidirectional communication network,
signals from the brain can influence the motor, sensory and
secretory modalities of the gut and conversely, visceral messages
from the gut can influence brain function (Grenham et al., 2011;
Montiel-Castro et al., 2013).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you&#39;ve the wrong idea of what &quot;will&quot; as we normally conceive of it is. You assume that there is no will among unwitting actors, yet our brain cells are clearly unwitting actors that, as you say, merely react to their surrounding environment. So do we humans exact a larger will as groups by coming together in response to our environments. We can either completely eliminate the idea of will according to your precepts, or accept that what we originally thought to be the will of a single entity is a complex lattice of relationships among simpler organisms.</p>

<p>They are all striving for that complexity that we are both talking about. It is inherently and obviously categorical in the world around us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re essentially biological machines that, like the bacteria mentioned earlier, respond in set ways to given stimuli. There&#39;s plenty of neurological evidence emerging that suggests our thoughts, while they may seem &#39;real&#39;, are actually ghosts or images thrown up by deeper processes in the mind. Google &#39;does free will exist&#39; if you want to know more about this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have looked into this concept a good deal. Again, this becomes a matter of semantics. You can take this incredibly complex predisposing of billions of things to certain actions by the influence of their environs and use it as an excuse to discount the idea of will altogether, or you can expand your definitions and allow for new understandings of what will is.</p>

<p>I strongly support revising the concept of will to incorporate what we now understand it to be, rather than discard it for not being what we thought it was.</p>

<p>You seem to think, however, that it is much better to avoid deriving any sort of ontological meaning out of what we study, yes? I find this to be a sophistical economy of human thinking that assumes that thinking of these things to any level of abstraction that isn&#39;t tied slavishly to the data holds some sort of innate foolishness that divests it of any credibility. On the contrary, I think that the extremely complex calculations that you yourself referred to that our subconscious uses in the judgment process lends more, not less, credence to the idea of the innate value of the Will concept.</p>

<p>This is a statement of my argument, and I presume we will choose to disagree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the existence of complex life implies the universe wanted there to be complex life. There&#39;s no good reason to say that, and it is a circular argument.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely disagree that there is no good reason to say that. Again, the strong anthropological argument&#39;s fallaciousness hinges on the specificity of what it considers selected for. I am not talking about any particular being&#39;s mandate from heaven to spread complexity in the world, by looking at its situation at any one time in the world. I suppose what my argument really hinges on is the concept of the Will, as the ultimate unwitting actors are those atoms and their constituents that make up all activity in the universe. You can struggle to strip the meaning from all of this movement by attempting to erase the idea of Will altogether, as you are doing, but I find this to be a pedantic compromise in our ability to understand the world, and that there is <em>every reason</em> to say that complexity is the end-product of this universe by merit of the  progression from extremely simple and homogenous matter to the extremely complex self-reproducing forms and patterns that we see all around on our planet today.</p>

<p>At the end of it, I do realize that this argument is circular. I would argue that the same can be said for the argument that this world is aimless. Yet, this &quot;aimlessness&quot; has provided a profound consistency of form and function that I feel brings the burden of proof to the door of the nihilist.</p>

<p>And I do think it is nihilistic to conflate the concept of determinism with an ousting of any larger contextual meaning to events. It completely robs us of the right to even attempt understanding of the world around us. You presume a utilitarian superiority with this slavish adherence to logical consistency, when there are certain things that can be arrived at in non-linear fashions, much as is done in the substrata of the human subconscious. </p>

<p>Still, a well-constructed argument. I can admire the architecture even if the implication of it is not to my liking or, really, of use to anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Microbiome stuff was interesting, but wouldn&#39;t really clash with my view of the human organism as a system of interacting systems. &#39;Net output&#39; in terms of conscious awareness is still the consequence of processes of which the individual is unaware but impelled by, and even if one of those is an interaction between gut flora and nervous system it doesn&#39;t really alter the broader picture of an organism acting as a function of the totality of it&#39;s own biochemistry. </p>

<p>Oh, but I didn&#39;t say the world was aimless. Or rather, I suspect a fundamental aspect of the universe may be precisely intentionality. Which is both a necessary consequence of what I described above, and the very opposite of nihilism. The human mind interacts with the world in very intriguing ways..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Fundamental aspect of the universe [that] may be precisely intentionality&quot;? What does that mean? It doesn&#39;t sound very different from my interpretation, that there are clear trends that suggest a common intentionality of the universe as a whole.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to call it intentionality if you don&#39;t want to. Perhaps you could just call it the Shape of Space. A 4-wheeled vehicle was an inevitability on this planet, because a rectangle has the best distribution of force in a driving scenario, with the minimal number of wheels. Obviously we built some variations for larger and heavier scales, but those exceptions are only a limitation of our <em>materials</em>, not the <em>design</em>.</p>

<p>And Design is what I suppose I&#39;d call it. We can create things, but only within the limitations of the space reality has granted us. We didn&#39;t invent 2+2=4, we discovered it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That only defines a time frame.  In fact Sapiens often overtook older sites.  Within decades or centuries of neanderthal occupation.  There is no technology with a small enough error range to detect if the neanderthals cracked the bones, or wether Sapiens did a few decades later. Pure supposition. Within that narrow time frame.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, violence existed, cannibalism, likely, just no evidence to back it (as i asked before, link any pertinent links)  in my opinion, there is no confirmed, and very little supporting argument either way.</p>

<p>As far as &quot;lots&quot; lots of evidence (no links like i asked to back your idea, just an anecdote)  the first 2 google answers are contradictory at best.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re being deliberately disingenuous. There are plenty of sites that were exclusively occupied by Homo sapiens without ever being used by Neanderthals. The rest of your argument collapses at that point. </p>

<p>But I&#39;ll also point out that it&#39;s quite rare that you can&#39;t stratigraphically associate artefacts with each other. So you might find split Neanderthal bones, evidence of Homo sapiens occupation and some stone tools known to have been used by h sapiens at the time, all in the same layer of an excavation. </p>

<p>This is how the majority of artefacts are initially assessed and its the principle used to build chronologies of activity at any site. Absolute dates come from scientific dating techniques, but relative dating within a site is established by stratigraphy. It&#39;s also very clear from stratigraphical evidence when a site has been reused by several groups in rapid succession, and also when there&#39;s been a significant gap. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re not prepared to go past the first two google hits in your research, I&#39;m not going to do the legwork for you. (Edit: the links you did find show clearly that the idea of h sapiens eating Neanderthals is well enough explored to have made it to the Guardian website. It&#39;s not 100% certain, in the same way almost anything you can say about events 75,000 years ago has a degree of uncertainty. But it is at the very least extremely probable.) I did give you the hint that you needed to be looking for academic sources. There are many journal articles that will support everything I&#39;ve said. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll just say in this context that I spent quite a lot of time studying hominid evolution, and specifically h sapiens/Neanderthal interaction, in an academic context and I&#39;m fairly sure of my ground on this subject..</p>

<p>Im not purposely antagonizing you.  Im just thinking that you can argue and claim sources, yet produce nothing concrete.

<p>I believe this is actually a common misconception brought about by Movies and Television, with most people with sensory disabilities not demonstrating any significant increases in their other senses.</p>

<p>It’s thought that they may simply perceive their other senses are better due to their lack of another sense, but that quantitatively being blind doesn’t make your hearing improve, our brains just make it seem like it does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would think it&#39;s like a computer. Yeah you may have a webcam active, but the computer takes a small performance hit for every input device active. Our brains only have so much power, and every sensory input requires brainpower to make sense of. There are thousands of calculations per second based on our visual input alone, so not having that input would free the area of your brain responsible for visual input and interpretation for other tasks maybe. I&#39;m not sure if this is actually how it works, just a theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All assumptions, thought that was obvious lol same as your assumption (or theory I guess) that chimps eat brains because they contain the pineal gland and they&#39;re getting high or its having some effect on them or whatever your assumption was. </p>

<p>It could be true, but more likely they eat the brain because it&#39;s high in fat and nutrients, same as why things like bears prefer the brain and liver. The animal goes for the most calorie dense areas first, because they don&#39;t know how long they&#39;ll be able to feast on the kill. It could rot before they fully consume it, or another animal may come along and chase them away. </p>

<p>But like you said... assumptions assumptions ;) pretty much the entire basis of this subreddit IMO. Not saying making assumptions and speculating is Inherently wrong, so long as it&#39;s a probable explaination grounded to reality. But a lot of people in this sub like to ignore certain facts to fit their narrative and cling to their beliefs to the point they&#39;re almost borderline delusional.</p>

<p>I try to keep an open mind so IMO speculation and assumptions can be a healthy means for discussing certain issues, especially ones without a lot of information to go on. But speculation can quickly get out of hand to the point it hinders healthy discussion. Speculation/assumption is a double edged sword, it has its place in debate and discussion, but it can also derail it.</p>

<p>For the record I&#39;m not accusing you of doing this, so far this has been a civil, grounded conversation and I appreciate that :) something we need more of, and not just on reddit.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, one of the possibilities goes like this. It&#39;s the Old Testament, so religious writing that tells people how to behave.</p>

<p>Most industrial and agricultural societies seem to have a problem with psychedelic substances. When it&#39;s a tribe of hunter gatherers with lots of free time, psychedelics are great.</p>

<p>When it&#39;s a farm based community where everyone is expected to work all day in the field, nobody wants a bunch of people laying around tripping. </p>

<p>Even in the Bible it says something about how Adam and Eve got kicked out of the Garden and had to work the ground for a living afterwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly at a scientific standpoint IIRC  there&#39;s no concrete proof the pineal gland contains DMT, or releases it upon death for the matter. </p>

<p>I truly want to believe I&#39;m wrong here, so please provide sources if you have any because it&#39;d go a long way in convincing me there&#39;s a possibility that perhaps consciousness, or some form of, the human consciousness could exist after the physical body has died. </p>

<p>I want to believe. I&#39;m very open minded but I&#39;m a realist, and so far there&#39;s no concrete proof Of DMT existing in the pineal gland. Again I&#39;d love someone prove me wrong, I genuinely want to believe DMT exists naturally in the human brain. </p>

<p>I&#39;m the type of person to look at everything objectively, yet keep an open mind. I tend to inform myself on both sides of a position or argument and come to my own informed opinion. I feel more people could benefit from that line of thinking IMO. By taking a step back and looking at most things with an open and objective mind. Everything is a possibility until proven otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you brought up a valid point. It&#39;s good to think critically and ask questions.</p>

<p>As for whether or not there&#39;s DMT in the pineal?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know of any research that proves it. But I can offer some really poor anecdotal evidence. If you&#39;ve ever seen DMT inspired art, you will recognize some common themes.</p>

<p>Intense colors. There also seems to be a strong element of geometry and repeating patterns, even a fractal quality.</p>

<p>So one time there was a guy posting some of his artwork here on reddit. The interesting thing is that he mentioned he had a tumor on his pineal gland. So his artwork had a bit of that &quot;DMT art&quot; going on. But he hadn&#39;t been doing the drug AFAIK. Yet his art had that same sort of DMT influenced quality to it.</p>

<p>So I think that tumor on his pineal was causing it to secrete low but constant amounts of DMT into his system. The levels were just high enough to influence the style of his artwork in a recognizable way.</p>

<p>I know this isn&#39;t proof by a long shot. But it seems to fit with the Pineal/DMT theory.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting! could you provide a link to the guy with a pineal tumors artwork? Or an article about it? </p>

<p>But yeah, the consensus seems to be that it&#39;s all anecdotal evidence, which doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the pineal doesn&#39;t secrete DMT, it needs further study IMO. </p>

<p>As for the common themes in artwork one could argue that&#39;s the nature of the drug, could be something more. Although DMT trips can vary wildly in content, they all carry a simular underlying theme or vibe with some people reporting extremely simular experiences down to the physical descriptions of certain &quot;entities&quot;. Usually the dissolution of the ego and contact with &quot;beings&quot; can have a profound effect on a person&#39;s worldview and perception once they&#39;ve come down and the drug has worn off. </p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible at this time to tell if these &quot;beings&quot; actually exist in some higher plain of reality or if they&#39;re simply the manifestations of our psyche while under the influence of a powerful substance. Either explaination could explain the similarities between different artists with similar styles after having a DMT experience. Alex Gray is an excellent example of this theme of artwork. It&#39;s heavily focused around psychedelia. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see more research into the role of the pineal gland or psychedelics in general, but unfortunately I don&#39;t have confidence in &quot;the powers that be&quot; that they would release such information IF it were discovered. Hell they could already know the pineal gland is &quot;the seat of the soul&quot; and they&#39;re suppressing this knowledge from the public. They&#39;d have a lot of motivation to keep it under wraps. Can&#39;t have the masses waking up to the fact death MAY not be the end of conscienceness. </p>

<p>EDIT:
On a seperate note (rant, ignore in any replies to this part of my comment if necessary, I know this comment is long winded already.)  This is essentially completely irrelevant to the previous conversation anyway. Just something I feel I should put out there:</p>

<p>Great conversations going on in this thread :) a lot of open minded discussion. Good to see, especially on a subreddit that can be so polarized and hostile towards others idea&#39;s/theories. :) people just need to keep an open mind and not cling to their beliefs like a radical. We&#39;re living in unstable times where the art of proper debate is degrading into nothing but ad hominum attacks and shouting matches. We need to have intellectual, respectful, and most importantly well informed conversations if we ever want to make progress. I feel like people these days don&#39;t understand the words &quot;respectfully disagree&quot; or &quot;agree to disagree&quot;. Too many people cling to their (usually uninformed) beliefs like a fanatic. Even in the face of overwhelming evidence some people will blissful ignore the facts to suit their needs or rhetoric. The best we can hope for is these types of people to become a shrinking fringe group, but from what I see this sentiment is only growing, especially among millennials. There&#39;s a few things that are contributing to this IMO. Social media is a big one, but also these &quot;social justice warriors&quot; who are a legitimate threat to freedom of speech. I genuinely fear for my generations future, if only for the fact they seem so complacent in giving up our personal liberties for the illusion of safety. </p>

<p>In short I beleive social media did some devastating things for society as a whole. It gave everyone an outlet to express thier opinion, and more importantly it created the illusion that everyone&#39;s opinion is valid. IMO you&#39;re not entitled to your opinion. Your entitled to your INFORMED opinion. Nobody is entitled to spout ignorance like it&#39;s gospel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>About consciousness, I just wanna share that my Russian grandmother who is 1k miles away from me at bsically all times, can <strong>sense</strong> when I am sick. We always call her a couple of times a week, and she never calls (because we do), and we have a great bond. </p>

<p>But when I was a little kid and I was sick, she would ALWAYS call. I was sick 10 times when I was age 8-10, and EVERY SINGLE time when I felt really ill, she would call us and say she dreamt of me, and asked me if I am ok. This happened 10 times at least, and every time she called I would have been sick that day.</p>

<p>Many more stories like this that I have, to me, confirm that there is some other &#39;bond&#39; out there that we can&#39;t explain (yet). Maybe this is consciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pineal gland produces melatonin and is outside of the blood brain barrier, it is second only to the kidneys in regards to blood flow rate. Essentially, adding CO2 to melatonin gives you DMT - both of which are readily available in your blood stream at all times. Melatonin levels directly correspond to light levels: during the day melatonin levels are lower due to sunlight, higher levels at night. Its still unknown what causes the conversion of melatonin to DMT, but it can be done nearly anywhere in the body. Peak melatonin levels in the body occur naturally during REM stage of sleep, as melatonin is produced relationally to the circadian rhythm. Now here is where science gets really really fucking interesting.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15869567">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15869567</a></p>

<p>A phenomena has been documented first in zebrafish, and second in mice, in regards to the photoreceptor of the pineal gland and activation of the circadian clock. Scientists found that when kept in a dark room, mice and zebrafish did not develop the cones in their eyes - they were blind. But what they did develop is a ridiculous pineal gland photoreceptor cone and extreme amounts of melatonin. Once exposed to light, normal photoreceptor cone development occurred in the eyes and melatonin levels dropped to normal values.</p>

<p>The darkness prevents the activation of the circadian clock (proven in mice), which would typically result in a shitty sleep cycle and bad eyesight while kept in the dark. Instead scientists found at time T zebrafish developed a parietal eye - an organ that protrudes from the skin as a grey dot, rests between the eyes, and connects directly to the pineal gland. Typically zebrafish develop a parapineal gland, a shitty version of the parietal eye. Parietal eyes are common in lizards/fish, but extant from mammals/birds (who have a pineal gland just not the parietal organ), parietal eyes are used for thermoregulation and circadian rhythm. The common name for the parietal eye is &quot;The Third Eye&quot;.</p>

<p>So science established that a fish kept in the dark for long enough evolves this organ that directly connects to the pineal gland and allows it to perceive the world in a previously undocumented manner. We literally have no idea what the parietal eye development in the zebra fish does, we just evolved this organ into it via controlled environment. That was never their intention. </p>

<p>See, zebrafish have damn near identical occular DNA/development as humans, and this research was conducted with the hopes of curing various eye diseases/ailments. The success of the experiment has a lot of researchers wondering what would happen if a human was subjected to the same dark room environment from birth. Would we develop a parietal eye or would our pineal gland express similar precursors like the zebrafish? Why is nature so set on controlling melatonin levels via light?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup! I know the researchers currently looking into this and they are all vigilant in furthering their research. It&#39;s worth noting, in regards to the spirituality surrounding the third eye, that all of the researchers associated with these labs are Hindu and from India.

<p>I think this is where the ceremonial cacrifice plays out its play. There might have something to do with the intense fear of the victim and the physiologic effects it might have on body chemistry.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because psychedelics are the origins of all religions.  Do some research on it and you&#39;ll see it is obvious.    </p>

<p>For starters take a look at what tribal societies religion is based on - the ingestion of psychedelics (mushrooms, ayahuasca, etc.).  If psychedelics did not exist mankind would have never discovered religion.  </p>

<p>&quot;For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&quot; - Genesis 3:5</p>

<p>Something you ingest that will open your eyes and make you like God - its ridiculously clear they are referring to a psychedelic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah I really don&#39;t know I&#39;m afraid, in regards to how much is calcified. If you want to decalcify your pineal gland it is important to get your necessary vitamins/minerals, particularly vitamin D which is best received from natural sunlight. People often recommend going hatless so as to let the suns rays absorb into your skin which will help decalcification. Iodine is also supposed to be helpful in the decalcification process. You can get Iodine in fish and certain nuts/seeds, or just in concentrated supplement form.</p>

<p>Above all else you need to IMMEDIATELY stop drinking fluoridated water. Get a quality water filter that specializes in Fluoride if you can afford it. Avoid foods that are heavy in fluoride as well. Chlorine is also bad for the pineal gland, so avoid swimming in chlorine heavy pools. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you heard the theory that there is only one food we need to eat in order to live almost indefinitely but that so far nobody outside of (insert controlling group here) has figured it out? </p>

<p>There was an entire blog devoted to informing people about this, but the person writing even admitted that they have no idea what the food actually <em>is</em>, just that they fell into this information.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very curious if there is a connection to cannibalism or the pineal gland here. Perhaps it isn&#39;t even a physical food but something spiritual we need to focus or meditate on. There was another movement that believed we didn&#39;t require physical food at all called Breatharianism. It didn&#39;t last long though.</p>

<p>I have long believed that there is something going on behind the scenes with blood; essentially replenishing old blood with younger blood. Whether through transfusion or cannibalism, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>By the way, did you know that blood is classified as tissue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What timeline are we in? This sounds like a plotline straight out of Bloodborne. In the game, humanity finds blood of old gods. They find the blood can cure any disease if ingested. The church starts giving it out to everyone &amp; anyone. Later they find out that the blood of the old gods has unintended side effects. It makes the user transform into a beast or demon. Those that can keep the transformation at bay (usually people with high faith/status in the church) try to &quot;ascend&quot; in order to communicate/become old ones themselves. But doings so usually makes the individual go mad because the knowledge isn&#39;t meant for the human mind to understand. Wonder if this game was some sort of metaphor. </p>

<p>Smoking pineal glands. Likely just referencing the idea in the ... satire? Trolling? Whatever the hell is going on here. Plz nobody launch Pinealgate over this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Barb,
Why don&#39;t you tell me who you have been with that makes you feel so much more preternatural of a celebrity because of natural selection and... of course, because your celebrity which is obviously
preternatural because of natural selection was engineered by democratic arbitration. You can&#39;t rob me of my genetic composite. You&#39;re not going to smoke my pineal gland. Did you know that I am fucking smart and smarter than Robert Pattinson or whoever you have been trying to be contemporaries with the white trash hoe Angelina Jolie making porn with, and easily more charming because I am not a tween automaton? Did you know that the alkaloid of DMT is actually a neurotransmitter like LSD 25 and 5-MEODMT, psylocin A + B and all psychadelic drugs because the definition of psychadelia is a neurotransmitter that the metaboliteitself thereof creates a kaleidoscopic vision of geometric proportions in the pea and pea or whatever attachment to the pineal gland there is with light cones OR rods also depending on genetics, and depending on genetics the chromosomal filtration of certain neurotransmitters within these rods or cones which also illustrate in the visual cortex
apparently?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget that the &quot;philosophers stone&quot; was the ultimate peak of alchemy and there&#39;s a lot of speculation it was talking about DMT (and that Isaac Newton spent 30 years of his life trying to figure out).  DMT is produced in the pineal gland in extremely small doses but the DMT drug works on the corpus colosum to make the two hemispheres talk to each other better (the infinite/connections hemisphere and the logic/value/time hemisphere).  So a person feels everything more than they&#39;ve ever felt while also feeling it&#39;s all connected in a single arc of time more than they&#39;ve ever felt, hence the ultimate experience.  </p>

<p>Also, I wanted to say that I always thought that the fruit metaphor was supposed to indicate that we activated our &quot;value&quot; brain and were on the path towards seeking God. That we evolved beyond the simple existence and begin to desire one fruit for its better taste than the other, that suddenly something was &quot;better than&quot; rather in harmony (which then led to clothes because our first fear is our own exposure and clothing can help to protect us from that exposure).  The speculation is that the fruit was either an apple or a fig, but the pine cone does have significance in ancient symbolism too (along with the olive branch and many others).  </p>

<p>Again, remember the key in everything is that it&#39;s always hidden in plain sight.  The symbolism is there, just have to find it and make sense of the consistency and usage.  </p>

Once you introduce them, you now have a materialistic explanation for anything out of the ordinary - hallucination. Even if you are pro-entheogens, it still seems to muddy things because we can&#39;t say where reality begins and a hallucination ends and now we are off in crazy land. Of course at the same time there could be references to entheogens but I don&#39;t think we are socially mature enough to really have an intelligent discussion about it.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a darker path of speculation. But yes.</p>

<p>We know there are some tribes who practice this even today. Seems reasonable that it has taken place in various locations throughout history.</p>

<p>Also, some people seem skeptical about ancient knowledge of brain/nervous system. Really?</p>

<p>Those people hunted for a living. That means cutting open animals on a regular basis. People are smart enough to figure things out without a textbook. If my awareness seems to be centered in my head, let&#39;s take a look and see what&#39;s in the head of this elk. </p>

<p>When my spear hits an animal in various spots, different effects are associated with each spot. Hit the chest and it drops right away. Hit the abdomen and it keeps moving for a long time. Hit the right spot on the back and it&#39;s back legs quit working (but the front legs are ok)</p>

<p>So my guess is that even people from 5 or 6 thousand years ago had at least a rough, functional knowledge of the digestive and circulatory system. I also suggest that they had some basic idea of the nervous system in terms of awareness, sensory and motor function. This would especially be so for the bigger features like the spinal cord and the brain itself.</p>

<p>So I imagine some guys from 6000 BC who wants to possess &quot;the spirit of a lion&quot;. They know the lion has a brain and they know that the lion&#39;s awareness (like their own) is located in the brain. So when they kill a lion, they have a little ceremony where the hunters each share a bit of lion brain. Placebo effect ensues.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;ll get really speculative. Say that some people got really good at recognizing different parts of the brain. Maybe they developed preferences for different parts/pieces? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll also going to suggest that some of the plants they were eating had different pharmacological effects. We know from ayahuasca, that some tribal cultures know enough to mix a DMT containing plant with one that has a natural MAOi.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say some guy had recently consumed such a plant... maybe in another special ceremony? Now he eats a few pineal glands and maybe gets a noticeable effect from all the neurotransmitters.</p>

<p>&quot;I drank some of that, ate a few of those... and now I feel like this! Gotta try this again and see if the same thing happens next time.&quot;</p>

<p>So yeah, take a natural MAOi and then eat some fresh brain tissue all loaded with neurotransmitters? Sounds disgusting, but it might have a noticeable effect.</p>

<p>Like you suggested, prion disease would spread effectively in regions where such practices were common. In this case, the fruit of the tree at the center of the garden would refer to the brain itself... and not just the pineal gland.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_neuroscience">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_neuroscience</a></p>

<p>And finally, your theory falls apart once you consider that pine cones are not fruit and have existed longer on earth that plants that bear fruit(nor is it a fruit under any other circumstances), so only if you incorrectly consider pinecones fruit(i dont think god would mistake his own creations) would this symbolism still align. </p>

Dang, never realized the human sacrifice and <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_C_8M2WVWfgM/SXQQxQ00kdI/AAAAAAAAA14/IHx8Rxu1ZEE/s320/vlcsnap-8953433.png">reptile aliens</a> angle until now.</p>

<p>“As your attorney,” he said, “I advise you not worry.” He nodded toward the bathroom. “Take a hit
out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.”
“What is it?”
“Adrenochrome,” he said. “You won’t need much. Just a little tiny taste.” I got the bottle and dipped the head of a paper match into it.
“That’s about right,” he said. “That stuff makes pure mescaline seem like gingerbeer. You’ll go completely crazy if you take too much.” I licked the end of the match. “Where’d you get this?”
I asked. “You can’t buy it.”
“Never mind,” he said. “It’s absolutely pure.” I shook my head sadly. <strong>“Jesus! What kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There’s only one source for this stuff…”
He nodded.
“The adrenaline glands from a living human body,” I said. “It’s no good if you get it out of a corpse.”
“I know,” he replied. “But the guy didn’t have any cash. He’s one of these Satanism freaks.
He offered me human blood – said it would make me higher than I’d ever been in my life,” he laughed.</strong> “I thought he was kidding, so I told him I’d just as soon have an ounce or so of pure
adrenochrome – or maybe just a fresh adrenalin gland to chew on.” I could already feel the stuff working on me. The first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrmne. Maybe I
should take a swim, I thought.
“Yeah,” my attorney was saying. <strong>“They nailed this guy for child molesting, but he swears he didn’t do it. ‘Why should I fuck with children?’ he says; ‘They’re too small!’”</strong> He shrugged.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>these hypotheses have never been scientifically accepted; adrenochrome is not currently believed to have any psychedelic properties</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The drug Thompson described is fictional, but there are elements of truth there, just wildly exaggerated and that was his rather awesome style.</p>

<p>Also,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adrenochrome is unscheduled by the Controlled Substances Act in the United States, but if sold as a supplement, sales must conform to U.S. supplement laws. If sold for consumption as a food or drug, sales are regulated by the FDA</p>

<p>It&#39;s completely legal for sale.   No need for any conspiracy to obtain it.</p>

<p>I did edit my previous post for clarity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you didnt show its a drug. all you showed was that aldous huxley mentioned it back in the day. Keep in mind that huxley said a lot of crazy shit and also was not a scientist</p>

<p>I understand why you prefer huxley&#39;s beliefs, since that is a more sensational narrative, and supports the crazy story that public officials are secretly killing people, cutting open their heads, eating part of their brain, and participating in dark rituals (and something about reptile aliens). if you are willing to believe that complete bullshit, then im guessing there is no point in discussing any of this with you, but here is why i think you should be more skeptical about aldous huxley and hunter thompson and this whole adrenochrome thing;</p>

<p>Huxley wrote his book back in the 50s. there is no evidence he even got a real sample of adrenochrome, or any at all. in fact it is unlikely, because chemists didnt work out how to extract pure, stable samples of adrenochrome until like a decade later.</p>

<p>odds are that the research he refers to, that says adrenochrome causes schizophrenia, or mimics its effects, is that of Hoffer and Oswald, whose hypothesis is no longer accepted.</p>

<p>the other issue with this whole stupid conspiracy about politicians killing people and eating their pineal glands in secret for dark rituals is that there are so many other sources of adrenochrome. in fact it is sold pharmaceutically, because it is used to constrict capillaries to prevent bleeding during surgery. It is present in many animals, it can be synthesized by oxidizing adrenaline, and it is even present in the blood of humans, rats, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>someone else up-thread brought up adrenochrome. i seriously doubt that there is any psychoactive result for eating the pineal gland. dmt specifically was talked about earlier in this post, someone pointed out that eating dmt doesnt do anything (unless there are other compounds present to prevent breakdown in the stomach), and that there are much better sources of the drug. i also doubt that a non-brain surgeon could even find the pineal gland. its really tiny, and if you cut open a brain, it all looks pretty much the same. plus there would be blood everywhere. I may be wrong about that but it seems ridiculous.</p>

<p>honestly the weirdos that go for this sort of conspiracy annoy me. i mean, there are much more interesting conspiracies that are ACTUALLY PLAUSIBLE. The clinton foundation&#39;s shady ties to foreign govts, russian internet brigades and russian attempts to influence US elections, the panama papers, .... but no, these idiots are like one step away from claiming they found sunglasses that let you see all the reptilians hiding among human population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Author Hunter S. Thompson mentions adrenochrome in his book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The adrenochrome scene also appears in the novel&#39;s film adaptation. In the DVD commentary, director Terry Gilliam admits that his and Thompson&#39;s portrayal is a fictional exaggeration. In fact, Gilliam insists that the drug is entirely fictional and seems unaware of the existence of a substance with even a similar name. Thompson also mentions the substance in his book Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail &#39;72.&quot;</p>

<p>The compound is real, but it can be synthesized in a lab.  No need to take it from a live human. Also, it doesnt seem to be very potent at all and full of side effects that make adenochrome vastly inferior to dmt, psilocybin, and salvia divinorum.</p>

<p>Here is a well thought out <a href="https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=51847">experience on adenochrome</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typing from mobile so please excuse typos </p>

<p>I&#39;ve partaked in the ritual/ceremony of Ayahuasca.  I ventured down to Peru there in the thick of the Amazon. No electricity, running water, everything can kill type of scenario. Stayed with a local family and we&#39;re living in shanty huts for two weeks. </p>

<p>Ayahuasca is the combination of many plants and herbs. The concoction has DMT and an inhibitor which allows you to experience the affects of DMT as it moves through your system. </p>

<p>The ceremony itself involved the shaman chanting, blessing and calling upon certain dieties to assist us in ceremony, and clearing the space.  We each drank the brew and lied down as we waited for  what was to come. I personally had an intention to let go of the things that were holding me back and to step into who I was becoming. </p>

<p>For those of you who have tried MDMA it starts off like that. A rush of euphoria overcomes you which is then followed by hallucinations. Long story short I faced my fears in the form of demons, left my body, met mother ayahuasca, went into what can be described as what awaits humanity, saw my timeline, connected with my spirit guides, puked a shit load (purging), faced some child hood trauma, and it all felt like I was in a dream. The distinction between reality and the dream state was blurred. Everything was maleable. It absolutely changed my life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Friday night was euphoric and I felt amazing afterwards.  Saturday night was hell and I was &quot;raw&quot; for days after.  I think the two nights expanded my access to how high my highest self can go and how scary the basement of my psyche is with all the fears within.<br/>
So... feel better?  Not really better so much as I have increased access to places and I commend myself for the bravery of playing this Russian roulette and exploring new places in the human experience.  Still processing it all frankly.  You can find Graham Hancock&#39;s journals with ayahuasca for another trip report online that captures the varied (and daunting) landscapes you can find yourself in.  </p>

<p>edit:  Turning into different jungle animals was fun and both nights I could vividly travel through all my memories at will.  Even flying through the streets of my childhood neighborhood.  To balance out the challenging bits, those were otherworldly experiences I&#39;ll treasure forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Instead of saying &quot;im going to try something outside my comfort zone to fix a problem in my life&quot; you said &quot;my fear of change forbids me from change, but i dont like my current state&quot;</p>

<p>Either you do something to fix it, or, your choice is to do nothing. So by not choosing option a, you are CHOOSING to have crushing anxiety. Im not saying a shaman trip or whatever is the first step, its not, but dismissing a path to curbing your anxiety due to anxiety is counter productive to you as a person.   YOU have to say im going to do one thing to make me uncomfortable today. Then maybe go a little further next time. Before YOU know it, youll be more comfortable doing more things. Just like a person working out, little by little you build your strength. But its you holding yourself from whatever your goals are at the end of the day. I work in a 100% commission line of work and its reallllllly made me realize we have more control over our fortunes than at first glance, you just have to make it a habit(which can be difficult) for yourself to think this way. I realize you cant do absolutely anything you put your mind to, but within your little sphere of life you really can do anything you put your mind to. YOU just have to actually make a plan and execute. Ask yourself: &quot;will this kill me?&quot;, if no, maybe just give it a try, whats the worst that can happen?</p>

<p>You must fear the consequences of not changing more than change itself to move forward in life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may actually trigger you to move past your fears. By facing your fears head on you no longer allow them to dictate your life and use them as opportunity to grow. </p>

<p>We all have fears. But when we let fear dictate our life we become a victim of our own circumstances. If we use fear as stepping stone to become something better - by facing, accepting, and letting go. Then you have transformation. However, getting to the point where you make that conscious step to do is the most difficult.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>DMT has been proven to be present in mammals and there simply hasn&#39;t been enough research done to determine further although the likelihood is high that it would occur within Humans as well.</p>

<p>Fact is studies are ongoing because it presumed to be the case by those in the know.</p>

<p>In fact in 2014 it was synthesized from a human melanoma cell line so we are well on the way to proving this concept.</p>

<p>Never mind the fact that it would explain near death experiences as well as dream states.</p>

<p>Also a simple google search shows the Adrenacrhome does indeed have effects on the human brain.</p>

<p>They classify these effects as  thought disorder, derealization, and euphoria.</p>

<p>Popular belief again seems to be that this could possibly have some effect but needs to be mixed with something else to bring on desired effects. </p>

<p>MAO Inhibitor?</p>

<p>Even Aldous Huxley seems to think it&#39;s capable of having some effect as referenced in these quotes from the wiki link I have provided.</p>

<p>&quot;a product of the decomposition of adrenaline&quot; that can &quot;produce many of the symptoms observed in mescaline intoxication.&quot;</p>

<p>I have no clue myself but that&#39;s just what I came across with a quick google search. I&#39;m sure someone has a better grasp on this than I.</p>

<li>When the Egyptians mummified the body they first removed  the pineal by inserting a little scoop up the nose. Supposedly they would put it in a jar and store it in the tomb. But since this culture was so focused on the pineal and with the things they created it makes you wonder.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, CHILDREN HAVE LARGER PINEAL GLANDS</p>

<p>&quot;The pineal gland is located within the precise geometric center of the brain. And although larger in children, as we age, it reduces in size to that of a pea as it undergoes a gradual calcification process. The optimum size of the pineal gland, when fully engorged and activated, is that of a grape.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is more :</p>

<p>PRACTICE OF EATING PINEAL GLANDS</p>

<p>There is a tradition dating back to at least 1000 A.D. in which Arabs and later Europeans engaged in the practice of &#39;eating mummy&#39;. Ancient mummies were ground up and eaten for medicinal and occult practices...secret societies still practice the eating of &#39;live&#39; pineal gland such as the Skull and Bones society  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/naomiastral/ancient-kemet/cannibalism-of-ancient-mummies---horrible-history">see this post on &#39;Cannibalism of ancient mummies&#39;.</a></p>

<p>Skull and Bones consume live pineal gland during ‘The Obscene Rite’ </p>

<p>The beneficial effects of the hormone melatonin have been part of the health supplement scene for some time, for high melatonin production is known to be synonymous with a high immune system, a low cancer risk, long life, energy, stamina, and according to many, enhanced spiritual awareness.</p>

<p>Laurence Gardner writes:</p>

<p>&quot;..High melatonin production thereby increases the facility for receiving and transmitting high-frequency cosmic and local broadcasts, and leads to a greater state of cosmic awareness - a state simply of ’knowing.’ In this regard, it is interesting to note that the Pineal Third Eye has been found to contain very fine granular particles, rather like the crystals in a wireless receiving set...many magical rites and meditation techniques are aimed at gaining control of this organ and the fluid it produces: the live melatonin... Supplements bought over the counter are ineffective because, as Gardner explains, their inherent secretions are obtained from the desiccated glands of dead animals and they lack the truly important elements which only exist in live human glandular manufacture..&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s not just the pineal gland, but every gland of the endocrine system, and for different purposes.</p>

<p>Probably relevant: Each gland is represented by a corresponding chakra. Here&#39;s a list, although there&#39;s some disagreement on some of these:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Root chakra (1st) — Reproductive glands (testes in men; ovaries in women); controls sexual development and secretes sex hormones.</p></li>
<li><p>Sacral chakra (2nd) — Adrenal glands; regulates the immune system and metabolism.</p></li>
<li><p>Solar Plexus chakra (3rd) — Pancreas; regulates metabolism.</p></li>
<li><p>Heart chakra (4th) — Thymus gland; regulates the immune system.</p></li>
<li><p>Throat chakra (5th) — Thyroid gland; regulates body temperature and metabolism.</p></li>
<li><p>Third Eye chakra (6th) — Pituitary gland; produces hormones and governs the function of the previous five glands; sometimes, the pineal gland is linked to the third eye chakra as well as to the crown chakra.</p></li>
<li><p>Crown chakra (7th) — Pineal gland; regulates biological cycles, including sleep.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I love these kinds of discussions. They happens so rarely. DMT is easy enough for an experienced chemist to extract from certain types of plant bark/material. Amazonian tribes discovered a way to do it, they claim the trees told them. In our western minds that sounds ridiculous. But what they mean is they interpreted some form of observed data from the plants somehow. Suddenly doesn&#39;t sound so ridiculous now. Those of us who grew up surrounded by the scientific method have to realize that there are other ways of interpreting data to achieve the same results. This is just what we grew up with and are familiar with. It&#39;s ignorant to say the scientific method is the only way to discover the mysteries of life and existence. </p>

<p>My point is words are useless. We think in concepts, not words. Ever had a thought you finished before you could even mentally complete the sentence? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve gone way off topic. You asked for my thoughts :P </p>

<p>I&#39;d imagine stuff from the pineal gland would have to be smoked, or as another user suggested, eaten alongside another chemical. Wouldn&#39;t be out of the question. It&#39;s interesting to note that Satan often represents a being that delivers (sometimes secret) knowledge to mankind in this context. Could be partly why the archetype appeals to the elite. I&#39;d love to try DMT sometime. I&#39;d have a really good conversation (in concepts, not words) with a hypercube. I&#39;ll report back if I ever get some :P</p>

<p>This is a very tough one, certainly on the internet.<br/>
 I wonder what concepts great civilizations such as the Maya have discovered, which we haven&#39;t. Or for which concepts we have become blind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really interesting post! I&#39;ve  been reading about there types of people for years and the few people who allegedly left the illuminati and lived to tell about it, also make claims that eating humans makes theme stronger and provides spiritual insight. </p>

<p>No doubt there&#39;s been a lot of research into psychedelics that is being suppressed. In my youth I did a lot of backpacking in Peru and happened to try both smoking DMT and also an ayahuasca mixture a few times. It was incredibly positive/euphoric experience (s) though occasionally terrifying at times. Which I why i just cant wrap my mind around how/why anyone could deliberately hurt anyone after doing DMT.</p>

<p>Or why anyone would seek out a negative psychedelic trip. I wonder if on some sick, unconscious level, that these elites are torturing themselves as well.</p>

<p>This particular paragraph made me queasy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The study was published in Nature Medicine in 2014. Immediately, emails flooded in to Wyss-Coray’s inbox. Alzheimer’s patients wanted infusions of young blood. So did numerous aged billionaires. One, who flies around in a jet with his name emblazoned on the side, invited Wyss-Coray to an Oscars after-party this year. (He didn’t go.) Another correspondent wrote with a more disturbing offer: he said he could provide blood from children of whatever age the scientists required. Wyss-Coray was appalled. “That was creepy,” he said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through a sudden spiritual awakening when going through depression many months ago. It was self-imposed depression, meaning my thought system had become so brutal that I literally believed I was a piece of shit and that there was no way out of my emotions. Out of nowhere, my mind shut off. Yet, I still existed. This was my introduction to the pursuit of enlightenment. </p>

<p>We all know that we are, in fact, energy. We all believe we are this &quot;me&quot; that lives &quot;my&quot; life. But the fact is that all of that is an illusion. There is NO you that exists within you. That &quot;you&quot; is consciousness, but we have this thought system, also known as an ego, that thinks for and of itself -- but...it is an illusion. The elite know this. They seem to have hidden the truth behind existence from all of us. Nowadays, it&#39;s taking deep depression and sudden awakenings for us humans to recognize that we do not exist the way we think we do. </p>

<p>In knowing that we aren&#39;t what we think we are and that reality is SO far different than what we assume, it seems obvious that the conclusions you have reached are not at all outrageous. It&#39;s likely we are not alone in this universe; not at all, in fact. Seems reasonable to me to that they hope to summon some &#39;thing&#39; to Earth, almost like a God, if you will, for them to worship (people theorize that there is a 9th planet and that NASA, owned by the elite, keeps incredibly life-changing information about the universe hidden from the public). And if &#39;negative&#39;, rather than positive, energy is something that &quot;blesses&quot; the elite with youth, strength, and materialistic power, I would not be surprised.</p>

<p>At this time in the world, it is my belief that all humans should spend some time looking within themselves, even if that concept is something you&#39;ve been groomed by family/friends/society to think is silly, worthless, and a waste of time. </p>

<p>Those who are interested, youtube &#39;Adyashanti&#39; and listen to that enlightened man talk. He&#39;ll open your eyes to the fact that NONE OF US IS WHAT WE &#39;THINK&#39; WE ARE. If the evil elite are living for their own enlightenment, let us find ours to combat them. The entire purpose of existing is to find enlightenment, but we&#39;ve been trained to think life is about relationships, money, survival, and being perpetually busy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also possible that the elite were trying to frame Hunter Thompson because he was so famous and was opposed to the New World Order agenda. Hunter was one of the first people to say that 9-11 was a a false flag and I think these claims he was involved in child exploitation may have been generated by his reporting. Remember the elite use mind control for purposes like this - false accusations. </p>

<p>But now that we have that out of the way.. it is also possible that Hunter wasn&#39;t the pure freedom fighter we think he was. I heard his son talk about the book he wrote about his dad and he wasn&#39;t necessarily the greatest guy... so who knows who the real Hunter was...</p>

<p>Hunter lived right next door to Osama Bin Laden&#39;s relatives in Colorado I believe.. pretty odd coincidence imo...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no reason that the person would need to be alive still to harvest a pineal gland. All the amino acids which make up the various compounds found in there would easily last for quite some time making it far more likely to just harvest it from those who died. Although the far easier thing to do is to just artificially create the compounds since there are various ways of doing so. The other main problem is the fact that very little compounds like those in the gland are viable to consume since the digestive system will break them down as well as the fact that it&#39;s very hard for them to cross the blood brain barrier. That&#39;s why artificial variants are used since they can be developed to survive ingestion and cross the blood brain barrier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome post! I&#39;d like to add this: known occult expert Mark Passio would say that the «eye of horus» symbolism is one for expressing the harmony/power, equilibrium of the sacred aspects of male and female : male = Protection, female = Care.. Not sure this is also implied in how they force this symbol in the media and in their rituals.  Would not bet on it. 
Still points out to the «cremation of care» ceremony in Bohemian Grove.. If you do bad deeds and you don&#39;t want to have any remorse, burn the caring/female part of your psyche symbolically, then you will feel powerful because less restrained to act out.  Moloch statue in the background accentuates the sacrifical undoing and the coherence of all of this. Eech. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe this is an exactly correct understanding of what satanists are attempting to do.  </p>

<p>Everything satanists do is a mockery/imitation of, attempted ursurpation of God.  </p>

<p>God is Omniscient, therefore satan tries to claim omniscience too... through this cannabalistic pineal gland ritual....  and using illicit means such as these  - cannibalising people, hexes, spells, misusing natural objects and misusing people - which provides links to the demonic whereby foreign or &#39;occulted&#39; pseudo-knowledge is passed from person to person or from person to demon.</p>

<p>Another example is Masses...Christians (Catholic and Orthodox Christians anyway) celebrate Christian Masses.   </p>

<p>Satan only imitates ..a &#39;black mass&#39;.</p>

<p>These sorceretic ritutals are misuses and abuses of God-give nature which attempt to invert the natural order.</p>

<p>The natural order inverted contributes to Satan&#39;s ultimate &#39;end-game&#39;, which is to be worshipped &quot;as God&quot;.  He of course will suffer defeat since he is not God.  But will use people who are willing to cooperate  with this agenda for their own earthly gain....at the cost of their eternal soul.</p>

<p>&quot;What does it prosper a man to gain the whole world, but lost his soul?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. “All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down and worship me.”</p>

<p>Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s well known in the occult community that it&#39;s a common practice during Satanic Ritual Sacrifices to withdraw the blood and the fluids from the brain when the human is at maximum fear levels, which loads that blood with N,N-Dimethyltryptamine and high levels of adrenaline. </p>

<p>They drink this blood and have incredible abilities because of the heightened senses that come along with being in that fight or flight zone during a death or near-death experience.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard stories of how Al Gore got caught with several liters of blood at the airport and it took his lawyers a couple weeks to come up with the documents that said apparently he needed the blood because of a &quot;medical disorder&quot;.</p>

<p>The Antichrist, Al-Dajjal and so on is said to have only one eye, which may refer to the Ajna Chakra of the subtle, energetic body, which more or less corresponds to the pineal gland. The subtle body is empiric fact, as anybody who was successfully treated by an acupuncturist can tell you. The difference between meditation and enlightenment by giving up the self and surrendering to something higher and the various Satanists is the latter unending reliance on the ego. And if everything you do is for your ego, why not eat human pineal glands?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, our positions on this are wildly differing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m arguing the (potential) existence of a reality whose very fabric responds and reacts to intentionality and consciousness. You&#39;re arguing for a simple, classical, mechanical universe; a kind of giant lego set with fixed rules and terms of operation. </p>

<p>You were further arguing that the conveniently neat fit between us and that universe is essentially due to the universe arranging itself to suit us, rather than us having evolved in that universe and so necessarily reflecting its physical manifestation. Now you seem to be arguing an immutable and unchanging universe in which reality is permanent and fixed in its terms and in which humans are a side detail. </p>

<p>Frankly, I&#39;m a bit confused about your meta-position on all this. It can&#39;t be both a strong anthropic universe and a cold uncaring universe of mathematics and geometry. </p>
