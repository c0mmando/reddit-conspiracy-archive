       I noticed this a few weeks ago, but kept it to myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/bidenbro">
        /r/bidenbro
       </a>
       is filled with super cheesy and (imo) totally unfunny memes about Joe Biden. I thought it was a super dumb subreddit that wasn't going to last. However, with all the Reddit manipulation that has been going on I started to think this can't just be users suddenly deciding that Joe Biden was cool and that they're going to make him a meme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who has been on Reddit for at least a year or two knows how well the hivemind of Reddit was against Joe Biden. The super creepy gif of him grabbing that young girl as he whispered in his ear was even semi viral for a while. I know for a fact the overall view of him for a good amount of time was creepy and negative. Yet, all of a sudden it changed...
      </p>
      <p>
       I ignored it for a while and downvoted most of the posts I saw from them because I personally find the memes unfunny and like they're trying way too hard. Then one day
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/bidenbro/comments/5gsxsw/what_the_electoral_map_will_look_like_in_2020/">
        this post
       </a>
       surfaced near the top of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, this is a conspiracy theory. Maybe all of a sudden Reddit users decided to start liking Joe Biden for lord knows what reasons. Maybe I'm out of touch with what's "in" and Joe Biden really is a super awesome cat to meme out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to share this observation I made because to me something does not feel right about this. Hopefully, I'm not the only one. Either way, we must keep our eyes out for this possibility that "Left Groups" are trying to join the "meme war" by propping up someone they can control through "Meme Propaganda." Maybe they heard Trump won because of memes and are trying to hop on the bandwagon early to meme someone that will continue their agenda in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps, I had a weird feeling about
       <a href="/r/bidenbro">
        /r/bidenbro
       </a>
       because it feels like when parents, teachers, or older relative try to be cool and hip. Yeah, it's cute and they kinda get it, but you just know when a meme is just right versus plain awkward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please let me know your thoughts and feel free to debate my observation. Free speech is king after all.

      <p>
       EDIT: Read almost everybody's great replies and contributions. I'd say overall most people have taken note of what's going on too. I went back to bidenbro to take a look at memes and their front page. So much corny lame memes. Not even funny. Stumbled on other weird foreshadowing memes. And even one that's not even a meme. Just a news article with Biden hinting he might be running for President in 2020. He's close to Obama so let's assume he's in the corrupt circle of controlled politicians. He would be their first choice because he's a trusted insider. The establishment already knows Clinton has no way of winning. Which is why she was so hurt by her loss. She knew there was no chance she could ever be president again.

       I think once people realize meme magic is real and Kek memed trump into office, they are trying to use the same thing for Biden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Difference is, Biden is most likely a pedo, a dinosaur that is out of touch with reality and wouldn't work as a Prez, so it will fail

       Christ I hope not. Ugh! He just gets all smiley around pretty girls and talkative which is kind of unlike him. Well he had a stroke and that's when it really started happening more. Poor man can't think straight 100% :(

       By your logic he has to be a pedophile then. If being wierd and awkward makes Joe Biden a pedophile then your dad must be one too.

       No. You're confused on what user you're talking to. Besides, that other user might be on to something. Biden is part of the circle that has a foot in the door of pizza gate.

       Why do you think he is a pedophile though? He seems like a good guy to me and he stated he doesn't want to be president so I'm not sure how he is a replacement for Clinton or whatever people are saying here. Also, I've never seen Biden hate on reddit. Have you ever actually read about Biden's life or do you just dislike him because of Memes?

       You agreed with another comment in this thread saying he was a pedophile. It seems you just think he is creepy and don't like the bidenbro meme. He does seem like he can be awkward sometimes but lots of people are. He's a close talker. The Biden bro meme became popular during the election when Biden was giving a lot if speeches and slamming Trump. People liked that and started making memes.

       It's so sad.. We were something great, man.. Did you know that the moderators of this very subreddit feel that shills deserve just as much of a right to comment as you or I do?

       Isn't that part of what people do on Reddit?  Didn't The_Donald use Reddit to hype up Trump?  And didn't Hillary also have some shitty sub to hype up Hillary?  And Bernie had a sub to hype up Bernie?  And Obama had a sub (that still exists but is less active) to hype him up...

       Do you mean Donald Trump used r/The_Donald to hype himself up? Or do you mean just the r/The_Donald users through their own discretion used memes to hype Trump up in general?
      </p>
      <p>
       I distinguish between:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        an organic portion of the Reddit user base pushes an agenda
       </li>
       <li>
        an organic portion of the Reddit user base is organized by an official political authority to push an agenda
       </li>
       <li>
        an inorganic portion of the Reddit user base is pushing an agenda
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The final option is a "conspiracy" that I do not believe should be permitted. r/HillaryClinton, for example, is clearly the last option. I believe r/The_Donald and r/Sanders4President were either options 1 or 2. r/BidenBro, atm, I am unsure whether is 2 or 3.

       Yeah, it's a cute and silly group of pictures that are just poking fun at the idea of the Obama/Biden brolationship. I also really like

       because those places make me feel happy and positive about the world. There is a lot of bad in the world, but there is a lot of good, too. Generally positive subs help me to enjoy that in a different way.

       Yes, but these are different scenarios. They were running for president. Now all of a sudden they're hyping up Biden for no apparent reason out of nowhere. I'm saying they're slowly spreading pro-Biden meme propaganda for a reason. The future will show us why... Just thought I'd call people's attention to it and see if there's any other like minded people who had also made this observation.

       Not there it isn't. It's about him being a super cool normal bro. Back in the day, the character was about him being over attached, or a creepy pedo, but now it's "ayyy I'm Joe Biden lookame eatin' some ice cream or whatever!"

       They're all mostly making seem like a funny, cool, regular joe, and nice kind of guy. Even though to me the jokes are awkward and not even funny.

       You're ignoring what everyone is claiming them. The subreddit took of right around PizzaGate and towards the end of the election. It would make sense for the establishment to copy the meme bandwagon and try to use the supposed meme magic to prop up someone they can control. Out of all the possible people we can meme you think the reddit normal user base decided to start meming Biden for no reason? On average reddit never liked Joe Biden. Anyone here over a year or two knows this. It's only been in 2016 that major manipulation of Reddit started and here we are now with a large possible manipulation known as bidenbro.

I have been here for 5 and I honestly can't recall a time anyone talking about Biden besides comments about him being close to people. I would argue most people are neutral about Biden.

       I know. Well kind of. He's part of the corrupt establishment.

      <p>
       You're not understanding. I'm saying the establishment that has taken over reddit is using the corny subreddit to make Biden into a cool cat that everyone likes so that later on they can prop him up to run for something. Well... trying.
      </p>
      <p>
       It occurred after the election. After they witnessed the power of meme magic.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're still not following! The establishment IS the one creating the MEMES. Sure some sheep follow along and try to get karma memeing Biden, but this was started by the establishment trying to make Biden look cool thinking they can use the meme magic Trump profited from. They think they can meme the fuck out of biden, make him look cool, so that in the future (once they have accomplished their mission of making him look like a cool memed out cat) they can prop him up in some elected position. Or make him a spokesperson or some kind of leader in some situation that will push their agenda further forward.

       Don't forget this is a conspiracy theory. We are in

      </p>

       However, bidenbro is really really weird to me. So I wanted to share and see if anyone else felt the same. Seems to me most people do. Glad I'm not the only one.

       Me and a couple of friends of mine follow that sub. Not because we like Joe Biden, we couldn't even vote for him as we all live in Germany, but because it's our kind of humor. I think the 90.000 other followers just like the memes as well.

       Well my post is common sense as well. I am not part of an agenda. I merely posting my observation to see if anyone has felt the same way. I have read through my entire post and comments to read about the participants discussions. Nowhere have I seen a user call someone a cuck or shill.

       Yeah of course the idea of political/corporate infiltrators/impersonators died with the election and nobody got any ideas at all. Makes sense. Nothing to see here. All those "so and so corporation did so and so amazingly nice thing for such and such disabled person!" are just a result of us all making a concerted effort to keep up with and share amongst ourselves the various small PR stunts that corporations pull. It's totally that.

       That's like saying Alqeda is dead. Isis is still there. Both groups are terrorists and fighting for a Muslim caliphate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with CTR and corporate influence. They're controlled by the same establishment. I'm sure they still have shills on Reddit. They took note how obvious it was and scaled down on shills to make it less obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: My wording might sound CTR and ISIS are controlled by the same establishment. That's not what I meant. I mean CTR and other paid shills from the establishment's agenda are controlled by the same overall hivemind.

       I think this just goes to show that the DNC did NOT learn its lesson. Run an establishment candidate in an anti-establishment election? Get mowed over. Repeat in 2020?
For those of you who think maybe 2020 will be an establishment election... I'm not so sure. With all this fallout from the election, "fake news" and the media tightening their grip on the narrative, I think more and more people are seeing this as a system that does not work for them.

       Oh no, I can see that's the route they'll likely take- they already are. But what I'm beginning to see is a growing dissent with the media, and a - at times emotionally nonsensical- rejection of their narrative. I wonder if they can come back from that after losing this election so badly and creating this division.

       That's what you get with propaganda. In a matter of years, people will see an old video of Biden being creepy with a little girl and will say: "Ohhh look, another Biden meme. The troll went a little far on that one. I wonder how they photoshop this shit into the videos." Dasmn it sheeple wake up!

       It's either a cheap PR stunt to distract from the damaging videos already here on Reddit showing him act weird around kids, or it's DNC's plan B for when Obama orders a full investigation into the election results, as well as CIA convincing electoral college to flip on Trump by December 19.

       I think you're a little too deep on this one. The reality is, a lot of people like Joe Biden but the more important thing here is the persona of Joe Biden as a "cool dude" is one that THE ONION has portrayed Biden, in many content pieces since 2009.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see this for yourself
       <a href="http://www.theonion.com/search?q=joe+biden">
        http://www.theonion.com/search?q=joe+biden
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you don't want to click, here is a small sampling of the articles they've written
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Joe Biden Shows Up To Inauguration With Ponytail

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Also, for liberals like myself, we're having a lot of fun at the nostalgia of "Cool Joe" or "Uncle Joe" now that he's leaving office soon.

       I will say this though; even before these elections started the overall feel towards Biden on reddit was not positive. It's changed all of a sudden. And the way they're trying to portray him and hype him up seems like they're propping him up for something in the future...

       I think you're basing your opinion on your personal bubble. In my personal bubble, Biden is well liked and the places on the internet that I frequent, makes it seem strange to me that you don't think people like him.

       I'm definitely bias. Obviously from my experience since 2010 on Reddit I can tell you from my general experience people did not like Biden on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion is definitely bias even more so because I believe that Reddit has been compromised. The take over started happening around 2014 or 2015 and got blatantly worse this year. I always felt something was weird and changing with Reddit and so did my close friends. 2016 just brought everything more to light.

       What are peoples thoughts on Hunter S. Thompson? I did a little research today about his life and death. He was semi-close with Biden. He seemed well aware of the elites and their affinity for minors and weird rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people think he lost his mind but he could've been on to something. I'm too young to remember him while he was alive. Was he compromised by the elites? Does anyone have any solid places to look more into his life and conspiracies surrounding his death?

       If you look up the creator of the sub CatholicGuy, he frequents T_D and seems to be a Trump supporter. He claims he was approached by Dems to use it as a base in 2020, but has no intention to hand it over. Someone on T_D suggested making the sub private the day before the new election cycle starts; CatholicGuy seemed to like the idea. Maybe it's a long con on the Dems...

       You're also missing the point. Trump was running for president and had no presence on reddit before this election. BidenBro is out of NOWHERE and for no real reason. He's not running for anything. It's like they're trying to hype him up now for something in the coming future...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you've been around reddit for 1-2 years you know on average the reddit hivemind has always been against joe biden. Now all of a sudden it's changed...

       Just a meme? It's just a news article. It's just a reddit post. No.

       Someone posts a random post. That's just a post. Someone posts a meme. That's just a meme.

       All of a sudden a Biden meme subreddit blasting weird biden memes all day everyday. That's unusual in my book.

       An exaggerated meme about Biden, a political figure in the highest area of American governments is completely irrelevant to politics to you? Clearly in any political scenario it is safe for a logical person to assume and clearly see Propaganda in such a subreddit. Wether on purpose and paid by a higher power, or by a close group of opinionated mods, (or high schoolers being silly and accidentally contributing) there is a propaganda that exists. That is a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is sounds you're trying to say to me is that you believe this is absolutely a ridiculous idea. Obviously it must just be redditors posting silly memes coincidentally about a person very high parts of our government ESPECIALLY on the democratic side which in recent events have been proven to be highly controlled by foreign interests. If you don't know about these facts by now then I shouldn't continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, a fake persona people give him for and IN the meme is perfectly relevant. If we assume this (globalist agenda pushers aka the left) truly is going on since this is indeed a conspiracy theory, then the end of goal of the creator of the subreddit would be to connect people psychologically from BIDEN to positive feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again there's also the chance it's just a silly subreddit. All just coincidence.

       I also noticed this.  Right away for whatever reason, they were laundering the image of joe.  For what reason exactly.....I can only imagine but when that amount of work is being done for him......I'm very skeptical.  All the comments I came across and had to comment on were all about how nice and "normal" of a guy he is.

       Right away.....red flags come up as the huge amount of joe meme's flooded the place.  Too obvious.

       A lot of people just look at Biden like a funny uncle.  Many people on my facebook adore him, and I've seen a lot of these memes floating around.  Some of them were genuinely funny, but that sub is filled with people trying too hard.

       People posting memes of a likeable politician is not a conspiracy.  The same way people posting memes of Trump as an off shoot of his online popularity has been achieved through organic means.  Shockingly, many liberal voters identify with Biden as a down to earth guy and not as (gasp) a filthy pedophile using memes to ingratiate himself into the white house.  Biden most likely has no interest in running in 2020 anyways.  He'll be too old and his political time has passed.

       But the truth is Biden has not been a likeable politician at least in the reddit hivemind. If you follow reddit closely like I have since 2011 you can see a lot of negativity toward biden started around 2013/2014. The overall feel towards Biden was negative. It's funny how all of a sudden it changed.

       I looked at the top 10 and None of them describe what you said about "an overly attached kid"
      </p>
      <p>
       They're all mostly making seem like a funny, cool, regular joe, and nice kind of guy. Even though to me the jokes are awkward and not even funny.

       I haven't even dwelled into the comments section. I bet the propaganda is even worse in the comments.

       You're also missing the point. Trump was running for president and had no presence on reddit before this election. BidenBro is out of NOWHERE and for no real reason. He's not running for anything. It's like they're trying to hype him up now for something in the coming future...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you've been around reddit for 1-2 years you know on average the reddit hivemind has always been against joe biden. Now all of a sudden it's changed...
