       many have speculated wikileaks has already been compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at the trend of the twitter posts as can be seen in the picture below, it seems to me as if the legacy establishment is painting a narrative through the website (wikileaks) that helped ,and therefore validated, people's opinion of the current government [corrupt to the core].

       There were early reports last week, most likely put out in order to bake the idea in peoples minds, that there was also a hack into the RNC, but Russia "chose" not to release them . I think they are going to try and leak something (potentially doctored leaks) between RNC/Trump direct ties to Russia. Just create pure chaos. I have yet to see them slow down their attacks, in fact its increased. Could pizzagate have been a distraction in order to forget about julian assange? if its real, then they know the FBI knows, and they're probably looking at all these fucking subredits to figure out where they have to cover their tracks and all the archive shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's going to be an all out FBI vs CIA rumble the next 4 days, and to me, seems like they may be already trying to fuck with the FBI

       This rumble has been going on for a good long while... a bloodless coup... I've watched the FBI and AG's office moving their soldiers into key positions... while the badguys kick back thinking they are too big to fail.

       i mean one of the major thing that keeps me hopeful is they were totally caught off guard, because as you said they pretty much thought they had it in the bag. been a scramble ever since. But i think they're just going to go all out in the next 4 days, who knows maybe even do something in between then and inauguration. Do not put it past them to essentially start a civil war as well as military conflict with russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       like an old man, i listened to the white house press conference for 2 and half hours last night. white house position is definitely to continue looking and will come back with updates and that its extremely pressing. It's extremely serious, even though they ensured it was completely safe before the election results

       I honestly don't know... It might be "Schrodinger's Assange"... NSA saw plans to kill Assange... but if they stopped the assassination totally the bad guys would know their comms had been compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was alive they would still try to kill him and know people were on to their plans... and  if he was dead people would be outraged worldwide... so they need him alive and dead at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       NSA found HRC's NWO handbook... so they want her to stay as close to the script as possible... cause that is exactly what they are prepared to fight. They need her people to improvise as little as possible.

       Yeah... most likely Assange is just plain dead and the DDoS stopped his deadman from triggering... but I'd like to be hopeful that FBI2 got him out just under the wire... and will clean up all the dirty bastards... and in return Assange won't drop the "bombshell" and will chill in a safehouse until a post inauguration parade...

       What better way to get instant streetcred for the new FBI than a fistbump on live TV with Assange... Whistleblowing is back in style... "Look kids! This FBI is hip!"

       Heeeeey... now that I google it... Game Theory sounds exactly like what I do... only I dont limit myself to just rational and intelligent targets. I always assumed it was some sports gambling thing and was uninterested... this is a pretty big wikipedia article here... but I'm always excited when something i made up in my head turns out to be a real thing...

       I'm always willing to admit when I might be wrong... especially since the more complicated the issue I am interpreting the more likely I am to mess up some of the finer points... But the length of time I have held a belief is meaningless in the face of new information...

       I like the video... but I swore off using my skills to get laid long ago... bad karma for sure... just cause I don't experience a wide array of emotions doesn't mean the people I interact with don't have them. Bad vibes.

       Yes, seldom is stubborn not synonymous with stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, but the video was not about sex, but game theory. The movie is better than that. Also, I really like "The Good Shepherd" - these people are wicked smart. Unfortunately, smart is also often synonymous with evil.

       I could go evil so easily... the sex stuff leads down that road pretty quickly... same thing with money or authority... or a perceived sleight against me. But I can keep it on the rails with practice... I don't want to be used for evil... simply because I don't want to be "used" at all...

       I'll give that movie a watch sometime soon... off to bed with me now... past my bedtime. You have a good one! Given me some good readin for tomorrow. Peace.
