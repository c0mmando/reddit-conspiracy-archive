       Yeah.  Trump absolutely IS one of them - so no one should ever expect him to really fix anything in this country.  Shit in all likelihood will NOT get better with him in power.

      <p>
       But so fucking what?  At least we'll still have a fucking WORLD with him in power because he didn't plunge the entire planet into WWIII.

       I'm not sure what your comment was implying.. but considering "fucking the middle/poor class over" I'd say take a look at the Democratic Party's policy's in the past- you'll be unpleasantly surprised to find out how much they've been screwing over social classes and lying about it to these very people all along.

       He probably will- it sounds like his goal is to lower them for everyone- corporations too.  But the stated goal of that is to increase growth for the US which would then help people at every level.  That may not turn out to happen, though it's too early to tell right now.

       Correct.  I should have said I'm not
       <em>
        African American
       </em>
       .  That said, I'm still not "black" per se since I'm mixed with nearly as much European blood (the rest is native).  I'm Latino, which is not a race per se - it's a cultural identity - but my bigger/main point in even bringing that up was that OP saying he feared a Trump presidency since he (OP) is "black"
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       makes no sense because civil war - bad as that may be w/Trump - is still FAR better than

       war w/Clinton.

       Yeah.  There's China too...and Syria - who happens to be the country the US is attempting to overthrow...who happens to be allies with Russia and China...who the US will go to war with and get its ass kicked by if it keeps trying to fuck w/Syria - which the US definitely keeps trying to.

       Look I'm not sure if you've noticed or not, but Trump is a conspiracy theorist and has been for years. Dude was a birther for crying out loud. And all along his campaign he pushed the NWO conspiracy notion, talking like he was very anti-establishment, against the globalists and their agenda, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the conspiracy theory community has kind of been taken by storm during this campaign. Suddenly it's like our opinions are so important that mainstream entertainers are calling us out specifically here on Reddit, the "fake news" narrative onslaught targeted very largely at Alex Jones (and I'm not even a fan of him, but he's easily the most prominent figure in the conspiracy theory community, whether some of us like it or not), even the pope weighed in lmao.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah places like this sub have been flooded with partisan people on both sides coming here and in other conspiracy theory communities to battle before us all, like what we think matters. Given how ignored and marginalized conspiracy theorists have been for so long, just considered "fringe" and mocked, it's pretty nuts to see all this stuff. A lot of Trump supporters who weren't conspiracy theorists before apparently sure as hell are now.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then weeks before Trump is supposed to be sworn in as president, and as it is being suddenly established that the conspiracy theory community is in large part holding almost as much sway over public opinion as the MSM (maybe even more, shit who knows), the CIA releases a "conspiracy" about Russia, but won't show their proof and then cancels their briefing with the electors at the last minute. Wut?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like they are hoping that we will all blindly believe it just because we are conspiracy theorists. But it was also a retarded strategy because we've been getting simultaneously blasted with accusations of "fake news" and a lot of people pointing out how Alex Jones has no credibility with his "secret insider" sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then the CIA and Washington Post are like, "We have secret insider information," and expect us to be like, "Okay we totally believe you."
      </p>
      <p>
       Like wtf lol.
