That said, I&#39;m still not &quot;black&quot; per se since I&#39;m mixed with nearly as much European blood (the rest is native).  I&#39;m Latino, which is not a race per se - it&#39;s a cultural identity - but my bigger/main point in even bringing that up was that OP saying he feared a Trump presidency since he (OP) is &quot;black&quot; <em>still</em> makes no sense because civil war - bad as that may be w/Trump - is still FAR better than <em>world</em> war w/Clinton.</p>

<p>Uh, have you seen the headlines where various political and corporate big wigs &quot;in the know&quot; let it be known that it wasn&#39;t Russia that made the leaks that caused Clinton the election, but it was instead the DNC worker Seth Rich? the one who ended up murdered?</p>

<p>Yeah...<em>those</em> &quot;Russians&quot; controlled the election.  The ones from America who are <em>Americans</em> and have nothing to do with Russia.  Yeah.  <em>those</em> Russians. lol</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Uh...but the point is that your family and friends would die ANYWAY regardless of which corporate puppet gets in office.</p>

<p>1 With Trump, your family and friends and the rest of America dies.</p>

<p>2 With Clinton, your family and friends and THE REST OF THE HUMAN POPULATION dies.</p>

<p>I&#39;d pick choice 1 over choice 2 - 10/10.</p>

<p>Yeah.

<p>Not like they do.  We would be outnumbered.  Big time.  And you know what?  That doesn&#39;t even matter because the real point is that THE ENTIRE PLANET WILL LOOSE if we go to WWIII.  It doesn&#39;t matter <em>whose</em> side you&#39;re on.  We would ALL lose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve noticed or not, but Trump is a conspiracy theorist and has been for years. Dude was a birther for crying out loud. And all along his campaign he pushed the NWO conspiracy notion, talking like he was very anti-establishment, against the globalists and their agenda, etc.</p>

<p>And the conspiracy theory community has kind of been taken by storm during this campaign. Suddenly it&#39;s like our opinions are so important that mainstream entertainers are calling us out specifically here on Reddit, the &quot;fake news&quot; narrative onslaught targeted very largely at Alex Jones (and I&#39;m not even a fan of him, but he&#39;s easily the most prominent figure in the conspiracy theory community, whether some of us like it or not), even the pope weighed in lmao.</p>

<p>And yeah places like this sub have been flooded with partisan people on both sides coming here and in other conspiracy theory communities to battle before us all, like what we think matters. Given how ignored and marginalized conspiracy theorists have been for so long, just considered &quot;fringe&quot; and mocked, it&#39;s pretty nuts to see all this stuff. A lot of Trump supporters who weren&#39;t conspiracy theorists before apparently sure as hell are now.</p>

<p>So then weeks before Trump is supposed to be sworn in as president, and as it is being suddenly established that the conspiracy theory community is in large part holding almost as much sway over public opinion as the MSM (maybe even more, shit who knows), the CIA releases a &quot;conspiracy&quot; about Russia, but won&#39;t show their proof and then cancels their briefing with the electors at the last minute. Wut?</p>

<p>It&#39;s like they are hoping that we will all blindly believe it just because we are conspiracy theorists. But it was also a retarded strategy because we&#39;ve been getting simultaneously blasted with accusations of &quot;fake news&quot; and a lot of people pointing out how Alex Jones has no credibility with his &quot;secret insider&quot; sources.</p>

<p>But then the CIA and Washington Post are like, &quot;We have secret insider information,&quot; and expect us to be like, &quot;Okay we totally believe you.&quot; </p>

<p>Like wtf lol. </p>
