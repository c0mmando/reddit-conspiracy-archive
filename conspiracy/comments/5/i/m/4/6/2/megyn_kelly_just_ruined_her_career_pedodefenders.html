       Hasert was convicted of non -pedo crime is Pence from when he was first accused of that?

       Maybe he honestly thought he was a man of integrity, came out to defend and support , found out, became saddened embarrassed and ashamed . The only one still saying he's bros with Hastert is Pedosta

       Anyone can look it up. It is the truth.

       And MIKE PENCE defended this monster. Pence is a major part of pizza gate and is an accomplice by omission to Child Rape and Molestation.

       Pence should be in PRISON, and what the hell does that say about Trump, who chose this Molester Defender to be VP?

       Don't be so naive. Everyone knows Hassert is a serial child rapist. Him and Tony Podesta go way back. This isn't new about Hassert. Because he wasn't convicted of it shows that he has connections. IF you are convicted of it means you lack the connections to get you off those charges.
Al Capone and OJ Simpson never were charged with their more serious crimes, because they had connections. Jarrod from Subway, however, was not.

       There you go moving the goal posts... did I say Tony Podesta is a child rapist? I said Hassert was. I said Hassert is connected. I said he hangs with Podesta. 
I implied Podesta was connected.
You assumed (or know) Podesta is a child rapist.

       You are incorrect about his indictment, conviction &amp; reasoning behind his jail sentence.

       I do not support politicians, but I wanted to help your cause, as you are extremely confident in your legal assessment and you are factually incorrect with respect to John Dennis Hastert and the crimes indicated on his indictment.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In October 2015, Hastert entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors. Under the agreement, Hastert pleaded guilty to the "structuring" charge (a felony), and the making false statements charge was dropped. In court submissions on sentencing considerations filed in April 2016, federal prosecutors made allegations of sexual misconduct against Hastert, saying that he had molested at least four boys as young as 14 while he worked as a high school wrestling coach decades earlier. At the sentencing hearing later that month, Hastert admitted under pressure from the judge that he had sexually abused boys. The judge in the case referred to Hastert as a "serial child molester" and imposed a sentence of fifteen months in prison, two years' supervised release, and a $250,000 fine. Hastert is "one of the highest-ranking politicians in American history to be sentenced to prison." He entered the Federal Medical Center prison in Rochester, Minnesota on June 22, 2016.

       I have not been able to find any Pence statements about Hastert after his molestation confession......have you?  All these links are regarding the uproar when Hastert supported Mark Foley.  TIA

       Pence is at best a defender of Child Rapist Hastert, the longest serving GOP Republican Speaker of the House in history, or at worst, as he has admitted a CONVICTED CHILD RAPIST. Who just reported to Federal Prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       DID Pence DEFEND that Child Rapist?

       a non-bias here.
my question is time frames of defense, by Pence, of said child molester.
was he convicted at the time of Pence defending him publicly?
or was it directly related to this conviction of pedophila?
      </p>
      <p>
       regardless, they are all full of shit. 
this whole political bias on this sub is too strong.
too many people have been lead astray by propaganda from both sides.
they are all in it together. 
one big happy secret society.

       Is it possible that Hastert was framed? Letter agencies are suspected of doing that kind of stuff to whistleblowers. Perhaps Hastert wasn't playing ball as Speaker.

       Hastert plead guilty. He reported to prison last week.

      <p>
       Mike Pence wrote long letters defending his family friend, who Pence has known since 1965.

       I'm not saying he's innocent. But if putting these people in high positions is a way to maintain control, perhaps he angered the higher ups and was exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Systems of control. Used to be you were a commie. Later on, you could be exposed as gay. Now, the stakes are raised even higher.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just playing devil's advocate a bit. But yeah, if he really angered the powers that be, there would be no way to hush things up.

       This fake news narrative is really getting tired.

      <p>
       edit: Also, so many inconsistencies with the story, has anyone determined what kind of "gun" was actually used if any? I remember hearing none at first, then an assault rifle, then a shotgun. Then there were no shots fired, then 2, then 3, some in the flood some in the wall, this whole things just smells like shit.

       There could be children's lives at risk - why is she not asking difficult, probing questions to make sure that it isn't real instead of being extremely biased and playing along with James' sob story?

       Megyn Kelly had James Alefantis on Fox News tonight to discuss Pizzagate. They distorted the story and it's origin, and demonized the investigation as a "witch hunt". They didn't show any more than 2-3 of his instagram photos, and they left out the comments (which was where the real juicy stuff was). The whole thing was not even close to what would be considered real journalism, she just threw some softball questions and sympathized with him. She's a garbage reporter...

       I think she's just more of a mouth piece with a prettyish face than anything else. Absolutely not an actual reporter though since she's just fed lines some someone else and she says them to the camera. Just like ron burgandy.

       I don't get what was wrong with the interview.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Instagram pictures they showed were the same two or three that are on every pizzagate thread. The comments were meaningless, as most of them came from other people. The story origin was correct: people on social media went through the Podesta email leaks and built up a narrative about the pizza shop.

       Well, she's a bit of a hypocrit, because she was a big deal during the presidential debates. She built herself up to be this powerful, strong woman who asked Donald Trump the tough questions as a debate moderator and they marketed her as a warrior of truth. Then, when the time
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       calls for tough questions, she's all sympathetic to this poor pizza shop owner who is one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the city, and glazes over his scandal. She's so full of shit, it's obvious, and I believe she is well aware of what she is covering for. You can see her fake/overacting in her responses and her handling of the conversation with James...Sick.

       One of the things they like doing is indignantly stating the relationship they have to their alleged victim, scoffing at the question, as though the nature of the relationship makes any accusations totally absurd and fantastical.   Anyone can look up the most basic information about child abuse and figure out it's most frequently perpetrated by someone that has access to the child, that the parents trust and has a relationship with the child.  You'd think they'd bother to look this shit up and adjust their lies but I guess they are sticking to what's been proven to work.

       What surprise me the most in all of that.... is how people seems surprise about how the interview happened.

       I mean... You guys really thought she would ask real questions? She works for Fox News ffs.

       Also, James Alefantis would never go on the big stage without being sure he is not walking into a trap.

       None of the tweets from the people there mentioned hearing shots till after police said there were shots and they were referenced as such.  So there was some thought here that he never fired a shot because people would have been tweeting that if he did, or hell even if he knocked over something that made a loud bang; AR-15s are loud as hell, if that is what he had on him. That being said the place holds a lot of concerts so they may have some decent sound proofing and he did have a sidearm that may have been fairly silent too.

       I have a question. Why do people keep saying that James Alefantis is the 49th most powerful player in Washington? What does he do other than run a pizza joint? Oh, who originally said he was the 49th most powerful, I keep seeing it but they never say...according to...whatever source they use.

       I'm not saying he's innocent. But if putting these people in high positions is a way to maintain control, perhaps he angered the higher ups and was exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Systems of control. Used to be you were a commie. Later on, you could be exposed as gay. Now, the stakes are raised even higher.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just playing devil's advocate a bit. But yeah, if he really angered the powers that be, there would be no way to hush things up.
