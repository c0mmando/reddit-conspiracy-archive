       The word gravity is a noun, it is what is known in physics as a "force" which is defined as a vector acting on an object causing acceleration inversely proportional to the object's mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       A vector is a mathematical entity with a magnitude  (e.g. 46.5), a unit (e.g. Newton), and a direction (e.g. toward the ground).
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravitational attraction exists between all objects with mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exact mechanism driving gravitational attraction is not fully understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Einstein's General Theory of Relativity provides a mathematical model for understanding gravity as the bending of spacetime by massive objects (think a bowling ball sitting on a rubber sheet, but in 4 dimensions).
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory is mathematically useful for predicting astronomical phenomenon, and was further vindicated with the discovery of gravitational waves earlier this year at LIGO (gravitational waves were predicted by Einstein 100 years ago... look into LIGO it's pretty cool).
      </p>
      <p>
       But Einstein's equations conflict with the equations of quantum mechanics, so there must be a gap in our understanding somewhere. But they're workin on it.

       I think it is, but we're not ready to discard our current erroneous theory. Also I think Einstein was a shill who did not meaningfully contribute to science. His theories are basically based on Lorentz transformations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity is an effect, and the fact that we ignore electromagnetism in our cosmology when it is a much stronger force than gravity should hint at what's actually in control. Consider that matter is held together by electromagnetic bonds, both ionic and covalent. Consider plasma is the most common state of matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the only way to explain gravity waves is if we also accept the existence of an 'ether' because waves cannot travel in a vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I've said enough unpopular opinions.

       It is easy to see that the dominant effect influencing astronomical bodies is gravitational, and not electromagnetic. The gravitational force is only attractive. This explains the motion of the astronomical bodies we can see: moons bound to planets, planets bound to stars, and many stars bound together into galaxies.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, electromagnetism can be attractive or repulsive. Two objects are attracted if they have opposite charge and are repelled if they have negative charge. Taking this into account, electromagnetism could be used to explain the motion of a two body system, such a a planet and its moon. You could just say that the two bodies have opposite charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when you expand to a three body system, you see there is no possible way that all three could be attracted together under electromagnetism. There is no value of charge that the third object could take on to be attracted to both of the other two. And yet we observe systems of many bound astronomical bodies all over the universe i.e. the solar system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, the force governing the interacting in the example system must be only attractive (gravity).

       This is specious reasoning when chemistry clearly says otherwise. Furthermore, we can use a simpler observation, the magnetic field of a cosmic object is directly proportional to it's gravitational field where equipped. Black holes emit intense magnetic fields, whereas the moon emits a tiny almost insignificant magnetic field. Jupiter's magnetic field is stronger than Earth's, but weaker than the Sun's. So on and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also current gravitational theory can't explain the fact that the stars at the tips of a spiral galaxy move faster than the stars near the center without inventing things like dark matter and dark energy. But are perfectly accounted for with the electrical model.

       Almost every sentence of your post is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemical bonds are not in any way similar to the gravitational attraction between stars. If stars and planets were bound in probability wavefunctions, then you would have a point, but they are not, and you don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Magnetic fields are not directly proportional to an object's mass. If you believe they are, then tell me the numerical ratio to convert from mass to magnetic field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern astronomers explain the faster-than-expected motion of stars at the edge of a galaxy through a distribution of "dark matter", matter which does not interact electromagnetically, but still interacts gravitationally, and possibly weakly. The dark matter still obeys general relativity like all other mass. Extra mass has been observed through gravitational lensing (look up Bullet Cluster), but the particles themselves have not been individually detected.
      </p>
      <p>
       No "electrical model" can hope to explain the faster-than-expected motion of stars at the edge of a galaxy, because as I stated in my first comment, it fails totally at explaining orbits of many body systems. The stars would simply pair off with oppositely charge stars, and not experience any kind of net attraction into a galactic shape.

       There is no direct relationship between an objects mass and the magnetic field it produces. It is entirely possible for a less massive magnet to produce a stronger magnetic field than a more massive magnet. Or for a massive object to have no net magnetic field at all.
      </p>

       Collapsed stars have strong magnetic fields because they are spinning faster.

       I like the documentary everything &amp; nothing by jim al khalili in learning what we know about 'space' or as the name implies 'nothingness' its interesting that when we think of the scales of the universe and the building blocks theories say that even in an empty vacuum particles are constantly entering and exiting existence as sort of fluctuations in the 'quantum foam' something i like to think is that at some level everything is connected one big fabric that we are simply an expression of - our perception of this is amazing as we are literally the universe learning about itself and that thought is so powerful to me.

       I forgot another really fascinating talk from the same scientist talking about quantum effects in biology its very interesting as logically if physics says the quantum world exists we thusly live in it and the rules of the quantum are so alien, so magical in contrast to the material world the possibilities are quite amazing.

       Think of it like dropping a ball onto a stretched out sheet of fabric. After it falls, there is a small ripple effect coming from where it fell. As someone explained earlier, that fabric is like spacetime (except spacetime is 4D, it's really fucky), and the ripples are gravity waves.

       Really anything with mass has a gravitational pull. F=G[(m1*m2)/r
       <sup>
        2]
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       G=gravitational constant
      </p>
      <p>
       M1=mass of object 1
      </p>
      <p>
       M2=mass of object 2
      </p>
      <p>
       R=distance between obects
      </p>
      <p>
       So you have a gravitational pull yourself. Anything with mass does. Just the more mass you have, the more pull you have

       So is gravity a gradient force or a discreet force? In other words how far away must you be to release yourself from the gravitational influence of a mass? For example we don't feel the gravity from the sun, yet it's strong enough to resist the centrifugal force of the Earth as it rotates around it and maintains it in orbit. That doesn't make much sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also consider that 300 miles above the surface of the earth gravity still applies, in other words the ISS is falling back to Earth, much like a zero g plane that simulates weightlessness. The difference is that it's traveling fast enough for it to fall into the curvature of the earth, in other words it travels fast enough to fall into the horizon.

       Spin a ball, and try to put something on it, and watch the object fly off. If gravity was caused by the rotation of the earth, then objects would stick to a spinning ball because the ball would be generating gravity according to your point of view.

       Real talk, do you honestly believe this? Not trying to instigate, I honestly want to know why you believe it, because it could be true for all we know. Having thought about it it's entirely possible for us to live in a bubble. Our brain uses our mind to filter what our eyes actually see. Meaning our vision is really upside down, and is obstructed by veins, our brain filters out all this to create a picture for our mind to process.

       I like the documentary everything &amp; nothing by jim al khalili in learning what we know about 'space' or as the name implies 'nothingness' its interesting that when we think of the scales of the universe and the building blocks theories say that even in an empty vacuum particles are constantly entering and exiting existence as sort of fluctuations in the 'quantum foam' something i like to think is that at some level everything is connected one big fabric that we are simply an expression of - our perception of this is amazing as we are literally the universe learning about itself and that thought is so powerful to me.

       It is easy to see that the dominant effect influencing astronomical bodies is gravitational, and not electromagnetic. The gravitational force is only attractive. This explains the motion of the astronomical bodies we can see: moons bound to planets, planets bound to stars, and many stars bound together into galaxies.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, electromagnetism can be attractive or repulsive. Two objects are attracted if they have opposite charge and are repelled if they have negative charge. Taking this into account, electromagnetism could be used to explain the motion of a two body system, such a a planet and its moon. You could just say that the two bodies have opposite charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when you expand to a three body system, you see there is no possible way that all three could be attracted together under electromagnetism. There is no value of charge that the third object could take on to be attracted to both of the other two. And yet we observe systems of many bound astronomical bodies all over the universe i.e. the solar system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, the force governing the interacting in the example system must be only attractive (gravity).

       Almost every sentence of your post is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemical bonds are not in any way similar to the gravitational attraction between stars. If stars and planets were bound in probability wavefunctions, then you would have a point, but they are not, and you don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Magnetic fields are not directly proportional to an object's mass. If you believe they are, then tell me the numerical ratio to convert from mass to magnetic field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern astronomers explain the faster-than-expected motion of stars at the edge of a galaxy through a distribution of "dark matter", matter which does not interact electromagnetically, but still interacts gravitationally, and possibly weakly. The dark matter still obeys general relativity like all other mass. Extra mass has been observed through gravitational lensing (look up Bullet Cluster), but the particles themselves have not been individually detected.
      </p>
      <p>
       No "electrical model" can hope to explain the faster-than-expected motion of stars at the edge of a galaxy, because as I stated in my first comment, it fails totally at explaining orbits of many body systems. The stars would simply pair off with oppositely charge stars, and not experience any kind of net attraction into a galactic shape.

       If spin determines the strength of a magnetic field then how do you explain Mercury's field which is almost as strong as earth's? Consider that Mercury takes 50+ days to rotate on its axis.
