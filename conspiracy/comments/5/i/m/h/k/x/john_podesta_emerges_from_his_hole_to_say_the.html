<p>We are now seeing the media use Iraq 2.0 propaganda to brainwash the gullible into begging the US to intervene in Syria. </p>

<p>Looks as though the craziest of all possibilities might occur, and that is hurling us into war before anything gets leaked and long before there is a new DOJ.</p>

<p>Hope I am wrong. But it does appear they are pounding the drums of war, gradually.

<p>This man is an expert on manipulation and cleaning up dirty laundry for others. We should never let him slip away and be forgotten. When he&#39;s quiet, that seems to be when he&#39;s planning to take over the world. The guy basically wrote the book on the Obama presidency before he won the election.</p>

<p>He&#39;s been quiet for some time recently. No doubt strategizing for something, and that something is probably much more near to us than the next election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there are two main possibilities here. One is that it&#39;s all just a psyop horse and pony show, which is always a very real possibility. The other is that the deep state is warring with itself. In that case, why would the deep state be warring with itself? A curious thing. </p>

<p>And we know that the CIA is especially heinous, complicit and very actively involved in corruption that spans the entire world with the meddling, toppling and so on of other nations. </p>

<p>So when we see another faction in the government doing a bit of a step-up to the CIA, it opens the possibility that maybe at least part of the FBI isn&#39;t totally corrupt and is trying to deal with some corruption from within. </p>

<p>Now this very well could just be hopeful thinking, too. Similar to how it makes sense to be skeptical that Trump is really going to walk the walk and not just talk the talk. Again could just be a horse and pony show, since we know that&#39;s a popular and effective divide-and-conquer tactic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also some very treacherous and tricky ground in general. We (as in the people) hopefully know better than to think Russia can be totally trusted or to think that nobody in our government has any connections with Russia behind the scenes, but at the same time we don&#39;t war with Russia, either. And all this political mud-slinging is kind of polarizing into those two extremes, like either the government is totally in bed with Russia or is pushing for war with Russia? Neither of those are good things.</p>

<p>So it could also be interpreted that the FBI and Comey are putting their hands in as many pies as possible to try to get information, trip people up and have influence, in order to catch or put out as many fires as possible, hence their flip-floppin attitude and maneuvering.</p>

<p>But again, wishful thinking? Perhaps. Guess we&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>Then the Clinton email investigation happened twice, which makes his decision-making look weirder, but perhaps this is just a way of signaling what&#39;s going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of reasons. It would legitimize the Russian hacking narrative they&#39;ve been pushing. The average citizen isn&#39;t willing to believe that the government would be willing to declare war to protect their personal interests. If we go to war with Russia everyone will just think &quot;wow the government must be 100% sure Russia was the hacker, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t have gone to war with them&quot;. Another, more obvious reason, is just that it gets people to stop talking about the hacks. If we&#39;re engaged in what is essentially WWIII, what was said in some emails will become a lot less important (especially because most people will believe the emails were Russian propaganda because the government declared war on them, as explained above). The main reason I can see though is that declaring war with Russia will officially make it unpatriotic, and even borderline treasonous, to question the US government. Any criticisms, and all conspiracy theories, no matter how valid will be labeled as &quot;Russian Propaganda&quot; (as they&#39;re already doing in the media), and anyone caught pushing them will be treated as an enemy combatant attempting to run a psy op on behalf of the Russians. Free reign to lock up any dissenters and have the masses applaud you as patriotic protectors in the process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there are two main possibilities here. One is that it&#39;s all just a psyop horse and pony show, which is always a very real possibility. The other is that the deep state is warring with itself. In that case, why would the deep state be warring with itself? A curious thing. </p>

<p>And we know that the CIA is especially heinous, complicit and very actively involved in corruption that spans the entire world with the meddling, toppling and so on of other nations. </p>

<p>So when we see another faction in the government doing a bit of a step-up to the CIA, it opens the possibility that maybe at least part of the FBI isn&#39;t totally corrupt and is trying to deal with some corruption from within. </p>

<p>Now this very well could just be hopeful thinking, too. Similar to how it makes sense to be skeptical that Trump is really going to walk the walk and not just talk the talk. Again could just be a horse and pony show, since we know that&#39;s a popular and effective divide-and-conquer tactic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also some very treacherous and tricky ground in general. We (as in the people) hopefully know better than to think Russia can be totally trusted or to think that nobody in our government has any connections with Russia behind the scenes, but at the same time we don&#39;t war with Russia, either. And all this political mud-slinging is kind of polarizing into those two extremes, like either the government is totally in bed with Russia or is pushing for war with Russia? Neither of those are good things.</p>

<p>So it could also be interpreted that the FBI and Comey are putting their hands in as many pies as possible to try to get information, trip people up and have influence, in order to catch or put out as many fires as possible, hence their flip-floppin attitude and maneuvering.</p>

<p>But again, wishful thinking? Perhaps. Guess we&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>Then the Clinton email investigation happened twice, which makes his decision-making look weirder, but perhaps this is just a way of signaling what&#39;s going on.</p>
