       It's not the we are saying that this for fact what is going on.The problem is that with the amount of information that has been put on there I would just like a real investigation. You know just at least for the possible lives of these children that could be potential being harmed.

       I would have to agree with you. The weird thing is that I can't believe that one doesn't wants to take this into consideration. I mean come on Canada, Norway, and Australia have all been busted with these practices. In 2006 they also were investigating about pedophilles working in the government. That was reported by Anderson Cooper.

       So do you instead mean in your above sentence that the weird thing is that you can't believe one DOESN'T want to take this (i.e. that pizzagate just might in fact have to do with actual pedophilia) into consideration?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, then yeah.  On one level, I don't disagree.  For the record, there are indeed more and more people that are in fact beginning to take seriously where all the incriminating information seems to be leading.  On another level, however, I can also see how many are still blind (willingly or otherwise) considering that the (possible) perpetrators of these crimes are amongst the most powerful corporate entities on the planet - entities who own the mainstream media and all but control the public's mind and perception.

       Sorry I should of proof read, because I meant to put doesn't. I fixed it though. I agree that this is something a lot of people are starting to take serious. They're trying really hard to make everyone believe it's fake. It's not working though people are seeing beyond what they are portraying. We just can't let this story die down. We need to keep pushing this story as much as we can. This could truly bring them down.

       I'd certainly hope so, but I think the rabbit hole is SOOO deep on this one, and the powers involved and implicated are
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       powerful, that they might just be capable of starting WWIII just to distract and take attention away from more deeply investigating this issue rather than allow too much information to be revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why, as you've just said above here, we need to remain
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       concentrated and vigilant about getting to the bottom of this and NOT lose focus.

       Ya the rabbit hole could go very deep into this one. It could almost be just on a total global scale too. Who really knows. I mean it's not like these practice haven't been around before. This was prevalent in greek culture. That's what Antinous story is all about. Then you have people who get really weird with it like Aleister Crowley. He's one interesting character to say the least. We need to keep spreading a discussion on this. We just need to find the truth in all of this mess that is occurring. Then we will finally shut up about it. Until then keep on trying to figure this all out.

       Well…it depends on what that truth ultimately is actually.  If the ACTUAL truth is that there is no pedophilia racket and it’s just occasional, random, unrelated criminals events that take place, then okay.  Prosecute and punish the criminals, and we’ll “shut up” about it.  However, if the truth is that there is an organized pedophilia racket being perpetrated by some of the most powerful figures on the planet? then I don’t think we should shut up about it
       <em>
        at all.
       </em>
       I think the entire human population needs to come together as one and fucking RID the planet of these figures.

       Ya when I meant "we will shut up about it" it was on thew side that if this is fake then we will stop accusing them of this. If this is true we will not let this just sweep under the rug. We will make sure that every single person involved that is from covering the story up to actually committing this crime will held accountable. If this story is true these people deserve to suffer.

       Just read through that whole thing. There's no evidence of anything, just rampant speculation that builds off of other speculations. Though the owner does seem to be a creep just based off his Instagram history, but that's about all I can draw from this.

       I never said any of this was evidence that could be used to bring them down. This is just more to provoke thought of what actually could be happening. There is just huge amount of weirdness going on with this story. The reason we are saying we want an investigation is because we want to know the truth. The emails seem like they are talking in code. Podesta is friends with Hasting who was busted for pedophilia. James Alafantis twitter picture is of Antinous who was a greek child used for pleasure of high greek members. I mean doesn't that seem a little too coincidental. Also with places like Canada, Norway, and Australia being busted with these practices shouldn't we at least look into this a little further.

       You're going to tell that you don't a little bit of curiosity that this maybe true. Seriously Canada, Norway, and Australia have been busted with these practices. John Podesta is friend with Dennis Hestert, who is in trouble for pedophillia.
