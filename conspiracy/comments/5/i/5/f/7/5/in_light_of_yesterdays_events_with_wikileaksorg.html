       Everyone is being attacked. This is drill for US cyber security command, private sector companies etc
      </p>
      <p>
       There are hundreds of billions in oil revenue, drugs, defence contracts and money, at stake. Based upon who controls the government. The pedo stuff coming out is basicly a govt coup. The other group who is in power, has reacted by mobilized DSAC and all the public/private resources they are able to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the assets were moved into the private sector, for intel, data mining and cyber attack/defence. So that these pedo oil drug families could control them. They also own the media and were pushing clinton. There is infighting going on within countries, between the power groups and internationally.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most secure linux is Void Linux, with MUSL, on an ARM process (not AMD or Intel). So get Raspberry PI 3 and get a void linux box and run bitmessage or whatever on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are doing all sorts of attacks. Every attack in fact. They have system they funded to identify things like decryption keys or document links or pdfs or images from internet and to censor them in real time, by intercepting internet traffic. Their program is massive in scale and has been running for years. They weaponized the whole internet. Everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNS system, BGP, the fiber interconnects, the ISPs, SSL/HTTPs, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter. They have weaponized everything. They have control from within twitter/reddit and also external control where they can remove content in real time over the wire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Downloading bitcoin or vpn software, people on windows are reporting the SHA256 hash of the exe they receive do not match. They are live intercepting file downloads and modifying them with backdoors. Then at higher level they are able to backdoor Windows and OSX computers, using the autoupdate functionality if the target is high enough priority.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to change your HTTPS private key, every day or hour. They have a timing channel attack, to recover the private key and once they have it, can live intercept traffic. You have to use LibreSSL and host on linux distro not using OpenSSL. The certificate authorities are compromised to. If they do not have the private key, they will just use invalid cert and you will get an error and have to click through.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on for hours about the shit they are doing. The fact that they are not spamming 200 messages a second on Bitmessage again, probably means that they have control of most of the network and message proprogration. They will run 2000 nodes on EC2, then will use their equipment to cut or degrade connections to servers they do not control.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they see you running an application, they will put you on a list and your computer is automatically targeted for exploitation, to extract your private keys. So that your traffic can be retroactively decrypted. You need to rotate private key frequently (but does not matter too much right now).
      </p>
      <p>
       I know through friend a computer security person in Phippines who was involved with wikileaks and did penetration testing. He was very low down on chain. He had "accident" then disappeared and police said he died. They may have just paid off the police and kidnapped him. They are going after everyone now, but there are too many people. They cannot van 200,000 people. They have no idea who is running the servers and a lot of it is peer-to-peer, third parties running infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALWAYS USE A VPN. Even if you are using tor, run tor inside the VPN. Lantern is an OK free VPN. Paid VPN to country outside of NATO is best thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sure you are using linux. Linux Mint is good. Turn off Zeitgeist. Disable flash in browser.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use multiple Virtual Machines. for different things. consider using
      </p>
      <p>
       The PSYOPs level has been turned up to 11 also. They are spamming threads with idiots. They are designed to lower discussion level or send people down rabbit holes. To dillute information to level where the group cannot effectively function.

       Currently the website is giving a insecure connection error. This is happening because WikiLeaks uses the HTTP Strict Transport Security protocol which basically means that if the TLS connection is what so ever altered, it will refuse to connect or give a warning before connecting. The HSTS was developed to fix the vulnerability of SSL-stripping which was introduced by Moxie Marlinspike,
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie_Marlinspike">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie_Marlinspike
       </a>
       the developer of Signal, the app endorsed by Edward Snowden, that introduced the tool, SSLSTRIP, which forces all traffic to go through HTTP not HTTPS thus making all traffic readable. This protocol also fixed SSL-capable man-in-the-middle HTTP proxies, which if you were under the MiTM, you would get an error telling you to accept a self-issued SSL certificate, not verified by third parties, which could let the attacker decrypt SSL traffic. This happens in Turkey and is commercialized by BlueCoat which got their SSL certificate verified. An example of this is mitmproxy, a pentesting tool that does exactly that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What that means is that someone is MiTM, someone issued a self-signed certificate, or the certificate expired. From the looks of it it seems that someone issued a self-signed certificate, (screenshot) because their is no ownership information.

       I don't think that is what is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the issue is that the HSTS configuration is not honoring Let's Encrypt's certificate, which is the issuing authority here.

       Might be something else, it'll take a bit to look into.

       Quick one: Lantern is not a VPN neither does it give you anonymity.  From the FAQ:
      </p>
      <p>
       Does Lantern give me anonymity online?
Lantern is designed to provide you with unfettered access to information online. Lantern is not an anonymity tool, so if you need or would like to be anonymous online, please use Tor. Otherwise, Lantern will give you faster access to blocked sites.

       is there any point wiping off windows 7 from laptop if im planning on live booting into Tails / Kali?
      </p>
      <p>
       would it limit further the number of possible backdoors?
      </p>
      <p>
       sadly it has a  Intel Core i5 520UM processor...is that when they already began making backdoors on those?

       i dont mind wiping it. its a an old laptop ive gotten out of storage and spruced up / updated. I have another main one.
      </p>
      <p>
       i dont mind wiping Windows and installing linux just my only worry is that i havent seen too many manuals about it for my specific one (think some drivers arent compatible?)
      </p>
      <p>
       but if its recommended ill dig into the linux drive compatibility issue.

       You probably already know this, but for the record it's better to run Tails off of a flash drive so that you can forcibly initiate a memory erase by yanking said drive out of its USB port.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe that there's any risk in keeping a Windows 7 install on your laptop (that I know of).  In fact, using that install from time to time to give it signs of activity are a good cover for other things you might be using the computer for.  If you're using a local coffee shop's WiFi, for instance, you might connect to it in Windows and remember the connection so that it looks like something you habitually use.

       You're quite welcome.  To the best of my knowledge, and to what I believe to be the best of common knowledge, it does not matter what OS is on the internal hard drive.  As long as you're booting directly into the flash drive (either because you've set it up as default or because you interrupted the boot to choose it as the boot disk) Windows code does not get an opportunity to execute at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there are other possible ways that you could be compromised.  A big one is that someone (presumably a state actor, for now) could exploit Intel's Management Engine (or the AMD equivalent) and gain virtually carte blanche access to your entire computer.

       The firmwares of hard drives and flash drives can be replaced with versions that engage in malicious activity, as well, though I don't know if those are attack vectors you have to worry about when launching Tails from a flash drive.  For extra caution, you can make a new CD/DVD every time Tails is released and boot from that.  You won't be able to set up a persistent partition, but once burned, the disk is pretty much tamper-proof.

       ive been trying to google this but i cant find any mention of AMT / IME for Intel Core i5-520UM laptops. Could you confirm whether this only affects more recent ones?

       if so, isn't that quite an easy way to get around this? or has it been known as something else previously?

       According to Intel, the i5-520UM supports v-Pro, where v-Pro is integral to IME.  Here's the page for that particular chip:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/47554/Intel-Core-i5-520UM-Processor-3M-Cache-1_06-GHz">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is a bit on v-Pro/IME/AMT:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/vpro-amt-management-kvm,3003-6.html">
        http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/vpro-amt-management-kvm,3003-6.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I only became truly aware of the pervasiveness of IME/AMT a few weeks ago.  I had an Ivy Bridge ThinkPad and it had the option of disabling various features (the anti-theft feature in particular could be irrevocably disabled) but...you know, it comes down to trust, basically.  You have to trust that the BIOS is gonna do the things you tell it to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm under the impression that even if the processor supports v-Pro, the motherboard must also support it.  It's possible the mobo of your laptop doesn't.  Without knowing the make and model, I can't say one way or the other.

       A "mainstream" linux distro will probably "just work" even if it is an older computer. May have some funky wireless issues but it usually just works. The main issue with drivers are video drivers but at the same time, you won't be gaming on an old laptop etc.

       You know what? For the love of God, don't run Tor over a VPN.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was interested in trying to relate your identity and your Tor presence, a VPN would make it awfully trivial if I had access to the provider (by correlating timings among other things).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you seriously don't want your ISP IP to talk to your guard node, use sockschain or something (even though that too wouldn't be extremely effective either).

       so I noticed my podcast website caravantomidnight.com  started acting funny yesterday. They are a legit site that you must subscribe to run by John B. Wells. I was always able to get to it at work streaming a podcast and when I was switching podcasts yesterday it gave me a SSL certificate warning. Now I can't get to it. Right about that time I tried on my phone and could not get to the website. It reported that it was having trouble contacting the server. The site was down for more than an hour. He has made comments about being attacked, having a modem fail about every month and guests that are talking about things like sandy hook routinely have their Skype connection cut during the interviews.

       I dont agree with you. If you connect to Tor from your home, the ISP knows you are using Tor. They may not know what youre doing, but they know youre using Tor. Using a VPN simply moves that trust to the VPN provider.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say hypothetically Wikileaks has been taken over by the CIA and they are logging everyone that comes on. If you come in on Tor, it wont matter whether you connect to Tor from your ISP or from a VPN- they still have no idea who you are. Now lets say they drop some malware.
      </p>
      <p>
       If youre going You--&gt; ISP--&gt; Tor--&gt; Wikileaks, any malware defeating Tor will reveal your actual IP address assigned by the ISP.
      </p>
      <p>
       If however youre going You--&gt; ISP--&gt; VPN--&gt; Tor--&gt; Wikileaks, any malware defeating Tor will reveal your VPN exit node IP (assuming they dont defeat OpenVPN, or that you have a firewall setup to block all packets not traveling the through VPN tunnel interface). In order to reveal you, theyd either need to get the VPN logs (which they may not have), or do timing correlation attacks to determine the entrance IP originating the requests leaving the VPN exit node that then went to the Tor entrance relay, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, it
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be useless. For all you know your VPN could be a honeypot or could easily be subdued by the .gov legally. Its impossible for us to know. Even in this worst case, its no worse than defeating Tor when you connect to it from your ISP.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as you have
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       leaks handled, Tor must be defeated to reveal your identity. They can use malware, or try to control the entrance and exit with honeypot nodes, but ultimately they must defeat it to get you (unless you reveal information related to other accounts with known links to your real IP etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       A VPN is just another step in the chain. It could be anywhere from meaningless to a pain in their ass, but it certainly isnt worse. Ultimately, doing everything you can to ensure Tor isnt getting beat should be your priority.
