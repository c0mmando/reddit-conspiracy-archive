        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you don&#39;t remember, Bernie had some people purporting to be from the BLM movement storm the stage at his rally and take his microphone.  They refused to let him speak, and Bernie gave them the stage. This seemed like an obvious setup at the time given his unimpeachable record of advocacy regarding civil rights.   The next day (if i am remembering correctly), representatives from BLM met with HRC and essentially endorsed her candidacy.  Has anyone searched this incident in the Wikileaks emails?  It would be interesting to know if this was coordinated through Robert Creamer and company. Long time /conspiracy lurker. First time caller. I&#39;ll hang up and listen...</p>

<p>Honestly - people have gone through Podesta&#39;s emails thoroughly and there&#39;s no sign of it. </p>

<p>Then interesting thing about the Pedestal emails is that they really are the literal tip of the iceberg as you&#39;ll see from Podesta&#39;s response to Clinton&#39;s classified email regarding Libya. He responded &quot;interesting, but not for this channel&quot;.

<p>The implication being that really sensitive stuff should be messaged through other mediums..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. I&#39;d never read that part of the story.  Speculating even further...Over the years, there has been a relatively close relationship between the Clintons and John McCain, despite their party affiliations.  One wonders if perhaps a favor was called in.  Bernie was really on a roll at that point if memory serves.  He was really nailing Clinton on her close ties to Wall Street and support for the Iraq war.  This incident changed the national conversation.  Looking into it more, I found an article reporting that the main BLM group claimed no responsibility for the disruption.   All very interesting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speculating even further, Marisa is an FBI informant who is performing standard Cointelpro tactics to damage Bernie not on behalf of Hillary, but on behalf of Comey/Bush.  For Hillary to ask such a favor of McCain risks her entire political career if McCain blows the whistle, for too little gain.  Of course, the obvious Reddit answer is that HRC is responsible for everything and I must be CTR.  I&#39;m sure HRC told the Pentagon to kill McCain if he didn&#39;t obey orders, but since she controls the Pentagon  (and the Kremlin I&#39;m sure) why hasn&#39;t Obama been killed by her yet?   Might as well kill all of them, but since she hasn&#39;t yet it&#39;s part of a bigger plot.  Maybe she has killed them and Donald is surrounded by robot clones, we have to warn everybody.  You get to Comet Ping Pong and I&#39;ll meet you there, 6pm tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even more wild speculation...While the incident does appear to be a setup, I&#39;m not sure anyone can say for certain which operatives were at work.  The story you linked to suggested that the women were linked to Sarah Palin, so I was just playing with the idea that perhaps McCain came through with an assist.  </p>

<p>According to POLITICO, they share a mutual admiration and seemed to enjoy their time in the Senate together.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2012/11/mccain-and-hillarys-bipartisan-bond-084297">http://www.politico.com/story/2012/11/mccain-and-hillarys-bipartisan-bond-084297</a> </p>

<p>From the article:  &quot;Their deep bond and mutual respect was born out of eight years serving in the Senate together, their shared admiration for the military, numerous trips around the world to war zones, security conferences in Germany — they once even took in a sunset in the Arctic Circle.&quot;</p>

<p>I guess I never considered that the FBI via Comey would be involved for the benefit of the Bush family.  I suppose that&#39;s also a possibility, however remote.  I wouldn&#39;t accuse anyone of shilling, since I&#39;m a new poster and deathly afraid of Rule 10. :)</p>

<p>In real-time it appeared the immediate and most obvious beneficiary was HRC, but who really knows?   I certainly don&#39;t. </p>
