<p>ALSO, The Russian hack job scenario was already deployed on the campaign trail and it fizzled out for one very important reason; the entire story depends on the ignorance of the public. </p>

<p>Meaning if someone is going to hack something, they use proxies to hide their trail. Many prefer to mask their location as RUSSIA because it&#39;s a massive landmass with many many tech savvy users. Now the media is using the same trick; masking this story with the word RUSSIA to make it believable. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree that it&#39;s true. I want an investigation and there is allegedly one underway. Those heading it up (Graham, Schumer, McCain) do not inspire my confidence that it is an &quot;independent investigation&quot;. </p>

<p>ALSO, the point has been made that no one seemed to give a fuck when the DNC was caught rigging the election. But now the world is on fire because some Russians might have pretended to be Trump supporters on social media? Naw, smells like catshit to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plus, nobody wants to mention the MILLIONS of $$$ that HC took from foreign powers... That&#39;s <em>real evidence</em> of foreign powers trying to influence our &quot;democratic&quot; processes, which is ignored because people are either too partisan or stupid to understand.</p>

<p>Nevermind that this was the first time that a candidate spent more OPM and LOST the election... the real lesson here isn&#39;t foreign anything, it is the unintended consequences of rigging shit so tightly. Whether it was the monolithic reports about the &quot;Great Recovery&quot; or BS polls (leading people to question <em>everything</em>) , CTR taking over r/politics (and sending all the Bernie supporters into r/conspiracy), or the Twitter suppressions, suspensions and bans (opening peoples&#39; eyes about the harsh realities of PG)...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to clarify what the term &quot;hacked election&quot; means.  What is being taken out of context is the term &quot;hacked&quot;.  First and foremost the actual voting machines were not &quot;hacked&quot;.  They have no connection to the internet, therefore noone from Russia accessed the actual voting system.  What is being confused is the left argument that Russia hacked the emails that lead to costing HRC the election.  This is preposterous at best.  The issue is once again the MSM is using wordplay to convince the ignorant that Russia hacked our machines in favor of Trump, which didn&#39;t happen.  In fact, we most recently learned the only real evidence of vote tampering occurred in Detroit, in favor of Hillary due to the recount request for Michigan.  It would not have been found otherwise, which is why ALL areas that HRC reportedly &quot;won&quot; need to be recounted.  </p>

<p>Now I won&#39;t argue against the possibility that machines can be altered, but not via an internet connection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite what I meant. Every piece of evidence is just a data point; a fact with both strengths and weaknesses in its support. A theorist must come up with a compelling narrative and evaluate the pieces of evidence, drawing a line that connects some data points and ignores others </p>

<p>Some data points have weaker support than others. This includes what some call circumstantial evidence. Some people believe that circumstantial evidence should be rejected outright. I believe that it is valid to include circumstantial evidence, evaluating it appropriately. </p>

<p>So I phrased my post to avoid immediate rejection by some commenters, acknowledging that some evidence is weaker than others while validating that all data points should be included. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems that 99% of the commenter rejected anyway my suggestion to keep an open mind, so maybe I shouldn&#39;t have bothered..☹️ But I will not stoop to their level and will keep my open mind.  I believe this is the core principal of being a conspiracy theorist, and should be the core tenet of r/conspiracy. One man&#39;s opinion. </p>
