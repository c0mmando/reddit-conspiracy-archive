       Instead, I see a bunch of posts trying to minimize or justify this horrendous act. Isn't it the role of r/conspiracy to out these truths? I'm on mobile so can't lay out all the pieces right now, but we can crowdsource the chain of evidence in the comments.

       There is evidence (real and circumstantial) that Trump and Hillary are friends and colluded together to steal the election from the American people to make the powerful more powerful, the rich richer, and the citizens even further removed from any sort of real honest conversation about the world we live in today, the things we've done to it, the things it will do to us, and how we can find a way to live peacefully and together without the constant bombardment of advertising and media telling us what to think and what to do.

       Honduras, Gautemala, Iran, Haiti, Congo, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Afghanistan are just some of he countries over the last century that the US has directly interfered with elections. Is it only a big deal when people do it to the US but business as usual when the US does it?

       From the perspective of an American, yes. If a foreign govt tried to institute regime change in my country, it's a very big deal. I don't understand the moral equivalence about this. Would you be cool if another country dropped an atomic bomb in the US, which isn't a big deal because we dropped 2 in WWII?

       Good 'ole American hypocrisy, as long as we are doing it it's fine but God forbid we be on the receiving end of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to answer your question...if it were an unprovoked nuclear attack, yes I would think that's a big deal even though we dropped two of our own. However, my opinion would change and I would have less of a problem with someone nuking the US if we did something to warrant such a response.

       I've yet to see anything I would call evidence. The Washington Post made a claim backed by an anonymous source, and then all other outlets sourced the Washington Post.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALSO, The Russian hack job scenario was already deployed on the campaign trail and it fizzled out for one very important reason; the entire story depends on the ignorance of the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning if someone is going to hack something, they use proxies to hide their trail. Many prefer to mask their location as RUSSIA because it's a massive landmass with many many tech savvy users. Now the media is using the same trick; masking this story with the word RUSSIA to make it believable.

       I don't understand why we wouldn't examine the issue with open eyes. Don't you agree that if it's true then it would be a huge bombshell? It seems like there's so much effort on this sub to shut down any honest open conversation. Makes me wonder if (Russian?) shills have infected the direction of this sub much in the same way as r/t_D.

       I don't agree that it's true. I want an investigation and there is allegedly one underway. Those heading it up (Graham, Schumer, McCain) do not inspire my confidence that it is an "independent investigation".
      </p>
      <p>
       ALSO, the point has been made that no one seemed to give a fuck when the DNC was caught rigging the election. But now the world is on fire because some Russians might have pretended to be Trump supporters on social media? Naw, smells like catshit to me.

       Plus, nobody wants to mention the MILLIONS of $$$ that HC took from foreign powers... That's
       <em>
        real evidence
       </em>
       of foreign powers trying to influence our "democratic" processes, which is ignored because people are either too partisan or stupid to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevermind that this was the first time that a candidate spent more OPM and LOST the election... the real lesson here isn't foreign anything, it is the unintended consequences of rigging shit so tightly. Whether it was the monolithic reports about the "Great Recovery" or BS polls (leading people to question
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       ) , CTR taking over r/politics (and sending all the Bernie supporters into r/conspiracy), or the Twitter suppressions, suspensions and bans (opening peoples' eyes about the harsh realities of PG)...
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd think that everybody would learn by now, but some people are really that stagnant (or are paid to say otherwise). These are strange days, for sure!

       The bombshell (if Russia did what some people are claiming) is that the Russians helped the Americans by allowing them to make a more informed decision. The only negative interference in this election was by the people who rigged the DNC primaries, cheated in debates and town hall meetings, used the media as a weapon, and used false flag attacks to frame Trump supporters as racists.

       We need to clarify what the term "hacked election" means.  What is being taken out of context is the term "hacked".  First and foremost the actual voting machines were not "hacked".  They have no connection to the internet, therefore noone from Russia accessed the actual voting system.  What is being confused is the left argument that Russia hacked the emails that lead to costing HRC the election.  This is preposterous at best.  The issue is once again the MSM is using wordplay to convince the ignorant that Russia hacked our machines in favor of Trump, which didn't happen.  In fact, we most recently learned the only real evidence of vote tampering occurred in Detroit, in favor of Hillary due to the recount request for Michigan.  It would not have been found otherwise, which is why ALL areas that HRC reportedly "won" need to be recounted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I won't argue against the possibility that machines can be altered, but not via an internet connection.

       I didn't say "hacked", as I computer hacking (although maybe that happened as well, I don't know). I'm saying "conspired", as in coordinated on a variety of actions, including disinformation and others. Let's talk about it!

       OK, to begin with the DNC leaks (not hack) did not really damage Clinton much at all. There is much more damning evidence that could be released by Russia should they have desired to do so. Clinton didn't lose because of leaked emails, that is a dumb excuse. She lost because the world hates her and is scared what she would have done as president.

       I don't discount that possibility. For a long time now, I've seen both parties as being controlled by the same interests and it being an illusion of choice. I'm just holding out a little bit of hope that Trump is truly an outsider.  But my opinion certainly can change.

       But if you've been reading the posts in this sub, people are making the connections to disprove it was Russia. Why do you think the MSM is pushing fake news so hard and at the same time painting Russia the bad guy? Its the same MSM that colluded with the DNC.

       Not quite what I meant. Every piece of evidence is just a data point; a fact with both strengths and weaknesses in its support. A theorist must come up with a compelling narrative and evaluate the pieces of evidence, drawing a line that connects some data points and ignores others
      </p>
      <p>
       Some data points have weaker support than others. This includes what some call circumstantial evidence. Some people believe that circumstantial evidence should be rejected outright. I believe that it is valid to include circumstantial evidence, evaluating it appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I phrased my post to avoid immediate rejection by some commenters, acknowledging that some evidence is weaker than others while validating that all data points should be included.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, it seems that 99% of the commenter rejected anyway my suggestion to keep an open mind, so maybe I shouldn't have bothered..☹️ But I will not stoop to their level and will keep my open mind.  I believe this is the core principal of being a conspiracy theorist, and should be the core tenet of r/conspiracy. One man's opinion.

       The existence of evidence is not sufficient for a particular conspiracy to 'be at number 1'. You aren't suggesting people keep an open mind, you're demanding their attention, and almost insulting them in the same breath.

       The phenomenon as a whole meaning the number of times the United States and other countries have influenced elections openly. The second post from the top when sorted by hot is a time magazine cover from 20 years ago bragging about America influencing a Russian election. It's a double standard to say that it's ok for America to do but not for anyone else to do to America.

       Well no I support the discussion about it, but I see it as short sighted to focus on only this instance. This is essentially the same narrative the MSM is pushing which is a huge red flag for me. You did say you're open to looking into the whole picture though and I respect that
