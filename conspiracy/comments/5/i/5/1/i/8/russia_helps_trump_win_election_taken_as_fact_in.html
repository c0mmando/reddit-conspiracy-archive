<p>Edit: it really shows how controlled media is (not like it wasn&#39;t obvious already) when they won&#39;t even touch the evidence of pizzagate. So anyone who has the argument &quot;the media won&#39;t talk about pizzagate because the evidence isn&#39;t good enough&quot; must feel pretty silly right about now. </p>

<p>Focus on Trump vs. Clinton, don&#39;t focus on what the elite do in their spare time.  Don&#39;t focus on the fact that if we didn&#39;t slave away at our shitty and pointless 9-5&#39;s, the eceonomy would literally crumble.  We must consume, or we die.  We must spend money, or the thing breaks.</p>

<p>This is just the another thing they do to keep people feeling like they understand the world.  Pedophilia?  That&#39;s awful!  I wouldn&#39;t want that to happen.  Well, maybe it&#39;s not.  I feel better already.</p>

Also the Tillerson appointment could already be interpreted as Putin blackmailing Trump and handpicking a Russian surrogate over Mitt Romney. I mean we can dismiss it all we want and circlejerk about Pizzagate and the Clintons, but the only real winner out of this election is Putin and to a lesser extent Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I mean you can definitely try to argue against my &quot;random words strung together,&quot; just know that Trump and America are going to be Russia&#39;s cuck, for lack of a better word, for the next four years. If you don&#39;t believe there was any Russian hacking whatsoever in this past election or if you think it was only against the Dems, wake the fuck up. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/politics/michael-mccaul-rnc-hacked/">http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/14/politics/michael-mccaul-rnc-hacked/</a> while this article is from CNN and you can call it fake news as much as you want, here&#39;s proof of a Republican saying at the very least &quot;Republican political operatives have also been hacked.&quot; There has been hacking and with hacking comes blackmail opportunities, which is exactly what we see here. I had never heard of Rex Tillerson until after Trump was done embarrassing Mitt Romney in front of the nation, is that not a little suspicious along with his close ties to Russia? Also this isn&#39;t an issue that should deal with either being classified as being a part of the &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right,&quot; it&#39;s a matter of sovereignty and national integrity. Honestly though, surprised that someone with such a strong myths-symbol complex rejects information that even slightly goes against the rhetoric of Trump. That is if you&#39;re a real person, for all I know you might as well be a Russian zombie account who posted in this sub. #MAGA oh fuck..... I meant #МРГА</p>

<p>|Why hasn&#39;t he, in the past 18 months, put out anything even vaguely anti-Russian?  Just a coincidence?</p>

<p>The problem with this argument is you can interchange &quot;Russia&quot; with literally any country not mentioned by Wikileaks. I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s Russia or not. But I <em>do</em> know someone has already taken credit, and that there&#39;s more evidence for pizzagate than there is for the Russia Wikileaks link. The integrity/whereabouts of Julian Assange has yet to be determined. I&#39;m not wildly speculating, just sticking to the facts here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually very simple if you think of this not as a group of people willing to believe anything, nor as a group of people in search of the truth through critical thinking. But rather, think of it as a group of people actively seeking to disbelieve what are commonly held beliefs and/or beliefs stated in main stream media.</p>

<p>Then this behavior makes perfect 100% sense. </p>

<p>After all, isn&#39;t a conspiracy theory typically just a theory that most people believe are horseshit, and rejects the commonly accepted version of events? Wouldn&#39;t a conspiracy theory community center around theories that most people believe are horseshit, and reject commonly accepted versions of events, especially if the mainstream media tells it that way?</p>

<p><em>Sometimes</em> the commonly accepted version of events are wrong. <em>Sometimes</em> what most people believe to be horseshit is actually correct. It is healthy to challenge and reject commonly held beliefs, and instead see the logic in an alternate theory <em>sometimes</em>.</p>

<p>But someone who does these things <em>all the time</em> are likely plagued by irrationality, unwarranted paranoia, and believing in uncommon beliefs just because they are uncommon, and disbelieving in common beliefs solely because they are common.</p>

<p>What, then, would plague a community that is balls deep in conspiracy theory <em>all the time</em>?</p>

<p>It does not help that most people who believe in pizzagate <em>genuinely believe</em> that James Alefantis runs a child sex ring out of his pizza parlor, and base this largely on Instagram posts of his goddaughter.</p>

<p>The pizza place being a hub of a child sex ring is <em>literally</em> why it is called &quot;pizzagate&quot;. And people who believe the theory are the ones who gave it the name, not mainstream media.</p>

<p>the &quot;pizza gate&quot; name was disputed on this very sub, with people calling for it to be called &quot;pedogate&quot; so people like you couldnt paint the picture youre painting.  </p>

<p>the &quot;pizza&quot; came from a couple strange emails in podestas archive speaking about stuff using pizza as code, this led to investigation into other pizza related emails in the archives, this then led to that spirit cooking lady which ultimately led to alefiantis.<br/>
alefiantis just happened to be named one of the most influential people in DC<br/>
this led to speculation on his business practices, obviously. the point being, how can a standard pizza shop owner be SO influential? turns out. he has big friends.<br/>
people then sleuth his public info, including his businesses public instagram which was, for a public business that invites children into its doors, highly sexual<br/>
also holds all ages shows for bands that are quite, &quot;artsy&quot;(for lack of a better word) with their content. bands like &quot;heavy breathing&quot; that play songs called things like &quot;all the children&quot; with art that is extremely sexual.  </p>

<p>pizzagate doesnt JUST refer to the allegations regarding alefiantis. pizzagate addresses all manner of powerful people abusing children. google pizzagate norway and youll find that norway has just arrested 51 people including lawmakers and officials. this too, is pizzagate.    </p>

<p>so to say that <strong><em>all</em></strong> people who think pizza gate is real, think these very specific allegations are true is extremely disingenuous   </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the &quot;pizza gate&quot; name was disputed on this very sub</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that a small minority of pizzagaters disputed calling it pizzagate does not change the fact that the majority wants to call it that, that the pizza restaurant is central to the conspiracy theory, or that the vast majority <em>at the very least</em> believes that Alefantis and Podesta rape children, if not all the allegations made against them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the &quot;pizza&quot; came from a couple strange emails in podestas archive speaking about stuff using pizza as code</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do know that the code words, often put on jpegs that PROVE pizzagate is legitimate, were entirely made up by one guy on 4chan and there is no record of them being used in the way they are allegedly being used before this conspiracy theory, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>alefiantis just happened to be named one of the most influential people in DC</p>

<p>this led to speculation on his business practices, obviously. the point being, how can a standard pizza shop owner be SO influential? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe taking a pizza shop owner being featured in a magazine as the gospel isn&#39;t a rational thing to do?</p>

<p>The only <em>feasible</em> way this can be used to support the allegations is if you also believe that the magazine was privy to his child raping satanic rituals in the basement of his pizza parlor, and included him because of the influence hosting these rituals granted.</p>

<p>However, my pet theory is they included him because he regularly hosted fundraisers that occasionally made a lot of money and occasionally big wigs would show up, and the author of the article about the 50 most influential people in DC was down to the dregs because 50 is kinda a lot of people.</p>

<p>I know my pet theory is fucking ridiculous, though. But for some reason I still believe it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>people then sleuth his public info, including his businesses public instagram which was, for a public business that invites children into its doors, highly sexual</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they weren&#39;t. This is objectively false, unless you consider pictures of his goddaughter to be &quot;weirdly sexual&quot;.</p>

<p>Alefantis&#39; <em>friend</em>, and not James Alefantis, posted some sexual jokes involving pizza. And an adult posting sex jokes for his adult friends to see is not proof for a damned thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>also holds all ages shows for bands that are quite, &quot;artsy&quot;(for lack of a better word) with their content. bands like &quot;heavy breathing&quot; that play songs called things like &quot;all the children&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really hope I don&#39;t have to explain to you that a restaurant that normally caters to all ages occasionally hosting events meant for adults is not at all suspicious. I also hope I don&#39;t have to explain that a band that performed in his restaurant also having questionable songs in their catalog doesn&#39;t prove shit. </p>

<p>James Alefantis should not be held personally responsible for every song or every view of every person who ever performs at his restaurant. </p>

<p>Saying that a case that has literally nothing to do with anything about pizzagate, or the &quot;evidence&quot; presented to support the theory, is &quot;also pizzagate&quot; because it happens to be about pedophilia is horribly flawed logic. And you guys only do it because, since this an actually real and credible thing, linking it to your pile of horse shit makes your horse shit look more credible. Not because there is a logical connection between the two.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you say &quot;most Muslims are terrorists&quot;, what you&#39;re saying is egregiously and objectively incorrect.</p>

<p>If you say &quot;the vast majority of pizzagaters believe Alefantis rapes children&quot;, you would be making a true statement.</p>

<p>This is the difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cheese pizza was <em>literally</em> the only thing that was a &quot;codeword&quot; before this came up, and <em>even that</em> was lied about blatantly on the &quot;codeword&quot; list.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong>heese <strong>p</strong>izza was used, explicitly and only, to mean <strong>C</strong>hild <strong>P</strong>orn. That&#39;s the only thing it was standard for.</p>

<p>The bullshit of &quot;cheese&quot; meaning &quot;girl&quot; and &quot;pizza&quot; meaning &quot;little girl&quot; is completely made up.</p>

<p>As is &quot;pasta&quot; meaning &quot;little boy&quot;, &quot;ice cream&quot; meaning &quot;male prostitute&quot;, &quot;walnut&quot; meaning &quot;person of color&quot;, &quot;map&quot; meaning &quot;semen&quot;, and &quot;sauce&quot; meaning &quot;orgy&quot;</p>

<p>It is all <em>completely made up fake horse shit</em> that did not exist before this conspiracy theory, made up by one guy on 4chan. And I&#39;ve seen this &quot;code word list&quot; passed around quite a few jpegs that PROVE pizzagate is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey man, jimmy savilles a pedo and so are some serious officials in norway, thats the shit that pizza gate is addressing. its out there. why not here?<br/>
i agree with all the other random codewords, but there are a few that i recognized like pillow-&gt;prostitute dominos-&gt;domination<br/>
my point being, when a group adopts a certain codeword, the things around the MAIN codeword get codewords too  </p>

<p>for example a kid i knew used to sell &quot;concert tickets&quot;(drugs) &quot;front rows&quot; was the good stuff, floors were other drugs (use band names to specify for example &#39;infected mushrooms&#39; &#39;cocaine cowboys&#39; etc)<br/>
so its not COMPLETELY unbelievable that someone who has actually been in the pedo community or close to it, much like since i used to lurk /b/  i learned about the cp/pizza codewords; its not unbelievable for them to know about the other codewords used, and its not unbelievable that the codewords change from each circle to the next...<br/>
and this is why i suspend my disbelief, because of evidence not only at home (400 kids freed in canada from pedo rings a couple years ago) but also very recent (im sure because of all the pizzagate hubub) high profile arrests and busts over seas (150 terabytes of kiddy porn and only 51 arrests, pretty lackluster if you ask me but i dont know the data on how many TB each guy had)<br/>
if it can happen over there, with their media stars and with their newspaper CEOs covering for them (guy whos now the NYT CEO/Saville). it most certainly can and has happened over here, and most likely is going on to this very day.  </p>

<p>the fact that the DOJ official responsible for child trafficking stuff &quot;liked&quot; the photo of the little girl taped to the table really irks my conspiracy nerve. along with other things. but as you can see its not totally absolutely, completely, bonkers irrational. at least, i think i have made that relatively clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To follow up, I&#39;m on mobile so forgive me<br/>
 The pet theory is probably why the article had him in the list , I agree with that, why he&#39;s so connected is the question in the conspiracy mindset...<br/>
The photos I refer to are pictures of men with pizza over their dicks, which were posted to the comet pizza account. Having that beside the little girl is the contrast I was talking about<br/>
And the shows with the questionable lyrics/songs/art were for all ages. That was the strange bit, that they advertised adult content for all ages.<br/>
Furthermore I agree on the fact it&#39;s all objective.<br/>
And that alefiantis shouldn&#39;t be held accountable for this heavy breathing band. It just so happens that she is the spirit cooking lady who has ties to podesta, which is interesting but still just objectively creepy.<br/>
And then you find out lady Gaga is friends with the heavy breathing girl and then you FU KING SEE LADY GAGA DRESSED AS A NAZI   <sup><sup><sup>OK<sup><sup><sup>Micheal</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>Jackson</sup></sup></sup>   at Hilarys speech and you&#39;re like wtf does lady Gaga have to do with hillary Clinton ?<br/>
So like I said before. It&#39;s not all completely irrational<br/>
And ya the people who adamantly think alefiantis is actively a pedophile is high, but to my knowledge there hasn&#39;t been a statement addressing all this pizza gate stuff and that just fuels the conspiracy.   </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a disservice to dismiss it so easily.<br/>
Dave Chappelle said the worst thing you can call someone is crazy. because it&#39;s dismissive , and there&#39;s no want to look further to find out the why.<br/>
And as I have laid it out the why isn&#39;t sooooooo unbelievable. Surely there&#39;s something afoot. Could be kiddy rape, might be a good idea to find out for sure tho...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re misinterpreting the issue regarding this Russia narrative. The problem people have is there isn&#39;t any concrete proof the Russian government directed or orchestrated any of these leaks, and yet the media is reporting this as fact. The truth is, the NSA would have conclusive evidence if it exists. There is a reason we haven&#39;t see that yet, and that&#39;s because it doesn&#39;t exist. Everyone who knows anything about how this works understands that tying a phishing scheme to a Russian server / entity is not conclusive evidence, whatsoever, especially considering how attribution capabilities have evolved.</p>

<p>So the media needs to be reporting this as, &quot;it&#39;s possible the Russian government orchestrated these leaks, we believe that to be the case, but the reality is we&#39;re just not sure right now. The DNC was breached multiple times, and at least one of those breaches involved Russian actors who are least one step removed from the Russian government. The person or group responsible for leaking these emails to WikiLeaks could also be tied to a different foreign country all together or to an inside source. If the investigation into these leaks yields definitive proof, we will provide that. Otherwise, based on everything we know, it seems most likely that Russia is responsible, yet we cannot say that conclusively at this point.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s why people don&#39;t trust the MSM. It&#39;s not honest. At all. What I just said is realistically what the MSM needs to be saying if truth is important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There actually isn&#39;t a responsibility to support pizzagate for journalists. Taken straight  from the Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics </p>

<blockquote>
<p>– Avoid undercover or other surreptitious methods of gathering information</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the cornerstones of  the Code of Ethics is to minimize harm </p>

<blockquote>
<p>– Realize that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves than public figures and others who seek power, influence or attention. Weigh the consequences of publishing or broadcasting personal information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s part of the reason, so many journalists have come out against Wikileaks. Wikileaks is not journalism, they don&#39;t follow  the code of ethics. They don&#39;t question the motives of their sources (literally mentioned in the code of ethics), they don&#39;t respect people&#39;s right to privacy (other than their own), they&#39;re not  accountable nor transparent  (one of the cornerstones of the Code of Ethics) but they do seek truth and report it.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, there isn&#39;t a moral journalistic responsibility to report on pizzagate. The code of ethics is very vague, simultaneously calling for journalists to seek truth but there is also a responsibility  to protect the  public and respect (especially private individuals) right to privacy and  in particular they actually have a responsibility to</p>

<blockquote>
<p>– Avoid pandering to lurid curiosity, even if others do</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it&#39;s pretty obvious to me, (albeit as a firm pizzzagate skeptic) why they haven&#39;t reported on this. But even if you do believe in pizzagate you can see there is justification from their side to not report on it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right. The Russian infiltration into Reddit is just a conspiracy that is baseless. That said, it is still a conspiracy as much as pizzagate, which was on the front page for more than month already.</p>

<p>Nobody can deny <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> during the last month before election. Though, I believe its possible in a way, similar to an agent provocateur at a protest. It definitely happened from both sides. You never know with those guys, but the security community has been warning our dumbass government for decades over their lack of security. It is about time they wake up to the fact that they are not alone in this world.</p>

<p>In the end, Hillary truly lost with her lack of interest in the midwest. Scott Walker should have been her canary in a coal mine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it pretty fucking depressing. On top of dealing with serious personal and mental health issues for 30-some years now, I know for a fact how corrupt and disgusting and fucked our overall system is. And how the majority refuse to even look at it. But that&#39;s &quot;just a part of human nature,&quot; I try to remind myself, albeit a small part. Some Humans are being inhuman to other humans and seem to love it: must still be human nature, an evolutionary hold-over.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really difficult to ponder this sort of mess and not feel so shitty and helpless, that I can slowly watch in disgust, my society circle down the drain and only hope humanity will one day grow the fuck up; it bothers me on a deep level, and yet I&#39;m essentially powerless to do anything besides feel sad at where we are today. </p>

<p>At least one day I know I&#39;ll finally die and can let go of everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you in more ways than one. 25 years of depression/anxiety since I was 9 years old. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time by myself reading, watching, researching, but mostly just paying attention. The funny thing is I have a lot of really good friends but many of them don&#39;t want to know this stuff, they just don&#39;t. I don&#39;t blame them, and I am now extremely cautious who I talk to about this subject with (no matter how well I know them).  I also have a lot of fully functional, amazing people in my life that see this too, but what do we do about it? As someone who totally relates to you, do yourself a favor and just try and minimize your intake of information like this, because it mostly just hurts yourself and condition more than anything at this point. I wish I had an answer for you. I&#39;m at a pretty low point right now too, and I&#39;ve wished and prayed for death more times than I care to count. I can&#39;t tell you to stay strong because that&#39;s impossible when one is low, I just wanted to let you know you aren&#39;t alone in your thoughts, no matter how fast the internal gears start spinning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its all extremely shocking to say the least. It&#39;s hard to not be depressed realizing the scope of corruption and true terror perpetuated by the elite. But I feel like now more than every it&#39;s important to have hope, and <em>finding</em> hope is harder than ever. I have faith that there are forces actively combatting the cabal.</p>

<p><a href="http://stevepieczenik.com/about/">Steve Pieczenik</a>: One of the world’s most experienced international crisis managers and hostage negotiators, received his B.A. from Cornell University, trained in Psychiatry at Harvard and has both an M.D. from Cornell University Medical College and a Ph.D. in International Relations from M.I.T. He was the first psychiatrist ever to receive a PhD. He served four presidents as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Bush Sr. and was a Senior Policy Planner under president Reagan. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ov5kvWSz5LM">this video</a> Steve states that he is speaking for a group of select members from 15 agencies in the US who are devoted to bringing down Hillary and all those involved in the attempted coup.</p>

<p>There is a significant amount of scientifically backed data to support the fact that our brainwaves effect the world around us. Thinking negative thoughts creates disorder, chaos, and deterioration. Whereas positive thoughts create universal harmony. It may sound like some hippie new age crap but the science supports the idea that the strongest way to influence and change the world is to feel love; and spread knowledge lovingly to the best of your ability. </p>

<p>Will this stop pedophilia or any of the terrors inflicted on us directly? No way. But I truly believe it will influence and create a wave of higher consciousness that will speed the collapse of this worldwide cabal by influencing those who have the power to reveal what can only be described as demonic acts of terror. </p>

<p>Have I lost all credibility yet? We NEED open minded people like you more than ever to not give up, and not lose your momentum and desire to see justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is not going anywhere. It has been all over this sub for over  month. Anybody on this board who is vehemently (for some reason?) trying to silence and stifle pizzagate discussion, you&#39;re wasting your breath...</p>

<p>I know I always say this, but this is a fucking conspiracy related sub. I would think the kind of people who frequent a conspiracy sub would be relatively open to questioning the official mainstream media narrative. The skeptics are literally echoing MSM talking points, and you&#39;re on a conspiracy forum, where <strong>NOBODY here trusts the media. You are not only wasting your breath and your own time by relaying their narrative here and slapping down the legitimate questions we have, but you guys look ignorant for pushing that stuff here.</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty funny actually, think about what you are doing. You&#39;re literally coming onto a conspiracy sub, discouraging an independent investigation and protecting the Elite who are implicated using mainstream media talking points as your rationale. Thats the stupidest thing I&#39;ve ever heard in my life, you are going to get nowhere. It&#39;s a fucking conspiracy sub! Everybody here hates and distrusts the elite and the media, and you&#39;re on here essentially protecting them and telling us we shouldn&#39;t bother looking into this. Ha! Thats classic!</p>

<p>I have never seen a &quot;conspiracy&quot; so aggressively attacked. Especially one that is actually backed by mountains of circumstantial evidence, that no rational person could overlook. Ignoring even the slightest chance that these kids could be in danger is stupid and selfish. The shills are going to try and split this board up over this issue, and divide us. We need to unite under this issue. I can tell you right now that millions of people all over the world are taking Pizzagate and the content in Podesta&#39;s emails seriously. You guys are smart enough to see that they are covering their tracks, deleting twiter posts and instagram photos, and the media is launching a fucking onslaught of &quot;fake news&quot; attacks, they likely staged a false flag gunman to demonize our investigation, and now they&#39;re trying to de-legitimize Podesta&#39;s emails with this new Russia narrative. They are blatantly scared. If you are still denying pizzagate, than you simply do not possess the ability to see the big picture in your head. The majority of people on this board are able to, we encourage a questioning attitude and we have an innate distrust of authority, we don&#39;t attack or try to embarrass others for looking into something as you are doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok maybe I&#39;m missing something. Where is this evidence for pizzagate? All I saw were Instagram photos of babies playing with money, a smiling girl goofing around with sellatape, a few symbols in corporate logos and a pizza shop owner emailing someone about pizza. I&#39;ve seen guys on 4chan claiming responsibility for pizzagate and high giving each other over it getting picked up by the media. </p>

<p>Did this whole thing start from the fact 4chan use the term &quot;cheese pizza&quot; when talking about child porn? </p>
