        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;An argument can be made that FBI Director James Comey has multiple conflicts of interest when it comes to interfacing with the great and the good, and the Clintons in particular. Based on the evidence available to hand – one could easily flag-up Comey’s relationships and past and present involvement with questionable banks, and the Clintons – as a type of conflict of interest (albeit indirect), if not an accessory to  institutional corruption, where Comey’s role as a top-level ‘fixer’ is self evident – fixing outcomes for those members of an elite international club of high finance and organized crime. Could this be the case? Let’s investigate…&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Many will also be unaware that before Comey was installed by the Obama Administration as FBI Director, he was on the board of Director at HSBC Bank – a bank implicated in international money laundering, including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;So according to the establishment narrative, Comey is the who will “keep an eye on the banks” and “help stamp out corruption,” while the opposite seems to be happening. Has Comey been put in place to stop corruption, or to enable it? His record certainly warrants some study on this point.&quot;</p>
