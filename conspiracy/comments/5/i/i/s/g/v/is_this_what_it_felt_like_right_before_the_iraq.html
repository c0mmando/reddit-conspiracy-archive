    <div class="md"><p>The reason it is more insane today is because people don&#39;t believe the lies anymore. In the run up to the Iraq war Bush had an 80% approval rating. The silent majority was pro-Iraq war because people wanted revenge for 9/11. America truly was nation of sheep in 2003. It is not like that anymore and TPTB know it. They lost control of narrative. More people believe in conspiracy theories than believe in the official story. The mainstream media and the government have almost zero credibility right. Every lie they tell is just waking more people up. The people have awoken and it makes me so damn proud. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lead up to Iraq/ Afghanistan was sickening and pushed so hard by the media. They were relentless as sycophantic. Any public figure who dared question was practically blackballed. </p>

<p>This media collusion in the face of blatant lies was the first step in redpillification for me. I didn&#39;t know anyone who was for the war, and some of them went to huge protests in DC and other cities, and they said there were tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people there. Yet the media didn&#39;t report a whiff of dissent. And the illegal wars began. I started to realize that the government does as it pleases, with the collusion of the media, and f*ck the rest of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same, same but different. With the Iraq war, you can look at the PNAC documents and see they planned to invade Iraq before Bush was even in office. With this current Russian red scare, I think it&#39;s a convenient scapegoat for losing so bad in the elections. And/or to deflect from the exposed corruption. </p>

<p>The major difference from now and then is the Internet. If you had a dissenting opinion there was no major platform to voice it or share information. There was no Facebook, Twitter or reddit. Almost all politicians and sources of news were pushing for war back then. Anyone prominent who disagreed got publicly character assassinated. It was more difficult then to find different perspectives than what the mainstream media was feeding us.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree about that key difference. The Iraq war and other shenanigans of that time were keyed in by some old school, deep state, Skull and Bones m&#39;fers. This new crowd is new money compared to all that. Even Trump&#39;s military junta/cabinet isn&#39;t on the level of these dudes.

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. The Bush and Neocons had the advantage of most of the country wanting war after 911. They started using that to blame Saddam directly for 911. Then it morphed to vaguely insinuating his involvement to WMDs and spreading freedom.</p>

<p>I still think there are several secret societies behind most that goes on or ready and waiting to take advantage of it. Then and now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest irony, for me, was that I got most of my information from NPR, at that time. They did numerous pieces questioning the validity of the &quot;official&quot; narrative and disputing the information from Chalabi. Yesterday, I tried to listen to NPR, in order to stay apprised of what the MSM is feeding people. Had to turn it off after they said &quot;Fake News&quot; three times within one minute. </p>

<p>FOX was considered &quot;Infotainment&quot; and was unapologetically pro-Bush Regime. They were so obnoxious (loud, seasickening graphics and lots of shouting) that I couldn&#39;t suffer them. Overall, the pro WMD propaganda, in the MSM, was dominant that you didn&#39;t dare speak out against it for fear of being labeled a &quot;traitor&quot;. It was much more forceful; and the the element of desperation to cover the sickness wasn&#39;t as obvious as in this new program.</p>

<p>If you listen to their voices, it&#39;s not hard to hear that they don&#39;t even believe what they are spewing. God, we are fucked!</p>
