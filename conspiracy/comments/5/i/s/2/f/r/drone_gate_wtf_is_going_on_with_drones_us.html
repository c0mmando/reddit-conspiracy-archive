        “My primary focus right now is in directed energy research,” Matlock said. “Our goal eventually is to integrate a high-powered, solid-state laser on a long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle operating in the stratosphere where the atmospheric disturbance of the aircraft and the laser is significantly reduced.”

       Yup it's just some straight up bullshit. Basically they want to make sure that no one is able to spy on their illegal ass shit. So the people in the government got together and claimed some nonsense about plane attacks and possible terrorists and now you have to register your drone with the FAA or w/e and so now if your drone is caught spying on people that you should be allowed to spy on i/e judges, senators, congressman who are meeting with sketchy ass people or taking bribes then you'll be sent to jail.

       This chinese drone seizure thing is silly. A good friend of mine worked on that ship. The drones survey the ocean floor, and the Chinese have been constantly following them for years and years. When they were pulling the drone in, the Chinese ship came up and snagged it and sailed away. Shit happens all the time, but this time a sailor on the ship took pictures of it happening and posted it on Facebook pretty much saying "lol china trolling us again...". It spread quickly and the MSM got ahold of it and spun it into some "acts of international aggression, how Donald Trump handles this will be pivotal in our relations with China moving forward." when in reality what happens is the Navy calls China and goes "Guys...give it back" and China goes " lol k sry."
