<p>Matthew 7:21-23</p>

<p>21 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ 23 Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Am I saved if I acknowledge Christ, even if I don&#39;t go to church and am probably far from how my friends live who have christianity as a part of their identity?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about these things a lot lately and I&#39;m happy I found this thread. I am technically Christian I guess since I was baptised? I read childrens bibles and the new testament a bit when I was younger out of curiosity because they were just given to me by people I trusted but thats about the extent of it all.</p>

<p>All the stuff going on in the world really has me thinking about that stuff more than I ever have, and I want to be on the side of righteousness in this life.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember the criminal who was crucified with Jesus and asked Him to &quot;remember me when you come into your kingdom.&quot; Jesus responded, &quot;today you will be with me in Paradise.&quot; I believe all it takes is a repenting heart who acknowledges Jesus as the son of the true God who loves us, and you&#39;re already in his army.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this. I always come out feeling comforted when I get a chance to interact with someone who knows scripture well. I still feel weird saying I&#39;m a Christian but the more quotes like that I come across the more I&#39;m pushed towards believing in Christ&#39;s words and actions. </p>

<p>A reoccurring theme in my life right now is looking for truth leads me to enlightenment, and then peace. It feels significant beyond just conspiracy theories and politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a former Roman Catholic, myself, now more spiritual. I suppose, once you realize &quot;Jesus&quot; may have been controlled opposition, you think a little differently (me). What is the bible (and which one) to you? Also, what makes you think anything written in it, is of any significance, if you think the only way to heaven is through another man. Jesus was a child of God, just like you, no different. He taught, the Father/Creator comes only through within yourself, but that got corrupted (imo), into relying on a third party for salvation. You are a creator, for the Creator created you... </p>

<p>Also, see my other comment in this thread.. I was once where you are, as well.... I don&#39;t mean that as snobbish, but genuinely trying to provoke thought...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i guess its just something i feel in my heart is true and have faith in that, i believe that theres a lot of disinfo out there and this worlds set up to confuse us and turn us away from Jesus and God.  yes i know theres conspiracies that its a control ruse through the elite but thats where faith comes in, you arent supposed to have clear evidence and need proof on every little thing, you are supposed to look at it as through the eyes and mind of a child.  and i have a revised standard version, its old it was my grandfathers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100%. Bible&#39;s been telling us the truth for thousands of years, and the prophesies in Revelation are unfolding as we speak. Time to pray hard and study the Bible; Jesus is coming soon. </p>

<p>PS: many people will discredit the bible or spout mysticism or things about &#39;the law of one&#39; new age stuff. Look into it if you&#39;d like, it&#39;s good to be open to everything, but just know that if you read the Bible it talks a lot about false teachings towards the end. So do your own research and pray for truth above all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Might as well ask for citations on the Easter Bunny.  Here are a few gems, though.
1. God loves us, which is why he made hell, for 99℅ of us to burn for eternity.
2. God gave Canaan to the Jews because he&#39;s super cool.  All they needed to do was slaughter every man, woman, child, and animal who already lived there.
3.  God made the world perfect, which is why it&#39;s such a fucked up mess.  2legit.
4.  There is not a shred of evidence that the events of the (early) Jewish history happened, as claimed.  Contrast this with archaeological evidence available for most other old civilizations.</p>

<p>Just a few chunks, in a sea of bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus is the singular biggest enemy of the NWO since He claims to be the Jewish messiah. The end goal of the secular/pseudo-atheist/zionist plan is to bring forth a different messiah, at which point the false Jews who claim to be Biblical jews (but are not)–this synagogue of Satan–will try to install a global zionist tyranny with Jerusalem as the world capital.</p>

<p>They hate nothing more than Christianity, since Christianity condemns their every deed. They have committed countless unspeakable atrocities–human experiments in the name of scientific progress, secret agencies going around murdering innocents, the planning and execution of genocides, wars waged to enrich themselves, killing millions of civilians in the process, turning healthy Christian societies into barbaric, sexually degenerate cesspools of immorality. The atrocities they have committed upon the world are beyond counting and their brutality and ruthlessness in obtaining their goals has no comparison anywhere. There has never been a more perfect global tyranny than that of today, where a small group of ‘elite’ global rulers control every single aspect of our lives while at the same time making everyone believe that this is freedom. Their NWO is 1984 on steroids.</p>

<p>And Christianity has predicted all of this. The prophecies concerning these developments can be found in the New Testament–most importantly, in the book of Revelations where their entire mark of the beast plan to economically enslave the world has been laid out in detail. As is their ultimate fate–and although most of them are deceived and believe they are actually the good guys and that they can persevere and win a war against God–deep inside they know that they are walking on the broad path of damnation and that there is only one end to their journey: eternal torment in the fires of Hell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold your house is left unto you desolate. <strong>– Matthew 23:37,38</strong></p>

<p>Then answered all the people (Jews) and said, “His blood be on us and on our children” <strong>– Matthew 27:25</strong></p>

<p>But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you to councils, and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten. <strong>– Mark 13:9</strong></p>

<p>Ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar and the father of it. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you convinceth me of sin? And I say the truth, why do you not believe me? He that is of God heareth God’s words, ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. <strong>– John 8:43-47</strong></p>

<p>Stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did, so you do. Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers. <strong>– Acts 7:51-53</strong></p>

<p>It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you and judge yourself unworthy of everlasting life, we turn to the Gentiles. <strong>– Acts 13:45-51</strong></p>

<p>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision, whose mourns must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake… wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith: not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. <strong>– Titus 1:10-14</strong></p>

<p>The Jews, who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us: and they please not God and are contrary to all men: forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost. <strong>– 1 Thessalonians 2:14-16</strong></p>

<p>Behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews and are not but do lie; behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet… <strong>– Revelation 3:9</strong></p>

<p><em>So</em> Jewish. /s</p>

<p>Well, these kinds of vague generalities are pretty much useless in any kind of adult conversation.  Of course anything taken to the extreme can have bad results ... but throughout history we see that religion is far more dangerous since it&#39;s based on nothing but passed down fairy tales that people can use for their own gain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes things can be generalized. Of course we look at exceptions, but generalizations are the for a reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Equating philosophy and religion in any way, even in their &quot;extremes&quot; is just plain wrong.  People should be capable of discussing things beyond their &quot;extremes&quot;, especially with things are opposed as philosophy and religion.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes philosophy and religion intertwine. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>One is based on absolutely nothing and panders to people incapable of thinking for themselves and exploiting that ignorance, while the other is about formulating an understanding of the real world through analysis and discovery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, sometimes they intertwine. For example, Buddhism is a religion that many subscribe to because of its interesting philosophical tenets. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whatever, if people say stupid shit they&#39;ll usually get called on it.  The world isn&#39;t a Biblical fairly tale, ignorance has dangerous consequences.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the world is a fairy tale.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At least this thread is being downvoted, gives hope that most people here at this &#39;thinking ground&#39; are beyond this bullshit. </p>

<p>Yes because upvotes and downvotes determine something&#39;s truth lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are thousands of interpretations of Christ and Christianity. Not one can be perfect because people are flawed and are bound to screw something up. Because of that, I study the bible and Christ on my own. I don&#39;t leave it up to other people to explain it to me.</p>

<p>I recently found a church but I am more going for the community. If I went to that church and they said something I disagreed with, I wouldn&#39;t just follow along because I&#39;m going to that church. Religious dogma isn&#39;t important to me.</p>

<p>With that being said, I look for the overarching truths of religion and apply them to my life. I greatly appreciate Buddhism and its tenets, but I am not a Buddhist. However, I&#39;d say I agree with the majority of its teachings.</p>

<p>For me personally, I know there is a God and I know I have a soul. I recently found truth in Christ, and now I&#39;m exploring that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny because many Christians are so hung up on the &#39;rules&#39; that they don&#39;t act like good Christians. But there are stories in the bible where Jesus broke the rules because it was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>With that being said, I am not using that to justify doing the wrong thing. Rather, I might use the Bible as a guideline in my life, but it is not my right to judge how others live. And if I slip up, that&#39;s OK.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m spiritual in the sense that I&#39;m working on my soul, but I&#39;m not religious because I&#39;m not devoted to any religion. I&#39;m devoted to God and Christ. I don&#39;t even cared to be labeled a Christian, unless that&#39;s important to others.</p>

<p>I know this isn&#39;t the best explanation and I&#39;m definitely not &#39;picking and choosing&#39; what to believe. I listen to my conscience, and maybe in some way, that&#39;s connected to God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christianity has nothing to do with Jesus. </p>

<p>Jesus was King Izates who was a Nazarene Jew, but also a descendant of the Pharaohs, Julius Caesar and Syrian royalty. </p>

<p>He was simultaneously heir to the Roman, Egyptian and Persian thrones and went to lead a tax revolt against the Roman Empire and claim his position as Emperor. </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t win. </p>

<p>When the Templars were over in the Holy lands, they heard of this story and brought it back as Arthurian Mythology to get around the persecution of heretics. They brought the secret society knowledge through orders like the freemasons (who jesus was one), and used that knowledge to start the reformation. This lead to the scientific and industrial revolutions and the diminishing of power of the catholic church.</p>

<p>The catholic church is the continuation of the spiritual wing of the roman empire. The other components are washington dc as the military wing and city of london as the financial wing. They claimed all of Izates relics as their own, when actually they were passed down through his familial lines and make much reference to the Pineal gland. </p>

<p>Apparently the ancient Egyptians used to engage in DMT ceremonies inside the great pyramids and the Sinai was full of acacia. The ark of the covenant was made of acacia wood. I&#39;d say Izates was in tune with this old knowledge and through his deep spiritual practice achieved Krsna consciousness. This lead him to make his stake and rebel against the Roman Empire. </p>

<p>After he was beaten, him and mary and his entourage fled to northern europe and dispersed throughout ireland, scotland and france. The city of Orange in France was apparently where Mary Magdalene settled and seeded the reformation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The old testament has amazing ideas on how to make a society, and is pretty great at giving warnings for how it goes wrong and what to watch for.  It&#39;s also awesome at telling you what you have to be careful for, and how to make extremely sound deals (which events break evenly, and which ones do not).  It&#39;s like learning in math the differences between addition and multiplication.  They tried to define which processes are part of the same cycle, and what kind of societal cycles people will go through.  </p>

<p>Jesus was just a dude who dominated being a leader.  He was just the epitome at it, and was simply prophesied that the dude who would be the best at leading us would also be murdered by us because he would ultimately just keep sacrificing and sacrificing and fulfilling other peoples wishes even up to the point where people want him dead for their own stupid reasons.  He just would not stop sacrificing and being awesome. But his whole strategy was boiled down to &quot;whatever you want, do that for someone else&quot;.  So in the end we were &quot;taught&quot; the keys to living in harmony.  It&#39;s really not that crazy to realize that was what it took to make the greatest leader.  It would be like if someone predicted Michael Jordan before he happened and boiled it down to &quot;the greatest athlete will always feel like he has to prove himself&quot;, but there were also a ton of predictions about where he would come from and what things would also happen at the same time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fable. A narrative of both divine and human, both martyr and king, both dead and alive, sold to the masses to incite emotional responses. Even the narrative makes no sense, logically, but that&#39;s supposed to thus be the mystery of the miracle? </p>

<p>If Jesus was God, all churches since the first council would have incurred his return.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look further into the events than just the story it&#39;s been turned into.  Even better if you look into serious research into it.  There is some insanely fascinating stuff about the stars and planets and an event that would have taken place in around 6 BC roughly aligning with Jerusalem.  A professor at Notre Dame is the one doing the research, if you&#39;re interested I could try to look it up and toss you some sources.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory which combines two relatively unknown theories, which are: Jesus could have been Caesarion, son of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra, the true heir of Rome, who was sent to the far East to hide from his father&#39;s killer and to learn from the Mystics in the East.. He then returned home, welcomed as the true heir of Rome and leader of the people teaching peace and spirituality (which is why he was killed by Jews (collaborators of Rome) and Rome - herself). And, parts of &quot;Jesus&quot; were made up (by Josephus) to prove the Piso-Flavian Dynasty&#39;s god status for Ruling Rome, instead of  Julius&#39;s true blood line. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just posted ^ up there about this, didn&#39;t even read your post, read mine. You are right. Jesus is Ra, Osiris, Apollo, Zues, and Lucifer, playing both sides of the coin...the real kicker is that he was Caesar and his son, who took back his roman empire not with the sword but with the cloth, aka roman catholocism, instated by constantine who changed sabbath to sunday, SUN-day....as we know now catholic church is highly involved with peet $$a g@t £   As was Cleopatra her own &quot;daughter&quot;, Selene (moon), aka mary magdalene. They ended up in Europe and continuing on the Merovingian bloodline which ended up in Britain with the current queen who sits atop her throne with the stone of scone underneath, the stone Jacob laid his head on when he saw Jacobs ladder, Jacob and all the Hebrew patriarchs were pharoas, Hebrew patriarchs never existed, that is why there is an obelisque in London called the needle of isis next to a statue of pharoa thutMOSES the third, aka MOSES..It&#39;s reincarnational black magic seen throughout all major religions with these two, osiris and Isis have a son, horus, the king of kings and god of the sun, same Shit over and over until now, it&#39;s almost over, the house of cards is falling, have faith not in god but in love which shall win over all illusion</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They both follow the same story, and maybe the interpretation of events is where the ultimate differences are.  Perhaps that means there is something more to what they share similar, rather than them both being false because they are &quot;different&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus was false prophet, never existed how we think, part of the reptilian bloodline from babylon, king james bible is luciferian occcult handbook edited by Francis bacon, foremost occultist and freemason, i used to be one of them, they &quot;predicted&quot; events in the bible which they helped create of course to wow everyone...Jesus is lucifer, the false sun god apollo...they are both called the lightbringer and associated with the bright and morning star...watch documentary ring of power, Catholicism is Satanism luciferian sun worship, they also worship his mate isis, aka Columbia aka Cleopatra aka Mary Magdalene...in the oxxult group I was a part of a woman (seer) would channel Isis and Jesus, and other masters, for the purpose of helping US serve them and to &quot;ascend&quot;, bait and kill, when I left i was possessed and haunted by demons...seems hard to believe but it&#39;s the truth, Jesus is the great deciever and his name was not jesus the name jesus is encoded with black magic. All this will be known soon. All religions have Sun God and moon goddess. It&#39;s the same two beings folks. Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have found things in the opposite spectrum of that. I see the corruption but that&#39;s why this goes back to our original argument. Religious institutions are often corrupt; therefore, I don&#39;t consider myself religious. However, I am spiritual, and I feel one can be spiritual and still intelligent.</p>
