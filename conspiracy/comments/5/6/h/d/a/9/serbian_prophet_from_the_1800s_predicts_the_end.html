        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">61</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-10-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/_DrPepper_.html">_DrPepper_</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>He predicts many things. He predicted WW1 and WW2. He predicted the rise of Germany and the fall of Germany. He predicted the Soviet Union and American cold war. He predicted the fall of the Soviet Union. He predicted Obama and Putin. He predicted that there will be massive tension between Muslims and Christians particularly in Europe. </p>

<p>Modern day and future prediction:</p>

<p>WW3</p>

<p>He predicts a nation (USA) across the seas (from Serbia) will create tension in Europe between Russia and western Europe (NATO). He says that men from winged tanks in the sky will come crashing down over the lands of Serbia but Serbia will not be involved in this war. He says that soldiers on the ground will be luckier than the ones in the sky. (As he&#39;s telling this story, his friend asks him if he&#39;s crazy by saying winged tanks in the sky piloted by soldiers. He says soon it will be my son. Kind of surreal to hear such stories in the 1800&#39;s). He says the war will not last long because a red headed man will bring peace to the world. He says that there will not be another war after the presence of this red headed man. HERE IS WHERE IT GETS CRAZY: </p>

<p>He says that man will go to other planets but he will not find anything and will not accomplish anything there (sorry Elon). He says that man will ride the moon and the stars looking for life but life similar to ours won&#39;t be found. Life will be there but we aren&#39;t smart enough to figure it out and won&#39;t be able to see it. The more knowledge that mankind attains, the more we will hate one another. There will be such hatred amongst mankind that we will love our contraptions (mirrors and glass--obviously referring to tablets, phones, laptops etc) more than we love those who are closest to us. </p>

<p>He goes on to say that even though there will be no more wars, mankind will destroy this planet and everything else with it. He says that a great illness will come which there will be no cure for. It will wipe out the majority of mankind. Everyone will think they have a cure but in reality, the cure is all around them (I&#39;m assuming he&#39;s talking about a cure in nature). He says that only animals and some people who inhabit a land where the 3 mountains meet will survive. They will repopulate the earth but nothing like what it is today. </p>

<p>He says that man will invent a box with buttons (computer?) but he won&#39;t be able to communicate with the dead with this device. Albeit, it will be close like a two hairs on a human head. </p>

<p>Man will dig into the grounds looking for energy (oil) and after many years and many holes, we will finally realize how stupid we have been and that energy was all around us (I&#39;m assuming he&#39;s talking about solar energy and other renewable energy forms). </p>

<p>He says that people won&#39;t be deceived by the devil. They will be deceives by something far worse. They will believe that their illusions are actually reality (virtual reality anyone?)...</p>

<p>Man will begin to hate fresh air (meaning we will stay indoors a lot). Men and women will wear the same clothes and we won&#39;t be able to tell the difference between one another. </p>

<p>Evildoers will commit atteocities by polluting the air and water which will cause a lot of people to die. Then they will have realized their mistake and instead of solving the issue with numbers, we will solve it through meditation (this one I don&#39;t get at all...maybe he means something else by meditation). </p>

<p>Predicting the atomic bomb: &quot;biggest nations will fight and scientists will invent a new tank so powerful that when it explodes it will blow everything away in existence. Humans, animals, plants will all go to sleep. </p>

<p>He mentions about a million times that man will think they know everything but in reality they don&#39;t know anything. It&#39;s interesting because it&#39;s true. We have never had more know-it-all&#39;s in the history of mankind. </p>

<p>When he was younger he told his mom, &quot;listen mom, I will never get married. At the age of 45, you will bury your son.&quot; 
He died at the age of 45...on his birthday.</p>

<p>He says that he sees and hears everything. He says that he can&#39;t describe it in this human language and that it&#39;s an out of body experience. </p>

<p>Looking at all these prophecies, can&#39;t say I&#39;d be surprised by any of them going forward. Mankind has totally lost himself in the world of illusion. We are pushing ourselves away from our very own existence and trying to entertain this illusion of a life. I&#39;m not religious but I think this line fits perfectly: May God help us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Timeline: </p>

<p>Muslims invade Europe </p>

<p>Small wars happening after WW2 leading up to the last great war, WW3. More men fighting in the skies will die than those on the ground. Those on the ground will be put to sleep and awoke after the war (some kind of coma induced state?). </p>

<p>Only people living in Australia will be safe from any war. </p>

<p>After the war there will be peace and lots of food but this food will be poisoned by a disease that is incurable. People who fast will survive. So, I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s a short lived infecrion but fast acting disease that kills quickly and apparently gruesome. </p>

<p>A redheaded man will come after all this and this will be considered the golden years in mankind history. There will be peace even many years after his death. He will have unified the world under 1 religion (brought together Muslims and Christians). He spends most of his time in Turkey. I&#39;m going to guess this is because Turkey is like the middle guy between middle eastern Muslims and European Christians. </p>

<p>During this time man explores different planets but finds nothing because he cannot see this energy and life form (we don&#39;t have the technology for it). Sorry, Elon.</p>

<p>Then, like history always repeats itself, bad people will come again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be fascinated by this sort of thing, but most of it is written in such a way that it is subject to wide interpretation. There will be technological advancements, wars, etc. Typical human &quot;progress&quot; is not difficult to predict. As for predicting his death at 45, he already decided not to get married so no children and wife to live for. Who&#39;s to say he didn&#39;t drink a litre of vodka per day because , what the hell, he&#39;s gonna die at 45 anyway. People&#39;s beliefs can come true. Self fulfilling prophecy. I had a friend in highschool whose mom was an astrologer. He was an out of control delinquent. She did a reading for him and &quot;predicted&quot; he would spend some time in jail. No shit??? lol. I predicted the same thing without consulting the stars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans are naturally skeptic but deep down we all know there&#39;s a higher power. A higher energy. Who is to say that some people on this planet don&#39;t possess that energy? </p>

<p>Tarabic predicted exactly how the Serbian prince would die (assassination) years after his death. Like the description was to a tee. It&#39;s all documented. Tell me how someone could know something like that. If he could predict one event perfectly then I have to believe that some of the rest is true also. Plus, just reading all this it makes perfect sense. Just listen how he describes the modern world. Is it not true. Are women not dressing like men? (Not that there is anything wrong with it). Are we not more obsessed with our materialistic objects than with those around us? I mean the list goes on. I&#39;m not trying to convince you but I do know deep down you think that there are some people out there with gifts that are not explainable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure but he says it&#39;s a land surrounded by water and as big in size as Europe. So, we can only assume Australia. I have a friend there who is very rich and for some reason he bought a strip of an island in the middle of nowhere and bought a hundred guns saying that bad things are coming. I wouldn&#39;t doubt it to be honest. We are on the edge right now. Tarabic said there will be many small wars leading up to the last great war and then there will be a man who will bring peace for a thousand years. So, safe to say we are fucked in our lifetime but our children and their children are not. Also, there will be a great disease that will wipe out the majority of the population in the world. Only those that fast and don&#39;t eat the diseased foods (everything will be contaminated) will survive.</p>

<p>Or perhaps the poisoned food is the standard American diet that is spreading worldwide, spreading diabetes, heart disease, and depression. And if you abstain from those processed foods perhaps you can avoid these deathly and debilitating diseases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wanted to point a few things out that stuck out to me.</p>

<p>The man is a prophet. It is hard to understand when you read this through a political lens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Everyone will think they have a cure but in reality, the cure is all around them (I&#39;m assuming he&#39;s talking about a cure in nature)&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not a reference to a physical illness. This is a reference to the capability of the human mind to overcome the illusion that they are living in, and discover the truth about reality. I don&#39;t mean the &quot;truth&quot; about the evil in the world, I mean the ultimate truth that can&#39;t be put into words. The truth that Jesus, Buddha spoke of (insert countless prophets here) is the same truth. It is an antidote to delusion, more far reaching in its effects than the cure to a physical illness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He says that people won&#39;t be deceived by the devil. They will be deceives by something far worse. They will believe that their illusions are actually reality (virtual reality anyone?)...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a continuation of my explanation. Not virtual reality. The cure he is speaking of is found in the way we view reality in an inaccurate way, representing our world in a conceptual manner. We create inaccurate mental concepts to navigate this world, we attach to them, and they control us. Our potential (to be like him) is limited by the
concepts we hold dear (whether we think reality is real or fake; good or bad; that things are possible or impossible etc) and any concepts we give credence to add to the delusion that we are somehow &#39;limited&#39; by the fact that we are human. The opposite is actually true, we are limited by the belief that we can only do human things, that nothing could happen unless it follows rules that were written in some textbook. </p>

<p>What happens when you get rid of that subconscious, controlling belief to such an extent that it changes your reality? The same thing that happened to this man.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like this is happening right now. The majority of the population believes the MSM. They don&#39;t believe in conspiracies, that&#39;s why they&#39;re called conspiracies. </p>

<p>People already believe that their illusions are reality.</p>

It seems like the disease is far worse in this situation. It will take a while but mankind bounces back and goes through peace for a 1000 years.

    <div class="md"><p>Meh, one thing you have to realize is that after every major war, mankind comes together and we realize once again how stupid we have been. It&#39;s like when you and your best friend get in a fight and then a week later you are like dude I&#39;m so sorry for what I said and you&#39;re best buddies again. I could definitely see a strong public figure coming in and unifying the world. I think it really makes sense that it&#39;s a Russian for starters because they regulate what happens in Europe/Asia/Middle east. Only other country that does that is USA but we have abused our power too much. Russia hasn&#39;t surprisingly. At least not yet. So, they really do have an edge if things break out. It seems like in this war USA and Russia will once again be on the same side. It won&#39;t be a mainstream war but one between Christians/Catholics and Muslims. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s going to be Germany, France, Russia, Turkey, USA, and middle east. I&#39;m guessing China will profit the most from this war and solidify itself as a
The global leader. I think the rest of the world will move towards peace and unification. NWO doesn&#39;t sound bad on paper but I could see how corrupt officials and politicians could ruin it. Just like democracy. Great idea started in ancient Greece and corrupted. In fact, the Greeks eradicated it because it was a corruptible system but the rest of the world caught on and took charge</p>
