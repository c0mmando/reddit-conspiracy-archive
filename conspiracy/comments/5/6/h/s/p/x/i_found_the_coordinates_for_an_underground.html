<p>Nothing terribly sleuthy involved - The Rainier Test was the first fully contained underground nuclear detonation (1.7 kt), conducted in 1957. This test was part of the larger Operation PLUMBBOB; in 1981 the Defense Nuclear Agency published a full report on it:
<a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a107317.pdf">http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a107317.pdf</a></p>

<p>The chamber is actually a tunnel once drilled horizontally into Rainier Mesa. I couldn&#39;t find specific dimensions. The report indicates a burst height of 880 feet, meaning the chamber had to be at least this large in order to contain it. That&#39;s almost a 9 story building. In a 1989 report by the Technology Assessment Board (ota.fas.org/reports/8909.pdf) more details are given: 
 &quot;It may require 12 months of mining, using three shifts a day, to remove the 1 million cubic feet of rock that may be needed to prepare for a tunnel test.&quot;
&quot;The tunnels are large enough so that satellites can be tested at full scale in vacuum chambers that simulate outer space.&quot;</p>

<p>So why do we care? To me, the significance is merely showing how long the technology has existed for building extremely large and secure underground facilities with little to no surface expression and no leakage of radiation. in 1963 RAND Co. published a report showing the feasibility of building deep underground highways and parking garages beneath major US cities:
<a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM3680.html">http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM3680.html</a></p>

<p>Whether or not any of these came to fruition in secret, I do not yet know. A recent post here provided a tantalizing account of a deep underground city(I of course cannot find it in reddit search, help?); if these exist then there must be evidence.</p>

<p>EDIT: There is an even earlier, more portentous RAND publication on deep underground construction from 1959, pertaining to how well they could be protected from surface nuclear disaster. However, the .pdf is not available for free yet, I will surely report back once I can acquire it:

    <div class="md"><p>It circulates liquid lithium, heated by a small nuclear reactor at the back of the drill - this superheats the rock, making it molten and easy to bore through. The molten rock immediately cools into a dense, glassy material that seals the walls of the tunnel:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think their goal was to have a device that immediately converted rubble into a usable construction material. Then and now, a huge obstacle in large mining and construction projects is where to put all the tailings, and how to quickly and efficiently remove them during digging. A high pressure drill would certainly create a void in bedrock, but a superheated drill melts that rubble and immediately uses it to stabilize the created void, rather than having to constantly construct pillar support behind the drill so that the tunnel does not collapse. No refuse from huge drilling operations and less resources used to stabilize the tunnel, in theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just meant why liquid lithium specifically. Like does it have superior heat transfer qualities, or anything like that? I&#39;ve heard of a reactor using liquid sodium before. I don&#39;t remember what the benefits were other than you don&#39;t need any chemistry control. </p>

<p>Edit: just re read your post. So because the rock would melt immediately then using water is potentially viable?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes, lithium specifically because of its ability to make highly durable, heat resistant glass. Sodium may have adequately liquified and heated the rock, but lithium would then mix with the molten material, cool rapidly and form a strong glass lining for the tunnel. This of course assumes a high silica content of the bedrock being drilled through, which unless drilling through ultramafic volcanics should not be an issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ohhh. So the liquid lithium is somehow excreted. I did a quick google search because in my experience heating anything to the required temperature to melt rock would absolutely cause core damage. But I found something called an advanced gas cooled reactor that seems like a plausible solution to a lot of the problems I had with this hypothesis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One key difference. The submarine is surrounded by water. Which it utilizes to condense the steam from the secondary side of the reactor. 
You maybe won&#39;t believe me, but I used to be one of 6 people that operated the reactor on a US submarine. So I can say with great confidence that while a nuclear powered drilling machine is possible. It&#39;s the least practical means of powering one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the TAB report they address that aspect of underground construction. In discussing feasibility, it is not the logistics of constructing a vast subterranean explosion chamber that act as a stymie, but the extreme aerial visibility of such an operation to enemy surveillance. In America, a very common ruse is to explain to the local public that a new electric power plant is being built (discussed at length here: <a href="http://thephoenixenigma.com/d-u-m-b-s/">http://thephoenixenigma.com/d-u-m-b-s/</a>)</p>
