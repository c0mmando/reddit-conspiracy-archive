My only advice would be take care of you and your family.  Be kind and try to help everyone you can.  It&#39;s not really if everything will go to shit, but when.  Just try to put your friends and family in the best places they can be for anything that may pop up.  Keep your head up warrior, your daughter is depending on you.</p>

<p>Someones trying to prove it to us. I&#39;d say if you delve hard into spirituality and certain drugs you come to that realization. I say realization because you will see what strings they are pulling and on what scale. I would say it&#39;s even to the point of they morph you and let you go and see if you fight the way you&#39;ve been morphed or if you accept it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d suggest you go to nderf.org (acronym, stands for &quot;Near Death Experience Research Foundation), find the &quot;NDE Stories&quot; and &quot;exceptional accounts&quot; pages and read through their archive. That could give you some real insight to the bigger picture of life and ease your mind a little bit. It&#39;s not religious, but it&#39;s helpful to know what the people who actually die and come back have to say about their thoughts about reality.</p>

<p>and FYI, the whole &quot;brain releases DMT at death&quot; hypothesis is just that - not a fact - just a theory someone came up with to explain away NDEs. Go read them and you might not come away feeling so crazy anymore.</p>

<p>also I&#39;d suggest reading some books by people who have apparently had contact with other species, or watching interviews like this one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvhquDI_v_U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvhquDI_v_U</a> -- or look up &quot;Suzanne Hansen&quot; on youtube, or read her book (&quot;The Dual Soul Connection&quot;, co-written with Dr. Rudy Schild who&#39;s an astrophysicist/emeritus research astronomer at Harvard). It sounds from a lot of people like there are &#39;good beings&#39; who are already helping, and that a lot of them are in the world trying to improve things currently.</p>

<p>think about how much the world has improved for commoners in the past 200-300 years, I&#39;d say they are doing a good job, or people are doing a good job improving things themselves all on their own, we now have the internet, almost everyone in the west (and east!) has electricity, hot water, transportation, etc. The world is already changing for the better, although there are extremely rich people and powers who want to hold on to their old slave states - it&#39;s just not going to work out for them in the end.</p>

<p>Another good ET interview would be: <a href="https://youtu.be/rLFKtmftUvs">https://youtu.be/rLFKtmftUvs</a></p>

<p>another would be the Jim Sparks story (wrote a book free online called &quot;The Keepers&quot;, read it). Also the Travis Walton case and experiences. There are more people having ET experiences than anyone can imagine. Another good example or two are the &quot;Westall School sightings&quot; and the &quot;Ariel School sightings&quot;. look them all up and spend the night watching or reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re welcome, all those things will help to answer your questions, and you&#39;re not alone in your feelings.</p>

<p>also whoever told you about the ETs disabling ICBMs is correct, it did happen, here are the nuclear workers (missile launch control officers, security personnel, etc) talking about it at a press conference where they all went public about it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUU4Z8QdHI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUU4Z8QdHI</a></p>

<p>one of the launch control officers is named Robert Salas (i believe he was a Captain in the USAF before retiring), he wrote books about his experience, a good one here: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MS2RVXW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MS2RVXW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;btkr=1</a> - but he also talks about his experience on youtube and radio for free,</p>

<p>also if you buy that book by Suzy Hansen (The Dual Soul Connection), don&#39;t stop reading it half way through, the author starts out on the &#39;shallow end&#39; and it might seem boring when she&#39;s explaining how her experiences started out, but then it becomes serious and offers in-depth answers to most of your questions from the point of view of someone who (I believe) has had actual experience with &#39;other beings&#39;.</p>

<p>There are many, many people who have ET encounter experiences. Another very believable example is a guy named Bret Oldham, whose story you can find on youtube - he says at one point he was allowed to ask them a question, and he was a kid so asked them &quot;do you believe in god&quot; - and they responded &quot;<em>we are all one with the one who is all</em>&quot;, which fits in very nicely with the experiences that people who have died and been resuscitated had, as well as spirituality in general.</p>

<p>the rabbit holes of these subject go deep, but they generally point to something good - rather than something hopeless and bad.</p>

I have medical problems and I&#39;m afraid if I don&#39;t have another baby soon I won&#39;t be able to. I also have learned a lot about the world recently and it scares the shit out of me. I don&#39;t want my daughters future to be the way it seems the world is going. I don&#39;t want to bring another child into this world of it is truly going to hell. I also don&#39;t want this to be all in my head and to sacrifice the chance to grow my family for something so uncertain. At this point I feel pretty lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am saddened by your pain.
I can offer you this, since you are questioning many things...
There is either an afterlife , or there is not. 
If there is not, then we are just intelligent animals. Regardless of how we came to be, whether it be natural evolution,  or alien genetic uplifting, if there is nothing after death, if we do not have a soul, then truly nothing matters. Everything is arbitrary, good and evil are just concepts that have no meaning outside what humans agree them to be.
For example, a lion killing a zebra is not considered  &#39;bad&#39; or evil, it is doing what is natural. And so if humans are just evolved animals too, then humans killing humans for example are not &#39;bad&#39;, we are doing what is in our nature. It is neither good nor bad, just part nature, regardless of how cruel it is. Ultimately in this case, we are no better than ants. We live and die, but nothing matters except our short existence.</p>

<p>If however there exists something beyond death, some form of spiritual energy that carries on, then we can imply that we are here for a reason. What that reason will depend on who you ask. Also, if this is true, then there must be certain laws that apply. Just as physical laws apply to this physical universe, spiritual laws must apply to this spiritual universe.
The concepts of good and evil then are then not derived solely from human thought, but come from outside of us from these spiritual laws, and applied to us. And so, those who perpetrate good or evil, will eventually have those laws applied to them when we encounter the spiritual world.
Since you are confused, start back at the beginning. Do you believe humans have a spiritual component or not? </p>

<p>If so, then all the evils of this world, all the suffering has some sort of meaning, a purpose even though we may not know what. 
Lastly, Truth seeking is important, but do not let it consume you. Do not worry about it so much. Your heart will be lighter for it.
Please read Matthew 6:25-34. You will understand without me having to paste it all here. 
I hope this helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have really believed in the spiritual type things. Like our souls, how we have chakras, how everything has vibrations and good and bad frequencies. Things like that.
 How our pineal gland is our 6th sense and how we were once at a higher state of conciousness.. But I am questioning EVERYTHING. everything at this point. 
But the &quot;ant&quot; thing  you said, really does have me thinking.... Because it really makes a lot of sense. 
And the whole right and wrong thing I have thought about that a lot but I don&#39;t think humans should kill just to kill... I wouldn&#39;t be against killing another human who is corrupt and just a disgusting human, or a human killing an animal for food because they are hungry. But humans killing mass amounts of other humans and animals just really does seems wrong. But then again lion will kill other lions Cubs and shit... But to me humans are something a bit more unique and enlightened i guess you could say... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you will get so many different opinions, I tell you to focus on the beginning and work out from there. That is why I ask you to make a choice between evolved animal, or spiritual being. Make a decision about what you believe. Be logical in your conclusions. Once you have established a foundation within yourself, only then can you venture outward. Right now you have no foundation, no structure,  and you are swimming in information and don&#39;t know how to integrate it. You are building a library with no shelves!</p>
