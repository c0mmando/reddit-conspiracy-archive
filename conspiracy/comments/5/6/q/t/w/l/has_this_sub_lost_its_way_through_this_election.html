        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all, a lot of the stuff Trump camp claims about Hillary&#39;s is not a conspiracy theory. It has varying degrees of truth to them but it&#39;s all pretty well known by now.</p>

<p>A conspiracy theory would be thinking Trump is really an agent of the Democratic party sent to destroy the Republican party from within. He did support the Clintons, donated money to them and used to advocate raising taxes on the rich to pay the national debt before he ever considered running.</p>

<p>A conspiracy theory would be thinking there&#39;s a social engineering plan taking place behind the two major parties and no matter who wins, the powers that be keep making the calls. Trump is set up as a heel in the WWE style, which would not make sense if he was acting like a real human being.</p>

<p>I look at the election and I just don&#39;t buy what I&#39;m seeing. Trump saying ridiculous things constantly  and Hillary being constantly exposed for corruption/ineptitude would not happen unscripted. Mysterious forces in the background revealing very damaging things about whichever one takes a lead is very suspicious.</p>

<p>The DP, knowing all if Clinton&#39;s skeletons would not jump to nominate her. The RP knowing Trump was acting like a psychopath would not nominate him either.</p>

<p>Come on r/conspiracy, am I alone in this? Help me out here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct and agreed, and TPTB know this as well.  That&#39;s why they keep us disunited, fragmented, and at each others&#39; throats.  It&#39;s because they understand that a public united as one <em>cannot</em> be stopped.  A public all deciding on the fate of the world <em>together</em> and with a similar vision of un-manipulated prosperity that functions <em>without</em> an overbearing elite cannot be stopped.</p>

<p>So they do everything they can to make sure that we&#39;re kept confused, dumbed down, constantly bickering and fighting each other over attacks that TPTB themselves create and foment behind our backs and unbeknownst to us.</p>

<p>We need to simply decide on a <em>better</em> fate of the world.  Every day.</p>

<p>A) It’s not about “belief”.  It’s about knowledge - a far different thing - and knowing that who I myself am is not all <em>that</em> dissimilar to what many other Americans are.  I’m willing to stand up and fight.  I’m not alone.</p>

<p>B) This has almost nothing to do with <a href="http://65.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8jv618r6h1qfvq9bo1_1280.jpg">voting</a>.  This is about much more than that.  It’s going to take a lot more than voting to fix this nation’s problems.</p>

<p>I don’t imagine much will happen in 30 days, but I don’t see this country <em>not</em> going down to the shitter and <em>hard</em> as hell if things continue the way they have been as of late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you likening the general rung of the citizenry of the United States to &quot;cats or turtles&quot;?  Perhaps I&#39;m misinterpreting, but if you are, then that is speaking very low of yourself, of your family, and of those people closest to you.  Are <em>you</em> a turtle/cat?  Is your mom? your dad? your siblings?  I realize that many of our parents - being older and pretty much stuck in their ways - may very well not understand or realize what&#39;s really going on in this country, but I&#39;m not sure that likening the whole of the population to &quot;turtlecats&quot; is either very fair or very accurate.</p>

<p>I&#39;d personally say that <em>you</em> aren&#39;t all that asleep...are you?  I mean you&#39;re here in this sub aren&#39;t you?  I&#39;m <em>definitely</em> not asleep.  I might not know everything that&#39;s happening (by far), but I&#39;m definitely not &quot;asleep&quot;, and I work hard every day to become more and more awake.</p>

<p>My point is that I think there are a lot more people like the one I see in the mirror than you might otherwise think - and if all those people were to come together and work toward a united cause <em>together</em>, then a LOOOT could be accomplished independent of how hard TPTB work at being so nefarious against the masses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we do our own thing and focus on our own personal interests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, and we need to realize that &quot;our own thing&quot; and &quot;our own personal interests&quot; would be entirely undermined if we ignore the fact that there are powers that are taking advantage of <em>all</em> of us collectively.  Not realizing that absolutely adversely and detrimentally affects our <em>own</em> personal interests.</p>

<p>I may not like you, for example, but if making sure and WORKING WITH YOU and holding hands with you together and marching/working together ensures that <strong><em>I</em></strong> end up living and prospering, then you better believe that I&#39;m going to have you hop the fuck on my &quot;brotherly love&quot; bus.  You&#39;re getting hugs and you can be assured that we&#39;ll be fighting <em>together</em>...and it, again, won&#39;t even be because of <em>you</em> or because I <em>like</em> you or anything.</p>

<p>If working with you and getting along with you ensures that me and my family live properly? then we will <em>definitely</em> be getting along together.</p>

<p>In other words, my well being depends on <em>your</em> well being.</p>

<p>If you go down, I go down.  We all go down.</p>

<p>So no.  I won&#39;t be stuck doing my own thing if and when I realize that the best way I can do &quot;my own thing&quot; is to make sure that we are <em>all</em> okay and doing well.  That&#39;s priority.  Working together so we <em>all</em> do well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand that humanity is being manipulated covertly to <em>do</em> wrong, and if it were instead manipulated (covertly or overtly) to do <em>right</em>, then the civilization in general would do far better and be far different than anything you&#39;re describing.</p>

<p>Here.  Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s">this</a> and understand just how adversely manipulated human civilization has been.  It&#39;s a manipulation that absolutely never <em>had</em> to be the way it is.  Those manipulators could have worked just as hard and just as effectively toward enlightening humanity instead of making them (us) into unthinking consumer whores.</p>

<p>You imply that being aggressive unthinking consumer whores is simply the default way humanity <em>is</em>.  Absolutely nothing can be further from the actual truth.  It&#39;s very relative really and the direction that the species goes depends a lot on the outside forces influencing it.  The outside forces influencing it are, as of the moment, rather nefarious, self-interested, and working toward disadvantaging the species for its own benefit.</p>

<p>It in <em>no</em> way has to necessarily be that way, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again (sigh) you’re simply not understanding A) what I’m actually saying, and B) that you yourself are actually tacitly <em>agreeing</em> with what I’m saying.</p>

<p>No one here is saying that humans are some “pillar of wanting to do right”.  That was never even <em>implied</em> in my previous response.  The point is, as I said above, that humans are malleable and can be worked on to do either good <em>or</em> bad.</p>

<p>And we’ve been worked on to do <em>bad</em>.</p>

<p>That’s why you and people like you think that “humans are just nothing but bad, man”.  It’s because much of humanity has indeed comported itself in a less than positive manner.  However, what you fail to understand is that there have been constant, negative influences weighing down upon Earth humans <em>getting</em> them/us to act in the manner the species has acted.  You think it’s just some sort of “natural” inclination to be like this when it’s actually not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ive seen enough videos and done enough drugs that have expanded my mind to what we are. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol.  If you’ve done what you’ve said you’ve done here, then trust me.  You have expanded exactly <em>nothing</em>.  You’ve, in fact, done nothing but atrophied yourself and made yourself more of a slave than you already are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the dawn of time, man has been satiated by the blood of others, whether we are manipulated or not. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it is amply apparent that what you continue to have zero clue about is that since “the dawn of time”, as you put it, humans have been manipulated covertly by other forces much more powerful than it.  That’s why we’ve comported ourselves like we have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are tribalistic and by default find the exclusion of others better than inclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Beyond</em> quite incorrect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the basis for all derision we see, our base instinct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s <em>your</em> base instinct - the one you’ve allowed yourself to be convinced is the case; the one you see when you look in the mirror at this point in your life and have figured it’s easier to simply project that out to the rest of the world - when little is necessarily that way in and of itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man is grimy and a gutter phenom and there is no glitter in the gutter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there need be absolutely no “glitter” to still be able to accomplish far greater things than have currently/recently been the case.  As such, none of what you’ve mentioned has anything to do with the species’ ability to realize the potential it very much has within itself to accomplish far greater things than you’re aware of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the &quot;pro Trump sub&quot; issue you bring up: </p>

<p>There&#39;s proven to be conspiracies in the most literal sense of the word with Hill-dog&#39;s DNC sandbagging Bernie, the CTR gang on Reddit, the whole FBI email thing. Shit&#39;s absolutely screwy with the CGI/Clinton Foundation as well. Clinton&#39;s a real-time conspiracy dangling right in front of us. Of course there is going to be interest in it here.</p>

<p>So in that regard it may seem &quot;anti Clinton&quot; (and therefore attract a pro-trump crowd to a degree). But at it&#39;s core is an issue of powerful assholes rigging a system and acting beyond reproach. That&#39;s bread-and-butter interest around these parts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ross Perot probably was an outsider. When he got close enough to be a serious contender he said he was threatened by a mysterious party so severely he was forced to withdraw. Perot was a very rich and powerful man so to be forced to withdraw, it must&#39;ve been something pretty serious. Later he came back just in time to spoil the election for the Republican party.  It all seemed pretty fishy.</p>

<p>In comparison Trump seems like more of a collaborator. Otherwise he would have met the same fate.</p>

<p>I pretty much believe your conspiracy theories, because I take a meta view of partisan politics, but this paradigm also limits my ability to see certain things.</p>

<p>Trump saying ridiculous things constantly and Hillary being constantly exposed for corruption/ineptitude would not happen unscripted. Mysterious forces in the background revealing very damaging things about whichever one takes a lead is very suspicious.</p>

<p>This is very key, I believe, to understanding the larger picture. It seems, like so much of our society, the &quot;reality tv&quot; version of spectacle has pushed out issues of substance. WHY? Who doesn&#39;t want us to go through the motions of debating tough issues anymore...? </p>

<p>This is a question and a topic that must be discussed in depth because it leads to the people and the root of the cancer that has overtaken America. </p>

<p>This whole primary and election process appears to have been presented in the &quot;reality TV&quot; format. All of the glaringly obvious election fraud events were glazed over and ignored. Trump was so conveniently used as the grand distraction away from the reality of the hard core corruption and on to the meaningless trivial garbage that now occupies the minds of most Americans.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NWO supports Hillary Clinton, so it&#39;s hard not to back Trump. Also, the Clinton&#39;s have several decades of corruption under their belt. Trump is not a career politician. There were talks last time time Hillary ran of making her husband president of the UN, and then abolishing America&#39;s sovereignty and ushering in the NWO. Hillary is a member of CFR, Trump is not. I could go on and on. IF Trump is just a shill for Hillary and the Democrats, then this is one of the greatest cons ever. With Hillary, we know with 100% certainty she is NWO, one world government, sell out to the highest bidder, open borders, etc. With Trump, there is a small glimmer of hope that we might be electing an outsider. Worst case scenario, Trump is a shill, but it would still be the end of Hillary and Bill&#39;s political career(hopefully). I&#39;d love to see that rotten cunt get sent packing, and out of American politics for good. So I gotta support Trump. If he&#39;s a fraud, and sells out, at least the silver lining will be that Hillary is done for good. </p>

We are tribalistic and by default find the exclusion of others better than inclusion. This is the basis for all derision we see, our base instinct.
