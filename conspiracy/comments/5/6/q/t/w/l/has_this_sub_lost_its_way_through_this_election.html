       First of all, a lot of the stuff Trump camp claims about Hillary's is not a conspiracy theory. It has varying degrees of truth to them but it's all pretty well known by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       A conspiracy theory would be thinking Trump is really an agent of the Democratic party sent to destroy the Republican party from within. He did support the Clintons, donated money to them and used to advocate raising taxes on the rich to pay the national debt before he ever considered running.
      </p>
      <p>
       A conspiracy theory would be thinking there's a social engineering plan taking place behind the two major parties and no matter who wins, the powers that be keep making the calls. Trump is set up as a heel in the WWE style, which would not make sense if he was acting like a real human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look at the election and I just don't buy what I'm seeing. Trump saying ridiculous things constantly  and Hillary being constantly exposed for corruption/ineptitude would not happen unscripted. Mysterious forces in the background revealing very damaging things about whichever one takes a lead is very suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DP, knowing all if Clinton's skeletons would not jump to nominate her. The RP knowing Trump was acting like a psychopath would not nominate him either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on r/conspiracy, am I alone in this? Help me out here.

       It doesn't have to necessarily come crashing down directly upon our heads as a citizenry, of course, but this Western bullshit corporation known as "The United States Of America" has caused far too much damage to continue on as it is.

       We citizens need to shape up

       Correct and agreed, and TPTB know this as well.  That's why they keep us disunited, fragmented, and at each others' throats.  It's because they understand that a public united as one
       <em>
        cannot
       </em>
       be stopped.  A public all deciding on the fate of the world
       <em>
        together

       and with a similar vision of un-manipulated prosperity that functions
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       an overbearing elite cannot be stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they do everything they can to make sure that we're kept confused, dumbed down, constantly bickering and fighting each other over attacks that TPTB themselves create and foment behind our backs and unbeknownst to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to simply decide on a
       <em>
        better

       fate of the world.  Every day.

       The fact that the citizenry has been trapped into thinking this and believing this utter lie and doesn't realize just how much power it truly has unfortunately ensures that things very well might be brought crashing down in this country - and we the citizenry along with it.

       A) It’s not about “belief”.  It’s about knowledge - a far different thing - and knowing that who I myself am is not all

      <p>
       Are you likening the general rung of the citizenry of the United States to "cats or turtles"?  Perhaps I'm misinterpreting, but if you are, then that is speaking very low of yourself, of your family, and of those people closest to you.  Are
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       a turtle/cat?  Is your mom? your dad? your siblings?  I realize that many of our parents - being older and pretty much stuck in their ways - may very well not understand or realize what's really going on in this country, but I'm not sure that likening the whole of the population to "turtlecats" is either very fair or very accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd personally say that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       aren't all that asleep...are you?  I mean you're here in this sub aren't you?  I'm
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       not asleep.  I might not know everything that's happening (by far), but I'm definitely not "asleep", and I work hard every day to become more and more awake.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that I think there are a lot more people like the one I see in the mirror than you might otherwise think - and if all those people were to come together and work toward a united cause
       <em>
        together
       </em>
       , then a LOOOT could be accomplished independent of how hard TPTB work at being so nefarious against the masses.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        we do our own thing and focus on our own personal interests.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yeah, and we need to realize that "our own thing" and "our own personal interests" would be entirely undermined if we ignore the fact that there are powers that are taking advantage of
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of us collectively.  Not realizing that absolutely adversely and detrimentally affects our
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       personal interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may not like you, for example, but if making sure and WORKING WITH YOU and holding hands with you together and marching/working together ensures that
       <strong>
        <em>
         I
        </em>
       </strong>
       end up living and prospering, then you better believe that I'm going to have you hop the fuck on my "brotherly love" bus.  You're getting hugs and you can be assured that we'll be fighting
       <em>
        together
       </em>
       ...and it, again, won't even be because of
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       or because I
       <em>
        like
       </em>
       you or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If working with you and getting along with you ensures that me and my family live properly? then we will
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       be getting along together.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, my well being depends on
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       well being.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go down, I go down.  We all go down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no.  I won't be stuck doing my own thing if and when I realize that the best way I can do "my own thing" is to make sure that we are
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       okay and doing well.  That's priority.  Working together so we
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       do well.

       have you never heard the phrase "herding cats" Its a phrase meant to give the idea of trying to get those dont care to follow a concept. I am not asleep and probably one of the least asleep you will come across, but i also know that you will not wake the masses that chose not to be awoken. Your ideals are incongruent with the truth of humanity, we are barely out of the caves and still committing mass genocide on ourselves

       You don't understand that humanity is being manipulated covertly to
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       wrong, and if it were instead manipulated (covertly or overtly) to do
       <em>
        right
       </em>
       , then the civilization in general would do far better and be far different than anything you're describing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here.  Watch
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s">
        this
       </a>
       and understand just how adversely manipulated human civilization has been.  It's a manipulation that absolutely never
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       to be the way it is.  Those manipulators could have worked just as hard and just as effectively toward enlightening humanity instead of making them (us) into unthinking consumer whores.
      </p>
      <p>
       You imply that being aggressive unthinking consumer whores is simply the default way humanity
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       .  Absolutely nothing can be further from the actual truth.  It's very relative really and the direction that the species goes depends a lot on the outside forces influencing it.  The outside forces influencing it are, as of the moment, rather nefarious, self-interested, and working toward disadvantaging the species for its own benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It in
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       way has to necessarily be that way, however.

       its not manipulation. Mankind is not some pillar of wanting to do right, we are 99.9999% gray and the rest good feelings.  Ive seen enough videos and done enough drugs that have expanded my mind to what we are. Since the dawn of time, man has been satiated by the blood of others, whether we are manipulated or not. We are tribalistic and by default find the exclusion of others better than inclusion. This is the basis for all derision we see, our base instinct. Man is grimy and a gutter phenom and there is no glitter in the gutter.

       Again (sigh) you’re simply not understanding A) what I’m actually saying, and B) that you yourself are actually tacitly
       <em>
        agreeing
       </em>
       with what I’m saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one here is saying that humans are some “pillar of wanting to do right”.  That was never even
       <em>
        implied
       </em>
       in my previous response.  The point is, as I said above, that humans are malleable and can be worked on to do either good
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we’ve been worked on to do
       <em>
        bad
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s why you and people like you think that “humans are just nothing but bad, man”.  It’s because much of humanity has indeed comported itself in a less than positive manner.  However, what you fail to understand is that there have been constant, negative influences weighing down upon Earth humans
       <em>
        getting
       </em>
       them/us to act in the manner the species has acted.  You think it’s just some sort of “natural” inclination to be like this when it’s actually not.
      </p>

       lol.  If you’ve done what you’ve said you’ve done here, then trust me.  You have expanded exactly
       <em>
        nothing

      <p>
       And it is amply apparent that what you continue to have zero clue about is that since “the dawn of time”, as you put it, humans have been manipulated covertly by other forces much more powerful than it.  That’s why we’ve comported ourselves like we have.

      <p>
       That’s
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       base instinct - the one you’ve allowed yourself to be convinced is the case; the one you see when you look in the mirror at this point in your life and have figured it’s easier to simply project that out to the rest of the world - when little is necessarily that way in and of itself.

      <p>
       And there need be absolutely no “glitter” to still be able to accomplish far greater things than have currently/recently been the case.  As such, none of what you’ve mentioned has anything to do with the species’ ability to realize the potential it very much has within itself to accomplish far greater things than you’re aware of.

       Exposing Hilary isn't supporting Trump. There are numerous posts theorizing that Trump is just a HRC stooge. I honestly haven't read one post here that "supports" Trump. Maybe ive missed them.
       <br/>
       And I dont think there are many regulars here who believe that the current Republican vs Democrat political system in America is anything more than a WWE style farce.

       Could it? sure. Will it? maybe. To be fair though, the truth isn't always a positive thing. I personally think HRC is one of the worst criminals ever to run for elected office, but I'm not going to vote for Trump. I don't trust him either....but I don't think he is the criminal HRC is....at least I don't have any reason to believe he is the crook she is....at this time. But I'll tell you what....if skeletons come out of his closet that compare to the ones coming out of hers, ill be just as critical of him as i am of her.

       IMO no, electing people to be part of the current system wont do anything but perpetuate the current system. As I've said many times, the system is rigged and needs to be torn down. The best non violent thing anyone could do at this point is NOT vote at all. Stop perpetuating the rigged system.

       When enough of us do that, then we can really start to build a system that is beneficial to everyone.

       Regarding the "pro Trump sub" issue you bring up:
      </p>
      <p>
       There's proven to be conspiracies in the most literal sense of the word with Hill-dog's DNC sandbagging Bernie, the CTR gang on Reddit, the whole FBI email thing. Shit's absolutely screwy with the CGI/Clinton Foundation as well. Clinton's a real-time conspiracy dangling right in front of us. Of course there is going to be interest in it here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in that regard it may seem "anti Clinton" (and therefore attract a pro-trump crowd to a degree). But at it's core is an issue of powerful assholes rigging a system and acting beyond reproach. That's bread-and-butter interest around these parts.

       But they are not conspiracies at this point. The email fiasco is a matter of public record now. The voter fraud was found and reported on. The participation by the DNC was outed by wikileaks.

       They are news, not conspiracy theories at this point. Yet we keep hearing about it in this sub.

       Trump could have been a plant by the Democratic Party but the more I watch trump the more I think he's a true outsider, something we haven't had since Kennedy.

       Ross Perot probably was an outsider. When he got close enough to be a serious contender he said he was threatened by a mysterious party so severely he was forced to withdraw. Perot was a very rich and powerful man so to be forced to withdraw, it must've been something pretty serious. Later he came back just in time to spoil the election for the Republican party.  It all seemed pretty fishy.
      </p>

       In comparison Trump seems like more of a collaborator. Otherwise he would have met the same fate.

       This is very key, I believe, to understanding the larger picture. It seems, like so much of our society, the "reality tv" version of spectacle has pushed out issues of substance. WHY? Who doesn't want us to go through the motions of debating tough issues anymore...?

       This is a question and a topic that must be discussed in depth because it leads to the people and the root of the cancer that has overtaken America.

       This whole primary and election process appears to have been presented in the "reality TV" format. All of the glaringly obvious election fraud events were glazed over and ignored. Trump was so conveniently used as the grand distraction away from the reality of the hard core corruption and on to the meaningless trivial garbage that now occupies the minds of most Americans.

       The NWO supports Hillary Clinton, so it's hard not to back Trump. Also, the Clinton's have several decades of corruption under their belt. Trump is not a career politician. There were talks last time time Hillary ran of making her husband president of the UN, and then abolishing America's sovereignty and ushering in the NWO. Hillary is a member of CFR, Trump is not. I could go on and on. IF Trump is just a shill for Hillary and the Democrats, then this is one of the greatest cons ever. With Hillary, we know with 100% certainty she is NWO, one world government, sell out to the highest bidder, open borders, etc. With Trump, there is a small glimmer of hope that we might be electing an outsider. Worst case scenario, Trump is a shill, but it would still be the end of Hillary and Bill's political career(hopefully). I'd love to see that rotten cunt get sent packing, and out of American politics for good. So I gotta support Trump. If he's a fraud, and sells out, at least the silver lining will be that Hillary is done for good.

       To me, that's like saying that I'll be a fan of Steve Austin instead of the Undertaker hoping that'll be the end of the Undertaker, not realizing that it's all a show and either way Vince McMahon wins.  The more passionate people get about either candidate, no matter which one, the better, because then ppl becone unwitting soldiers for the status quo.

       If you look at what happens to true outsiders, it's highly unlikely Trump is one. Murder, railroaded out of politics, etc. Look at Perot and JFK. Trump has institutional support. That would never be given to an outsider.

       To a Clinton supporter, it looks as if the sub supports Trump. But, that it not the case. It's just that the level of corruption that Hillary Clinton is involved with is over the moon in comparison. As a result, Clinton posts are a hell of a lot more frequent than Trumps. r/conspiracy supports the Truth and that's all.

       Well I see it this way, the Clintons have been wrapped in the cloak of conspirator for decades while Trump since 9/11 has been easier to identify as an outsider (perceived, real or not) and a CT. So of course the natural lean of the sub will go to the candidate we self identify with the most.

       Correct and agreed, and TPTB know this as well.  That's why they keep us disunited, fragmented, and at each others' throats.  It's because they understand that a public united as one
       <em>
        cannot
       </em>
       be stopped.  A public all deciding on the fate of the world
       <em>
        together
       </em>
       and with a similar vision of un-manipulated prosperity that functions
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       an overbearing elite cannot be stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they do everything they can to make sure that we're kept confused, dumbed down, constantly bickering and fighting each other over attacks that TPTB themselves create and foment behind our backs and unbeknownst to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to simply decide on a
       <em>

       its not manipulation. Mankind is not some pillar of wanting to do right, we are 99.9999% gray and the rest good feelings.  Ive seen enough videos and done enough drugs that have expanded my mind to what we are. Since the dawn of time, man has been satiated by the blood of others, whether we are manipulated or not. We are tribalistic and by default find the exclusion of others better than inclusion. This is the basis for all derision we see, our base instinct. Man is grimy and a gutter phenom and there is no glitter in the gutter.
