       The content of the speeches is a big red herring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, it doesn't matter what she said to them. They didn't care what she had to say. The massive payments for the speeches is just how banks like Goldman Sachs and JPM Chase paid her off in anticipation of her run for president. It's a way of bribing her that convenient bypasses the FEC and campaign finance laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if you want to find a Hillary speech that really gives away her true intentions, check out her speeches to the Council on Foreign Relations.

       I know in the Clinton Cash documentary it mentioned how after Hillary was successfully nominated as Sec. of State, Bill's speaking fee jumped from $200,000 a speech to $500,000 a speech.

       A rider document was leaked which states the requirements for a Hillary Clinton speech appearance.    It clearly states that the host of the event must pay a $1000 dollar flat fee for a stenographer to create "an immediate transcript of Secretary Clinton's remarks".   It also states that, "We will be unable to share a copy of the transcript following the event."

       Hillary was also given billions to rebuild Haiti. Haiti wasn't rebuilt. Just because she accepted money for transcripts, doesn't mean there are transcripts.

       Can someone explain how HC couldn't just get someone to type up a normal looking speech and pass it off as legit? 
She is wayyy more corrupt than faking speeches. And nothing is beyond her when it comes to lying.

       Most everything has a digital marker for time created and location. Most printers do this too. She could fake them but it would be pointless. She never gave speeches. It was just a way pay bribes

       A rider document was leaked which states the requirements for a Hillary Clinton speech appearance.    It clearly states that the host of the event must pay a $1000 dollar flat fee for a stenographer to create "an immediate transcript of Secretary Clinton's remarks".   It also states that, "We will be unable to share a copy of the transcript following the event."
