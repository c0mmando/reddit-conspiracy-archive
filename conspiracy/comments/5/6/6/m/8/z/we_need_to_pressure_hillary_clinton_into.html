    <div class="md"><p>The content of the speeches is a big red herring. </p>

<p>Ultimately, it doesn&#39;t matter what she said to them. They didn&#39;t care what she had to say. The massive payments for the speeches is just how banks like Goldman Sachs and JPM Chase paid her off in anticipation of her run for president. It&#39;s a way of bribing her that convenient bypasses the FEC and campaign finance laws.</p>

<p>However, if you want to find a Hillary speech that really gives away her true intentions, check out her speeches to the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
