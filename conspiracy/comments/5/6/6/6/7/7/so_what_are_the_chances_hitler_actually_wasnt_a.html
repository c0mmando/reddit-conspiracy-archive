       ive seen quite a lot to indicate that the reason ww2 actually happened could possibly be the banking system itself (in addition to an emerging Zionist group that actually WAS emerging at the time historically, which even british papers in English account for at the time)
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it extremely likely. in our current situation, I imagine if a president ever executive ordered the FED away -- the rest of the world would immediately deem us a irreconcilable threat, even if we staunchly didn't want war.
      </p>
      <p>
       they cant let a state that creates its own bank exist, especially a functional one that hands power to majority citizens. any society like that would be financial warfare against all the other tyrannical states, and would dissolve them over time as people noticed how much better the other way works for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       think about it, the german mark was worth nothing under their democratic government -- because democratic governments in todays age pander, they have to please the people who got them in power and thus, not the majority citizen, but the banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really know the history 100% of their banking at the time, but I'm almost certain the first prime targets of hitler were the banking cartels, and that's who he got the economy powerful enough to build such a war machine with technological marvels from a point where the average citizen burnt dollars for heat and couldn't afford bread.
      </p>
      <p>
       what happened in Nazi Germany is exactly what I expect to happen to an America that leaves the fed and abolishes national/international banking by constitutional amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are plenty of justifications of why hitler ran his first few offensives (Poland, Rhineland, etc.) because germans lived there and were not being treated right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a jew by heredity btw, so me saying maybe hitler was right might mean something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean fuck. look at this shit.  if you look at his speeches and publications, when referring to the jews, he was mainly referring to an actual, existing political cabal/pseudo-Marxist group, who view the bibles prophecy of ruling the world as literal -- with people like soros believing they are the messiah -- too bad they let that prick live and didn't execute him too. if the Nazis killed soros, then maybe they would have even saved the world more than once lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       what do you do in a society rife with brainwashing, and a supremely corrupt system that serves to line the pockets and grant power to those who install it, at the cost of nobody else having power?
      </p>
      <p>
       you have to create a proto-fascist regime, capable of quickly removing/exterminating pro-brainwashing groups (in the US, this would be probably most SJWs, some social minorities who are resistant to reeducation, almost all economically powerful individuals involved in gov't and all their shills)
      </p>
      <p>
       these people will fight to reintroduce the old, unfair system because they want to be at the top, or because they are just plain brainwashed into it and its sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       so what he did was entirely justifiable, and even possibly the right thing to do entirely too.
      </p>
      <p>
       if I'm not wrong, he wasn't immediately exterminating jews -- and some of his gov't was controlled by western bankers who might've wanted him to look bad at the end, so I'm not sure if the gas chambers and stuff were built late-game just to get a reason to make people not believe this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       or an alternate possibility is that, as he tried to eliminate the powerful cabal working towards Israel, he ran up against strong opposition among the jews when they began to unite against him and his national socialist banking system worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
       of course, they were  not being peaceable. they were not trying to ask for higher status in life even. they wanted the entire old banking system that was starving people to death back.
      </p>
      <p>
       so if that's true, they all deserved to die. if its true my ancestors were pricks and enablers of tyranny, and I'm glad some of them died back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just pretty concerned its the banking system itself that is the true hidden cause of ww2,
      </p>
      <p>
       think of what they say since then -- nationalism is evil and causes war -- caring about your region in specific and what is fair to it, causes war because NOTHING CAN BE FAIR.
(nationalism is GREAT)
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler wanted war and started the war -- he didn't. this is clear and evident in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       the international economy was implemented when really? after ww1. WW1 was probably a bid against any nation who opposed unfair international banking schemes which were to be forcibly installed on the losers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Germany, having fought the hardest and lasting the longest with the best reasons for not doing it that made sense to people, obviously had to be punished by the other international tyrants who were abusing fake banking systems for power.
      </p>
      <p>
       so they saddled Germany with all the worlds debt at the time, to make it seem as if the international system worked fine for those states whom agreed peaceably (only germans knew they were slaves, it was hidden from the rest that early on)
      </p>
      <p>
       obviously, go listen to some of hitlers speeches. he does sound scarily similar alt-right, just with a bent against the jews. and scarily enough, I believe him in what ive seen. I can see why people agreed with him and followed him to the ends of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       he offered them an out of the banking system. an out with unfairness that was foisted upon them at Versailles, which they fought so hard against.
      </p>
      <p>
       people were dying. starving. sick. homeless. it was a nightmare and something had to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       looking at it this way, makes the beerhall putsch make way more sense -- they tell us he was not popular in Germany at that time, but had enough support to launch an almost successful revolution? no way that statement can be true!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       the US also got into the war late, id assume it was because of our system. originally the US was pro-Germany in both wars. but the banksters flipped the story with their media machine halfway through once they realized they too were under fire, not just stalin.
      </p>
      <p>
       its curious why the jews hated stalin too, he helped them a lot and it was even them who birthed the ideals which formed communism. I theorize its because somehow, the leaders of the SU weren't the jews--  and the jewish version of communism does not believe in true equality on race, whereas even if stalin was a brutal evil man, he did. he would not have handed the party over to one group of powerful jews at his own expense -- therefore it was not a biblical prophesied government of the jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       it really scares me that we are facing a similar thing here today, as debts rise for all nations and the endgame of the system installed way back when is coming to get us.
      </p>
      <p>
       now its failing by design and all nations seem to be falling into the chains of slavery, I'm almost certain any nation that does the right thing, and tries to back out, will be framed for crimes against humanity and nuked off the face of the earth immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       if I'm right on this -- if the jews then were involved in banking (which they were) and hitler's prime original goal was to kick out these early FED/IMF type systems that were fucking the german people after Versailles,
      </p>
      <p>
       then obviously this was the real cause of the war. and obviously everyone else was on the wrong side.

       Would you consider that hitler is controlled by the same group of zionists that controlled the allies and he is simply an agent facillitating for the collapse of Germany?
      </p>
      <p>
       Same for Mussolini and Japan, Mussolini and Imperial Japan might very likely be just a collapse facilitator like hitler.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway the zionists in the 10s, 20s and 30s very likely targeted these 3 countries for collapse and castration, and before the illuminati/zionists collapse countries, they import radical ideologies and have people believe in them. In fact after the war these 3 countries were all castrated and subject to zionist rule.

       Think about it, if a Western country today finally snapped and decided to purge its ruling class - the politicians, the bankers, the media - couldn't it potentially be represented as anti-Semitic purely due to the disproportionate presence of Jews in these industries? How do you think the ADL and so forth would interpret such an act? They'd probably "declare war" on the regime in question,

       And jewry urging us sanctions against japan to create a conflict between usa and japan and thus bring usa into a European war (against the wrong enemy), it's important to remember that sanctions and blockades are more deadly than atomic bombs. The British blockade during ww1 caused 1 mil german deaths from starvation including at leat 100k after the 1918 armistice

       Henry Ford is an interesting source. He invested a lot of ressources into researching the very same concerns that Hitler had.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it would be terrible naive to dismiss everything Ford wrote, on the basis of it being antisemitic. That's so troubling that people don't realise how conditioned they are to immediately dismiss everything that jewish media labels antisemitic...

       Some actually step back and take an objective view of history. Official stories, as we all know, are written to provide a benefit and are notoriously false to some degree if not completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a Jewish friend when I was in high school. They observed all the traditions except one, and that was playing the victim. His family believed that the Holocaust happened, but not nearly to the degree as is told in the History books written well after WWII.

       A state sponsored genocide is evil. As is totalitarian fascism. The fact that they were evil doesnt negate the scope of moral relativism that can be used to analyze their history. They may be just as, less than or more evil than another subject but that doesn't negate their own evils.

       A lot of the american propaganda leading up to ww2 was pro Hitler, mind you. That was exposed for being less than valid. How do you explain that?

       Lets focus on the important issue rather than the details. What state sponsored genocide? Have you genuinely done research on this topic or do you speak from a moral high ground where you believe  to know something without a shadow of doubt yet are completely oblivious to the fact that you've been indoctrinated for decades?

       Link me to it! I have no evidence disproving it, I just find a lack of evidence proving it. I am genuinely interested in the truth however (you may doubt that, it's fine I don't care). A lot of things I have read and dug up here and there have led me to believe that skepticism is justified (Several accounts of post-war atrocity propaganda being disproven by even jewish mainstream historians, figures of death tolls being corrected lower and lower by mainstream historians, many cases of eyewitness accounts reporting absurdities which were later confirmed to have been made up, deceitful mistranslation of german documents during the Nuremberg trials, and cases of torture during the trials leading to confessions of camps that didn't exist, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm genuinely interested in what irrefutable proof you have, because many people much much smarter and educated than me have searched for it all their lifes and didn't find it.

       He was, luckily, in a holding camp, so he got out eventually, to be released into slavery in Bavaria (which in itself is an entertaining story). But from his experiences in the comparatively benign holding camp, I have little trouble imagining what Birkenau might have been like. Additionally, there are just too many primary sources to dismiss. I think history has it exactly right - together with his industrialists, Hitler was exactly the overmind of the variety that are held by many to be accountable for many trends today. Except he did his business very much in the open.

       Can the Wannsee protocols be verified to have existed before the trials?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know, I'll have to do some digging. Generally I'm skeptical to everything surrounding the Nuremberg trials however, because germans were tortured brutally and evidence/counterevidence not treated justly by the court. This is aknowledged even by mainstream historians nowadays.
      </p>
      <p>
       With documents like this, everything depends on verifying their credibility. I suspect that he documents are heavily guarded and protected by gatekeeper-historians, but I'll find out what the deal is with them.

       I have many family members who are survivors of the Holocaust, and many more who died in the camps. This may mean nothing to you, but I'm very confident my little Grandmother is not part of some massive 'Zionist' conspiracy. But don't just take my word for it - there are myriad reports from Holocaust survivors on the web. Afraid of doctored evidence on the internet? Go see the evidence in person at the Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. I don't know anyone who wasn't powerfully affected by what they saw there. Lots of primary sources, physical evidence, and interviews with survivors stored there. Finally, I'll leave you with this quote from President Dwight D. Eisenhower:
". . .the most interesting—although horrible—sight that I encountered during the trip was a visit to a German internment camp near Gotha. The things I saw beggar description. While I was touring the camp I encountered three men who had been inmates and by one ruse or another had made their escape. I interviewed them through an interpreter. The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said that he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to “propaganda.”" (

       )
I think, given Ike's farewell address (

       ) it is pretty hard to argue he was part of any huge corporation/banking based conspiracy, because is he was, why would he have been allowed to expose these transgressions to the world?

       I'm not ashamed of being proven wrong, I'm interested in the truth. I wish I could shake off these ideas and beliefs, because they are dangerous, alienating and burdensome in day to day life. I do however enjoy the detective work of trying to piece together a puzzle and evaluating the credibility of sources. There's a ton of material on either sounds of the argument with which to work with.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I won't debate someone who obviously is pretty heavily emotionally invested in his high horse of moral superiority. I don't think you have been exposed to the 'counterarguments', however I have been exposed to the pro-arguments all my life. So it be an unfair debate anyway.

       I agree. I'm curious about true history and skeptical of everything we've been told, but I was just watching a documentary the other day about Poland and Hitler completely demolished Warsaw, total devastation of a generation, hard to square that with him being a knight in shining armor fighting against the Jew World Order. Not sure what was going on in WW2

       I can't read all of each of these posts (they are long). But I'll give you my synopsis of what I believe to have happened:
      </p>
      <p>
       Pre 1900 Switzerland - ~1500 Switzerland is the Political Police for all Kings Queens throughout Europe, and today the Pope. 1349, Jan 9th, Roman Day of "New Beginnings", Basel Massacre, or pre-Holocaust (fake Jew homes to lure in Jews to be burned, originates in Switzerland).
      </p>
      <p>
       1850 - 1900 Switzerland - Develops radical new political system, Direct Democracy, empowering every Citizen similar to a Senator via Caucus voting. The Presidency is a council of 7, to prevent political assassination and corruption. Media becomes heavily controlled by the Gov as "dividing a nation against itself" is seen as the greatest threat to sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p>
       1890 Switzerland - Develops the largest network of electronic communication, and is the first country to connect every single citizen via a wire (as opposed to horse and pigeon). Develops the most prolific news organization in the world, printing headlines in 4 languages : French, Germany, Italian, &amp; Romansh.
      </p>
      <p>
       1915 WW1 - Swiss / Italy / France attack and defeat Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       1940 WW2 - Swiss / Italy / France / Germany attack and lose to US / Russia / UK.

       They were just good at getting their people in power and controlling the press.   Churchill wrote a book like Mein Kampf before Hitler about the (((Russian revolution))) but he was broke as a joke and they bought him off.  No wonder he drank so much.

       I've considered this, but there is evidence of hitler being a jerk in his own right. So he could have been fighting international bankers AND been a jerk both at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a modern day comparison, I would look at China. The international bankers might have a reason to force a war between the US and China right now, but that doesn't make China the good guy. It will be two bad guys fighting each other.

       This is how I feel. Hitler isn't the mustache-twirling villian that 7th grade world history leads us to believe. There was a lot of tension going on in the world about and he was the spark it took to ignight a world wide war. He's definitely at fault for a lot of horrific things, but he's not solely at fault.

       The best understanding I've found is Hitler was chosen and groomed from a very early age to do what he did. It's believable that the rich elite who sold and dealt with both sides, fueling the war, stripping resources out of the land and away from people's hands, are the same group that groomed Hitler, and gave him what he needed to succeed as far as he did. I personally think that Hitler was like any other leader, when he become unmanageable by certain means of control, they killed him.

       hitler didn't do anything good for anyone, except bring the rest of the world together with his defeat.  he was an iconic personality cult in a time of struggle for the world, and germany in particular.  he, like many, used jews as the personification of the financial industry and focused the ire and energy of his people on that to help accomplish his goals.

       The very early top Bolsheviks were largely Jews and Stalin was a paranoid guy who preemptively killed a lot of people who might have a chance of one day opposing him and this meant that he killed a lot of Jews.  Putin for example kicked out some particular Jewish "oligarchs" for gobbling up insane amounts of wealth when the USSR collapsed.  These elite Jews ran to London and the West where many elite Jews congregate and and they were given an audience for use as propaganda points against Russia towards the end of what we are seeing happen now.  There is a place neighboring Russia called the state of Ukraine and the region of Ukraine (The Borderlands) where Jews get to run absolutely amok slurping up all wealth.  Russia is now a place where Jews can only be extremely powerful but not Rothschild level powerful.  This rubs these few elite Jews the wrong way and so they conspire against Russia.

       You are absolutely right op. Obviously good/bad is a gross oversimplification (which should make all the bluepilled mainstream believers that can only explain nazi atrocities with 'well they were evil!' skeptical, yet it doesn't) but within the context of what you can find and attribute to credible sources... Hitler would most certainly have to be considered the good guy. And it's becoming ever more clear to everyone.

       See the Documentary "Hitler's War? What the Historians neglect to mention" You will see Hitler wasnt a puppet of the bankers, he kicked them out of Germany and did everything he could to have peace for his people and provide poor Germans(as he had been homeless) with all the rights and luxuries a rich German had. A Volksgemeinschaft (folk community)

       How did you even find a 24 year old post to respond to lol. There's a lot of things that I could respond you with, but first of all it's been absolutely proven without a doubt, that Prescott Bush funded Hitler. Congress even penalized him or something to that end, you can look it up and verify it for yourself or believe in lies

       24 DAYS and its called the search reddit bar.. There was a relationship between Prescott Bush and Fritz Thyssen and a relationship between Thyssen and the National Socialist Party. But there was no relationship between Bush and the NS Party.

       That one link can be debated endlessly whether he knew he was indirectly funding Hitler or not, but in his position if he wanted to fund Hitler that would pretty much be the best way to go about it. Regardless, it's absolutely true that Prescott Bush financed Hitler, perhaps indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly, but it is true. It's not "Jewish disinformation"
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, why the fuck would the Jews WANT anyone to think that Hitler was a Jew? That doesn't make any sense at all, as beleif in that would only be detrimental to what the Jews want as at the very least makes them look even more conniving. Anyways, there's a plethora of other things that show a connection, when I have time I'll dig up my sources; way too busy right now and tired as indicated by the obvious mistake of putting days instead of years, days must feel like years to me right now...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the link you gave me is pretty much dead, the audio that supposedly disproves the links does not work, and the picture does not work either. You should verify your sources instead of believing the summary, so yea try again

       The link in the original article does not work. If it addresses the jewish accusation then why not tell me what it is in your words/understanding, instead of just linking to a giant essay. If you really care about fighting disinformation you wouldn't post with just a link and no other words; what a halfassed effort. I don't know why you're going back on your own words, but as you already said yourself Bush indirectly helped fund the NS party, so much so that his account was frozen by the US government under some helping enemies act. It's true and you accepted that yourself; as I said he maybe did it with no knowledge that Thyssen was linked to the NS party but there is a definite proven link between Bush and the NS party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I don't even think that the ideology behind the NS party is inherently bad, but like it or not what Hitler (perhaps indirectly/unknowingly) did, helped the creation of Israel and allowed Zionists to have a collective Jewish voice that they can subvert/brainwash for their own interests. Nationalism is great but gassing/killing/evicting/etc all those Jews (which according to sources that is too difficult to find right now, weren't even real Jews and were part of a thirteenth tribe) only furthered the interests of Zionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm able to actually explain what I know, if you really think what you believe is not disinformation you would be able to do the same. But to say "There is no link between Bush and the NS party" is complete and utter disinformation. Don't bother responding with such low effort replies, if you're not gonna put in effort then neither am I, especially since you're the one who restarted this conversation by chosing to respond to such an old post; stop wasting my time

       You are so intent on linking Prescott Bush with Hitler like that is irrefutable proof that Hitler was a Rothschild puppet lol. Its an absurd accusation.

       The Balfour declaration was declared when Hitler was doging bullets in a foxhole, fighting for his fatherland. He didnt care where the jews went he only wanted them out of Germany and he was able to negotiate the transfer agreement, yes. Those Gassings/killings of Jews that advanced zionism.... Well there is zero proof of any genocidal gas chambers.. NONE.

       You fail at reading comprehension pretty hard. The link from the original article does not work for me, what does that have to do with common sense? Figure out that I should read a giant essay? I repeatedly said that it's possible that Bush didn't know he was helping fund Hitler, as in it may have been an inadvertent accident, unintentional, etc. The population of Jews shot up rapidly due to the second world war. I know there's no proof, that's why I added those slashes to get my point across since I wasn't sure what you believed in, the point being that he one way or another made Jews leave. They advanced Zionism, and again perhaps Hitler didn't realize that it would do that and it may have been unintentional (again I'm repeating myself here). Go back to school or get some sort of help and learn to read
      </p>
      <p>
       This is worse than low effort, this just low iq. For you to think that I'm somehow showing "irrefutable proof that Hitler was a Rothschild puppet" is itself laughably absurd. I hope you don't support Trump because you're giving the rest of us supporters a bad name. Low energy as fuck

       Ah, and here is the "stormfront" insertion into this thread, by a throwaway account no less, to create the excuse needed to cry anti-Semitism. It always happens. People screaming r/conspiracy is anti-Semitic in 5...4...3...2...1

       I never blamed the jews as a small people, and the extermination was horrific, I'm only questioning whether globalist controlled shills operated most of the horrors of the holocaust for research purposes (dr. mendel, etc) and illegal no human rights studies on manipulation, mind control, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a lot of this may not have been known to hitler and may have been run by those agencies who backed him within the US and possibly also backed the soviet union.
      </p>
      <p>
       from what Ive seen, hitlers political agenda for the people seemed to have been anti-protoglobalism because globalism is strongly related to the original Zionism as it was arising at the time (which actually, caused most of the aggression towards Germany thru sanctions, etc, and pressured the war). by this I mean that its interests were in having a national bank controlled by the populace with no interest. self determination in economy, and the ability to compete with global monopolies and innovate. basically the opposite worldview of the controlled development of the west through banking dynasties and elite bloodlines
      </p>
      <p>
       I KNOW all sides were co opted and funded by the same people. its the root of the history I'm interested in. what really happened and how it relates to modern day affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       if the world wars were actually truly fought over the system of banking which was permissible to the populace, and the idea of who controlled industry and society, then the foe of the final great war for humanity, the last war, can be deciphered.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the cause of war itself can then be eliminated -- tyranny itself.

       "Dr. Mendel?" At least read a few more books before coming up with this nonsense. You can't even get the names right. The fact alone that you call it "ww2" shows you've studied little beyond a few articles.

       Look you intellectual midget. If you dismiss the content of a post, on the basis of it being posted on Stormfront, you are doing the exact same thing that a racist does, when he dismisses the comment a black person makes, on the basis of him/her being black (without consideration of the content of his comment).

       Look Shit fer Brains, I've seen it a million times in this sub over the years. When ever Stormfront material, good or bad,  conveniently shows shows up in a Jew related thread, it gets used as "proof" that r/conspiracy is racist. Realize your limited mental capacity or try harder to figure it out.

       Henry Ford is an interesting source. He invested a lot of ressources into researching the very same concerns that Hitler had.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it would be terrible naive to dismiss everything Ford wrote, on the basis of it being antisemitic. That's so troubling that people don't realise how conditioned they are to immediately dismiss everything that jewish media labels antisemitic...

       That one link can be debated endlessly whether he knew he was indirectly funding Hitler or not, but in his position if he wanted to fund Hitler that would pretty much be the best way to go about it. Regardless, it's absolutely true that Prescott Bush financed Hitler, perhaps indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly, but it is true. It's not "Jewish disinformation"
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, why the fuck would the Jews WANT anyone to think that Hitler was a Jew? That doesn't make any sense at all, as beleif in that would only be detrimental to what the Jews want as at the very least makes them look even more conniving. Anyways, there's a plethora of other things that show a connection, when I have time I'll dig up my sources; way too busy right now and tired as indicated by the obvious mistake of putting days instead of years, days must feel like years to me right now...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the link you gave me is pretty much dead, the audio that supposedly disproves the links does not work, and the picture does not work either. You should verify your sources instead of believing the summary, so yea try again
