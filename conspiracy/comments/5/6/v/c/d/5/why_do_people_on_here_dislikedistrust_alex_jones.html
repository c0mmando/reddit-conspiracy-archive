       TPTB control the media. But they also want to control the opposition. So they create Alex jones (he's cia) to be the celebrity conspiracy theory guy. They let him talk about most conspiracies, but not the really deep shit. Also they mix in a good amount of disinformation to make him not as credible. So nothing is fact and nothing is fiction. It's all muddy. He's a lunatic sometimes. He's telling the truth sometimes. He's controlled opposition.

       Honestly, a lot of people here are young, they don't know their roots. I'm an old fart.
      </p>
      <p>
       About 20 years ago the internet was just getting started and conspiracy info was hard to come by, especially the hard hitting stuff. You had to go to obscure conventions or track down books and yeah there was Coast 2 Coast, but that was mostly paranormal and UFOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then out of nowhere come this fiery eyed, red faced, screaming Texan on the radio shouting about rising up against the New World Order and how we gotta all fight back, resist their programs, never give in, get armed, get involved and FIGHT!!
      </p>
      <p>
       We'd never heard anything like it. Nobody had talked about fighting back like that, he was crazy wild, he was passionate, he was a rally call, and he was the biggest wake up call this country has ever had.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love him or hate him, trust him or not, he's a huge reason we are even here talking about these topics. He created a platform when there wasn't one. EVERYONE went to Alex Jones cuz that's where you could tell it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask Luke, We Are Change, and all the others. He got people motivated, they started spreading the word, they started movements, they stood up and declared to resist. Then they all started making their own shows, channels, pages, groups... It worked, he did it, and here we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       He started a fire in our hearts, and for that he'll always have my respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont understand why people think he avoids the Zionism angle, maybe he does now. But back then I was listening to his shows while he was learning about it all and freaking out on air and exposing it all. Oh well.  I haven't listened to Alex Jones in a very long time, so I can't say he's the same man he was back then, probably not, chasing the devil for so long tends to change a man.

       Dig into it, you'll find that he's strangely averse to ever talk about Israel and it's involvement in false flags or the merchant banking mafia. There's a reason he's so massively successful and alive simultaneously. He's on their payroll. The fact that Hillary Clinton gave him a shoutout for nation-wide exposure should give his supporters something to think about as well.

       He also jumps right on the mainstream media bandwagon to further certain agendas. Like the absurd "YOU'RE ALL GOING TO DIE AND YOUR KIDS ARE GOING TO DIE TOO!" message last week from Hurricane Matthew. He bolstered this with an absurd video claiming that Florida could capsize/tip over and kill 19 million people.

       Yes and no. He meant it as a joke, but he drops ridiculous bombs like "hurricanes didn't exist until human activity", and really acts it out. It was absolutely meant to spread fear. Look at the comments and you'll see a significant number of users take it seriously.

       While I don't agree with his conclusions (he seems to encourage division) and find his self-promotional tactics tacky and self-promotional, he does source information you won't normally hear about, and he for sure has helped to foment discussion on areas the mainstream narrative tends to avoid.

       Poor Jews, it must be so hard having any criticism of your culture, people, and your own little country completely censored from the media, the TV, newspapers, and movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also must be really, really tough being the wealthiest, most educated, and politically over-represented white-skinned ethnicity in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       But still on the dark corners of the internet sometimes people suggest that Jews are no better than other people and that their culture promotes hatred for other people.

Your absurd reactions to my comments shows how much you focusing solely on "the jooz did it' has clouded your judgment of the world around you and distracted you from the reality in front of you.
