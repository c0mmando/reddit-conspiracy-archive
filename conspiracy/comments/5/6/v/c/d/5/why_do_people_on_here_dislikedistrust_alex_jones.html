    <div class="md"><p>TPTB control the media. But they also want to control the opposition. So they create Alex jones (he&#39;s cia) to be the celebrity conspiracy theory guy. They let him talk about most conspiracies, but not the really deep shit. Also they mix in a good amount of disinformation to make him not as credible. So nothing is fact and nothing is fiction. It&#39;s all muddy. He&#39;s a lunatic sometimes. He&#39;s telling the truth sometimes. He&#39;s controlled opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, a lot of people here are young, they don&#39;t know their roots. I&#39;m an old fart.</p>

<p>About 20 years ago the internet was just getting started and conspiracy info was hard to come by, especially the hard hitting stuff. You had to go to obscure conventions or track down books and yeah there was Coast 2 Coast, but that was mostly paranormal and UFOs.</p>

<p>Then out of nowhere come this fiery eyed, red faced, screaming Texan on the radio shouting about rising up against the New World Order and how we gotta all fight back, resist their programs, never give in, get armed, get involved and FIGHT!!</p>

<p>We&#39;d never heard anything like it. Nobody had talked about fighting back like that, he was crazy wild, he was passionate, he was a rally call, and he was the biggest wake up call this country has ever had.</p>

<p>Love him or hate him, trust him or not, he&#39;s a huge reason we are even here talking about these topics. He created a platform when there wasn&#39;t one. EVERYONE went to Alex Jones cuz that&#39;s where you could tell it all. </p>

<p>Ask Luke, We Are Change, and all the others. He got people motivated, they started spreading the word, they started movements, they stood up and declared to resist. Then they all started making their own shows, channels, pages, groups... It worked, he did it, and here we are.</p>

<p>He started a fire in our hearts, and for that he&#39;ll always have my respect.</p>

<p>I dont understand why people think he avoids the Zionism angle, maybe he does now. But back then I was listening to his shows while he was learning about it all and freaking out on air and exposing it all. Oh well.  I haven&#39;t listened to Alex Jones in a very long time, so I can&#39;t say he&#39;s the same man he was back then, probably not, chasing the devil for so long tends to change a man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thank goodness no one blames &quot;one small group for everything bad that happens in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>In any case, you seem to have gotten your talking points wrong. You are supposed to say: &quot;you&#39;re just blaming THE JOOOOOOOOOOOZ for your personal failures in life!&quot;</p>

<p>What, is everyone on vacation and they are leaving this to the trainees today? Oy vey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that I&#39;m not a jew , I know plenty of the crimes of Israel and the jewish desire for racial supremacy.  Your absurd reactions to my comments shows how much you focusing solely on &quot;the jooz did it&#39; has clouded your judgment of the world around you and distracted you from the reality in front of you. Many just need their anger directed in a certain direction I guess.</p>

<p>Three times now you have used standard talking points - even a single criticism of Jews, Judaism, Israel, etc., is always, 100% of the time, met with cries of &quot;blaming everything on the JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOZ because you&#39;re a failure in life,&quot; etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>If you ever dare to mention Jews in anything but the most worshipful way, you&#39;re an &quot;agent&quot; mean to &quot;discredit&quot; our community!</p>

<p>Oh no - what will <a href="/r/conspirtard">/r/conspirtard</a> think of us? Don&#39;t say anything about Israel, otherwise <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> will make fun of us! Just shut up about Zionism, talk more about the Jesuits and Bigfoot, otherwise <a href="/r/isrconspiracyracist">/r/isrconspiracyracist</a> will call us anti-seeeeeemites!</p>
