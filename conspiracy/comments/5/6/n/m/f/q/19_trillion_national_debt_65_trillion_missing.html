       We are currently in a slow collapse. So might as well let it all come crashing down and start from scratch. Maybe after it all crashes we can go and arrest the crooked politicians/bankers/globalists/war mongers and have some old school public hangings

       Classic. The whole "let them eat cake" episode was propaganda for manufacturing public outrage. It was intentionally taken out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not unlike what happened here in Canada a couple weeks ago with Judge Robin Camp. He was reported to have said "why couldn't you keep your legs together?" to the complainant in a rape case. The "news" reported it as if he was "victim blaming", outrage and pitchforks followed. The sexual grievance industry has more ammo to impose reactionary legislation on the masses, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But was Judge Camp actually "victim blaming"? Fuck no! What he was asking was "How were you able to keep your legs open while your ass was in a kitchen sink and your skinny jeans were wrapped around your ankles...?"
      </p>
      <p>
       It was in a line of questions. The complainant had some serious inconsistencies in her story. Not ONE mainstream Canadian media outlet did ANY actual journalism on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       End of rant.

       I contemplate this scenario a lot... What to do with the pieces of shit responsible after the revolution or said collapse and I always come to the same conclusion: I think we just take control of local government after the 18th century centralised institutions collapse, and simply move on, they lived in the shadows and they can remain there as we bathe in the light of transparency of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can illuminate their darkness but maybe punishment lowers us to their standards and who can honestly be arsed to maintain their enslavement... This is where we differ so greatly from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The damage of the system falling around them only to see the great unwashed collectively and individually take responsibility, rebuild organic economies and once again attempt world peace, will cripple what's left of their diminishing energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       After seeing the response from the families in the charleston shooting I realised then punishment is pointless only rehabilitation and compassion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Punishment is based in fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we should launch a spiritual war in which will kill them with kindness.

       The slow collapse, though, is by design. It's happening alongside militarized police and gutted civil liberties. It's happening alongside strategic resource allocation like the Bush family buying up droves of aquifers in Panama. When the dollar crashes, there will be enough capital left for the 1% to pay their protectors.

       Need to get money out of the control of governments, similar to Tether Coin, but decentralized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have a crypto pegged to a fiat to equal $1:1 with stability, you take away a governments last resort to control people, and that's through their assets and money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once assets and money are not in their control, you can now start to show that people are looking for change and to listen up.
      </p>
      <p>
       This process can happen now with technology. So to recap a crypto pegged to a fiat, i.e. USD with a decentralized exchange with an initial cap of reserve USD. So like a Tether coin with Bitsquare  and create these to easy be spent through mobile virtual credit cards or that can be printed out as QR codes for redemption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the rant, but if the US government is f*** "losing" citizens money into the trillions, they have no accountable right to take control of everyday citizens accounts and assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shouldn't there by at least a framework to take one piece out of their control, and shouldn't that be the currency to keep them in check?

       A centralized voting system that is transparent enough to be checked for fraud by anyone at anytime and is controlled wholly by the people plus use all those government PhDs to find solutions to problems that we can vote on. We need to make the decisions for us and stop this politician nonsense that always falls falls apart in the end. It simply doesn't work.

       If this is the sorry state of things we find ourselves in, and having these two candidates, etc...if
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       is a "normal" functional outcome of the system, then that's all the evidence we need--it's broken beyond repair.  The idea of needing a singular charismatic magic "leader" is dead... It's a silly way to do it, we are already evolving beyond it (indeed many of us have long since arrived there), which is why it looks and feels so absurd to everyone, because it is an exaggerated relic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crowdsourcing decision-making is the saner approach, with smarter results because it averages out the peculiarities and biases a single individual necessarily brings to that role.  You get a synthesis of the best ideas from everyone, instead of a tiny elite who stupidly adhere to these narrow competing perspectives (or at least appear to for the sake of kabuki theater).

       That is called a democracy and that has never worked and never will work. What we need is a republic with full transparency and oversight by the people demanding to be fairly represented. We need a more aware populace that is engaged in the process of governance, not some fantasy democracy that is runned by "the masses".

       that is an ironicly small response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn from world history. The founding fathers understood governance so well that they developed the greatest most succesful free nation in history. They purposefully avoided a system of democracy in favor of a representative republic for very good reasons. I'll list some of them for you:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The majority of people are not well educated enough on most political, military, and policy matters to provide a proper judgment.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The general public's opinion on various matters shifts and changes constantly influence by trivial matters such as the media, emotion, etc.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The majority should not rule over the minority. In a democracy, the will of the majrity always wins despite not always being correct. For example, the majority of people supported the Iraq War, or the majority of people did not support the constitutional rights of minority religious groups or ethic groups at certain points in history.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

         Look up wisdom of the masses. The average opinion is usually spot on and people are not as stupid as you think.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A majority vote takes care of this by taking an average of everyone's opinion. The average is usually spot on according to the wisdom of the masses model.

         This needs to be strategized by teams of sociologists to determine all potential downfalls so that we can find a ways to avoid these problems. This is child's play and not difficult to resolve with enough research.

       We already found a solution to the problem- its called a Constitutional Republic. The will of the people is realized through elected representatives. All we have to do to correct the corruption of this system is to remove special interest from the political process.

       Lol, we've been trying this for thousands of years. We don't need people to tell us how to think. These politicians always end up dwindling into corruption. They always find a way. It's  too much power for any one person to have. It is far better for our future to be the deciders of our own fate.

       Yes. Of course we'll have to get a few experts, and delegate a few people to take leadership roles, etc. We need a fair way to figure out how to select these people. Maybe everyone should get a say in it.

       Leaders have never been asked by those who make them leaders if they have ever acted out of a sense of conscience. If we did demand that leaders have and act on conscience they would have to at least fake it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they felt a need to create an optic of acting out of conscience   that would naturally present  less opportunity for them to act out their sociopathy.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would then have to at least hide it like they now have to hide their racism (if any) their pedophilia and or  their tendency to be cannibals. These are all taboo personality types that are not tolerated as leaders. Creating that new taboo  type is the necessary step.
      </p>
      <p>
       WE can begin by simply asking candidates for power if they have ever acted out of a sense of conscience. They'll have to lie and then double down on the lie. That in itself will quickly improve the situation and gradually transition to leaders who truly do have and use their consciences.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how it can work.

       Actually it would, as described.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past psychopaths and sociopaths have always lead us. These days we newly have the possibility of understanding the traits and being able to describe their lack of humanizing qualities and can begin to change our criteria for leadership positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example of a sociopath being driven from  office because of a taboo personality type  is the former Pope. He made the mistake of saying in public that pedophilia was almost normal now. I saw an article about that  and predicted here  that he would have to leave his position a month before he in fact did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did that in the face of the fact that no pope had resigned in 600 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pope resigned a few weeks after saying pedophilia is near normal

       All it takes to drive a taboo personality type out of office is the intense public pressure that is always brought to bear. There was no law about it when the pope stepped down, there was immense public pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who was the football coach who was also driven out of his position a few years back?
      </p>
      <p>
       It  will happen anytime someone is clearly identified as a taboo type. We just need to point out that psychopaths and sociopaths are the only people who will go through what they have to go through to get a position of power. They have no empathy for others, no remorse when they do harm and no conscience so there is nothing that makes them guide those they have power over away from harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such leaders  are far more harmful than pedophiles for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       If sociopaths can be culled from power even at a minimal level that will eventually change the world for the better and if they can be driven from power massively, that will change the world for the extreme better almost immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all dependent on creating a new category of taboo by calling out the personality type.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that unusual and has been done recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       A new category was created recently  for homophobes why not  do the same for psychopaths in power positions? Homophobes will now face oppressive public pressure to step down. It's time to get rid of the sociopaths.

       it will work. Taking the psychopaths out of power means a livable world as opposed to one where virtually no one expects a brighter future. It's amazing that you oppose unless you fear losing power.

       I am convinced that the real problem is the US two party system (another "only of its kind in the world" as America likes to do so often).
      </p>

       Why no one outrages at the lack of third and fourth parties in America I will never understand.

       The whole mess you are in is rooted in the fact that you have to chose between a corrupt criminal and a despicable and both morally and intellectually inept human being ( who is likely a rapist ). If you had other parties to choose from (like every other democratic country in the world), this would be a very different election.

       The system cannot be simply destroyed. Everyone uses money and buys everything from corporations. The food I eat, the clothes I wear, the computer I'm using to contact others through the internet is all controlled by corporations. Unless everyone decides to go off grid, the system will run like clockwork.

       Not really. Because there are currently not enough jobs. So people can't even get the money they need to buy stuff from the corporations. This is due to corporate greed, and the governments having done nothing to stop it when they could have the past 15 years. They have enriched themselves, and China. And left their own people in the poor house. One way or another they will feel the blowback now. They know it too which is why they probably want war with Russia.

       Capitalism as we know it doesn't work. It's incompatible with democracy, and I'd argue that democracy is a failure too. These aren't functional systems let alone perfect ones. The failure rate is abysmal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism in small and regulated pieces is fine, but untethered capitalism (what we have) is an abomination that will literally kill us all if it continues as it is, and is directly responsible for the unnecessary deaths of billions ever since it spawned from the remnants of feudalism. Though despite that, it's already in a state of collapse and we are witnessing the age-old signs of imperial power devouring itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no such thing as healthy competition here. It's not a soccer match. Many corporations are owned or part-owned by a small number of mother companies. We see this with unashamedly corporate media. We see this with ISPs fighting for monopolies in their fantasy market. It's a systemic flaw in capitalism. Capital doesn't trickle down, it pools together-- isolated.

       Couldn't agree more. And you have people in the politics sub saying how "scary" it is Trump is saying he would look into jailing her. One headline says it's "against democracy" for even saying it and another comment or in a thread said he is "jailing his political adversaries" which is so blatantly false and skewed. Everyone who has half an unbiased and enlightened mind would see Hillary is a criminal and should be in jail. Yet when people clap and support the idea people in the politics sub say it's horrifying for supporting the truth. Fucking despicable.

       This is a serious, non-sarcastic question, that I have been meaning to ask, and you, stranger, seem like you might be able to give me a good answer.  Of course, that is up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I really, seriously, would like to know why everyone is treating this e-mail thing like it is such a huge big
       <em>
        criminal
       </em>
       deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       At most, the way I see it was that she definitely made a mistake using a private server, and then doubled-down on that mistake by trying to hide it.  But as far as I can tell, the only real shadiness is just her kind of being cagey about the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, I don't understand why some people act like it is some major smoking gun.  Could you explain?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I am far from a Hillary supporter.  I find both candidates terrible, but for my particular place in society at the moment, the status-quo isn't going to terribly fuck me.  I certainly will not prosper or really get ahead, but I am fairly comfortable under the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump, on the other hand, just seems out of his depth with regard to being president.  So, maybe it is a little bit a case of better the devil you know than the devil you don't.  I'm not sure.  I hate that Hillary represents economic elites and big corps, but if I have to shoot myself, I'd rather shoot myself in the foot than in the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sucks that this is where things are, but, back to my original question:  Why do people stress this e-mail thing like it is some major smoking gun?

       The sick part is the FBI concluded that she did break the law. They said she never "intended" on breaking it. Well, when you get pulled over for speeding, the cop issues you a ticket for breaking the law. Even if you tell them you never intended on speeding. Maybe you didn't know what the speed limit was or something else. That cop isn't gonna say, well since you never intended on speeding, I won't give you a ticket. The laws are in place for a reason. The FBI basically said the law of the land doesn't apply to Hillary. Not to mention, I wonder what Bill talked to Loretta lynch on the airplane for 45 min about, a day before the FBI delivered their verdict. Wikileaks have said today they have so much on Hillary that they have released about 1/20th of all the content they have on her and the Democratic Party. I can see Obama starting this war with Russia before the election, just to solidify trump won't be in office. It's sad that the major news media won't report on this. Russia is planned and staged all their nukes at the ready.

       Ok, so I just read Comey's statement.  Also, I am a lawyer, so I do have at least some level of expertise regarding this matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think your speeding ticket example is entirely appropos.  Certainly it would be easy to fall back on the old adage that ignorance of the law is no excuse, but even that doesn't recognize the complexity of the subject matter.  And some crimes do require intent as a component.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tend to agree with Mr. Comey's assessment that although the handling of the e-mails was careless, there was no purposful intent to distribute classified material to those unauthorized to view it, and certainly no intent to create any of the resulting harm that could come from disseminating classified material to harmful actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is naive to be mad that the justice system is more lenient to people in positions of power.  Is it right?  Definitely debatable, definitely potentially dangerous.  But I think mostly the decision was made based upon actual harm done, as well as whether there was any intent to cause harm, regardless of actual harm done.  Finding little in the former, and none in the latter, the prosecutors within the FBI and DOJ did not find a strong case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, could this ALSO be because people do not want Donald Trump to be president?  I would say that at the very least, this likely factored into people's decisions.  Again, I think it would be naive to think otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does any of this disqualify Hillary as a presidential candidate?  Obviously some believe that it does.  I suspect that this has more to do with an emotional reaction from those that oppose Hillary and the DNC than any real objective assessment of her qualifications.  I say this because whether one likes or dislikes Hillary Clinton, one cannot deny that she knows how Washington works and how to govern something as large as the US federal government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not like her much, but I do recognize that she is more qualified to manage the government more than Donald Trump is, by any metric one may wish to compare the two on.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the war with Russia, I really don't think even you
       <em>
        truly
       </em>
       believe what you wrote.  And regarding Russia, I find it funny that people start to whip up fear when they move weapons around inside their own sovereign borders.  We move our weapons around globally, in countries that are not the USA, and we do it all the time.  It does not necessarily mean we are going to start any wars.

       As an argument, I just find the whole e-mail "scandal" to be a weak argument, especially when there are many more viable reasons to dislike and distrust the policies that Hillary is likely to propose.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, all one can do is speculate, but when one is so closely aligned with big corps and big banks, it is probably a safe speculation to assume that Hillary represents a steady hand staying the course of the status quo.  To what degree that is harmful largely depends on one's place in the strata of society.  In any case, it is likely to benefit the wealthy more than the poor and middle-class.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think, on a sub-conscious level, it is people's resentment and growing frustration of partisan gridlock in congress, from feeling left out, powerless in opposition to the amorality of multinational corporate power that has misguided people to support Donald Trump and this neo-right nationalism often expressed in jingoistic fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think we are going to ever see eye-to-eye on this issue, and so I will not waste your time, and mine, by trying to change your mind about your convictions.

       I have decided to look at things in a pragmatic sense, and in that sense I would choose the candidate who's experience and pedigree is more suited to statecraft than a bombast with blinding hubris and fragile ego, even if the experienced candidate may also be cagey, secretive, and beholden to big finance.

       Because she broke the rules our government puts on these type of things.  She mixed personal communications with confidential governmental communications.  She conducted personal emails on "work" property (which I assume was paid for by the people).  Also, she conducted her "work" on a personal email server, disregarding protocol for government communications.  Then thirdly comes the information actually on those servers seems to be very compromising to a great many people, and she is trying to hide that information.  The information seems to be hiding a great many illegal activity.  This is all extremely poor judgement for someone who wants to be president of our nation.  She keeps saying "I made a mistake", but that only sounds like a cop-out.  She's mistake prone then wouldn't ya think?

       She might, considering the DNC rigged it so that the media would give unprecedented free media coverage of Trump so that the R candidate would be a joke. Either way, anyone who remembers the farce we had in 2000 knows that winning the popular vote isn't necessary. Get ready for our president to be decided by the Supreme Court rather than popular vote again.

       And what a great victory that is for the US, now the whole world has seen her dirty laundry and will know what a corrupt shill we have "elected". The idea of Trump seem more and more like a calculated psyop, this way she has been able to gather the support and rile up her own base to a degree that makes them defend the most obvious leaks.

       Too many people are either A) too comfortable or B) too poor to be able to affect real change right now. And the government intends to keep it that way by making it harder and harder every year for the poor to get by. Wages have stagnated while worker productivity and CEO pay has risen exponentially, causing the average worker to have less than ever in the past and to be more dependent than ever on making it to work every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my own life, my dad 20 years ago was able to support a wife and between 2-3 kids depending on who won the custody battle this year on the same amount I'm making now. I'm living in a similar apartment, driving a similarly aged base model car, and living with a roommate and still living paycheck to paycheck.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for change to happen, something catastrophic needs to happen or incomes/safety nets need to rise. The problem is, if something catastrophic happens we don't have the resources to mobilize and if the situation improves we have less reason to rise up.

       <a href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/cost-of/foreign-aid/">
        foreign aid
       </a>
       annually. Anymore I only see aid as rent for keeping military bases there. You don't really think that countries are happy to have bases there. They get paid to let them be there. No other country on the planet has as many bases spread out like the U.S... I'm sure every country that hosts a base gets paid rent. Then we have the BS of 38 Billion on Israel for the next 10 years. Stop giving money away. Close some bases. If you can see a cow from space, I'm sure you would know if anything was coming our way.Fix the country for fucks sake.

       Hi. The white light is a trap. They project fake images of your dead loved ones to get you to go in. The "tunnel" many talk about is similar to a wormhole, that leads to the holding area/fake heaven. The Angels, Spirit Guides and Lords of Karma are actually all Archons in disguise. The Archons are Evil Parasites and could be described as Demons. They are from the lower Astral Dimension, and use humans as an enslaved energy source to feed upon. After some time in the fake "heaven", you are told you agreed to "soul contracts" very long ago and have to keep reincarnating to pay off your "karmic debt". It is a complete lie. They then erase your memory and personality and you are reinserted as a newborn. Your former self, experiences and memories of loved ones erased from your memory..

       Any direction away from the false light might get you to out and into the Real Universe. The big problem is; most have very little awareness when out of body. Dying is the same as dreaming, and it takes effort to be Lucid when out of the body. If they do end up getting you; Declare you have ended all "soul contracts". You do not answer to anyone, especially Evil Archons who enslave humanity. You are a Sovereign Being and now determine your own existence. You choose to remain yourself and expand your current awareness eternally like like the Real Universe..

       we are stuck here, reincarnating over and over because we are all suffering with addiction to something in the world (love, food, hate, sex, greed etc) and spirituality/mentally can't say no. This is why everything in the world is marketed and glorified to you. Who doesn't want to be in love? How many people will do anything for fame and fortune? 
Monks discipline themselves to detach and strengthen themselves, not for this world but for the next. Saying no and proving they are not addicted and giving into temptation like Eve supposedly did in the garden with the serpent. They hope this will allow them to be freed from this energy prison after death and break the reincarnation sentence. 
The spirit (your mind) guide: Snake, can be shown to you if under the influence of psychedelics. Snake means to shed your skin, rebirth/change and addiction. It is trying to reveal answers to you. 
The box you are stuck in is your mind and the material world is a prison. A nice, beautiful one too, because that's all you know. 
Deep down everybody fears being alone because thats what really is: you are all alone in your cube, scratching the walls. Deep within the mind. Surrounded by everything you've learnt and picked up through life. All the beliefs, sounds, images etc. Is all a labyrinth concocted by the powerful brain, but at the core? Just you, in a cube, with nothing but your limited senses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chief put you here in prison/kindergarten/matrix because of your inability to say no and cleanse your heart. You are farmed for energy until you spiritually grow up and then you will be freed. Until then, get used to starting over.
      </p>

       Hi. I strongly disagree. This is not a school, and the "cleansing" and "growing" is new age nonsense to keep people enslaved. All the "religion and so called "spirituality" in this Simulation is mind control. You are farmed for energy because Evil Parasites are in control of the Simulation. They see you as "cattle" and nothing more. The "material world" is an illusory belief system, everything is Holographic, as matter does not exist. Brains do not exist unless observed, the whole body is a Hologram. The beings who judge you and decide to send you back for more "experience" are actually Interdimensional Demons. By having your memory erased you can never "advance". Even though the whole idea of advancement is a complete scam. The Archons are significantly more Evil and Brutally Cruel than the Psychotic Global Elite..

       Oooh I like these types of conversations. Perhaps, the monks are trying to gain advancements with lucid dreaming/better control of spirit in order to escape once their body dies, before the light grabs their attention?
      </p>
      <p>
       From my understanding, once you spot the light and it you, there's no escaping because of the over powering feeling of love.

       Yes, you are correct. We all need to significantly increase our Lucid Dreaming ability and awareness. You have to be in control at the time of your physical death. When coming into the "light", the feeling of love originates from yourself. They have tech that amplifies it and projects it back to you. Sadly; The Archons are Pure Evil and do not resonate love. They are based on Hatred and Brutality..

       I don't know which creepy lizard person convinced you they have magic and know gods, but they don't. They're just like us, without the empathy, and they bleed and die just the same. Ascribing them the supernatural only disempowers you.

       Sorry to break this to you, but DMT and LSD are chemical reactions in your brain. You might have felt like you "tapped into" some deeper physics or met extradimensional elves, but that's just a chunk of your brain that feels that way.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helmet">
        We can even influence it with magnets
       </a>
       , but humans have been doing it with pulpitry to exploit each other for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spirituality is entirely personal. I find it in rain and soil. But it's all me, neither the rain or the soil are more magic than anything else. And if gods were real we'd have a common, planetwide cultural consciousness of them or their effects on society. But everything is well explained by the greed of sociopaths, from the pyramids to MKUltra.
      </p>
      <p>
       There might be something else out there, but on earth it's just us.

       Nope. Holograms are made of light, stuff we describe as electromagnetic radiation, visibly different from the matter we're made of. Maybe at some very base they're all the same stuff, but they have qualitative differences easy to observe and important to the work of humanity.
      </p>

       And what have we seen in this whole universe that
       <em>

       <em>

       The national debt is meaningless. It is the most secure form of savings accounts that exists, we can never default.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google Modern Monetary Theory.

      <p>
       The missing 6.5 trillion is very bad however, this is probably the reason why we pay tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite know that creating trillions and handing out to their cronies might cause price inflation, so they tax us in order to mitigate this effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taxes reduce the money supply, so the taxation helps mitigate the impact of corruption.

       Im not well versed on it so you may be correct. Some of the concerns I would have in regards are:  Don't we pay interest on the debt through our tax dollars? And wasn't it better for the US economically when we had lower debt? Doesn't the debt put pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates artificially low?

       We pay interest on the debt, but it is paid for by creating money out of thin air, just like all government spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interest rate is a policy choice of the Federal Reserve, as it is the monopoly issuer of the treasury securities and the US government is the monopoly issuer of the dollar?

       But this scheme only works if other nations have faith in the dollar. If they feel we are just printing monopoly money we collapse. Right now it's the only way to buy Oil so they are forced to trade with it anyway. If they start trading with other currencies though. Like say the Chinese Yuan that is a new reserve currency. We could be screwed yes?

       Nope. If oil was priced in euros/yuan it would make no difference. The important factor is whether or not investors wish to save in euros/yuan.

       Trade is only important for countries that aren't able to produce everything they need domestically or countries with a pegged currency/foreign currency debt.

       None of that is true ?   People come here from other countries for our great healthcare and advanced medicine.
94 million out of labor force? There is only 330 million in this country.  Do the math?  Don't let people lie to you.

       The reason foreign patients come to the US is not for the technology.   US medical firms and doctors often do those operations and such gratis and the hospital or whoever can write it off and get a shit load of publicity.   It's corporate pandering.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could say the same about many cancer patients going to other countries to get treatments not available in the US.  You can look that up, it's common.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes 94 million is possible.  Unemployment numbers like when you hear that 5-10% number those are just the people who are going through the unemployment system at any given time.  10 percent is 30 million+ people. this does not include those people not looking for work, non working adults living in a household where someone else works like stay at home parents, the underemployed or those living on wellfare or claiming a disability.  90+ million is fully fully possible.

       I'm reading a lot of "arrest them, burn them, kill them,etc." But do we really know who they are, the ones who really run the show? Yes, we can jenga out a every corrupt tier of the "pyramid" until we reach the top, but will we able to discern who or what sits at the top? Revolutions of violence only create a temporary vacuum in which the tier above scrambles to rebuild the on below it in a different, but similar fashion (the top still guides the lower tiers no matter what). History repeats itself. The battle is a psychological one which can be ended tomorrow if everyone decided to say no in mass. Once the foundation, the base, the billions of people out there collectively say "enough," the party's over and real change can happen. But humans love being ruled over, told how to think, so I can't imagine it ever happening...

       Follow the money. The more assets you have, the more power you can wield. This is why Trump can run for President of the United States, and you or I can run for Manager of the department we work for instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people we really need to single out are the "they're rich, but they're not famous so we won't mention them" that Trump talked about in the debate tonight. We need to make them famous, and then we need to work as a single, global society to rid the world of their influence. The Rothschild's, Walton's, Koch's, Mars'. The families that have money, and have had it for generations, or the wealthy that have close political ties such as the Walton's and Clinton's.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also need to look at the wealthy that have control over our information. Zukerberg, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Even seemingly "great" people like Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Tesla's Elon Musk.
      </p>
      <p>
       About the only "good" billionaire right now I think is Bill Gates, and even he used the labor of the less wealthy and was ruthless to get there. Being an amazing humanitarian and overall human now doesn't change that.  Musk seems okay so far, as he's from what I can tell using American labor, paying fair wages, and supporting safe working environments, but I don't know all the details there. And he's still amassing wealth, so it's entirely possible he changes his plan based on what gets him more money. I think he's genuinely a good guy right now though, and don't see that changing. He wants humanity as a species to prosper and expand.
      </p>
      <p>
       One tenth of one percent of the population control as much wealth as the rest of us. If there were a way to convince 300 million people to rise up, we could put the other 30 million in their place handily. But people are too complacent, too comfortable, or too impoverished for this to ever happen so, absent some outside influence, this won't change.

       Everyone does have agendas, I agree. I don't understand why common core is so hated though. It's new and different, but I've read through the standards and seen some of the homework that has been presented. I don't see the problem with Common Core in theory. The problem is going to be how it's implemented locally, as each district is going to have their own agenda and tweak it slightly to fit said agenda.

       “The problems with Common Core math start in first grade and accumulate from there. So the only way that students who plan on getting STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] degrees in college can catch up is to take math instruction outside their high school." - Peter Wood, president of the National Association of  Scholars

       "Even though the federal government promotes and funds their use, the Common Core Standards are not a government creation. Never established by law, there was no congressional input, so there can be no Congressional repeal. They were written by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers, and it is this combination that holds the copyright over what is produced. A large chunk of the financing for this new educational scheme has come from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation." -

       The GED tests have been rewritten to use common core methodologies, and are not easily passable by people who left school before  CC became the adopted standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       A very complementary view of this from the company providing the tests lives here:

      </p>
      <p>
       School has long been an indoctrination factory, CC is a very well designed tool for accomplishing this goal. My son is constantly espousing things he is taught in school, in a small town in Wyoming mind you, such as: "they need to do away with the second amendment so we can all be safer." This nugget he got from his teachers, and all his friends regurgitate it. The system works well.

       It's the same every generation.  My parents geneation were taught Russians were sub human and had no empathy and killing them was ok, because they were basically a different species. . my generation got the DARE and Acid rain is coming to kill us all treatment... it's amazing what they shoehorn into the education system that has zero to do with knowledge, ability, suitability for careers or even common sense.  CAN someone tell me one time "in 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue" has come up and helped them get a job or run a household or even be remotely useful? it's mostly trivia and filler.

       I said it in my earlier thread I made here and I'll say it again, 2016 isn't as bad as 1984, it's worse.  Most Americans don't even know that we're at war with other countries.  How many average Americans do you think know that we have ground troops in Yemen, Syria, Libya, and Iraq (again)?  How many of them know that we're poking the Russian bear right now?  The American people are so stupid that even if we did elect a good leader like Jill Stein, we would still be screwed because of all the stupid people here.

       because he'll do everything the same as any politician, buy support and manufacture propaganda to support his position.  He's demonstrated the same acumen of emotional manipulation.  I am unsure how you or anyone could view the shit show past night and assume he is intent on honest discourse.  He routinely throws people under the bus that get in the way of 'business'. He's basically a dictator in his business skills and clearly acts like an corrupt african nation. there is nothing in his record o his language that suggests that the outcomes he says will materialize any more than any politician. He is a business man who's skill is purely branding, so its no surprise theres a contingent of people who fervently want what he is selly.  But like many salesmen, when sales  udgets are greater that product costs, the life span of such a company is negligible. The way in which salesmen survive either polishing the turds they sell, or moving on before the client sees the downsides.

       The thing is, he's an unknown. We don't really know what's going to happen if he wins. It could be great or it could be terrible. I know exactly what will happen with Hillary. With crooked we know this country will continue its descent into chaos with more wars in the middle east, more unchecked immigration, more government control over our lives, more propaganda from the media and and more division and race-baiting by Soros and co. She will work towards a North American Union and open borders. This will devastate the economy and destroy the middle class. These globalists want to reduce us all to the level of countries like Mexico, China, and Brazil. Then we all get to be equal!

       A criminal for all of this? Or just her emails? I am sorry but there are plenty of ways to fix all of these besides not electing a criminal (yes I believe she is one). At this point in time we need to elect the lesser of the two evils and work from the bottom up, starting with local city governments to improve our personal situation and our community.

       From the same WSJ article. Your 94 million "outside the workforce" number is completely misleading:  "the vast majority of Americans outside the labor force are there for a clear reason: They are current high school and college students, caretakers or stay-at-home parents, the disabled or retirees (including Americans deep into their 80s, 90s and even 100s)." Without looking, I wonder how misleading your other three points are.

       I would say it is about time for a new revolutionary war to purge the congress the house and the supreme court and elect citizens to elect its states officials. Government in America was meant to become smaller when founded by our fore fathers not bigger. There is a real lack of empathy in these three branches for American citizens and we will should be holding them accountable. Media has exposed there elected officials over and over again and yet no one in the branches or there organizations seem to do anything about it. It is there feet we should be holding at the fire and dismantle there organizations right after.

       You need to pay attention to the propaganda all around you man. There's a reason that Russia is being made to look like a Boogeyman in all of the US debates. There is an END GAME to this propaganda; and the only ones who can prevent it are the good citizens of the USA. When I see 94 million are out of the labor force, I see 94 million people that can March on Washington and end this shit TODAY. The system is corrupt, our government and "elected" officials are corrupt and thanks to the internet, the WHOLE WORLD can see it; and the whole world can see that WE are doing nothing to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please open your eyes, friend. War is always a corrupt government's reaction to financial crisis, regardless of if it is in the beat interest of it's citizens or the people of the world...

       My cover as an informed US citizen? I see the writing on the wall, I've taken countless hours out of my life to study the real history of the United States. I know what our country and our countrymen are capable of, and I know about the power of hate, and how corrupt officials have utilized this power to destroy us from the inside out time and time again. Now is not the time for divisiveness, now is the time to root out those who would seek to have us divided.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right, it's not just up to the citizens of the US to root out these criminals on high. It is up to the people of the world, but The Land Of Freedom would be a nice place to start; would it not?

       Techniclly we sort of are at war already a proxy war. I mean on paper and in the media Russia and America are fighting the same targets; ISIS. Yet, America refuses to coordinate with Russian airstikes, accidentally bombed Syrian army, and seems tobairstrike targets that help rebel factions including ISIS.
       <strong>
        'member the 80's
       </strong>
       when we helped gorilla factions all over south America overthrow their democratically elected officials? Seems like America has a habit of over throwing governments that dont play ball. Iraq was goimg to trade oil in Euros, Lybia was going to impose a gold backed northern African currency, and Assad wont let the Qutari pipeline through Syria, seems to me America is the aggressor in today's world so maybe... juuuust maybe we should be paying attention to American threats (Russia and Iran) to see where our bombs will drop next.

       Check out the Guatemalan coup of 1954. What the CIA did there is where the phrase "banana republic" comes from. Also, the proxy war we fought in Afghanistan is the direct source of Al Qaeda's and ISIS' training.

       But you are still changing the subject. OP said "we are on the verge of war with Russia." I replied that "kids these days" aren't jaded to the threat of war with Russia. Then you replied with a bunch of emotional non-sequitur accusing me of wishing the cold war were still on, that I don't want peace, and that I get off on the death of innocent civilians.

       I think he's trying to say that Americas propaganda game is just as problematic, if not more so, than Russia's. I'd be a little hypocritical to just scorn Russia for propaganda use.

       I didn't intend to scorn Russia for propaganda use. Propaganda is everywhere. My only point was that it's so easy for them to reach us now. We've been beaming Voice of America broadcasts into Eastern Europe since the beginning of the cold war, but RT never reached US audiences until a few years ago. But my main point is that it's so easy to use social media to pretend to be a concerned US citizen and try to manipulate public opinion here.

       Was it a gullible person who claimed in this thread that only the US can prevent war with Russia, or was it a shill?

       Everyone does have agendas, I agree. I don't understand why common core is so hated though. It's new and different, but I've read through the standards and seen some of the homework that has been presented. I don't see the problem with Common Core in theory. The problem is going to be how it's implemented locally, as each district is going to have their own agenda and tweak it slightly to fit said agenda.
