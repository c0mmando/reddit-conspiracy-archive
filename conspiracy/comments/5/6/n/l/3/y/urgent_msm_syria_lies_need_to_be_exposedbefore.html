    <div class="md"><p>All lies all the time. They aren&#39;t &quot;rebels&quot; when they&#39;re foreign fighters crossing the Turkish and Jordanian borders to join the fight. They aren&#39;t &quot;moderate&quot; when they&#39;re desecrating corpses and dealing in sex slaves. They aren&#39;t conducting legitimate jihad when they&#39;re accepting Zionist support to engage in Takfirism. SOHR is not a trustworthy source. The White Helmets are Al Qaeda&#39;s clean up crew. Assad is better for Syria than ISIS or Al Qaeda (or the FSA, SDF, NSyA, Khorasan, Al Nusra) just as Saddam was better for Iraq and Gaddafi was better for Libya and <em>none of them</em> were a present threat to the powers destroying their countries.</p>

<p>Alongside the MSM&#39;s Hillary shilling the reporting on the Syrian war is currently the best example that our media cannot be trusted to tell the truth.</p>

<p>all three stopped using the USD in their oil trading, aka the petrodollar, if that caught on the USD would lose most of its value overnight. its still happening but these attacks have been a warning for the other oil producers to stay in line or we will murder you and lay waste to your people.</p>

<p>The Infamous &quot;Oded Yinon Plan
excerpt:
&quot;When viewed in the current context, the war on Iraq, the 2006 war on Lebanon, the 2011 war on Libya, the ongoing war on Syria and Iraq, the war in Yemen, the process of regime change in Egypt, must be understood in relation to the Zionist Plan for the Middle East. The latter consists in weakening and eventually fracturing neighboring Arab states as part of an Israeli expansionist project.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew the proxy war in Syria was about pipelines, but I never quite understood the specific order of targeted countries until your comment. I agree, that&#39;s a very reasonable explanation. </p>

<p>Your statement that Iran is the next target is astute. I myself <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4ynafw/will_israel_attack_iran_within_the_next_6_months/">posted a thread</a> with detailed information about why Iran may be the target of an Israeli/US attack in the next six months (and I posted it in August!).</p>

<p>For some strange reason the thread was downvoted. But honestly, the person&#39;s speculations make perfect sense to me. Iran needs to be attacked before their S-300 air defense systems are operational. Otherwise, the layered defense system will close off several possible attack routes. </p>

That way, the U.S. will have video &quot;evidence&quot; for Russian war crimes in Aleppo, and a handy pretext for further escalation/intervention in the Syrian conflict. </p>

<p>Just think about that statement. You honestly can&#39;t decide who&#39;s worse or you just don&#39;t agree entirely with both? I&#39;m not a fan of 100% of Trump&#39;s policies but I&#39;ll be damned if in a binary choice he doesn&#39;t have the blatantly obvious upper hand.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Hillary is a better person, just that it isn&#39;t immediately obvious that her presidency would do more long term damage.  We know what we are getting with Hillary, and it&#39;s not good, but it isn&#39;t any different from what we already have.  We have no idea what Trump would actually do, so it&#39;s possible he would be better, but it&#39;s just as likely he would be much worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for bringing attention to this. I&#39;m shitting my pants about the Syria conflict, and there&#39;s hardly a peep about it in the MSM. I feel like Doc Brown in Back to the Future 2 talking about alternate 1985 when I bring this up to others. How are we ignoring our own country provoking WW3?</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to downplay any conspiracies, and yeah, if you didn&#39;t know about war propaganda please get educated on the past 200 years of American history.</p>

<p>The war system itself is perennially evil.  It is both horrifying but also important to contextualize.  We are not just now, with Syria, realizing the lies.  The fight is big as hell, it&#39;s like ending slavery.  But that by no minimizes the gravity of it all.</p>

<p>Some of us here might know this, but that isn&#39;t reality for the general public. Yes the fight is big. </p>

<p>You used &quot;We&quot; to start sentences three times in your reply. Essentially what you&#39;re saying is calm down, this is normal war propaganda. yada, yada, yada.</p>

<p>What are we supposed to do? I dug in for the long fight years ago and the world has gotten progressively worse. Largely due to mainstream media manipulation. I&#39;m sick of it and unless you have a plan besides &quot;diggin in&quot; then you probably shouldn&#39;t be projecting what we should do.</p>

<p>edit: This particular story is important to get out there. It&#39;s an eye-opener for people who are sucked into mainstream news. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re advocating silence as a strategy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t fault the video or its creator for not covering everything. That is obviously impossible, and not what he was trying to achieve with the video. However, I do take issue with the response to the video in  this thread. </p>

<p>This is a serious problem that deserves discussion, but it feels like all I ever see is people throwing out their pet theories or using whatever is posted as an opportunity to lash out at whatever group they are currently mad at. This is inevitable in a public forum, but what I don&#39;t understand is how it seems to be the only thing that gets up voted. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any answers. I am just trying to continue the conversation by asking specific questions. I decided to make a top level comment because I didn&#39;t see any of substance worth replying to. </p>

<p>If I had to guess, I&#39;d say that Russia and Assad had some kind of arrangement, undoubtedly related to oil, that was going to disrupt the current balance of power in the region and therefore the global economy in a way that would benefit Russia and hurt the US and other western powers.  </p>

<p>This is obviously super basic and obvious, but I don&#39;t know enough to get any more specific.  I was just frustrated that everything I saw in the comments was either off topic or phrased as if thier piont of view was the only logical explanation, without ever actually explaining what it was they thought was going on.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For many Syrians, the U.S.-trained rebels are perceived as little more than guns-for-hire, Robert Ford, the former U.S. Ambassador to Syria, told me. “American mercenaries, that’s what I’d call them. They’re trained by Americans. They’re paid by Americans. They’re supposed to fight for American goals—which are out of synch with local priorities.”</p>

<p>this is just a small taste of what is actually going on in Syria. Covert operations, unfortunately, arent publicized/covered or talked about these days. there are very few &quot;real&quot; journalists around these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. This is my personal opinion based on the intel I have collected from my friends in the region of Aleppo, Homs, and Damascus, Syria. Majority of the rebels are brainwashed with the ideology of &#39;takfiri&#39; (a very harsh sect that has been denounced by the Islamic Council of Ulama&#39;). These fighters aren&#39;t moderate at all. They&#39;re full of extreme ideas, they killed Christians, Jewish, even Muslims. They have disobeyed all points in the &#39;Tenets of Jihad&#39; (do not kill innocent people, do not destroy buildings etc). When our media described them as legit, trust me. They are not legit at all. They are just the same as the IS, placed to trigger more hatred and clashes between the Christians and the Muslims. </p>

<p>Anyway, has everybody checked out on the result of the Battle of Mosul yet? I have lost contact with friends in Iraq. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Hillary is a better person, just that it isn&#39;t immediately obvious that her presidency would do more long term damage.  We know what we are getting with Hillary, and it&#39;s not good, but it isn&#39;t any different from what we already have.  We have no idea what Trump would actually do, so it&#39;s possible he would be better, but it&#39;s just as likely he would be much worse. </p>
