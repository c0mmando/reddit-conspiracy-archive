         In Fielding Question About U.S. Corporate Tax Reform, Hillary Clinton Mentioned Her Frequent Meetings With Corporate Executives And “Groups All Across The Private Sector.” HILLARY CLINTON: “This time around, a number of business leaders have been talking to my husband and me about an idea that would allow the repatriation of the couple trillion dollars that are out there. And you would get a lower rate -- a really low rate -- if you were willing to invest a percentage in an infrastructure bank.

         Clinton Said Lowering The Corporate Tax Rate Could “Be On the Table And To Be Looked At As Part Of A Broader Package” To Make America More Competitive. [Remarks to Cardiovascular Research Foundation, 9/15/14]

       Clinton on the campaign trail declared, “I won’t cut Social Security.” Yet in the email’s excerpts of her Morgan Stanley speech, she lauded a presidential commission that proposed changes that would slash Social Security benefits, according to experts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The email shows Clinton specifically telling Morgan Stanley that the Simpson-Bowles commission “put forth the right framework” for dealing with fiscal challenges. She also said “the Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right.”
      </p>
      <p>
       As the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported in 2011, that commission proposed a plan to “cut benefits for the vast majority of Social Security recipients, weaken the link between a recipient’s benefits and past earnings (which could undermine public support for the program), and, despite the claims of the co-chairs, fail to protect most low-income workers from benefit cuts.”

        THROWING SHADE AT ARABS

       Email Discussion about including disparaging comments about Arabs in Clinton speech on ISIS:
      </p>
      <p>
       "We can throw some more shade at the Arabs, though. Dan and I have an idea."
      </p>
      <p>
       "I’m glad you’re bumping that up a bit. You cover regional responsibility, but this is a big flash point for voters."
      </p>
      <p>
       "We now have a John Anzalone memorial paragraph in the speech." (john anzalone is a Clinton's pollster, I think this is supposed to be a joke)

       This email is from a Clinton surrogate who spoke with Netanyahu.
      </p>
      <p>
       We discussed possible economic initiatives to help the Palestinians, like more Palestinian investment in Zone C, and/or an agreement to limit settlement expansion to the established blocs that under the Clinton parameters would be in Israel after any negotiation.

       Abu Mazan continues to talk about retiring, as he has done for years, but seems more serious now. There is no obvious successor if he leaves, “other than the guy in jail”. (Added Marwan Barghouti)
Israel Arabs are a “real problem.” The government had to dismantle the northern branch of the Islamic Association because they were radicalizing the Israeli Arabs, who are 20% of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Prime Minister and the Defense Minster, and “certainly the military and intelligence community”, want to keep the PA. There is still intelligence sharing on radicals, but when Israel asks them to arrest the radicals they identify, they refuse, and ask the Israelis to do it, and then protest the arrests. But this is all part of a scenario of cooperation. However, if the PA takes Israel to the International Criminal Court, this would be a “huge problem” and a potential game changer in terms of their relationship with the PA.

       What I find amusing from all this is she for the most part got the 55 and above vote in the primaries and she plans to slash social security. That's Hillaryious
