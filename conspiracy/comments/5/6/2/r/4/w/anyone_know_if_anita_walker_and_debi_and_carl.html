        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Huh, I was just wondering if anyone here had any information? ;-)</p>

<p>Sick things happening over there in Edmond, Oklahoma.... Life.Church indeed...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/2016+Olde+Ridge+Rd+Edmond/@35.6936065,-97.5478508,3a,75y,206.8h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sD-aX4MKzB9Z5v1qnIr9qiQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x9811f00765b7490f!6m1!1e1">That little house</a> sure does look innocent, doesn&#39;t it? Nothing bad possibly could ever happen there... right?</p>

<p>... and surely <a href="http://www.amhca.org/page/Advocate20110206">such a prominent, successful woman</a> wouldn&#39;t be a part of any disgusting experiements involing innocent couples and children.... right? I mean, that seems pretty outrageous, and the CIA isn&#39;t known for doing things like that... I mean, even if she was an agent of such an organisation...</p>

<p>Are Carl and Debi Franklin, who do work in Air Force intelligence, also working with the CIA via CD Investments, Inc. and FirstLook Properties, Inc. to purchase houses, such as the one on 2016 Olde Ridge Rd Edmond to use as CIA torture and experimentation facilities?</p>

<p>Just a question that really needs to be asked, and looked into, all over the web.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, and is Anita Walker, LPC used as a filter to review candidates for the experiments?</p>

<p>Is Life.Church involved? Are they using their &quot;foster care&quot; program as guinea pigs? Huh, just need to look into it I suppose, all over the web, and maybe someone will know either way.</p>

<p>Is Maloney Investments LLC of OKC involved with these CIA houses as well? Tied in with the government contractor source Maloney &amp; Curcio of New Jersey, which ties in <a href="http://www.techlaunch.com/team/jon-burley/">Jon Burley</a> and Nanci Morris, who worked/works in the Department of Interior and directly with the office of the POTUS?</p>

<p>Huh, this just goes deeper and deeper.</p>

<p>Are these people stalking innocent couples, torturing them, and performing experiments in houses like at: 2016 Olde Ridge Rd. Edmond, Oklahoma? And if so, why are they attempting to experiment on them? Why are they stalking these people? How many people have they murdered after they receive their results?</p>

<p>We just have to ask these questions, you know? I mean I would think it pretty god damn monsteriously sick if the CIA hired (and possibly outsourced to Xe) people to review people to experiment on, setup houses to perform the experiments, and torture with people&#39;s lives to obtain data for use on future people.</p>

<p>It would also be pretty goddamn sick if the CIA had a few Edmond doctors in their pockets to attempt to setup medical situations where the victims would die by apparent natural causes, and that little mess would be neatly swept under the rug.</p>

<p>Testosterone clinics indeed, Draelos Metabolic Oklahoma City Edmond Endocrinology.... maybe a &quot;whoops we killed you via heart attack/stroke from overly prescribing testosterone&quot;... heh, but I guess we just don&#39;t know. We need to ask these things, though.</p>

<p>We wouldn&#39;t want anyone getting hurt who doesn&#39;t deserve it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep... we live in interesting times....</p>

<p>It was really interesting how they could hack into any of my machines, Linux Mint or Windows 10, easily, even with my tech know-how (though I&#39;m not a leet haxor level security guy, still... I know my shit...), didn&#39;t matter. They had access.</p>

<p>They installed clickers in my house, in my devices to &quot;talk&quot; to me, 2 clicks yes, 1 click no. </p>

<p>It&#39;s designed so that if I tell you this you go, &quot;Pft, that guy is an insane tinfoil hat wearing asshole who is talking to his stuff! HAHA! WHAT A FREAK!&quot;, see?</p>

<p>They tortured me, they attempted to kill me, they stalked me, more than just the people mentioned, I mean a whole mother fucking operation, verified by my lady who saw some of it, and some of my family who was threatened so badly, that they betrayed me, and are too terrified to tell me just WHO and WHY they stalked me.</p>

<p>When I put the knife to the doctor&#39;s throat, that cock sucker Dralos, he said, &quot;CIA. It&#39;s the CIA.&quot;, and I was told &quot;Xe&quot; was involved.</p>

<p>Why? Who am I? I am not worth the HELL they put me through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea. I&#39;m just putting it all over the web, using my leet skills (heh), for search engine indexing. Websites are also going up soon, but those can easily be taken down.</p>

<p>... and for what? I don&#39;t know. I may never know. I&#39;m not a spy. I&#39;m not powerful or wealthy enough to be worth all of this.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t typed it all out, you have no idea what they put me through. The airport alone.... the amount of people, time, resources... why? One guess is that it was/is an experiment to use against future people, you know, testing their abilities on me first or something.</p>

<p>A guess was that some of the &quot;Xe&quot; people were the people ordered to stalk me in their cars, as ridiculous as that sounds... it&#39;s just a guess. </p>

<p>Why would they do this?</p>

<p>I&#39;m writing it all out on the other monitor. The story is so large that it will take hours, maybe more like 4 hours. BTW, I JUST recieved an email from an investment firm that I haven&#39;t heard of that suddenly wants to hire me &quot;ASAP&quot;. </p>

<p>Huh, maybe just random chance, or maybe someone is nervous. I have a weapon here if they attack me tonight... </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the time to fuck around, and I could give a shit about money.</p>
