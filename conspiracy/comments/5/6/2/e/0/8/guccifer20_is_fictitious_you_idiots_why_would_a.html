    <div class="md"><p>Supposedly he did it because Guccifer is his idol. That just doesn&#39;t make any sense! To try and steal your idols name. And why not make a name for yourself? But mostly the first part. Go ahead, google Guccifer. You are going to be buried in Guccifer2.0 info. If TPTB wanted to bury the good stuff...they succeeded.</p>

<p>I think Guccifer really uncovered some deep illuminati shit and failed to get it out to us. To bury him, they created a fictitions hacker and released a bunch of shit that doesn&#39;t cause any harm to the illuminati. Just the stupid ass DNC. </p>

<p>I have to say: One of the people I correspond with about conspiracy stuff didn&#39;t even know there were two Guccifers until I mentioned it to him last week.</p>

<p>And I, too, would like to know more---a LOT more---about the illuminati stuff. I&#39;m sure you know he said there was a planned dirty bomb nuke for Chicago, which didn&#39;t happen---maybe because he gave us the headsup about it. Rahm Emmanuel is surely part of the fifth column that&#39;s (all but?) taken over the country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google for &quot;Guccifer -2.0&quot;. That way youll get atleast some stuff from the original guccifer(search results with 2.0 in them are not shown).</p>

<p>FBI of course tells that he didn&#39;t manage to hack clinton&#39;s server: <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/286851-comey-hacker-guccifer-never-gained-access-to-clinton-server">http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/286851-comey-hacker-guccifer-never-gained-access-to-clinton-server</a></p>

<p>According to this: <a href="https://chiefio.wordpress.com/2016/05/04/guccifer-why-hillary-is-toast/">https://chiefio.wordpress.com/2016/05/04/guccifer-why-hillary-is-toast/</a>
&quot;Sitting out there in “the cloud” is a 30 GB archive of “stuff” from a guy who used to read Hillary’s emails “for a few hours” and then go out to do gardening… What’s in it? Who knows.&quot;</p>

<p>Theres also a 5.87GB torrent named Guccifer Leaks - Hacks from Marcel Lazăr Lehel of Romania from 2014. Which might be contain this information: <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/guccifer-archive-687543">http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/guccifer-archive-687543</a></p>

<p>If the 30GB file is indeed correct, then it seems that he failed to get it out. Russian intelligence services seemed to have access/were monitoring him, so they might have the information he uncovered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He named himself after him because the original Guccifer was known for hacking and releasing politically sensitive documents. Carrying on in that tradition himself, I think it makes sense to use a name that is already associated with important leaks because it immediately identifies him as a hacktivist in the same vein/with similar motivations and grabs attention quickly. You&#39;re staring too deeply into the abyss, unknowingly gazing into yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that the more blatant, transparent and mainstream a given source of disinformation is, the more gullible fanboys it will have, who will race to its&#39; defense, downvoting into oblivion anyone who dares to question it.  Snowden and Assange are the usual suspects, but it happens with Anonymous as well.</p>

<p>Why anyone still believes anything that Anonymous says beats me.  It makes me think, though; given the degree to which the group have destroyed the original meaning of the word &quot;anonymous,&quot; and how thoroughly hijacked they are now, maybe said hijacking never actually happened in the first place.  Maybe it was a psy op all along.</p>

<p>Part of the problem with studying conspiracy theories for years, is that in the end you have trouble knowing what to believe.</p>
