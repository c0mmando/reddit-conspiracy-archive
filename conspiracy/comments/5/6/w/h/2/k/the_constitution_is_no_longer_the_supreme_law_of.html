    <div class="md"><p>You call yourselves awake, but the slavish attitude that many Americans have towards the Constitution, proves that you are still subject to brainwashing; merely a different form.</p>

<p>The Constitution was a re-implementation of the Augustine Principate; that is, the form of government devised by Augustus Caesar for Rome, after Julius was assassinated.  A few things were changed, here and there, yes; you have the farce that is the electoral college, so that you can tell yourselves that you are democratic.  The American legislative branch, however, is just as much a bribed, psychopathic gerontocracy as the Senate was in Rome.  The Constitution was also both more centralised and more tyrannical than the previous articles of Confederation were, too.  The rationalisation was to have a single regime across the entire continent, both so that the single army of said continent would be much larger, and so that all of the tax revenue from said continent would end up in one place.  </p>

<p>The Civil War was about taxation, not slavery.  Lincoln only freed the blacks from the outer form of slavery; but in reality he made slaves out of all of you.  Go and read about how he suspended the media and jailed anyone who was critical of him without trial, and then come back and talk to me about the Great Emancipator.  Lincoln&#39;s Masonic owners built the Lincoln memorial, and they did so to commemorate the fact that Lincoln solidified and ensured the subjugation of the entire country.  Everything you rail against as corrupt now...the Federal Reserve, the gold grab...Lincoln laid the groundwork for all of it.</p>

<p>The only thing that is really happening now, is that the mask is being taken off.  You are seeing the system of government that you <strong><em>really</em></strong> have, rather than the one which the CIA brainwashed you into thinking that you had.  If Hillary is good for anything, she is great for helping the rest of us figure out what we really want, by giving us an incredible demonstration of what we <strong><em>don&#39;t.</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried to register rebootcongress.com a little while ago but unfortunately it was already taken. I really like it as a metaphor though.. think it could resonate with a lot of people.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m not sure 1940 is far enough back. You&#39;ve already got The Fed, the IRS, and gold confiscation at that point. I&#39;d be looking at like 1890 or something I think. But as <a href="/u/b_low_brown">/u/b_low_brown</a> points out there was plenty wrong with society back then as well.</p>
