<p>Steem.io (steemit.com) is a project to decentralize and open-source social media on a blockchain, maybe this is something you might be interested in. It can&#39;t be muted or censored, which, IMHO, is the main selling point (although they still try to sell it as &quot;blog and make money&quot;, but that&#39;s completely uninteresting in this context). </p>

<p>They also suppressed the tag &#39;conspiracy&#39;.  Any post tagged conspiracy and other tags will not show up among other tags (ex: in other &#39;subs&#39;), showing a willingness of steemit to actively suppress &#39;conspiracy&#39;.  They also caused blog posts not to show up in various ways.  They also have not responded to any inquiries by myself or an other, even hitting their media group.  No boilerplate response, nothing.

<p>I am going to make it my business to expose steemit as a deep state strategem to fracture communities, and they&#39;ve lied about their blockchain based censorship technology.  They dun goof&#39;d.  They got caught.  I wish you and others would acknowledge this, experiment around with steemit by posting anti-deep state stuff and see what happens.  Then report back.  I wish overall you&#39;d stop promoting steemit.  It&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>Well, I did. I posted an article on what happens when a plane hits a building, <code>#investigate911</code>. 44.69 SBD: </p>

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/history/@akareyon/what-to-expect-when-a-plane-hits-a-building-mig-21-vs-plattenbau-cottbus-e-germany-1975">https://steemit.com/history/@akareyon/what-to-expect-when-a-plane-hits-a-building-mig-21-vs-plattenbau-cottbus-e-germany-1975</a></p>

<p>Another one I posted with <code>#conspiracy</code> and <code>#investigate911</code>: The case for an independent and international investigation into the terrorist attacks of september 11th, 2001 (101 SBD). </p>

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/investigate911/@akareyon/the-case-for-an-independent-and-international-investigation-into-the-terrorist-attacks-of-september-11th-2001-introducing">https://steemit.com/investigate911/@akareyon/the-case-for-an-independent-and-international-investigation-into-the-terrorist-attacks-of-september-11th-2001-introducing</a></p>

<p>My most successful article on the blockchain so far? Me bashing Steemit for still being beta, for the UX and UI sucking balls, for nobody understanding the math, for the whitepaper and the devs not explaining it, for a &gt;0.9 Gini coefficient, for disproportionally and systematically favoring the haves over the have-nots, for inventivizing writing for the trash bin - 2555 SBD:</p>

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@akareyon/a-realistic-integration-crash-course-for-social-network-migrants-to-steemit-com">https://steemit.com/steemit/@akareyon/a-realistic-integration-crash-course-for-social-network-migrants-to-steemit-com</a></p>

<p>Or just take @corbettreport&#39;s introduceyourself post... what did he get? 10000 SBD or something of that order? Although he says &quot;9/11 was an inside job&quot; in the video. </p>

<hr/>

<p>You can see, I&#39;m skeptical of Steem as well. But your argument does not convince. </p>

<p>The admins never replied to your emails? Many other users complain about that as well, for reasons completely unrelated with &quot;conspiracy&quot; or &quot;censorship&quot;, simply because sudden changes requiring hardforks are implemented without prior discussion (the fucking rep system, for example). The interface sucks balls and is buggy as hell? I don&#39;t disagree, but I don&#39;t make a conspiracy theory out of it, I just call out the lazyness of the devs. Images were not displayed properly? Many others had that problem the last few days, with innocent art, and complained about it in the steem.chat channels. </p>

<p>And so on, and so on.</p>

<p>Sorry, my man, you know I like you and respect you, and I&#39;ll be the first to join your &quot;business to expose steemit as a deep state strategem to fracture communities&quot; as soon as I see the same thing. </p>

<p>All I see right now is @ned and @dan trying to tweak the backbone to death to satisfy SJWs and nonsensical complaints about bots and brigades and inequality instead of working with what is there and building a good and strong UI instead, which could solve most of the problems without any hardforks. But that seems to be their style, I heard that is how they effed up Bitshares as well: tweaking the backbone until it broke.</p>

<p>The search function sucks? Use steemshovel.com. </p>

<p>The UX sucks? Use steemstats.com. </p>

<p>Last, but not least, do not confuse the blockchain and steemit.com. Steemit is just the interface, not the blockchain itself. Steemit is centralized and yes, they do &quot;censor&quot;, NSFW content, for example. I installed piston.web and can see those too now. The blockchain itself remains immutable.</p>

<p>And no, it is not based on Bitcoin. It only uses the same technology, namely the blockchain, an invention which might prove to be the steam engine of this century. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that steemit is bullshit because my post wasn&#39;t as popular as yours. I&#39;m not so immature, and I did get a few meager upvotes.  I&#39;m staying it&#39;s bullshit because they suppressed the conspiracy tag and clearly demoted those that were marked as such by omission.  That&#39;s A)</p>

<p>But more to the point, B) they actually altered my article adversarially and to make Hillary look better.  STEEMIT did this.  And I have PROOF and three Witnesses.  It&#39;s my first link.  Please <em>actually</em> look at it this time, because I know you&#39;re a smart person Akaryon, and I think you of all would understand.  Nothing else you say in defense of them can help this behavior--it&#39;s indefensible.  Also, does my proof of that not completely undermine steemit&#39;s claims on how their technology works?</p>

<p>I did, and I already addressed that. Images were broken for all of Steemit, not just you. Harmless artwork and illustrations, not just your Hillary glitches. I saw it myself, on Firefox, Chromium and Vivaldi. It was discussed in steemit.chat. It&#39;s a bug, or bad coding, not a conspiracy. It is fixed now. As you say, I am a smart person, but I really don&#39;t understand why you would blow it so out of proportion. </p>

<p>I can understand why those who set up a node want to avoid DMCA takedown orders or how that government censorship shit is called. You can set up one for yourself and check whether your content is still on the blockchain. Hint: it likely is. Again: there is the blockchain Steem, it cannot be censored. And there is one &quot;official&quot; interface, steemit.com, which does filter the blockchain to avoid legal problems, and there will be many more alongside piston.web. I don&#39;t see the issue here.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The value drop is more likely explained with the nonsensical June/July bubble, when STEEM peaked at ~4U$ on the exchanges and the chicks who got five-figure rewards for dumping plastic balloons in the ocean or posting make-up tutorials cashed out instead of powering up. My favourite is the trucker who boasted he &quot;bought some ass&quot; and later complained bitterly when his shitposts received no attention anymore.</p>

<p>Even the sucky UX explains the current market value of STEEM better. BTCs value didn&#39;t drop from more people showing up to the party either, you know.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Apart from that, I must reiterate, and I said it in the steemigration guide: you&#39;ll be unhappy if you post for the cash. As soon as the market reaches saturation, payouts will be negligible for most users. I know they make it a selling point, and I disagree strongly with that strategy, as you have seen for yourself. What sets Steem apart from all other social networks is that there are no administrators or moderators. Sure, a user rich in SP can downflag a post to seven hells - but he can&#39;t delete or remove it. That puts Steem miles ahead of Reddit and Facebook, IMHO. </p>

<p>That, plus there is considerable infighting going on among &quot;truther&quot; and &quot;received knowledge&quot; &quot;whales&quot;, as they call powerful users there. I&#39;d be suspicious if all the whales and witnesses agreed, but there is strong competition among them and lively debate, which is good.</p>

<p>And again: I&#39;m not defending ned or dan or the plutocratic approach or the wealth distribution or the underlying math. I criticize it heavily, openly and publicly, be it on Steemit, here or in the chat, and I&#39;ll even do so when I&#39;m in Amsterdam. There are many other critics of Steem, on cryptocurrency grounds alone - it&#39;s a Ponzi scam, it was significantly pre-mined, the devs already tanked Bitshares, changes are hidden in hardforks without prior discussion, witnesses receive disproportional rewards, the &quot;block&quot; function still doesn&#39;t work and so on and so on. I&#39;m just saying that the case you are making is extremely weak, an interface bug is not evidence for a conspiracy, and I think you&#39;re overreacting. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>As the whitepaper says - it is an experiment, and I want to see the outcome :)</p>

<p>How on EARTH would I know this?  Do you have a source for this?  I hate to be suspicious, but I feel very much like you are making this up. You know why I feel this way?  Because each of my images was cut off at exactly the place it was needed to obfuscate hillary&#39;s glitches.  Also, I never heard of this, but I dont&#39; spent as much time on steemit as apparently you do.  It seems like you&#39;re a huge supporter of steemit, very quick to defend them on all points.  That is also suspicious to me because I know they are a ponzi scheme (&quot;it was significantly pre-mined&quot; ==&gt; Yes!  It&#39;s market capped, meaning that people getting steemit are just dividing a plate of brownies, to put it dead simply)  and I am one of at least 5 others who think so.  </p>

<p>I want you to know that I have never said anything about the interface or some of the other complaints.  you are bringing that into the discussion to use as a strawman.  Sorry!</p>

<p>I really need you to post me an example or a post that steemit was image- broken in this way.  You need to prove that.  If you don&#39;t...then I&#39;ll know I&#39;m right about everything but I&#39;ll also know another thing.</p>
