       Its clear the bankers and the global elites want Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       But theres a legitimate chance Trump may end up winning the election.

       How does this figure into the Trump is a plant scenario?

       Dude did you see what they did to Bernie?
      </p>
      <p>
       She's going to win, period.
The last time they "let" 'someone unknown' run against her, she was crushed and we had our first black president. If Trump even comes close to the votes somehow (after his latest self induced fuck up) they will just LIE to us and tell us Clinton really won. Exit polls be damned, shit won't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       You really think this guy who spent the majority of his Adult life befriending and donating to Clinton(s) is somehow not a motherfucking plant?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think someone who isn't a plant would be so silent on the numerous corrupt things concerning Hillary? Yet blurb out stupid fucking shit after stupid fucking shit effectively handing over the Presidency to a god damn Psychotic murderer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think Trump was totally unforeseen by the Global Elites who as
       <em>
        you've said
       </em>
       , likely want
       <em>
        her
       </em>
       to win when he's LITERALLY one of the only people in the world the majority of "the people" would feel
       <em>
        forced
       </em>
       to choose Hillary over?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any idea how many people will vote for Hillary simply because they can't relate to a Racist Tax dodger and feel somewhat obligated to do 'their" part to 'keep him out of the WH?
      </p>
      <p>
       WHAT THE FUCK yo?

       I mean most time this shit is a "motherfucking layup" for anyone with half a brain, there's soooo much out there that could really damage her if brought up more by Trump it just screams of foul play.

       Agreed completely. I would like to believe that he's running on his own wide-eyed dreams of making America great again, but the fact that he didn't bring up any one of the Hillary scandals during the debate... just... why?? Is he really THAT inept?? I don't think so...

       That was what really sold it to me I was maybe 85% sure he was somewhat of a goon or total plant but it's like jesus dude, anyone with a brain and critical thinking skills would have buried her with anything from:
      </p>
      <p>
       "You passed out during a 9/11 memorial visit, imagine if it was the real thing?",
      </p>
      <p>
       "You've barley held any press conferences over the last six months the fuck kind of transprancey is that?'
      </p>
      <p>
       "How's the ole' blood clot treating you? Hate for there still to be effects/injury my lady."
      </p>
      <p>
       "You're frail as fuck and call out sick for a lot of things, as the President we expect you to answer and be available to the people...can you do it?"
      </p>
      <p>
       even a "fuck you" would have given me some indication he had motives against hers.

       Yes, totally "in your face" style too, something I'll never forget back when Obama said "She will say everything and change nothing" at the time I was like 'boom drop the mic baby' (I was impressionable at the time) then later on shes secretary of state n I'm like wow fuck me. He has the balls now to say shes most qualified and competent to replace him. shits weak.

       And I actually lol'd I def forgot that Trump wants that, fucking Giuliani man... haha I mean you gotta laugh to keep from crying sometimes.

       I was impressionable once too. I remember watching the Bush-Kerry debates while drinking with my buddies and cheering on Kerry. We were so sick of Bush's bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything wasn't all super liberal like now at the time- Bush's duel presidency (both stolen IMO) was SUPER rightwing and the media reflected that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they've swung to the left- but all I see is authoritarianism. Fuck a "left/right" false paradigm... I've seen both and they both suck. Ron Paul, a true rebel, got ignored and royally screwed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't ignore Trump. As PT Barnum once said- "I don't care what you say about me in the press, just make sure you spell my name right."

       Yeah I was very young when 9/11 happened and grew up with the Bush years I remember at a certain point people felt if they said anything that went against the grain they'd be called unpatriotic or American the was a real, legit fear of suppression.

       Obama was just my first eligible voting n I was hook line n sinker.

       Trump's clearly okay with not giving a fuck about negative perception. It's so clear that the public really doesn't affect these big shots.

       That's what I struggle with too. I don't know if he's a plant, but to me his candidacy doesn't pass the smell test. The thing that makes me raise my eyebrow is that every time yet another new Hillary scandal pops up, Trump out-crazies himself. Maybe that's just Trump being Trump and he's too green and obviously isn't a seasoned politician... but I dunno. It just doesn't smell right.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I'm not sure I fully believe that our votes matter. I think him being a plant might fit the scenario perfectly if it's already determined that Hillary will be president (by TPTB of course).
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't know what to make of this entire election. Everything is just so bizarro that it almost feels like one big psy-op.

       What convinced me was every neocon is pro hillary.  They aren't voting Trump.  Hillary's policies and ideas compared to Trump's are wildly outrageous and extremely right wing.  Her views on israel and drones and libya and wars for example.  But Trump makes her look good.  She isn't publicly saying slurs or making sexist comments.  So Trump makes her look good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Trump and Clinton being friends for years convinced me.  Why would Hillary or the Clintons be friends with someone so racist, sexist etc...?
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, I wonder if the elites picked Hillary, and then expected Trump to throw the election.  Theres long been a theory Trump would do something so outrageous he'd lose on the spot.  Say the N Word, for example.  He has yet to do that.  its possible they expected him to do this, on purpose, but that at a certain point he actually realized he could win it.  And refused to drop out.  And is legitimately running now.

       One theory I've been giving some thought: maybe Trump was picked specifically to create even more of a divide? He appeals to conservatives because the common agreement among tea party people and republicans alike during the last election was that we need someone who will run the country like a business and stop wasting our tax dollars. What if TPTB were like "💡! Run it like a business!!! TRUMP!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump appeals to "common folks" with his no-bullshit style. He's also appealing because he's not a politician and people who are at least a little informed are understandably fed up with politicians. BUT he's also divisive because he does say what conservative America is probably thinking and he doesn't sugar coat it for the bleeding heart liberals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people who are still asleep are the ones getting dumped into playing the game and getting caught in an uproar over the fact that he said pussy. Maybe he's just there to ensure an even greater divide between people. We all know TPTB love when we're fiercely divided...

       Trump is not a Clinton plant (imo). GJ and Stein are, though. I wouldn't vote for him, because I don't believe in Government, but from what I can tell, he is not. This idea/theory gets brought up damn near ~5 times a day here... Trump being a plant is 2D chess, TPTB are playing 4D chess. If anything. Hillary will pass from illness and Kaine is their man. First Jesuit US President with the first Jesuit Pope in the Vatican. Two factions are fighting, just like in Russia. Either way, we are all fucked. Kaine is their man, and he will unlock the gates of hell (Kaine-&gt;Cain(and abel)). Maybe Trump will turn on his handlers, though. Interesting times we live in...

      </p>
      <p>
       She was not prosecuted because she is sick and has dirt on many Deep State people. In the interest of all parties she cannot testify. She gets let off and doesn't smear the Clinton name. She gets to be the first "female" president, and the name is not smeared. She keeps quiet about CIA/FBI details. She sets the path up for Chelsea. Her and Bill pass of natural causes, and the name is untainted. Their man is Kaine (after Hill passes in office). Chelsea plays a role and takes over the foundation. Win-Win for all parties. Make sense? If I was an evil fuck hiding shit, and had a Trump card against certain people, this is the deal I'd arrange.

       Yes I can follow you on this as this is a quite real case of "everybody wins" scenario. Where it's not sooo much of a drop off for Chelsea (and her weird, weird face..) the family name and the foundation themselves

       I also agree that Kaine would serve many many interests or goals for them if you will. Despite his weird tone and delivery during his debate he will be talked up as a 'calm and collected" decision maker if he's ever in that position.

       To me, it would be Iceland-&gt;Poland-&gt;Russia. It's awkward, because I'm a Pole and we and Russians don't get along, and never have. Sad, because we are damn near the same. Fuck Rus and Lech (brothers - younger bros understand this). I can return to Poland (have a "right to return"), but NATO is trying to fuck em over, my Polish brothers and sisters are holding strong though...

       Ah I'm Portuguese myself apparently they were they first to legalize pot then basically erethang else. Perhaps I should return, maybe that would be something cheesy and beautiful: A rash of Amercians simply returning to their country of origins. (lol?)

       No nation is off limits to the NWO, it just depends on which side (East v. West). Poland is fighting NATO and the EU, we've always been rebels and do our own shit. We have also always been rag dolls in between the West and East. Seriously, NWO, leave us the fuck alone. Poland is a special place and has amazing people. I wish to return, but the West wants to fuck that shit up, and I don't trust Russia, even though I do have Russian family and blood. Shit is complicated. I'm also a US citizen who loves this country. I just fear we are too far gone. I want freedom, while many want a nanny state. My ancestors fled that shit from Communist Poland. Life is weird.... Seems like the West is reverting while the East is actually moving forward...

       But how is that fitting into the global elites and bankers plans?  Im not sure the bankers who run the country give a damn if theres a pressure valve for them or us.  They have chosen hillary, but that has little to do with the "d" next to her name, and almost all to do with the idea that she supports everything they want to see happen.  Neocons wouldn't support her otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus hillary isn't a democrat.  She is by her own admission a "Goldwater girl".  She's a right/centrist democrat.
      </p>
      <p>
       She's the face of the democrat party and represents where the party is right now.  Which is why Sanders really isn't a radical.  He's what the democrats used to be.  He's a real democrat.  Its just that the democrats are so far right now, that someone like Sanders comes along he's viewed as a socialist and a radical, when in reality he's neither.  He's just radical compared to "them".

I just fear we are too far gone. I want freedom, while many want a nanny state. My ancestors fled that shit from Communist Poland. Life is weird.... Seems like the West is reverting while the East is actually moving forward...
