       I know, for a lot of people my age, it's 9/11, and the generation before it was probably JFK. But to be honest, I remember something from before 9/11 that made me doubt everything, back when I was still in elementary school.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was doing a project on Martin Luther King Jr. in 1st grade, and of course, the government issue textbook just burned the name James Earl Ray into my childhood brain over and over and over again. But I remember, while researching on the dial up internet for a presentation I was giving in class, I saw a news article about MLK's son meeting James Earl Ray in prison from just one year ago. I read the whole article and was shocked: the King family did not believe James Earl Ray was the murderer.
       <strong>
        This went against everything I saw on the History Channel, this went against everything my teachers told me, this went against everything I read in class.
       </strong>
       But here it was, plain as day, the 1999 King family civil suit against the United States Government: the court found various agencies of the United States of America guilty of the assassination/wrongful death of Martin Luther King Jr.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's right. I was 7 years old when I found out the civil rights icon and my personal hero, Martin Luther King Jr, was killed by my own country and my own federal government. But I just told myself that it was all so long ago. I thought those evil elements must be ancient parts of history. That blissful ignorance would only last until 2006, when I really started digging deep into 9/11.
      </p>

       What about you guys? What was the first tip off for you about the "rabbit hole" so to speak?

       I guess you could say the first conspiracy that really opened my eyes was Chemtrails/weather modification. I remember when I was a freshman in high school my brother told me about them and was showing me videos. I didn't really put to much thought into it. Then one day on the way home from school I was staring out the window when i noticed this strange halo around the sun and weirdo rainbows. Then I saw planes flying through dumping large amounts of aerosol. I remember thinking to my self wow this is so Crazy watching these trails slowly forming massive sheets. If they are doing this and no one is told what else could be happening. From then on I was obsessed and learned to always question what I was told. I was so enthralled and had to learn more about everything of course that led me into 9/11 and everything else. I learned that the world I lived in is a fabricated reality shaped by a invisible something.

       Well when I was in high school I bought a 911 truth shirt, so maybe I was more open to conspiracies then I thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       After I graduated I was so busy in college and all that, that I didn't have time to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, I became a teacher. I heard a bit Sandy Hook while I was at work, and I was so saddened. I didn't think twice about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A year later I started investigating it (I can't remember what triggered that), and I think everything changed from that point on.

       Take my word or leave it. I was told about 6 weeks in advance that the government was going to murder a whole church full of people in front of the American people just to see if they could get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure enough, propaganda was brought to full force and people were frothing at the mouth for the blood of the Branch Davidians.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were so inundated with  psychologically intensified control of their thoughts  they didn't even complain when the military clearly murdered those children.

       I cannot prove the conversation ever took place and shouldn't try because I might get suicided,  but that's still  why I'm here tonight.

       Weirdly enough, it was learning about planned obsolescence in 9th grade intro to economics. Realizing that businesses intentionally design in failure just to force people to keep buying shit and that not only was this known about but it was just a simple fact of business, plainly described in a cheap highschool textbook for all to see, and that nobody was bothered by it. That was enough for me to begin to extrapolate just how stupid and self-destructive our modern institutions are.

       The health system. That family doctors and GP'S really don't care for us or know what they are doing. Then I read the history of Medicine with the Rockefeller and Carnegie family creating a Big Pharma  system with the doctors supporting it. I always thought my doctor was God and then after this i saw the light. I began to realize it's all about money, everything is about money. Cancer research is a joke, most vaccines are a joke. This then opened my eyes to everything government, business, politics. Just follow the money. It will lead you to the answer all the time. Everything is about money.

       Probably the first conspiracy that attracted my attention was man-made global warming. I saw early on what a complete farce and fraud it was, from top to bottom, and was amazed when it kept gaining traction in the media and with politicians. It
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       has traction even though it's been debunked and disproved countless times over by serious scientists. Seeing this got me interested in how easy it is to delude large numbers of people if you have the backing of the media, even when the data is completely false and does not even make good sense.

       Believe it or not but gamer gate was a look at how groups develop agendas to push through different media outlets. The PR agency was creating "stories" that were getting redistributed through various websites. That sort of opened up my mind to how the media actually operates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it is obvious that that all the media get talking points and stories from the Clinton / Obama machine. Their agenda comes to people through online magazines, online video on Facebook, cable news, newspapers, comedy news, late shows etc.

       I think I said this before, but when the bombings happened here recently (Brussels) and photoshopped footage was released by our state television along with a very odd tweet raising further suspicions

       When you see conspiracies play out in real time, suddenly it doesn't seem so far fetched anymore

       An old friend tried to convince me 911 was a fix. At first I was really hostile towards the idea. I remember mocking him for it. This strange thing happened though. I have this memory of the event of the media saying the firemen had to demo the building next to the towers. This was before I knew anything about building 7 and totally believed the official story.

       Then I went searching and came across this video

       I had a feeling about 9/11 a few years after. My first real red flag was the whole CNN
       <em>
        big news
       </em>
       event when Obama announced Osama's death. Before it even came on, I had a hunch that he would say they killed him. He was tanking in the polls, that got him re-elected. The whole story doesn't make sense, and the team who got him were so rehearsed. There was an interview with a guy who wrote a book, and the journalist was essentially feeding him the story. I don't know how people didn't see it? Who the hell throws muslims in the ocean for tradition, they don't. No body, no proof. They showed Saddam, why not Osama? He was probably dead for a while, people claimed many of the videos they released were edited.

       911, and The Boston Bombing took it to a whole level of Psyop understanding for me. If you really understand the Boston Psyop, you will get everything .I believe they wanted to seperate the herd by mocking us with the obvious fakery.
