       No it isnt. The criticism of Trump on the politics sub is just right. It's the lack of Hillary criticism that is out of proportion. Both candidates are such utter scumfucks, worth less than a rapists dick, that they wouldn't be worthy of sucking shit out of a septic tank. Hillary is a fucking criminal, and Trump is a god damn conman. The GOP and the DNC scraped the bottom of the barrel of humanity when pushing these two fucktards to the nomination.

       "I'm amazed that Trump literally threatened use the power of the Presidency to go after his opponent if he won."
      </p>
      <p>
       ...regardless of who you support, uh, no, he's not "using the power of the president" to do that. It's called using EXISTING LAWS passed by CONGRESS to try her under the Espionage Act and others regarding the disposal/destruction of classified information (those emails marked with a 'C')

       I was just about to post something similar. Every last post is anti-trump, with the top post being titled "Well, Donald just threatened to throw Hillary in jail." Its genuinely terrifying how brain washed these people are buying into this gag we're calling the election. I do not support Trump in any way, yet its clear to me he destroyed Hillary in this debate to the point where she was visibly shaken.  The fact that people are eating it up is leaving me feeling completely hopeless for the future of this nation.

       His responses were often scatter brained and without clear direction. He was able to call out her scandals but that was all he did well.

      <p>
       She had well articulated policy discussions about energy, campaign finance, and Syria/ISIS. She faltered when attempting to hammer him on his scandals.

       If anything, my biggest takeaway from this debate was that while Trump would fuck us at home by going back to square 1 on healthcare and trickle-down, Hillary will fuck us abroad by continuing to arm and create future terrorist factions.

       Clinton had some well-thought out responses for sure, but good for Donald that the quote from her speeches leaked by wikileaks had the "you need to have private and public opinion on policies" bit. Cant really trust anything from that woman's mouth, no matter how well rehearsed/though-out response she gives.

       There are none.  Its funny how many so called "conspiracy theorists" have become mindless sheep in this election.  Don't get me wrong, Hillary is corrupt as hell, but most of the people here will defend Donald to the death even though he's clearly a moron.

       if you had a multi-million dollar inheritance, you would be considered "successful" too, because there's basically no way for you to lose unless you go to Vegas and bet all your money on a single game. all you have to do is hire smart people to handle everything and suddenly you are "successful" because your dad left you money and businesses.

       Trump is a Clinton family friend and campaign donor who was set up to "run against" a Clinton.. that doesn't seem perfectly set-up to you? Kind of like Bush II being set up to "run against" his own frat brother and fellow Bonesman, Al Gore. Both candidates are doing the same things - clouding and disguising the political realities facing the US by providing a freakshow-sideshow spectacle and pretending it's important, while the corporate infiltrators behind the scenes secure all the important offices in the federal government and state governments - meanwhile poor stupid people are arguing about "clinton II or her family friend and donor donald trump".
      </p>
      <p>
       he's an actor. they're both actors - rich ones. that's all. He's doing a great job of discrediting everything he touches and making all the "anti-establishment" people look "extremist" and stupid. It does not matter one iota who wins this election, the same things will be happening. Same as "obama" vs romney - surprise, Obama does the same shit Bush II did, and worse. They are PR people who
       <em>
        represent the idea of
       </em>
       "the  government", and who physically embody the legal powers of "the office of the president", so someone exists to sign their names to things and shake the hands of other states diplomats. That's all.

       No, he's a moron because he never goes into any detail about his policies (since he doesn't know what he's talking about), and can never seem to answer a question directly.  Not to mention how many times he's completely changed his views in this election alone.  He's not successful, he was handed everything he has.

       How can he go into ultra specific detail?  It takes more the one person he delegates the specifics to the experts then I'm sure will sign off or not on the final result.  Candidates have never gone into specifics.  Most people wouldn't get it anyway.  He inherited 100M when his father passed.  Who gave him the rest?
      </p>
      <p>
       All I care about is that he has never been elected to any office.  That alone is reason enough for me to vote for him.

       The MSM has been so biased in regard to Trump people ignore legitimate criticism. I think if they just reported policy he would not have survived the primaries.

       Trump survived the primaries because Democratic Party operatives encouraged mainstream media outlets to give Trump unprecedented free media coverage. He literally had more coverage than any other candidate, even from "liberal" outlets like MSNBC. They did this intentionally to push the Republican Party in an indefensible direction. They made Trump become their opposition so they'd have an easier fight. Can you imagine Clinton winning against someone reasonable like Rand Paul? Her only chance of legitimately coming out on top was if her opponent was also an awful scumbag.

        Wikileaks exposed the fact that Democrats encouraged the media to give more coverage to shitty Republicans like Trump

       . He might not be under their control, but he's only the Republican nominee because the Democrats made it happen by colluding with the media to make it happen.

       Everyone can see that it's a PR agency working in that subreddit -- the same is true in r/the_donald though. Politics is just r/the_clinton. It's irrelevant anyways because the real problems include both trump and his family friend Clinton II, debating those two is like celebrity gossip. That's all it really amounts to. It's like debating whether Russians should elect Putin's wife, or Putin's family friend and donor.. which is what the donald is to the clintons.
