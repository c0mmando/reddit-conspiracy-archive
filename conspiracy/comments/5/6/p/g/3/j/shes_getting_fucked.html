       Yeah. I have seen that absurdity. Obviously it isn't because she is his opponent, he clearly talked about the turmoil in the FBI. She is being investigated for crimes and is a notoriously corrupt politician. If there was an investigation that wasn't being influenced by her and Bill she would be charged. That was clearly what he was saying. An investigation that isn't corrupted in her favor needs to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the whole "did you see him stalking and lurking?" is silly. He was at his place in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't support either and this is bullshit. The politics page is 100 percent anti Trump right now, but no one is discussing her bullshit Abe Lincoln story. Or that she can't be trusted because she obviously believes in have public positions that differ from private.

       People he doesn't like? He's specifically referring to CRIMINAL acts committed by her, that have landed many others in prison for less severe offenses. She SHOULD go to prison, and it will be fucking hilarious if she does.

       A special investigation NEEDS to be opened on her because she is a career criminal. Plain and simple. Unless you live under a rock somewhere, there's no way you couldn't have figured that out by now.

       Or perhaps you're not very well-informed. The law is the law. It applies to you and I, so why should certain people be above it? That's outlandish.

       Really? Deleting emails, sending classified emails to people with absolutely NO security clearance, accepting bribes in order for positions on government (pay-to-play), etc., etc., etc... cmon dude, you can't be that clueless. Which is why I'm sure everyone here reading these comments can tell you're either employed by HRC directly and are being paid to come in here and troll, or you are with CTR. Either way, get fucked.

       A sailor is spending a year in prison for taking a few photos with his phone on a submarine. Clinton allowed everyone access to classified information and destroyed subpoenaed evidence and is getting off with nothing. Please explain to me how that is justice.

       The private server was not allowing everyone access to classified information although it did not meet the strict security requirements. Second she gave the order to delete emails months before the subpoena.
      </p>

       Justice in her case would be a suspension of security clearence

       Don't dismiss the theory they are working together just yet. They are really good at acting the part and for Donald to get mad and bluster? Yeah easy. That being said I don't know, I just see it as a possibility. I can't just dismiss connections. He still may be there to give voice to her legitimate failings and make anyone else who points out the obvious criminal truths about this sound crazy and bigoted by comparison.

       Well put, I agree with this assessment. After the previous debate, the theory that they are working together was boosted by Trump's deflated performance; after tonight's debate, with Trump having really hammered her like many had been hoping for, the public opinion rightfully shifts away from the likelihood of that theory being true. It's too early to say and both are possible. It's not over until it's over and I think it's always valuable to consider multiple theories and weigh the evidence existing behind each of them.

       It's true. Trump is so tainted that you can't agree with any of Trump's legitimate points without being ostracized  (I live in northern California, and am in the pro-Bernie,  never Hillary camp).

       In its weakened state, Trump, a former Reform Party member and establishment critic, led a hostile take over of the Republican Party. He will defeat Clinton and purge the GOP of the globalist NWO Bush NeoCons. Get with the program.

       Trump made sure that any and all arguments that he is a stooge for HRC were put to bed with this debate. At this point it would be pretty difficult to make the case that he isn't, in fact, running to win.

       Trump is to big to be suicided. Guarantee he has dirt that would be released if he were to "pass away" in his sleep. Trump is in the 1% but I think a lot of the 1% don't like him.

       I look at this and think,  okay,  maybe Trump isn't controlled opposition and he actually wants to win this.  Then again,  his reputation in the MSM,  for what it was worth,  is now shot.  Is this just a coordinated attempt to tie these very credible concerns in with a man who is now portrayed as a racist and sexist to the sheeple? This is too easy for Hillary to stand on stage,  chuckle,  brush them off and dismiss these points as the ramblings of a desperate scumbag.

       Really? I'm pretty sure those emails are actually missing, and I know that if that is the case, then she should really be in prison. What Donald Trump just said tonight, was the most honest thing I have ever heard anyone say in Washington.

       I agree,  and I also agree that those emails are missing.  My point is that the most honest things said by anyone in Washington was uttered by a clown.  It discredits the message for him to bring these things up in a live debate, because it's too easy for Clinton to portray it as desperate posturing,  and once again ignore the substance of the argument.  My gut reaction to this is still that they are working together.  It's like they picked the most credible issues and he spewed them all off in quick succession.  Like it or not,  they are now associated with Trump and his reputation.  They will sink with his reputation and campaign in the coming weeks,  as I predict we are now entering the final act of this show where Donald Trump will completely self destruct.

       No way they are working together. We are talking about two of the largest egos on this planet. I would have taken Hillary for less of a megalomaniac, until I started reading her emails. The way she sees herself, and the way she interacts with people on a daily basis, proves she is a sociopath. She's dreamed of becoming president, ever since she was just a little boy in Arkansas. Donald Trump, I think started the campaign for fun, and I think it has gotten away from him. But you still have to have a huge ego to even do that in the first place, and that also screams narcissist.

       You're the one who responded to my comment. I'm just saying, Hillary won that debate by most people's standards and I will be voting for her this November unless something major happens. Feel free to respond if you have something substantive to say and not just more 3rd grade insults.

       Again, no she didn't. Trump embarrassed her. You're delusional (3rd graders don't know that word--so, probably a 7th grade insult) if you think she won that debate. Look at the polls! The people have voted, and of course you're free to have your opinion, and you are also free to vote for a woman who will drag us into a war with Russia immediately, and a woman who has lied and cheated to get where she is and has NEVER done anything important in her political career, and a woman who will sell this country out in a second if it means she can make another couple million from some shady foreigners. You go ahead and vote for her. And I'm not saying Trump is necessarily a better person, but he hasn't lied and cheated and fucked over America to get to this point. How's that for a substantive response, fuckstick?

       Look at the polls? Are you kidding me? Donald Trump is losing every poll I see. By a lot. Or are you talking about the online Breitbart polls? Because if you are, you're already too far gone and I can't help you. Check out some real polls sometime:

       And your reasons for voting against Clinton are literally all opinions. Not facts. I'm basing my choice on facts because I happen to think those are a little more reliable.

      <p>
       And by the way, I hope one day you learn how to write a sentence without ending it with words like fuckstick, bitch, and moron. It really just makes you look uneducated and it's frankly quite sad.

       Oh sure, a poll created by CTR. Good comeback. And I don't give two shits what you think of me. If you're a Clinton supporter, then yes, I owe you the use of words like moron, bitch and fuckstick, because that's what Clinton supporters all are. And yes, including you. Think what you want, because the people who still care about America and see Hillary for the criminal that she IS look at people like you with a lot of derision.

       It went through our justice system, and for me to say they are wrong would be to imply I know more than they do on this case that they studied and scrutinized intensively. I do not. You do not either, sorry to break it to you.

       So you can say it's false, but you can't prove it. So no critical thinking person should believe you. That's how logic works. It's based on facts and evidence.

       I dunno, it's true, but with Trump they could also start WW3 and blame it on him, and get away with it, just because people see him as unstable. Either way the deep state is guiding the war, not the president.

       I think you should unplug CNN from making up your opinions for you. Hillary is a criminal, trump talked about some fat chick 10 years ago, who fucking cares.

       Holy fuck lmao, I've never watched CNN a day in my life. I agree Hillary is fucking corrupt, just have enough common sense to see that the epitome of male white privilege is not a better alternative. If you think he is, you are a fucking moron and a big part of what I hate about the world today. He doesn't even have the self control or empathy to be able to open his mouth without offending someone, and based on your comment I guess you don't either. My reason for disliking Trump far exceeds the recent audio clip leak. Please don't respond though because I literally could not give a single fuck what someone who can try to justify donald trump has to say.

He's obviously so intelligent because he can see the epitome of white privilege and anyone who can't see that white privilege is "literally everything wrong with the world"  is retawded.

       A trump victory doesn't prove this.
The 2016 election getting to the point it has, proves this.
Our country is probs still better than most though. We just won't talk about 2016-2020 in the history books XD

       It went through our justice system, and for me to say they are wrong would be to imply I know more than they do on this case that they studied and scrutinized intensively. I do not. You do not either, sorry to break it to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can say it's false, but you can't prove it. So no critical thinking person should believe you. That's how logic works. It's based on facts and evidence.
