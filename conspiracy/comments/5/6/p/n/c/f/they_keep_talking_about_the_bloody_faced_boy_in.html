I thought this was pretty well known to be a fake - am I wrong? Why are they talking about this and then took an alleged social media question about it???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was white helmet war propaganda, you are correct. People are dumb enough to not question anything that a kid is involved with though. That&#39;s why a lot of foreign countries use kids with grenades to kill soldiers.  Our society sees children as benign.  That&#39;s why this lie is still pervasive</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yah - and is it just me or did the &quot;question from social media&quot; seem like a warmongering plant? I mean, I guess there&#39;s no shortage of people who eat up the MSM narrative/feces every second of every day, but the way that question was worded really bothers me...something about &quot;are we doing too little too late? Is this the next holocaust already started?&quot; It was so melodramatic and appealing to such strong emotion, it sounded like something straight out of the third Reich media playbook to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to know if something is propaganda, read through Edward bernay&#39;s book titled &quot;propaganda&quot; it is the most comprehensive inventory of propaganda techniques and how to use them ever produced and is still implemented today. These principles were used to convince people that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, although for many thousands of years only 2 main meals were eaten, and saved the bacon industry. Still pervades people&#39;s minds TO THIS DAY</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting a link. I was hoping someone would back me up with some details. I remembered being 100% convinced it was obvious bunk propaganda but couldn&#39;t remember details in a way I could explain to a skeptic.</p>
