    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The idea of the Nibiru encounter originated with Nancy Lieder, a Wisconsin woman who claims that as a girl she was contacted by gray extraterrestrials called Zetas, who implanted a communications device in her brain. In 1995, she founded the website ZetaTalk to disseminate her ideas. Lieder first came to public attention on Internet newsgroups during the build-up to Comet Hale–Bopp&#39;s 1997 perihelion. She stated, claiming to speak as the Zetas, that &quot;The Hale–Bopp comet does not exist. It is a fraud, perpetrated by those who would have the teeming masses quiescent until it is too late. Hale–Bopp is nothing more than a distant star, and will draw no closer.&quot; She claimed that the Hale–Bopp story was manufactured to distract people from the imminent arrival of a large planetary object, &quot;Planet X&quot;, which would soon pass by Earth and destroy civilization.&quot;</p>

<p>Yep so this has been going on since 1995!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, are you saying there are extremely violent volcanoes and earthquakes happening all over the world <em>at the same time</em>? </p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t be commenting on a Reddit thread if this were happening. We&#39;d be dead or dying for all the shit storms being thrown up into the atmosphere while our homes shake into rubble. Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull">Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull</a> volcano in Iceland? Airlines were grounded and people were stranded for days, there were electrical storms etc. That was ONE volcano and wasn&#39;t even considered an historically major eruption, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_volcanic_eruptions_in_the_21st_century">zero deaths</a>.</p>

<p>But again, I want to emphasize, I don&#39;t think any of this will come to pass, so OP can relax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Many small eruptions is more telling than one larger one</em>, more importantly <em>it&#39;s indicative of shifting/building magma/gaseous pressure underground</em>. We&#39;d all be dead is a logical fallacy since we&#39;ve lived through this before, and things are just getting warmed up. I don&#39;t think you have any sort of basis of fact to your lack of concern, simply reciting one trivial event doesn&#39;t demonstrate anything. Locate the pattern. </p>

<p>The eruption of Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland is having a major impact on travel and commerce in Europe and worldwide. But as a volcanic event, it barely rates mentioning.</p>

<p>Mt. Pinatubo had not seen any major activity for at least 500 years. But <em>thousands of earthquakes and minor eruptions through April and May of 1991 suggested that Mt. Pinatubo was likely to erupt</em>. Further readings suggested that gases were building within the volcano, raising the possibility of a major eruption.</p>

<p>Do a quick search of Western American Coast &quot;Quake Swarms&quot; and lie to OP again that these thousands of small quakes are not indicative of building pressure trying to find release.

<p>Your source quote is indicative of <strong>one large earth quake.</strong> There is little evidence to suggest there was a pole shift in our past, save for the ice age and &quot;rumours&quot; of humans being frozen in ice over 100 feet high,  I. E. A tsunami was frozen in its tracks.</p>

<p>You&#39;re talking about detecting one large earth quake. That is wholly different to another planet flying by our earth and spinning the magnetic North and South poles. Everything would &quot;release&quot; in a matter of a few hours.</p>

<p>I&#39;m certainly not lying to the OP, especially when I say ...again, I don&#39;t think this is going to happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep saying &quot;hidden planet&quot;, that&#39;s not what i&#39;m talking about. Like a record skipping, or a politicain only hearing what they want, twisting words, failing to understand.</p>

<p>Pole shift is an effect as well. Everything you/the article stated are all also effects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>such as astronomical cycles, atmospheric composition, plate tectonics, and ocean currents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To add: Volcanoes, Earthquakes, Birkeland current disruptions, magneto pause disruptions/reversals, Solar cycles, maunder minimum</p>

<p>Therefore the simultaneous aspect of these &quot;strange&quot; and less then coincidental effects points to one or more external factor.</p>

<p>The one thing you and scientists didn&#39;t say is Cosmological rays, and galactic magnetic field lines. Basically &quot;external&quot; and invisible forces. Which points to ... &quot;something&quot; - quit calling it a planet, I&#39;m calling it a &quot;magnetic anomaly&quot;.</p>

<p>I can say this is evidence, and the leap is much shorter than you think, you are the only thing stopping you. Know your enemy, know yourself. Also, I don&#39;t care if you make the leap that the Perihelion of the Sun around it&#39;s south magnetic pole is causing these effects. You make the connection or you don&#39;t. </p>

<p>You can keep splitting apart all the evidences or you can bring it all together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people say these effects are not drastic, they are getting drastic but the onset has been very subtle, also people aren&#39;t tying the details together: this is witnessed with seismic/volcanic upticks and polar vortical activity happening now, &quot;smash into&quot; is the wrong thought, think instead &quot;magnetically grab hold of and fling&quot;, think &quot;pole shift causer&quot;. Also, things may not be &quot;apparent&quot; or &quot;obvious&quot; due to redshift, limits of human observation, picture cosmic rays redshifted to invisibility to our perspective, with the long wavelengths of energy penetrating and heating the core of the planet while increasing cloud cover on the way in - I can point to the white papers on these effects or you can search arxiv.org for &quot;cosmic rays produce clouds&quot; or &quot;effects of cosmic rays on earth atmosphere&quot;. I don&#39;t agree with calling this magnetic anomaly we&#39;re approaching &quot;planet x&quot; or &quot;nibiru&quot; due to the disinformation campaigns. I prefer &quot;Black Star&quot; due to it exhibiting seismic and magnetic properties of a &#39;very large&#39; but &#39;invisible&#39; (off one end of our visible spectrum) body (also these word&#39;s ties to sec govt projects - do some diligence). This leaves the anomaly being a &quot;place holder&quot; (an, &quot;i don&#39;t fully know&quot;) very much the same as the rest of science with their &quot;dark matter&quot; and &quot;dark energy&quot;. </p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://terral03.com/">http://terral03.com/</a> or his YT channel He&#39;s been tracking this anomaly geo-magnetically and astronomically for years <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNrZdBjWjfssfMx5dETze_g">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNrZdBjWjfssfMx5dETze_g</a> Geologists, Astronomers, and physicists of all skill levels globally are all researching this with him. </p>

<p>Also, Adapt2030 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-5dIHmtQzHIdNCs7-bEdCA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-5dIHmtQzHIdNCs7-bEdCA</a> is covering the local earth changes quite well, i&#39;d say this is drastic. </p>

<p>Meanwhile S0 is tracking the solar changes well <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTiL1q9YbrVam5nP2xzFTWQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTiL1q9YbrVam5nP2xzFTWQ</a></p>

<p>Many people who are calling this Nib or X may be collecting information on the same anomaly (I think this is what <a href="/u/Focusym">/u/Focusym</a> is talking about- no &quot;you&quot; and your &quot;we&quot; is not crazy, nor is the &quot;they&quot; in your scenario - don&#39;t get lost in the &#39;separation&#39;), though, the names only seem to cause confusion, but some people are much more science focused links below. Attempt to see the similarities, and chock the differences up to perspective from the earth (possible religious background) and position of the Earth relative to other planets in regards to the Blackstar, consider any name you hear for &quot;an extra body in the solar system&quot; to simply be the same &quot;placeholder&quot;. I have a firm belief that this anomaly spins closer to 1/2 like a Meson, as opposed to 1/3 like Fermionic matter, thus making it invisible to standard observation methods.  This also makes it closer to a &quot;virtual&quot; particle-composed body... Particle physics doesn&#39;t really draw a difference between virtual and real particles though. Spooky action at a distance is mediated by gluons, mesons, gravity, and nuclear forces are all mediated by mesons at different &quot;SCALES&quot; they are all one.. </p>

<p>Every single argument here is &quot;<em>that you would have to see it with your eyes</em>&quot; for it to be powerful enough to tear particles from us away or heat the core like a microwave oven til we pop. That&#39;s literally blind ignorance, totally false. Magnets and microwaves are invisible field lines to us. Think of passing through the north polar vortex of the galaxy, one wouldn&#39;t even need to pass near it to feel massive changes. </p>

<p>As far as &quot;prophecy&quot; is concerned, nobody &quot;on the ground&quot; knows what&#39;s actually up and the men in towers and holes think they can hide, most people who believe the religious texts at face value fail to recognize the texts value as an astronomical or alchemical - pre-science text books. The snake (sine wave) is the tying factor between sci/rel. Buddhists expect the arrival of an enlightened one, who is said to be able to &quot;turn the wheel&quot; of dharma. Astronomy and logarithmic spirals say we can spend &quot;forever&quot; spiraling the drain until the wheel is turned. </p>

<p>The one resounding thing through all texts is that there is nowhere to run, that no place is safe, besides under the shade of an octopus, eg (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path</a>) this may however point to a faraday cage with octagonal structure, though, &quot;safe beneath the [8] wisdom&#39;s&quot; keeps me from crawling into a hole, and i think that&#39;s the trick. Trust your heart as well as your eyes. </p>

<p>Advice to OP or anyone else worried about it, lift your head up, live your lift <em>right</em>, keep up your studies or job, this snake is not dancing for you, you&#39;re not playing it&#39;s tune. Respect it, FEAR NOT, it draws near to draw out the poison from the world, if you only have a few drops in your pocket or around your neck when he comes around you lay them on the ground for him. This is more about electrical conductivity, than idolic worship of precious metals.  </p>

<p>The math is quantum based, contains many variables, and would need massive computers to deduce. Until the government acknowledges agrees and shares their resources someone may be able to actual do the math, and share the information. Many of these observations are actually being taken as of late too - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry</a> </p>

<p>To anyone looking to find the folly in the math and/or science look for inversions and squares &quot;neutralizing and becoming blind&quot; to negative or very long wavelengths, to Toy Story, to the Cowboys and Space men, A sub N D Y &quot;snake in my boot&quot;, Achilles heel. </p>
