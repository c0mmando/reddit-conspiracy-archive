       While I don't disagree with all of that article (although it is a bit dramatic), it never even tries to connect CTR to domestic terrorism.

       I mean, I always advocate that people read the article and point there criticism toward that. But you posted an article with a shitty title on reddit and it was downvoted. Sounds more like SOP than a conspiracy.

       Whether or not it is shitty is an opinion, you are right.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion it was a bad title because, generally speaking, terrorism requires violence or intimidation and, because of this, the post was downvoted without people reading the article.

        it is reasonable to say that paid political propaganda - or government gaslighting - is in fact a form of terrorism perpetrated upon the people.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sure, if you stretch the definition of terrorism to mean "everything I don't like." What definition does this fall under? It might be shitty or subversive, but it isn't terrorism. Especially considering you can avoid/ignore it if you want to.

       Do you honestly believe lying is a human rights violation though? I mean I get if you are keeping an argument to just when the impact is at grand scales, but you seem to take issue with the act itself.

        I am sure if a scientific medical monitoring was given - with censors and instruments hooked up to the receiving human being of the paid de-facto gaslighting operation - there would be instances of spikes in blood pressure, heart arrhymias - and more detrimental physical effects - a real physical assault delivered through non physical medium - and if ever expert testimony was given from a doctor of psychiatry - one could surely ascertain results of damages in the form of anxiety, depression, contributing trigger to psychosis

       Good luck proving that reading political propaganda is the true cause of that. I don't think your class action problem holds up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm assuming you would be trying to recover under intentional infliction of emotional distress? That is what it sounds like at least. I mean, I've been called a shill on here before. Maybe someone read what I wrote and got pissed off. How do you prove what they read was from CTR and not from an independent actor? You also have to prove the behavior is outrageous. You obviously think it is, but it isn't up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       That tort is hard to enough to prove when you have evidence that a person directly affected another person. I can't imagine how you would go about proving it, in a class action, where it isn't clear if the action of the defendant was the only contributing factor to any ill affects the plaintiff suffered.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a real physical assault

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Okay, just stop. If you are talking about recovering this at least know the terms you are using means. Assault requires an imminent threat of serious bodily harm (generally speaking, in a civil context). Meaning there is an immediate reasonable belief that you are about to be hurt or killed. You would not be able to prove this from reading something on your computer scream. Even threats over the internet don't necessarily qualify for this so a differing political opinion that may or may not have been paid for certainly wouldn't.

       I'll take your word on that being illegal but it doesn't have anything to do with a class action suit. They may have done something illegal but that doesn't mean your rights were violated. If that were the case random citizens could sue a company anytime they were using discriminatory practices.

       If the F.E.C. brings a case and wins no one who read propaganda is going to recover for it.

       You took that part out of context. I acknowledged it's different when it is on a grand scale with actual consequences. That isn't what OP's reasoning was though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Goebbles committed suicide. And you should actually read the judgement against Streicher. There was more to it than just spreading propaganda. I guess it is the gallows for you for spreading falsehoods.

        I am sure if a scientific medical monitoring was given - with censors and instruments hooked up to the receiving human being of the paid de-facto gaslighting operation - there would be instances of spikes in blood pressure, heart arrhymias - and more detrimental physical effects - a real physical assault delivered through non physical medium - and if ever expert testimony was given from a doctor of psychiatry - one could surely ascertain results of damages in the form of anxiety, depression, contributing trigger to psychosis

       Good luck proving that reading political propaganda is the true cause of that. I don't think your class action problem holds up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm assuming you would be trying to recover under intentional infliction of emotional distress? That is what it sounds like at least. I mean, I've been called a shill on here before. Maybe someone read what I wrote and got pissed off. How do you prove what they read was from CTR and not from an independent actor? You also have to prove the behavior is outrageous. You obviously think it is, but it isn't up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       That tort is hard to enough to prove when you have evidence that a person directly affected another person. I can't imagine how you would go about proving it, in a class action, where it isn't clear if the action of the defendant was the only contributing factor to any ill affects the plaintiff suffered.

       Okay, just stop. If you are talking about recovering this at least know the terms you are using means. Assault requires an imminent threat of serious bodily harm (generally speaking, in a civil context). Meaning there is an immediate reasonable belief that you are about to be hurt or killed. You would not be able to prove this from reading something on your computer scream. Even threats over the internet don't necessarily qualify for this so a differing political opinion that may or may not have been paid for certainly wouldn't.
