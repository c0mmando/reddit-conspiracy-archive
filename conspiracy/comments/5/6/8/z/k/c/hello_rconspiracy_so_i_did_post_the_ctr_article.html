    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not it is shitty is an opinion, you are right. </p>

<p>In my opinion it was a bad title because, generally speaking, terrorism requires violence or intimidation and, because of this, the post was downvoted without people reading the article. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is reasonable to say that paid political propaganda - or government gaslighting - is in fact a form of terrorism perpetrated upon the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, if you stretch the definition of terrorism to mean &quot;everything I don&#39;t like.&quot; What definition does this fall under? It might be shitty or subversive, but it isn&#39;t terrorism. Especially considering you can avoid/ignore it if you want to. </p>

<p>Do you honestly believe lying is a human rights violation though? I mean I get if you are keeping an argument to just when the impact is at grand scales, but you seem to take issue with the act itself. </p>

<p>What are your thoughts on lies by omission? What happens about lying to protect someone&#39;s right to privacy? I&#39;m not trying to argue I&#39;m genuinely interested in your thoughts.</p>

<p>Good luck proving that reading political propaganda is the true cause of that. I don&#39;t think your class action problem holds up. </p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you would be trying to recover under intentional infliction of emotional distress? That is what it sounds like at least. I mean, I&#39;ve been called a shill on here before. Maybe someone read what I wrote and got pissed off. How do you prove what they read was from CTR and not from an independent actor? You also have to prove the behavior is outrageous. You obviously think it is, but it isn&#39;t up to you. </p>

<p>That tort is hard to enough to prove when you have evidence that a person directly affected another person. I can&#39;t imagine how you would go about proving it, in a class action, where it isn&#39;t clear if the action of the defendant was the only contributing factor to any ill affects the plaintiff suffered. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a real physical assault</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, just stop. If you are talking about recovering this at least know the terms you are using means. Assault requires an imminent threat of serious bodily harm (generally speaking, in a civil context). Meaning there is an immediate reasonable belief that you are about to be hurt or killed. You would not be able to prove this from reading something on your computer scream. Even threats over the internet don&#39;t necessarily qualify for this so a differing political opinion that may or may not have been paid for certainly wouldn&#39;t. </p>
