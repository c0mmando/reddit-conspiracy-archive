       Just two years ago everyone knew that the two party system was what was ruining the country, and everyone could easily identify what the status quo is. Everyone would tell you how bottled up and controlled the election process is via the very calculated and controlled media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, everyone is having no qualms with voting for a major party and seem to have forgotten the media is completely controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both Trump and Shillary are for 100% of the same globalist NWO policies that degrade American life and soverignty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe the lies. I urge you to take a step back and look at everything. Nothing has really changed - it's the same tactic as ever: there is a slight of hand going on - constant shills in all the right places on the internet pointing fingers and yelling to look at, essentially, what we already knew: how corrupt the establishment is.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they are also saying "at all costs do not question the red team candidate".
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe the lies. We, the American people, only have two Zionist globalist shill puppets to choose from for the two major parties (like there would be something else), and they have reached whole new generations and spoke to them in their language (memes) to ostracize third choices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe the lies.

       Absolutely correct, people are too centered on this election and can't step back and observe things to figure out the candidates are all the same and that this "democratic election" really won't have affect against the NWO globalists.

       are they zionist shills or globalist shills?
      </p>
      <p>
       those are two competing ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       with clinton meeting with Rosthchild for lunch and trump meeting with Netanyahu I think it's clear who's the globalist and who's the zionist

       You do know the Rothschilds played the biggest role in founding Israel? Without their support the British wouldn't have made the Belfour Declaration, which created Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Rothschild literally built the Israeli parliament (Knesset), and Dorothy Rothschild built the Supreme Court building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the new Israeli National Library that got built this year was by Rothschild fund Yad Hanadiv:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edmond Rothschild is even on their 500 sheqel bill.

      <p>
       Not all globalists are zionists (certainly there's competing world orders desired), and not all zionists want a global government (because the international community condemns Israel time and time again). But they do control global finances, and as long as they have a puppet or two in the UNSC to veto on their behalf, they are just fine! Global governance hurray!

       The rothschilds also founded Rhodesia; are you going to suggest that was a zionist movement aswell? They capitalized on a new country being built.     It's quite clear through their actions they are globalist. They would just as quickly end Israel as they ended Rhodesia  if it benefited them.

       And your point being? The idea that zionists are always anti-globalist is blatantly false. Many reject it, but many are entirely part of it. Either way, as a whole Zionists have the US and UK/France/Germany by the balls.

       While that may be true I'm trying to highlight that the Rothschilds capitalize on new countries being built. Getting in from the start makes it easier for them to siphon off of the taxpayers. Saying they are zionist for founding Israel is like saying they are white nationalist for founding Rhodesia, when in reality Rhodesia was just a business move, just like Israel

       Rhodesia isn't the one getting $4 billion in military aid from the US, nor does it have notable influence in US media and finance.

       I don't believe the Rothschilds 'control'' Israel either, they merely helped found it as a nation. I believe the Zionist Project is much bigger than any single family or corporation. Or even individual Jewish lives (see

       They have the perception of 1 unit in an 1000 unit picture. It really sucks but they will all do as they please. Let the chipping begin. 10$ chip that let's you into virtual reality I hope. Literally dirt cheap and load it with every goody you can imagine. Fake hamburgers to satisfy your fake taste buds. Fake Animals. Fake Ice cream. Fake sporting events. Fake everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banking and all ID on the chip. Doors open when you walk up to them. Bring it all on, make this the most tempting thing you can imagine and roll it out. Watch 90% of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       God bless the real, all the rest get killed, who can you trust? only time reveals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fly a fighter jet around in the fake reality, fly in a hot air balloon. Bang a hot VR girl, bring it all on. Scuba diving 1000 feet down, I seriously hope they have every good thing you can imagine in this thing. Let the chipping begin. As much as I feel bad it's the only way for us to get back to where we once were. Let the stage of the world continue the show and end it with the grand finale.
