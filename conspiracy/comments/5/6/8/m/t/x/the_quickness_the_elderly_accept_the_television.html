       There was an article released several days ago stating that people should go and get the newest flu vaccine as early as possible. They added a little fear porn threatening the worst flu season ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I swear within minutes of my father reading it, he proclaimed to my mom and I he was going to go get the vaccine because of the article, and did.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is probably the tenth one he got in his lifetime and I must say, he acts strange and compulsive.

      <p>
       Perhaps it's the heavy metals in his brain? He isn't the person I remember and is easily influenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       He talks to the TV all day and curses Trump. It's really sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is like a TV news parrot and I never engage because the second you go against his narrative he heard from "multiple sources", all mainstream news, he is quick to call you rediculous because it's not what he has seen on TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad :(

       The Boomers and Greatest Gen grew up in a world of trustworthy newsmen and investigative journalism.  Old habits die hard and they struggle to recognize that the mass media is corrupted, partially because to recognize that mass media has been lying is to acknowledge that they themselves have been wrong.  This is the hardest part for them.

       They're a product of their times, it's not really their fault they are the way they are. They've grown up by the system, and have remained so for their entire lives. You can't just reverse 60+ years of social engineering instantly. You know the saying "you can't teach an old dog new tricks?" Fact is that they will probably never be able to look outside their set perspectives. You would be the same if you grew up at the same time as them. Don't judge them, we'll probably also have outdated world views someday.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are very lucky to have the Internet at this point in history. The greatest source of human knowledge, available instantaneously for many of us. Freedom of speech and information are the only things that might save us from a worsening status quo. We must fight to protect those freedoms at all costs, for if we fail then future generations will be deprived of information like today's baby boomers. Knowledge is power, and the powers that be wish to deprive us of both.

       I don't mean it literally, it's just a metaphor. A more accurate one might be "you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink."
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, we should try to grow off each other. I'm using old metaphors because they are useful tidbits of wisdom that came from our elders. I don't believe we're any smarter than they are or vice versa, we've just grown into different social/political paradigms. I do atleast try to inform my elders about these things. But again, there's only so much I can do. I can't force them to accept the truth, all I can do is lead them to it and hope they can break free of their lifelong biases. A huge disaster or upheaval of their lives might force them out of it involuntarily, but that would also be jarring and painful, both physically/financially and mentally. I'd hate for my elders to go through something like
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVq76YvTPMs">

       Listen Kids.... I am 63 and I was a red pill taker since Viet Nam, Kent State, Watergate, etc.  You may think we're all brain dead, but that's not the fact.  Many of my friends of the same age are well aware of the matrix we live in  Do not generalize.  You will find some folks of your own age that are equally unaware of the game that is being played on us all.  Some of us boomers are much sharper then you think.

       "Red Pilling" older generations about the truth is very difficult. Everything they know has been ingrained in them for years. Might be futile to even try, most will immediately reject your attempts. If you really wish to try helping them along the way, what I would do is try showing them infallible sources.
Like the official videos from the House Commitee on Govermnent Reform. Videos/pictures from real life should work. Show them current Haiti, and the videos explaining why the people are still living without clean water, shelter, and basic necessities despite us showering them with donations. Show them video proof of US warmongering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is that most are unwilling to let you even do the research
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       them. They won't sit down are let you inform them. They believe with age comes experience, and as a matter of pride won't let youngins claim they know better. Appeals to ethos won't work because of this. Logos won't work either because it requires more effort than they're willing to give you. Pathos is the only appeal that might work. You gotta win them over, not argue and guilt them. Ask them to humor you, if necessary plead with them that you'd feel safer if you had their opinions on
       <em>
        one easily "digestible" source at a time.
       </em>
       Even then, is it worth this much effort to reverse the judgement of someone already growing old? I'd say it's better to forget it, focus on informing younger people who might actually care.

       Yeah I don't think it's possible. My father can listen to it and start to make sense of it. My mother though would rather plug her ears and stick her head in the dirt. They never go far enough though his logic stops him at around "Well they're screwing us out of a bunch of money for their own gain" it's like nah man it goes way farther, do you think some guy who has 100 million dollars really cares about getting that much more? Do you really think the electric companies, our government and everyone else needs to constantly raise their rates? It's to control everyone. It just won't click for some reason. He agrees I have good points but can only see it from the peanut perception he is used to using. All the power to him I just hope he doesn't succumb to the mark of the beast.

       Thats actually a good sign with your father, if he's willing to accept at least some of your points. Be persistent, baby steps might actually work. If your father wakes, then he might be able to help your mom stop plugging her ears.

       I'll play the waiting game, I am trying to explain how they're going to screw everyone out of everything they own. They don't believe me, I know what the NWO is. Let all the markets crash. Lmfao. We live and we learn, as they would say to me. LOL. They just bought a cottage and have mortgages on both places. NWO just around the corner. I wish the best for them but, I know at the end of the day there will be no way to keep them both in the long run. They are dreaming. I am an encyclopedia of knowledge on a level other people don't know exists. I will just let the world play out. When it gets worse and never better maybe they'll decide to listen. Lol.

       The good news is that people who believe the TV probably have a higher mortality rate.

       There's several thousand different combinations/strains of the Influenza virus. It shouldn't be that scary at all like that article makes it out to be (unless one's immune system is extremely sick already or exposed to hundreds of people and objects).

       I know plenty of people like this myself. Among them is most of my family, who in my mind are more or less chimpanzees I am able to maintain very little attachment to, due to their almost total lack of psychological participation. A big part of me is just waiting for a big disaster, hoping they will all be herded to their local FEMA camp for food rations when the supermarkets empty, hoping they will all be herded to their next emergency vaccine to save them from a big pandemic, imagining that in reality they will be killed. It would be sad if I felt something for them, but all I really feel for nowadays is the poor world that's supposed to exist but doesn't.

       The cause of misanthropy, is viewing ourselves as superior to those we feel misanthropic towards.  You hate your relatives because you view yourself as being developmentally superior to them.  Likewise, I used to hate people here on Reddit because I viewed them as mindless, degenerate Millennials with mobile phones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not long ago, however, I took some LSD, which made it much easier to consciously look at and monitor my own thoughts, to a very deep and fundamental level.  What this showed me is that whenever I think of people as being superficial, ignorant, wanting instant gratification of whatever else, I am being a hypocrite, because there are ways in which I am superficial and pretentious, and just want convenience without having to think or do anything or take responsibility for myself, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might not be as stupid as your relatives in the specific
       <strong>
        <em>
         ways
        </em>
       </strong>
       that they are, but I can promise you that there are areas where you are really stupid; just as there are plenty of ways in which I am.  I no longer think of anyone else as a worthless eater, because I've also stopped viewing myself as perfect, or better than them.  We are all human, and we all have flaws.  If you can recognise that you have flaws yourself, it will grant you the ability to feel empathy and compassion for others who do, because you'll start seeing yourself as being on the same level.

       hey you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually know all of this stuff already in so much detail, due in no small part to my own psychedelic experiences. I know it well, I know it well enough that I can communicate it freely to another person just like you do. I agree with your post completely and wouldn't even add anything to it. However, even despite knowing it intellectually, even despite making deliberate effort throughout my days to counteract my own outlooks and consciously assert a more reasonable perspective to myself, it remains merely knowledge; it remains separate from myself and I do not experience it as actual reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I must stress, I
       <em>
        completely believe
       </em>
       what you're saying, which is exactly why I'm on the offensive, trying to reengineer my own outlook all the time whenever it rears its head. I correct my thoughts as they pop up and I even make a lifestyle out of investing myself into as few of my own things as possible, hoping to have as few things of my own as possible that I am motivated to prioritize over other people. I'm quite diligent about all of this, and it does help, in the sense that I am quick to overlook the behaviors of other people and excuse them for any perceived transgressions they may commit. Which is awesome, and I'm glad, because fuck going through life angry. But actually giving a shit about them? Giving a shit about who these people are and what they're doing? How do I do it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not kidding when I say I excuse these people. There's really nothing anyone can do that I will take seriously for more than the few minutes it immediately affects me, if even that. I am not an angry person, generally speaking. But my goodness I am a lonely person. I am an exhausted person. How do I transition to experiencing these people as reward, as actual additions to my experience, rather than as complications I must endure - albeit endure very well? This is my problem. Far more than hating anyone for anything, it is this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only reply to this post with any seriousness because I am impressed at your understanding and helpful response. If you have any input I can use, I will take it.

       My parents are 60 and about 3-4 years ago, they were beginning to see the light. Not believing anything, questioning things, understanding more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, they've reverted back to the "Nah, all that stuff is just internet bullshit. You believe everything you see on the internet." And thus go back to watching and believing MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe it's a mechanism, like it's almost too much to unplug after so long and accept what you think is true isn't. Even when faced with it, you'll end up going back.

       Is it really so surprising that the people who either abandoned or ignored the hippie movement to either build or allow the shithole we live in today are not into questioning the official story?

       The future probably won't be great as learned helplessness grips younger people.
