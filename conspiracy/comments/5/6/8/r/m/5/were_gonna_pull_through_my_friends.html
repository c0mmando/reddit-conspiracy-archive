       V for Vendetta was 100% correct that removal of fear is the best eye opener. Under G W Bush, things felt so locked down for someone that was awake. Under Obama, govt has gone so crazy that everyone sees it and damn near everyone realizes he or she could identify with a group they try to label as a threat. It certainly does not mean things improved under Obama.. it just means govt has overplayed their hand.

       I think we're getting help from aliens or angels, or we've reached a tipping point where our desperation, demoralization and anger has taken us collectively to bruce banner level hulkism.. creating an egregore of vigilantism out of populist sense of justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you that this 'sense' of 'awakening' is happening at all levels of society, crosscutting socioeconomic groups.  I talked to a blue collar mechanic, they know what's going on, doctors, lawyers, they know too, computer experts feel the same.  The only people who aren't onboard are the yoga moms driving priuses to whole foods with coexist stickers (new age or wicca) in asheville and places like this for example the bay area.  Basically it's the social justice warriors who are really out to lunch in terms of information or are using outdated partisanism, or are just people with ethical problems (like they don't care Hillary is a criminal).

       It clearly says how you can see them. Youtube the lens and you'll see tons of people who take pictures of "ghosts" it's all one and the same. There are also numerous articles. Link it to what sacred books call Archons/Djinn/Demons and you'll see the picture being painted. I am not religious, but I acknowledge those books have a point they are explaining.

       Don't you wonder why no one can fix the world and it keeps going non stop? Our world is the work of a higher intelligence. We all just play along with it, as Queen says "I command your very souls you unbelievers" look at the big picture and you see a completely different thing. I used to look at the world one way, looking at it completely backwards makes infinite times more sense.

       Doesn't matter how it works, pyramids are built all over the world and are there for specifically the use of infinite electricity. Go back thousands of years not hundreds. I'll throw in some Nas quotes because I gotta say he's spot on.

       "Baby, 'fore we came to this country we were kings and queens
Never porch monkeys, there was empires and Africa called Kush
Timbuktu where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian, Arabs and gave them gold
      </p>
      <p>
       When gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans"

       So are all the ghosts on TV shows like the show Ghosthunters really just lost soul or negative/bad entities? Do you believe in ghosts? I always have but never had anything weird happen. Always wanted to experience it. Recently started thinking about invisible aliens around or near spectating. Just kinda thought about it one day and now I see you posting things about this has me wondering.. You have touched a lot of issues I have been obsessing over for awhile now. if you get the time please PM me

       I've been there and done that. I'm not so sure these days. I embrace the spirits (good ones, these days). The wind whispers. I'm not saying people are not good, I'm just saying that is not the purpose if this realm (imo). or maybe it is.? It's a catch 22 for your spirit being and your human vessel, one cannot live while the other does...

       You create your own reality. The shadow government does not control my life. They do not control the wolf that attacked me and my dog. It's an illusion that your brain conjures up based on bias and the construct they create.

       Karma is merely if you do XYZ, XYZ will and can happen to you. I don't believe in that, per se, in the traditional sense. Game over. You learned from your mistakes, but they will not haunt you, nearly remind you. Make sense?

       My previous pup found her. We were out on a hunt, and the little runt was lost in the cold. That pup nursed her and protected her from the rest of the hounds. She's been inside with me ever since. That pup died, and now she is here. Cuddles like her adopted mamma used to.... Her eyes are blueish green like mine. Not green in the sense, you are probably thinking.

       All I know and can say is, this dog is an extension of me. If you fuck with me, you're going to meet a wolf, lol. The most loyal dog I've had. We have a bond, that's for damn sure... It's weird. Words cannot describe... Crazy  because she is passed out on the couch with ,me, ears perched....

       ok so reading this over "your spirit being and your human vessel,"
      </p>
      <p>
       so to you in this sense our "spirit being" is separate from our soul?
that is an interesting dicotomy to think about

       type.  So you work on loving yourself and then you'll love the world, because to some degree the ego demands solipsism to be true (truman show); you know no world but what you've experienced.  But as a mature person you accept their experience to be true to them as well and thus you act accordingly, per a golden rule, if and only if you believe them to be entitled to the same blessings as yourself.  (many don't, but they are the exception to this rule, and they are nearly the entire raison d'etre of this sub)

       I don't know the purpose, all I can comment on is my spiritual beliefs based on experience (not religious). Also, by living alone in the woods with nature. Observe nature. That is the best advice I can give. Live in it, embrace it. Clarity will come to you, I promise..

       Disagree.  When taking a karate belt test decades ago, I was just standing there not doing anything for some reason.  Frozen like a dummy.  I was on the high diving board again for the first time.  Stupid.  I had prepared, I was ready and this was an advanced test.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sensei said, "you can change at any time and do something different".  He didn't say, "you can start at any time"...or "go".  Though I could tell he was irritated with me, which was rare, because he was very patient.  He repeated, "you can
       <em>
        change
       </em>
       at any time. and do something different."    It was covertly insulting but also very loving and extremely wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       It forced me to think about what the hell was happening, and with this I snapped out of it, succeeded and advanced.  Anyway,  this has stuck with me, this 'being allowed to break out of loop, or allowing myself to try something different at any time' has become something of my own.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've taken it to mean that we can redeem ourselves at any time, change who we are to succeed in anything we do.

       I'm actually happy for the first time in my life.  The nation is falling apart as a massive detox, and the people who will suffer the most are the veterans who have spent the last 2 yrs lying to everyone on social, acting as the henches for the illuminati,, because they are thinking that if it falls apart they will be trained to survive with their aks... 'oh it's going to be an apocalypse like the walking dead.'
      </p>
      <p>
       no it won't.  there will be a squad of oathkeeper types that start sniping the baddies, simultaneous hack of the baddies computers....lists and death squads that go and round up each one of the astroturfers and we'll burn their shit down drag them out into the street with their women crying and shoot their face for treason.  They will kill their way upward.  We'll force people into MRI scanners to eliminate the parasite
