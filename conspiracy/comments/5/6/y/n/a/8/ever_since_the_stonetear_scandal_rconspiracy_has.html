       There has been a sharp and distinct shift in discourse within this subreddit since stonetear was exposed and all the attention garnered since then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost overnight, Clinton apologists are legion and their posts are getting upvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very noticeable because this was one of the few places on the internet where reasonably nonpartisan discussions could take place about government corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, just days later, people are defending, rationalizing, and minimizing the corruption of the Clintons while accusing anyone who disagrees with them of being Trump supporters, racist, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also worth noting is the tone of the attacks from the CTR shills. Rather than presenting even semi-intellectual arguments, they respond with smugness and condescension--much the same way Clinton performs in her debates. This must be a tactic that the Clinton campaign thinks is effective.

       At this stage, CTR will with almost certainty use higher-level scripted bots to control many accounts at a time. I would, if I were to run an operation like that.

       This is horrifying to me. We used to joke about the internet being filled with bots and there were only 1-2 real people in a conversation. The future is even worse, we could have entire subreddits full of bot conversations, and when the AI gets good enough...who will be able to tell the difference?
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a world where AI and 3D tech pass the uncanny valley and even Skype video calls are questionable in regards to authenticity.

       The entirety of reddit is like this and has been for a long time. Eglin AFB is a consistent #1 visitor to reddit, of all the cities in the world - and Eglin is where the USAF runs it's "online inform &amp; influence activities" from.

       think about whether or not you've
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       seen anything critical of the US military policies on the frontpage or on any major sub, ever. I sure haven't. I get the distinct impression that most threads have fake convos/fake narratives being posted by a legion of random accounts working on a bot network. They also keep everything that doesn't fit their narrative hidden or banned.

No. So... quit sounding like CNN. They want you to hate Putin so it will be easier for the masses to accept the war they will inevitably lie to drag us into.

       There is good reason why the Clintons have the nickname "teflon." Nothing ever seems to stick to them. I see no reason to think that anything will change in that regard once she's president, which is arguably the most "untouchable" position one could possibly have in the United States.

       Except usually they aren't correct the record. All other shills are much more subtle and work in other ways. CTR is just super blatant and can be spotted from a million miles away, plus user post history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hardest shill to spot is one who builds up a rep in this sub as someone who always posts great links/posts, and then every so often throws in something subtle to slip into your subconscious. That's why: question everything, trust nothing, research all

       My own suspicion is that the Clinton team have worked with Reddit to corral most critics of Clinton in this folder and effectively marginalize them that way. Hence the huge numbers of deletions on other subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this folder, the posters bring the label 'conspiracy theorist' on themselves just by posting, and thus mark themselves out as fringe commentators.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton campaign specifically said it was going to smear its critics as 'conspiracy theorists' and on Reddit at least, something like that is happening. It would be far less work to simply get all the critics into a sub where they could be ignored by mainstream folk, than it would be to argue with each and every one of those critics on an individual basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should observe, however, that I have no way to prove this idea. It just seems to explain what we already know.

       But if people who never self-identified as conspiracists get thrown in because they hate Hillary/fear ww3 with russia, that will dilute the brand and inspire pushback. If we tinfoilers are the only sympathetic audience when they need it the most, it may give us an in for further redpilling, It's like wojak says...I know the feels bruh!

       I can't wait for the election ends. My biggest fear is that this mega media grab will continue. The next Hillary scheme will be called "create the reality". People wont be able to avoid it and participate in modern life. These last 4 weeks of all media have been disgusting in telling people what to think instead of giving them evidence so they can make a decision.

       We have some interesting times ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched
       <em>
        Videodrome
       </em>
       recently and some of the parallels between the film and our reality have come to light. For those who haven't watched, the film touches on the idea of a person existing through media (video) alone. It is explained that through video individuals can control the reality that people perceive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The film was released in 1983. They had no idea that the Internet along with its social media tools would blow the premise of the film out of the water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our politicians can introduce whichever character they choose to play with social media and build it up through TV appearances. News stations can fabricate news and pass it as reality - and they don't even face any consequences if they are caught.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are entering a period where truths and false information will be difficult to verify, but both will be propagated. How do you choose what to believe? Well, it all depends which character on the screen you trust. If you are a Democrat, then you are likely eating up all the current news with no filter. If you are a Republican, you hate the bias and long for a new source of information (Trump Network?). Independents are just sitting back confused as hell.

       It won't get any better that's for sure. The USA did just give up control of the Internet to the United Nations so we can't say it's somewhat protected by the First Amendment anymore.  An open and free Internet is one of their most annoying foes as the establishment narrative is being challenged in real time at this point.

       What's worse is, I've seen many patronizing, almost satirical posts getting upvoted.  Stuff like "Man, there are a lot of black helicopters and chemtrails out today".  Then someone replies "Yea, man, it's crazy, I saw them too!  I keep hearing that something big is going to go down on {{ date of some Trump rally }}".  Then a bunch of other accounts chime in with equal amount of noise and no value.  No links, no nothing, but satirical conspiracy banter.  All getting upvoted.

       .  Effectively lowering the signal-to-noise ratio of the entire fucking subreddit.

       I could probably dig up a few of these posts if anyone's interested.  I can't remember if I archived them or not.  But it was all IMMEDIATELY after all of the Stonetear shit started going down.

       uh, just out of curiosity, do you realize that trump is a clinton donor and family friend, who has suddenly materialized on the political scene to "run against" his buddy's wife and do everything necessary to make her look good and discredit all of the opposition to "the establishment" by associating it with a guy like trump? that doesn't seem at all suspicious to you? you think trump is an actual, genuine opposition to "the establishment"? lol.

       It's the individual's job to read, research, and form their own opinion on any story or issue. CTR is of course going to try to sway views but if people don't bother trying to understand the subject they would be at fault. Just make sure you make as much information available to as many people as possible, it's all you can really do to help.

       Ya, post links to source materials or refer to books or just give them names of experts that would do better explaining the subject. That way you at least give the other person a chance to research whatever the subject may be.

       Have you considered the possibility that people are just souring on Trump? For a long time I was fiercely anti-Clinton. I still am, and I won't vote for her. I live in a red state anyway, so I'll vote third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if I lived in Ohio? Very different question, my friend. They are both literal piles of crap, each in their own terrifying way. Up until recently, I thought if I were in a swing state that I would vote Trump - a political outsider, shake things up, maybe get more people to care about the political process, and surely Congress will keep him in check.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, even with the emails, Stonetear, DNC collusion, Clinton Foundation...fuck, man, I just don't think I could bring myself to vote for Trump anymore. If I picture a G8 Summit with Trump at the table, thinking about his behavior at the debates, I shudder at the thought. You can't constantly talk over democratically elected leaders of other countries the way he does in the debates. Scoffing, yelling out, finger pointing. It may work for him in the pushy self-promoting business world he inhabits, but...the man would be an embarrassment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying there are no CTR shills or anything like that, but I really think this people in this sub are living in an echo chamber and ignoring how every day people see things.

       Souring on Trump doesn't mean you're going to sit around on reddit trying to rationalize and divert attention away from Clinton's corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Constantly bringing Trump into the discussion is pointless. This isn't the_donald, not every anti-Hillary post has a pro-Trump undertone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Odds are, Hillary will most likely win--which would make Trump irrelevant and discussions about her corruption all the more vital. Constantly trying to divert discussions of Hillary back to Trump is only preventing rational discussion from taking place.

       It is the latest tactic from CTR: act like a disenfranchised bernie supporter, and give a heart felt reality of why you just can't bring yourself to vote for trump, or complain about how "blatently" r/conspiracy has become a pro-trump platform. I've seen it all over the sub over the last 5 days or so. A disinformation campaign to get people back to r/politics so the astroturfing can be confined to one place. It's actually kind of funmy how desperate they've become; going from a snide "i don't have to opperate in r/conspiracy, everyone thinks they're  loons" to a "quick! Flood r/conspiracy there's an exodus on r/politics because they see our obvious manipulation!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Just looking at the controversial tab of this sub, it shows a lot of people wondering why the focus is so much on Hillary. I suppose when shills are just agreeing with each other, it kind of loses its effect.

       They definitely seem worried about losing Bernie supporters to Trump.

       Though, from talking with my friends who were Bernie supporters, it seems most of them who are refusing to vote for Hillary will instead be voting for Stein or Johnson.

       That's a common sentiment around my social circles too. I'm advocating a third party for more competition in a failing two party system. Thing is; while
       <strong>
        most

       bernie supporters are voting third party, there still are some out there voting trump just to spite Clinton. Who can blame them? The whole Clinton campaign has demoralized bernie sanders support from the get go.

       You wouldn't know it. There have been quite a few Trump shills that get their posts to the front page in this sub. The knee-jerk reaction so many are prone to only serves to reinforce this kind of mindless behavior.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        not every anti-Hillary post has a pro-Trump undertone.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I agree and think it's important to highlight this point. That said, some of the popular posts that are anti-Hillary are posted by Trump shills so I can see how the implication could be perceived.
      </p>
      <p>
       All things considered, I can't wait for the election to be over so we can say goodbye to all the shilling. To echo your point: YES, continue to blow the whistle on HRC's transgressions. She's got a long history in the limelight with plenty of unsavory material to work with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Out of curiosity, I searched for the word "trump" in this sub and sorted by Top of all time. 9/10 were posts defending Trump and/or denouncing HRC (the 10th was suggesting they're both just distractions). I realize this isn't scientific or conclusive in any way but I wonder if r/politics would demonstrate the inverse of these findings. It certainly makes me wonder if this sub has a Trump lean or whether it has been infiltrated by Trump shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: I'll brace myself for the impending downvotes. I know my position of not jumping to conclusions or disagreeing with the hive mind of r/conspiracy is unpopular but is the irony of downvoting someone with a differing perspective/take on a situation lost on the posters of a subreddit that is supposed to be dedicated to giving a voice to
       <em>
        exactly that (differing perspective)?

       I mean, I can't imagine
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       in this sub disagrees so vehemently with me when I suggest taking a cautious approach to supposed "evidence." The real conspiracy r/conspiracy seems to be ignoring is how heavily many here are swayed by leveraging their borderline hatred of HRC. It's almost too easy. If you mention anything negative about her, this sub will get behind you full force and drown out any cautious interpretations of the claim being made. It's actually pretty shocking just how quickly people are willing to rally around just about anything that resembles their personal world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, that's not critical thinking - that's starting with the end in mind and working backwards. I've actually just unsubbed from r/conspiracy. Maybe the posts and this sub will become less politicized once this election is over. We can't be the only people who feel this way; but, I suppose those with measured approaches and moderate views are just less likely to get involved in heated/emotionally-charged discussions. Maybe there's actually a silent majority here after all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I just realized I went on a tangent there. More directly, I agree with you. I think there's an assumption that if HRC is bad, Trump must be acceptable as a leader. With many of r/conspiracy viewing HRC as linked intrinsically to many of their least favorite US government policies, Trump seems to be the default option. To me, this just seems to be further perpetuating a 2 party system that fails to address much of the nuance needed to successfully address a nation's challenges.

       I use social media as a litmus test to gauge populist reactions to anything and everything. In that respect, if balance exists, you can use the hive mind as an incredible peer review source for all manner of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       These days the pendulum is swinging so fucking wildly that any constructive view or objective opinion is completely ignored. All it does is serve to galvanize the angry and beleaguered to their extremes. From this no information can be gained and social media is losing its use. It's kind of funny that really I don't care about what is going on, the events aren't what have me so salty because this is just life as normal if you've been paying attention. The difference now is the people. They are twisting everything without the media or the information handlers even having to lift a finger. That is what has me so angry.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how dictators are formed and how real war begins. This isn't fervor over the first black president. This is the ignorant turned fanatical over business as usual. One step further and these people become radicals.

       That's an interesting point. I think you're absolutely right - it's terrifying thinking that people so out of touch with reality can be so easily swayed by appeals to emotion. And providing evidence to the contrary only results in a doubling down on initial claims. It's disturbing.

      <p>
       I would disagree with you there. At this point in the election it is a zero sum game. Highlighting Clinton's corruption is de facto support for Trump. They are the only two realistic options (early ballots are already being collected). This has changed over time - early in the election cycle, pointing out flaws in one candidate isn't necessarily showing support for the other when there are a multitude of options. That is no longer the case. It's one of the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, you're ignoring fundamental human behavior. Humans constantly seek to rationalize and reinforce their opinions. If we assume many have swallowed the bitter pill that is Hillary Clinton for Pres, then we would expect them to seek out and promote content that supports this position - whether it is pro Hillary or anti-trump.

      <p>
       Not necessarily. I'll give you two reasons why.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, exposing her corruption doesn't seem to affect her chances of winning. Right now, new evidence is dropping on a daily basis illustrating how corrupt HRC and her people are, and it's having virtually zero effect on the polls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, she will most likely win. This is according to the oddsmakers and polls. Even if legit votes aren't enough, we know that there will be fraud involved and there is really nothing to prevent that from happening at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, once she becomes president, her corruption will be orders of magnitude more important than it is already.
      </p>
      <p>
       CTR is only the beginning. If anything, it's a sneak peak at how government propaganda will be conducted in the coming years--especially with Hillary giving orders from the top. Just wait until she has a budget hundreds or thousands of times larger for similar propaganda operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you turn the light on, the cockroaches scatter. We need to at least make them apprehensive about moving forward with their plans. We do that by exposing their operation.

       This subreddit is very anti government corruption. Yet, as more evidence piles up every day about HRC's corruption thanks to Gucifer and Wikileaks, more people are somehow rushing to her defense and criticizing her opposition (Trump supporters)? Sorry, it wouldn't happen organically.

       That's just not true. The sub is constantly bombarded with posts that are written as if the poster thinks being all in for trump is the default opinion. And then anyone who calls trump for what he is is instantly called a CTR shill. It's more likely these are Trump shills trying to use reverse psychology.

       Nobody here cares about trump's antics. What the hell are you talking about?

       Firstly, if the shoe fits, secondly there shouldn't be anything wrong with rationalizing voting for Clinton, I mean in their eyes you're rationalizing voting for Trump, think about it.

        Also worth noting is the tone of the attacks from the CTR shills. Rather than presenting even semi-intellectual arguments, they respond with smugness and condescension--much the same way Clinton performs in her debates.

      <p>
       They're only smug because Donald is getting his ass handed to him and they know victory is at hand, believe me they did the same thing to us Bernie supporters.

       One thing any future candidate should keep in mind, never snort coke before a Presidential debate, that shit may get you past rally after rally of your own supporters but once the rest of the country sees the shitshow that is your behavior the end is pretty much nigh.

      <p>
       Yes because smugness would be a tactic taught to get people on your side lol, these CTR people are most likely reading or copy pasting from a script like any collections or telemarketing firm, I'm sure smugness and condescension would be worked out in training if they want to look legit, but then again they're trying to blend in here on Reddit so I might be wrong the right idea might be to amplify the smugness to blend in better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall the most likely answer is people have seen Trump for the pile of feces he is and are coming here to discuss it since r/politics has turned into one giant circlejerk/counter-circlejerk of Pro-Hillary crap vs the entrenched opposition, the whitewashers, and the constant brigading from pro-Trump subs and users and the counter-brigading from the rest of the site, which I'm sure is like at least half the site. Face it, it's all a shitshow and thankfully it's almost over, or at least in the electorate sense.

       What point is there in arguing with someone who is paid to have their talking point or "opinion"? They won't change it even if they're proven wrong. You can thank Hillary for using these tactics. As much as her group would love to blame someone else, they are the ones who funded millions for this group to exist(quite openly too).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not as though they are presenting real facts either. For example, they lie about her health and say she is fine... Then she has an episode on  9/11, disproving this. They are just pushing talking points, not fact correcting. It's funny to watch them disappear after every event/scandle, only to come back pretending nothing happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       And like, 20 people have done the" God forbid someone have a different opinion" in this tread. Not even subtle. Right up there with "downvotes? Really??". Always a shit post.

       Lol but that's what I'm talking about, I've now been labeled a "shill" and instantly there is no point in having a conversation because I've been "bought" meanwhile in reality I've been a member of this sub for 9 years on three different accounts, whenever I give out too much info on one account or something else I bail, why deal with the hassle when we can easily make a new one, and this one is my work account. Believe me on this as well, I just bought my first house, if CTR were paying me I'd at least have some money to spare, I'm fucking broke, every dime has been going into this house, it's worth it but still I'm broke! lol.

       Okay no, the theory on her health happened long before the 9/11 event, I even commented in here about how disgusting the whole thing was, I mean seriously speculating on someone's health is pretty low, and then she goes and has whatever happen on 9/11 lol wtf.

       I've seen this exact same thing happen with pro-Trump people though too, they pop in, push their bullshit talking point or correct their record, and then delete the account, so it's not just CTR at work, but you have to wonder who is at work doing this for Trump, I know I do. It's crap regardless of who is doing it and for whom.

       Dude like I've said, I've been one of the very few liberals in this sub for so long that shit doesn't even phase me anymore, this sub has as much of a hivemind as any other, and at times it will crush dissenting opinion like they subs name was r/The_Donald, but without the shitty moderation, the mods here are actually pretty good as far as I can tell. But I've been here since the good old days of stormfront dominating this sub pushing their anti-semetic, racist, and white nationalistic crap. And by anti-semetic I don't mean "DAE think Israel is doing fucked up shit" I mean the whole "Jews did this that and the other thing" type stuff.

       This sub has grown a lot since then but there are users that still try their best to take us back to that crap.

        Not to mention nearly all of your response pertains to Trump supporters, but people can have that opinion without wanting to vote for Trump.

       Well my biggest issue is with Trump supporters honestly, you can vote for who you want but they seem to be the most blind on things. True Hillary supporters won't even come in here otherwise they would catch shit from me on how they did the same shit when exposed to evidence of fraud in the primaries and screwed over my man Bernie.

        I didn't compare how informed your opinion is to mine at all. I'm just noting the fact that you have 0 facts and 100% ad hominem responses in your opinion, and as such it can be disregarded.

       Isn't that most opinions? I wasn't trying to provide any facts I was giving my opinion on the situation and how everyone keeps freaking out over r/politics and CTR yet they just really want an echochamber here of their own opinions.

       All of this is conjecture at this point anyway until better evidence is presented.

       I agree, and there were facts within my statement but because they don't ally with certain people's political leanings or because they've been so spoonfed with Right wing propaganda and disinfo they can't even recognize when something has been established as fact, case in point Trump's bogotry, people supporting Hillary are constantly using it as a shield, but because they are using it doesn't mean it's not true, there is an established history of him saying bigoted crap throughout his decades in the public eye, so it's not like this crap is being made up, unless we throw out logic and reason and say it is for the sake of saying it and to provide propaganda and disinfo leaning the other way.

       And I am asking you where I could possibly acquire this mystical knowledge that you have that I don't. What are your sources of information? Do you not understand that media is meant to be chewed up and digested, not spoon fed?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's called critical thinking. You read or listen to what you are being told, and then you cross reference the claims with other sources to find out whether or not it's a legitimate piece of information. It's pretty easy. You should try it sometime.

       yes and many of those "informed opinions" happen to coincide exactly with "bought opinions" which are permeating every part of the web where actual discussion takes place.  There is no ambiguity over whether or not a massive amount of people are being paid by super PACs to "correct" peoples opinions of her.  This problem exists, and people (Trump supporters or not) are correct in questioning all Hillary supporters on the internet because we KNOW that a good portion of them are getting paid to create a narrative that is not completely in touch with reality.

       So literally any liberal based opinion is now a "bought opinion" in your eyes? Because that's what you're telling me from that statement. People don't all stand on one side of the spectrum and saying crap like that is just a way to invalidate the other side.

       Okay well first let me laugh at the fact that we're talking about narratives that aren't in touch with reality in r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I got my laughter out of the way, yes we know the problem exists, but like I outlined previously the issue at hand is everybody that disagrees with somebody's stance on something immediately calls "CTR/shill" whatever, it's like this subs version of yelling "triggered!" guess what if you can't defend your ideas maybe they weren't good ideas, so maybe that's the question we should all be asking ourselves rather than practicing our own version of McCarthyism here on Reddit and trying to turn everyone over to the "shill" police, or as it's known on Reddit, the pitch fork emporium.
      </p>
      <p>
       See this is one of the benefits they were probably looking for not only when they paid for CTR to work for her campaign but also through the press release, they effectively poisoned the well and turned us against one another because everyone is too busy shouting shill at opposing viewpoints and political ideologies.

       I don't know every time I've checked thinking I've got a "shill" I've been wrong. But I've seen plenty of posts where people were just copying pasting the same answers over and over again. Also those posts seem to be out of character for Reddit, like including thank you's and stuff, we don't do that normally, I try to have some courtesy here and there but never something so scripted sounding as that, and most users could give a shit about any kind of courtesy at all around here.

       Not voting is the worst thing you can do, you can at least get out there and vote for the candidate you align with the most and the down tickets, and then there are the local elections and ballot measures that are important too. Do like pot? Guess what it's on the ballot in many states. Want to stick it to big coal/oil? There are solar measures as well, but if in Florida vote no for amendment 1.

       I don't need how psychological warfare works, but I do need you to understand that Trump does have a history not only of bigoted statements but actions as well. Yeah it can be used to marginalize but this time it happens to be fairly accurate. But regardless you're going to believe who or what you believe but I implore you, take a deeper look into things, and I don't mean by diving right back into the hole of the Right/Alt-Right propaganda machine, find some middle of the road opinions like you can find on the intercept or other news agencies like it, nice unbiased reporting that attacks both sides, or even find some conflicting sources and discover the shreds of truth from both arguments and form your own opinion, that's what I try to do.

       That is a completely unrelated issue. Irrational and Bigoted being his functionally illiterate supporters who see this billionaire acting like a pig and think that makes it ok for them to act like pigs now. He's beautifully subverting American values and stability on behalf of his buddy Putin.

       You're conflating all sorts of different issues into one ball of nonsense. Just because Hillary is sold out does not excuse Trump's behavior. Literally anyone else could have beaten her in a landslide. But of course the republicans had to put forth a guy who more closely resembles an African Dictator than an American statesman.

       Let me break it down for you. Read this carefully before replying to avoid any further embarrassment on your part.
      </p>
      <p>
       This subreddit is very skeptical of government and very anti government corruption. There was a lot of reasonable discussions going on about the leaks and what we are finding out about Hillary's corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the stonetear scandal hit. After that, there was an influx of Hillary apologists who were not active here before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, in every active thread discussing new evidence involving the corruption of Hillary and the those associated with her (which is dropping every day), there are people here trying to rationalize, minimize, and brush aside that evidence while also attacking anyone not shilling for Hillary as biased Trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it was
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       like this before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, before you reply, read what I wrote again, and take a deep breath. I don't want to see you make yourself look any worse. I can only handle so much cringe.

       How can you honestly expect anyone to take you seriously when you insist that anyone who doesn't agree with you is automatically being paid by this woman who is nothing but a career politician. You're giving her way too much credit. Is she a clueless incompetent idiot or an evil power hungry bitch? Or is she just a petty, self absorbed nerd with a shitty personality and a blurry moral code?

       I'm betting on the latter

       If she wins, they will be hiring many more and everyone will be getting raises because she'll be able to funnel tax dollars into her propaganda operations just like Putin, the dictator she's always going on about and aspires to be just like.

       No, they won't. Reddit will always have vast networks of reputation management firms operating on it. The only thing that changes is the urgency and the operation.

       really excellent response.  I agree with everything you wrote.  It is also really apparent sometimes when something is CTR.

       I'm not sure. I'm a lurker by nature it is only very recently I chose to start posting or communicating here at all.

       I use social media as a litmus test to gauge populist reactions to anything and everything. In that respect, if balance exists, you can use the hive mind as an incredible peer review source for all manner of information.

       These days the pendulum is swinging so fucking wildly that any constructive view or objective opinion is completely ignored. All it does is serve to galvanize the angry and beleaguered to their extremes. From this no information can be gained and social media is losing its use. It's kind of funny that really I don't care about what is going on, the events aren't what have me so salty because this is just life as normal if you've been paying attention. The difference now is the people. They are twisting everything without the media or the information handlers even having to lift a finger. That is what has me so angry.

       This is how dictators are formed and how real war begins. This isn't fervor over the first black president. This is the ignorant turned fanatical over business as usual. One step further and these people become radicals.
