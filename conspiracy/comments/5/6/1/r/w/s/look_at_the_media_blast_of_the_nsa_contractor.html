<p>Boom.  This cat gets it.</p>

<p>Well, maybe not <em>all</em> the floods.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some natural catastrophes might have literally just happened without any PTB manipulation.  However, I <em>totally</em> would bet the house that at least a few &quot;natural catastrophes&quot; weren&#39;t really all that natural at all and were externally manipulated by outside, external, intelligent forces.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a shit ton in the bible that is nothing but manipulative, propaganda hogwash - yes - but some of it I imagine is also literally an accounting of certain historical occurrences that very much took place and occurred.</p>

<p>Matter of fact, <a href="http://whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">this is a pdf right here</a> of a book that goes <em>very</em> much into a lot of the evidence that exists laying out exactly what we&#39;re touching upon here.</p>

<p>It can be said that we are in a giant (from our perspective, as you correctly said) <del>zoo</del> experiment of sorts.  It’s an experiment that, it is said, has been tinkered with by <em>many</em> ETs throughout the ages and throughout the existence of humans in not only this incarnation, but in past incarnations (ancient Egyptians, Atlantans, Lemurians, etc).</p>

<p>Some of those ETs may or may not be robotic.  I imagine most if not all of them are organic, to be honest.</p>

<p>The system has already been in place for so long that the vast majority of Earth humans don&#39;t need to actually communicate or come in contact with any actual ETs.  It&#39;s kind of a &quot;plug and play&quot; system that was already set up ages ago.</p>

<p>They&#39;re merely King Rats (<a href="http://whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">p. 244</a>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn’t disagree with this.  A few years ago, there was an OP that came out on here that got a <em>looot</em> of traction and discussed some very interesting and occult information.  I posted a response on there that itself ended up getting quite a bit of traction as well…and it is very apropos to the idea you’re talking about here.</p>

<p>I would invite you to go through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">what I posted</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_081018">what I linked in the responses therein</a>, for a much, <em>much</em> deeper dive into this idea that you touched upon here that there might be PTB on this planet who’s intention is to get us to “unlock our true potential” by subjecting us to difficulties that we have to “break out of as a people and civilization”, as it were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I read it all. I believe anyone who has completely delved into spirituality comes to those conclusions. Very nice post 10/10. Now the question is, what are we meant to do? What does the end of bible prophecy mean? Are we going to be liberated and it&#39;s just a waiting game until then? I completely acknowledge there are other entities around here. I&#39;ve read DMT reports, never done it myself though. There&#39;s also <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/639279/SCIENTISTS-discover-invisible-alien-entities-spying-on-us-on-Earth">This</a></p>

<p>What is going to happen, when will it happen? I hope tomorrow but I also recognize bible prophecy is coming true and it&#39;s very likely nothing will change until the messiah comes.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t go that far because the conclusions aren’t really all that obvious, and they aren’t really talked about <em>that</em> much in spiritual books and literature.</p>

<p>Thank you, sir.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now the question is, what are we meant to do?</p>

<p>Transcend…as much as possible, transcend.  Work, in other words, toward moving beyond both the evil <em>and</em> the good of this world.  See them both as limitations and as temporary.  Appreciate what you can, help who you can, but try not to be attached to too much of any of it.</p>

<p>What does the end of bible prophecy mean?</p>

<p>I don’t know what the end of the bible prophecy is.  What is it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are we going to be liberated and it&#39;s just a waiting game until then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Na.  I certainly wouldn’t say that.  Seems existence and the universe - God or whatever you want to call it - is holographic.  As such, everything is everything.  You are me, I am you, we are all each other.  Everything is everything.</p>

<p>We just have to arrive at the direct, experiential understanding of this truth.  Not easy to do by far, but I think liberation comes via this channel more than through anything any one book might say.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve read DMT reports, never done it myself though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good.  You shouldn’t.  I’d say stay far, far away from it.  It’s a limitation and a crutch - just like any external substance that is used to elicit any type of state.  The concentrated, disciplined, <em>sober</em> mind can achieve anything with enough practice and effort.  Any other means simply puts one more crutch, one more limitation, and one more impediment on one’s ability to arrive at the Truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s also This</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Existence is like a radio.  We happen to live on the radio station called “Earth in the third dimension”, but even within <em>this very space</em>, there are many other different “channels” so to speak, and if we have the ability to “flip” as it were from channel to channel, we would be able to witness many different beings existing in the very same space that we are in right now at this very moment…just existing on a different frequency, a different dimension, a different wavelength.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is going to happen, when will it happen?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s happening now.  It’s already happening.  It’s <em>been</em> happening.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hope tomorrow but I also recognize bible prophecy is coming true and it&#39;s very likely nothing will change until the messiah comes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you tune in properly, you will realize that there <em>is</em> no messiah.  There is no messiah because <em>everything</em> is messianic and has the potential to be so.</p>

<p>The “messiah” is <em>you</em>.  Like we were referring to at the beginning of this thread, part of the point of The Hidden Hand information is to show you/us how to elevate our own abilities and frequencies so that we can see that the very truth we are searching for is, in fact, inside of us already.  We don’t need to be looking for it outside or in any “other” to bring it to us.</p>

<p>DMT is how you get to other dimensions, look up Terence mckenna and others. DMT isn&#39;t something that makes you happy or anything it&#39;s what Shamans use to talk to spirits.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I’d say that perhaps anything that one relies on so heavily that they have trouble functioning properly without it can be classified as a crutch of sorts.  Some crutches are worse than others.  It seems that fasting, if done responsibly, can be quite a forging and disciplining activity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#39;t our body react to it and our brains begin to connect differently?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, our bodies <em>definitely</em> react to it.  Our brains connect differently as well - especially depending upon what <em>kind</em> of fasting one does and how one’s mental state is in the first place.</p>

<p>I fasted for two months straight before (I believe it was fifty seven days, to be exact) and was able to accomplish it because I had mentally and emotionally prepared myself for it beforehand.  I was able to remain focused and get through it as a result.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tesla claimed if he didn&#39;t take a sobriety break he would have lived until 150.</p>

<p>Our bodies are devices. Based on what you put in you&#39;ll get a different outcome. Tesla hardly slept because he drank so much. He claims 1.5 hours a day. Judging by your &quot;smh&quot; I can see that you have beliefs to take you away from all possibility. </p>

<p>I am leaning towards drinking/cannabis/magic mushrooms/dmt are the keys to figuring out the universe, DMT being the pinnacle. People who smoke DMT say they see words pop up in 7 different languages and see things that can&#39;t be explained. Just like how we see things that are unexplained maybe there are other things unexplained that will link together on the other side. You are blindly believing what you wrote. I do agree it is likely mostly true, I would rather experience everything.</p>

<p>I believe every entity in the universe is us in another form, might as well communicate with ourselves from the future.</p>

<p>Some tesla quotes</p>

<p>“I myself eschew all stimulants. I also practically abstain from meat. I am convinced that within a century coffee, tea, and tobacco will be no longer in vogue,” he said in the early 20th century. “Alcohol, however, will still be used. It is not a stimulant but a veritable elixir of life.”</p>

<p>“Had I not given up [daily] whiskey during [Prohibition], I would surely live to 150 years of age.”</p>

<p>“Alcohol is not a poison, nor is it a drug…[i]n small quantities, it cleans and sterilizes the alimentary channels; thereby preventing infections, and proves a beneficial stimulant to thought, speech and physical exertion.” </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a drinker. I&#39;ve probably only been drunk a handful of times. But reading these quotes today is making me want to buy a 40.</p>

<p>Also saying it had nothing to do with his inventions meh. It could it could have not. I think it does though. Clean body, clear thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good. You shouldn’t. I’d say stay far, far away from it. It’s a limitation and a crutch - just like any external substance that is used to elicit any type of state. The concentrated, disciplined, sober mind can achieve anything with enough practice and effort. Any other means simply puts one more crutch, one more limitation, and one more impediment on one’s ability to arrive at the Truth.</p>

<p>DMT is how you get to other dimensions, look up Terence mckenna and others. DMT isn&#39;t something that makes you happy or anything it&#39;s what Shamans use to talk to spirits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Existence is like a radio. We happen to live on the radio station called “Earth in the third dimension”, but even within this very space, there are many other different “channels” so to speak, and if we have the ability to “flip” as it were from channel to channel, we would be able to witness many different beings existing in the very same space that we are in right now at this very moment…just existing on a different frequency, a different dimension, a different wavelength.</p>

<p>Exactly that&#39;s what DMT does. Research drugs more.</p>
