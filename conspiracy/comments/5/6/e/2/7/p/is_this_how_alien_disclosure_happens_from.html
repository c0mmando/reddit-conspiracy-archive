    <div class="md"><p>well we don&#39;t know how fragile our system is. If we were able to destroy earth for all we know we&#39;d be starting the cannibalization of our own solar system by the sun, pulling everything close enough to ignite/consume them. there are people who believe Jupiter could be a second sun, given the right circumstances it may be able to be ignited and used as a power source for space craft about to leave the solar system, but maybe trying to ignite it we accidentally blow up the solar system. at this point, it&#39;s a little inconceivable that humans could destroy our system, however it could very well be possible in the next 50-100 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are part of the group of people who believes that &quot;aliens&quot; within their UFO&#39;s, (disclaimer, I do), actively seek nuclear missile launches / tests and deactivate them using their greater tech, then you may want to know that the reason they do this is because there is more to a nuclear explosion then just the destructive force we have seen/experienced. The nuclear explosions apparently also affect alternative spectrums / dimensions, which are possibly (I believe definitely are) filled with other forms of life. So it IS possible that we would destroy ourselves and other aliens when we detonate a nuclear bomb.</p>

<p>Then again, we have somehow gotten away with detonating Nuclear weapons a few times without any .mysterious UFO deactivations... One of which the scientists actually told the politicians there was a possibility the nuclear bomb they were testing/detonating in our upper atmosphere might set our entire atmosphere ON FIRE!!!!! They went ahead.... Augh</p>

<p>That said, Podesta believes/believed in ETI:

<p>Not even joking. People saw 2008 coming but it took a while until everyone started catching on. They were even laughed at and shunned. Remain calm. Don&#39;t start shouting this shit in the streets. Prepare. Prepare. Prepare.</p>

<p>People were right. All those crazy theories were fucking right. We never went back into space because the aliens won&#39;t let us. That&#39;s why Elon will never make it to Mars. This is why these are the times... The end of times as we know it. We now enter a new era...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have expressed a (half jokingly) suspicion that zionist banking overlords have operated with some outside help for centuries. Think about the absolute brilliance of the debt based money system and wall street. Think of the genious, in creating this system with which you can accumulate control. Crash the markets, buy up property and companies, stabilize. Control everything by fomenting dependance on that which you have a monopoly on (money). Control the media, to sway and manipulate public opinion.</p>

<p>It really feels like they knew something about the human condition, way before human behavior could prove them right.</p>

<p>TLDR: ET is telling the zionists how to conquer the world via money and media control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How so? </p>

<p>ET life was primarily discovered by the military during ww2 by pilots seeing &quot;flying saucers&quot; and AAA battery operators shooting at unkillable targets. </p>

<p>Investigations led them to understand that they were in fact from other planets, and we&#39;re no threat to humanity.</p>

<p>The fossil fuel industries, who had deep resource and Intel connections with the US government, got wind of this and realized that ETs were not using their fuel types/systems and therefore did everything they could (and still do) to suppress both concepts, and obfuscate the truth.</p>

<p>All ETs are peaceful, because civilizations that are not peaceful are not allowed out of their solar systems by the greater universal &quot;good&quot;. Humans fall into this catagory. If we were to try to leave the orbit of Pluto,  we&#39;d be (and have been) met with double or triple the number of ships/soldiers to prevent us from leaving.</p>

<p>Human apes are still seen as critically uncivilized by the rest of the universe; nuking ourselves, bitching about resource and military trivialities, etc.</p>

<p>We are not civilized yet</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best and quickest source of into is probably youtube. Look up Dr Steven Greer.</p>

<p>He heads the disclosure project, an organisation that, in 2001, disclosed publicly the existence of benevolent ET life with over 600 military and government witnesses. To be a witness in his group you must be willing to tell your story to US Congress under oath. All are willing, and they include(d) Edgar Mitchell the astronaut and more. Several of his witnesses have unfortunately died in mysterious circumstance since 2001.</p>

<p>The two initial things that should be looked into right now are, imo, the energy technology were speaking of now, and the planned hoax, false flag alien invasion that&#39;s being planned.</p>

<p>The former because he&#39;s actually about to make another documentary about the very subject; technologies that have been blacked out of piblic view. Technologies that enable faster than light travel and &quot;unlimited&quot; and &quot;free&quot; energy production. These of course, threaten the established $100T oil industry.</p>

<p>The ladder because he has actual proof (leaked documents, memos and technician witnesses) that nefarious plans are being conducted that would see several key people assassinated simultaneously and the whole planet false flag attacked by organic-machine hybrids that look like generic &quot;alien greys&quot;. They&#39;re, of course, NOT ALIEN, but rather robots made by Lockheed/Martin using reversed-engineered alien technology and new understandings in biology, genetics and microsurgery. One of his witnesses says this plan could be conducted with a single button press, but theyre waiting for the right moment.</p>

<p>All the violent alien abductions that have ever occurred are human-led operations. If they had their way, we&#39;d spend trillions on bogus defense contracts to fight the bogus alien invasion. </p>

<p>Thank you for investigating.
Be well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Podesta is the most famous politician in the disclosure movement as he has made several remarks about wanting to chase down the issue within the government (with Bill and Hillary also mentioning an interest). </p>

<p>The disclosure issue cannot really be disinfo because it would mean shining a light into dark programs and things that people have died over. Perhaps Podesta&#39;s role doesn&#39;t  means what we think it means, perhaps there is a way that this could just be muddying the waters but it&#39;s a big stretch to denounce this outright. Mitchell has, of course, been saying this for years but holy shit there is a lot of stupid close-mindedness around these parts, as usual. If there is a scenario that you could not possibly entertain, then really, you don&#39;t belong in a community like this.</p>

<p>Here is some pretty &quot;cult&quot; / crazy shit his <em>Noetic Sciences</em> craziness. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trained as an engineer and scientist, Captain Mitchell was most comfortable in the world of rationality and physical precision. Yet the understanding that came to him as he journeyed back from space felt just as trustworthy—it represented another way of knowing.</p>

<p>This experience radically altered his worldview: Despite science&#39;s superb technological achievements, he realized that we had barely begun to probe the deepest mystery of the universe—the fact of consciousness itself. He became convinced that the uncharted territory of the human mind was the next frontier to explore, and that it contained possibilities we had hardly begun to imagine. Within two years of his expedition, Edgar Mitchell founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences in 1973.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a video interview with him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The weird thing is that he died less than 3 weeks after the latest email from &quot;short illness at a hospice facility.&quot; Yes he was old and that kind of shit happens all the time. Other than that I find the emails fascinating regardless of his age or circumstances. Zero Point energy has been a <em>thing</em> for a long time, mostly debunked, but also rumored to be gobbled up for military tech. A fucking astronaut, and arguably at one point - a very smart man, was shooting off emails about ETIs and ZPE. But certifiably insane I guess...</p>

<p>edit: Ok, reading more into Edgar would certainly make him out to be a nut job but this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> shit!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I would say it was weird if he died shortly after and he was 35. He was 85, so I don&#39;t find it all that peculiar. He&#39;d also been speaking out about this sort of thing since at least the 90s, including a Dateline interview.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well we don&#39;t know how fragile our system is. If we were able to destroy earth for all we know we&#39;d be starting the cannibalization of our own solar system by the sun, pulling everything close enough to ignite/consume them. there are people who believe Jupiter could be a second sun, given the right circumstances it may be able to be ignited and used as a power source for space craft about to leave the solar system, but maybe trying to ignite it we accidentally blow up the solar system. at this point, it&#39;s a little inconceivable that humans could destroy our system, however it could very well be possible in the next 50-100 years. </p>
