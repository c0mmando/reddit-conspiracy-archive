       Dude.  Here's a little newsflash:  This sub isn't
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       about political bullshit.  It's about
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       that TPTB hide from the masses - and as much bullshit chicanery as you think there exists in politics? psshhh.  That's not even the tip of the iceberg compared to what TPTB are hiding from the masses with regard to ET reality on and around this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get it.  You have your head stuck and focused on the ground - only in "political" matters.  That's not the worst thing in the world considering how much bullshit wrong doing is going on in the world of politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       However - and this is a
       <em>
        big
       </em>
       however - exposing the reality of ET existence on and around this planet makes what's going on politically look like a fucking
       <em>
        quark
       </em>
       in comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, and as such, BRING ON THE ET DISCUSSION.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, keep the Shillary/Frump b.s. politics yadayada going.  However, upvote the
       <em>
        shit
       </em>
       out of the ET stuff because that's ultimately the far, far bigger issue.  Not saying the political chicanery isn't important.  It is.  However, the ET dynamic is truly
       <em>
        cosmic
       </em>
       , and many here are
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       focused on that.

       It's part of her conspiracy-fakeout-turducken.  I mean just 2 weeks ago, she died, then she had parkinsons, now she's ok, but just as the USMS is about to RICO her, Oh look fucking aliens

      <p>
       How much more of this garbage are we going to take.  Arrest her and Comey and Lynch already and put in front of firing squad, shut down cia to continue weeding out the baddies, so we can get on with our lives.

       should absolutely NOT be ALL about Trump and Hillary, which it HAS BEEN. There's been dozens of complaint posts about this over the last several months. It's ridiculous. Conspiracy topics do not ONLY encompass politricks. There've been times where the entire front page was covered in Hillary drivel threads, and anything about anything else, any other country, any other person of interest even was being vote controlled down the second and third page. I'm actually surprised someone is suggesting there should be more threads about Hillary!
