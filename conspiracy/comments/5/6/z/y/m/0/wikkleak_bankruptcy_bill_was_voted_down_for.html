<blockquote>
<p>You know a lot of people don’t realize that the industry that gave the most money to Washington over the past few years was not the oil industry, was not pharmaceuticals. It was consumer credit products.</p>

<p>The credit industry on this bankruptcy bill has spent tens of millions of dollars lobbying, and as their profits grow, they just throw more into lobbying for how they can get laws that will make it easier and easier and easier to drain money out of the pockets of middle class families.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>**Mikulski on the Senate floor in 2005:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This bill is unfair to the little guy—to families who are struggling to overcome medical bills, unemployment, or divorce and find themselves forced to declare bankruptcy. Under the guise of reform it makes it tougher on families who have done the right thing. That’s not what we should be doing in the United States Senate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>HRC Comms advisor: One idea is we could...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>have women Senators who all voted for it to put out statement</p>

<h2>Judy and Marcia are also prepared to say that Hillary fought really hard for changes</h2>

<h2>This is all just messaging. It&#39;s democracy for the companies, by the companies through political operatives that strategize to spin issues for a mostly brainwashed public that don&#39;t question how their country is being picked apart and deteriorating.</h2>
