<p>What if he was put in place to give Hillary a definitive edge?</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t that leaked tape (or any that are apparently similar to it) come out during the primaries?</p>

<p>Listen to this man talk, there is literally no substance in what he says, he literally just repeats himself. How the hell did he get this far?</p>

<p>I have nothing to back this up, but is there a even a slight possibility that there was some sort of election fraud to give Trump the upper hand just so Hillary could have an easy win?</p>

<p>There already is some evidence of election fraud against Sanders, so why couldn&#39;t the same be true for Trump? Just the opposite way</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh.. Where do I start. The mainstream media has been after him from the beginning, as have all big banks, big Pharma. They have put words in his mouth, miss-quoted him, miss-represented his stance on pretty much everything. His supporters aren&#39;t buying it. In fact if you visit <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>, shitpost ing aside, that subreddit is populated by people equally awake as this sub. They have been hanging on to his &quot;tape&quot; because it&#39;s probably one of the only things they have against him, if they played this hand early on, people would have forgotten, so they kept it up until the right moment, oh look at that, wikileaks just dropped a bunch of emails with proof Hillary is a two-faced liar, hates the American people and works for big interests like banks and Pharma, we have proof of collusion and lies, yet all the media talks about is this tape. You know what I say about that tape, who fucking cares, it was private locker room guy talk. I can tell you from experience, you get a bunch of guys in a room, you add some drinks or some activity that will raise the testosterone in the room, and even guys who would never think of speaking like that will, I know this to be true, I&#39;ve played enough sports and hung out with enough guys to know, even the beta males will sometimes slip up and say something crude if thrown into that kind of scenario. Plus, the thing most people aren&#39;t talking about is who recorded this audio? It&#39;s the same people who blackmail people to get their way, politicians, religious cults like Mormons and Scientology followers are known to use this tactic, throw someone in a situation where they lose control, document it, blackmail. But this pales in comparison to what she and her husband have done to America and its people. They have stolen money through the Clinton Foundation, money that was raised to help the less fortunate went right into their pockets, or they used the foundation to write off taxes, the same tax loophole trump used, a loophole Bill Clinton signed into law to help him and his rich friends. Trump repeats himself, that is on purpose, the average American needs this repetition for it to stick, it is a very common technique used by writers and comedians, it&#39;s called the rule of 3s, where to hit home a joke or a point one must repeat it 3 times, well documented. On the flip side, can you actually listen to her bullshit pre-rehearsed pre-meditated cookie cutter speeches? Can you not tell how rehearsed and fake they are, how every word that comes out of her is a complete lie. She will not follow through with anything she&#39;s saying now, just like all other politicians, aren&#39;t you sick of politicians saying anything they want, all the lies, just to get elected. Fuck them all. I want someone that speaks from the heart, off the cuff, honest and blunt. Maybe he will make a mistake, miss speak, but that&#39;s something we all do when we speak candidly, from the heart with emotion. Trump is a rich man, he could retire and live like a king, yet he&#39;s taking on the establishment, the media, and the liberal mindless drones, who are smearing his name. I laughed when trump announced his presidential run, I said look at this clown, what a joke. But just seeing what the media is trying to do to him, listening to him speak honestly has changed the way I look at him. He may not be perfect, that is, unless you&#39;re comparing him to the Clintons, who belong in jail, nothing more nothing less. If trump had cheated in the primaries like Hillary did, believe me, the media wouldn&#39;t stop talking about it, the reason they aren&#39;t is because he won, fair and square, through support from others like him, who love their country and their freedom. I am an immigrant, I&#39;ve lived in Europe, I&#39;ve seen what &quot;those people&quot; are capable of, I&#39;ve also seen multiculturalism work wonderfully, but you can&#39;t force it, those people need to be vetted properly. Plus, America is in the shitter, help your own before you can help others. I could keep going, but I&#39;m guessing your mind and most others is made up one way or another, no matter how many tangible truths come out about Hillarys treason, morons will still say, but Trump said bad words. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to clarify: I don&#39;t think Trump rigged the primaries in his favor. I think whoever may have rigged the democratic primaries in Hillary&#39;s favor rigged the republican primaries in Donald&#39;s favor. The United States is most united when they have someone to hate. The country seems to be uniting around hating, despising Donald Trump. This way when the presidential election is rigged, there will already be a rhetoric of why he lost so hard instilled by the media. If it was a viable candidate, someone like Kasich, then it would be much harder to instill this underlying hatred for a reasonable, moderate candidate, thus making it harder to get away with stealing the election</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen pictures of his rallies compared to hers? How do you explain that? Why do you think the polls show her in the lead, yet she&#39;s had 20k people at her rallies since the first debate and Trump has had over 300k. Why do those numbers not match? Why are all independent media poll show him in a massive lead, then you turn to CNN and she&#39;s in the lead. Who do you think is telling the truth? 
Do you think it&#39;s okay for Hillary to pay millions so people can go online and change the way others think? To influence other people&#39;s minds? Is that okay? Is this the internet you want? Is this the future you want? </p>

<p>The same can be said for Sanders during the primaries.</p>

<p>If she and whoever is behind her had the power to rig the Democratic primaries, they have the power to rig the presidential election and the rhetoric in essentially every media source will justify it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! I realize that! And that is what they are paving the way for by lying about the polls, that way when they declare her the winner, people will say, well we knew it was close(it isn&#39;t). Trump has said that the system is rigged, he is correct. He&#39;s also asked for his supporters to be on the lookout for fraud. At the end of the day, I wish we had the choice to wore for Bernie, Jill, Trump and Hillary... Tally up national votes and name the winner. That is how a real democracy would work, the system is rigged so that those in power can control the outcome. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary is possibly the worst and weakest democratic candidate of all time. Certainly of the modern era.  Democrats always nominate weak, boring, milquetoast candidates.  Kerry, Gore etc...  But Hillary is by far the most absurd.  </p>

<p>She&#39;s widely seen as a liar and corrupt as fuck.  </p>

<p>And she nearly lost to a supposed socialist.  </p>

Hilary winninng is going to be far worse since they though they had a chance with trump. The country is too divided and the other half can&#39;t get behind trump no matter what. Hilary is planning on sweeping this under the rug when she is in and expect a major offensive against the alternative media. They morphed us into this new hated
