       Think about it, every reference in the books that guide the actions of the most powerful regard the masses as sheep that can be easily guided around. Which may be true. However the internet is offering people the chance to wake up. The information is there, available for all, for the first time in human history. If people en masse take advantage of this opportunity by learning and understanding how the people of the world are controlled, and then spreading that information and acting out against the system of control, then it could lead to a wildfire effect that would cause a pushback from a populace in ways that the powers that be would not anticipate. Imagine if they try to distract the public with nonsense, and no one buys it, and everyone keeps their eye on the ball. They would be screwed.

       PSYOP is the number one most effective tool in their arsenal. It works spectacularly well when there's nothing to challenge or expose it, and when their engineered bullshit doesn't have anything to compare it against. That's the reason they got away with indoctrinating and brainwashing the masses for so long. They only had single source delivery for their propaganda: state (government/corporate)-sponsored media. Now with advent of the Internet, you have of amateur and professional investigative people using whatever free-time they have to produce their own journalistic endeavours that reveal facts and evidence. Millions being educated right now having evidence, facts and testimony to evaluate and compare against lies, disinformation and outright fantasy driven agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe you me, if they could go back in time and lock off civilian access to the internet they would do so in a heartbeat. For what they trade off in consumer profiteering pales in contrast to what they lose in the information war. And friends, they have lost this war nearly completely as more hearts and minds are won by the minute with powerful reality and truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since PSYOP is the primary weapon, then once it's methodologies and ruses are exposed then they have lost and will resort to what they know best... brute force upon order, carried out with extreme prejudice (military definition).

       I think this is the truth. I very much doubt this awakening that is happening was part of the plan. I think they just like to dole out technology to the masses to drive consumerism, about 30 years after any military application has worn off or been made obsolete. Only they didn't anticipate that the internet would become so widely-used and now they're having to backtrack by filling to forums with disinformation by paid shills, but it's not really working on  a lot of people.

       No, it was definitely not part of their plan. If it was, they never would have expended the tremendous money, personnel and resources on Operation Mockingbird, MK-ULTRA, Operation CHAOS, the domestic Phoenix Project operations against anti-war and human rights activists, Jonestown and other cult black ops to discover and test ways to control and subjugate and slide people into complacency.

       I know, right? I think technological advancement is out of their hands in some ways, they can be ahead by 20-30 years or whatever, but they cannot put the cat back in the bag once it is out. I think the internet is one of those things. They are doing damage control, and it's becoming very transparent to those who are paying attention. Biggest PR operation in world history, but it's all rearranging deck chairs on the titanic if people keep waking up like they have.

       The fastest way to expose a dictatorship is to make them reveal themselves as one. That is the exact point in which we are at, and that is why we see such bold and reckless criminal behaviour from on high along with outlandish cover-ups and transparent lies exhibited every single day and growing.

       Hm true. The published study that found the US is an oligarchy was a notch on the belt in this regard. They are having to push and contort and bend to get their way, and such a system is not stable because it's too erratic. I think it's just a matter of time until humanity moves on to a new level, because the current system is breaking and people are seeing it in plain sight. We
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to build something better, there's simply no other way to proceed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm scared of most now is an artificial revolution, funded and promoted by a NWO, that will then take power and screw everyone even worse than it is now. However if people wake up to
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       , then I'm not sure what happens then... once power and authority is completely centralized on a global level, then there's no more expansionism to hide behind. You cannot pretend to reinvent a broken system if you cannot give auspices of it ascending to some higher level. If everything is already globalized, then that's not easily possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       is the stuff people really need to be thinking and talking about.

       They would be, and they know this. They also know this goes against human nature. We are a minority. As much as it would be nice if all would do half the research we did, it's not rational or possible.  Humans are humans and will always seek the path of least resistance (get along to get along - stick with the pack). I hate to use memes, but this really sums it up:

       I don't think humans are as futile and stupid as you want to paint them as. I think most people just go with the flow to avoid ruffling feathers, but this isn't stupidity, it's fear. When things get so messed up that fitting in doesn't matter anymore, then that fear will no longer control them. For many, this day is approaching.

       I don't know man, I wouldn't say stupid, just preoccupied with other things and not really caring to know. Some of us (those here - want to know), we seek truth and knowledge. Most don't, for whatever reason. After all the rabbit holes I've been down, it's lonely, and I wish more were here to see it, but it sucks, tbh. To think the world is a lie, is a heavy burden.
      </p>
      <p>
       I talk to my family and friends about this stuff, but I'm not sure I'd wish what I've been through unto them. Which is why people do not seek it. You definitely have to have a mind to accept and understand. Most don't. So, I wouldn't say stupid, I'd say not strong enough (mentally). Humans have always had a leader to "think/do" for them. We on the outside scream, you can do it yourself, if you try. They don't care to listen though, it's easier that way. It's easier to be told what to believe rather than to think/create your own thoughts..

       During times of hardship, maybe 10% will listen.

       I'd agree with that, and hope so. I believe we are in a great awakening. What scares me, is if the pendulum swings in a direction not for truth but despotism... I know human psychology (studied it).

       Well those in power will try and make it swing toward despotism and the informed people will try to swing it toward truth. They will create the despotism to scare the truthtellers. But if no one buys in to it, it won't be enforceable.

       The point is, it's a numbers game. We have to wake up more people than they're lulling to sleep, and I think the early age of the internet, where we are right now, is a golden period of possibility to achieve this.

       Putin_loves_cats paints an overly-pessimistic view, in my opinion. If everyone believed as he does, then the powers that be would be very happy! Everyone would be pacified and feel worthless and have no faith in their fellow man. This is exactly how the powerful want us to feel: powerless. People don't revolt when they feel powerless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your story reflects mine as well, and I think it's quite a common story. After all, none of us would be here on this subreddit if it weren't partially true.

       I'm pessimistic, because I'm 95% sure I've been down more rabbit holes than you, and have studied more (no offense). There is a reason I say what I say (I also have inside knowledge). We are not like normal people. I want to be left alone, and understand the universe. Most don't, most don't care. How is this so hard to understand? Flip it. They don't want people look inwards.... Think about it.

       Again, painting with a super big brush, to try and create a feeling of pessimism and lack of faith in humanity. If you were working for the powers that be, you could not be doing a better job of spreading their emotional messaging.

You're just as diluted as the masses. Think about what you are saying, and what I am. You're an idealist, I get it. I used to be. Until I looked inward. Man... I don't even know..

       So if you're that pessimistic, don't drag everyone else down with you. It's one thing to be realistic, but it's another to be pessimistic and not see any ways out of this mess. If humanity is trying to get itself out of this shit, then don't you think it's best to program others with a message that may actually result in the problem being solved? A realism that offers solutions, instead of a defeated pessimism? Maybe I've read you wrong, but there's really no reason to think humans are just permafucked forever, and reinforcing that idea in others is only making that result all the more inevitable. It is literally what the NWO would want, to make people feel defeated, and on top of it you're an intelligent semi-authority to a lot of people, and so they take what you say very seriously. I just want you to realize that by spreading defeatism on these core issues (that literally cannot be known anyway, I bet people thought the age of kings and queens would never end) that you may be doing a lot of damage, even though you might be thinking you're doing something good. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's be clear here, I'm not talking about foolish unbridled optimism or anything, I'm simply talking about realism. And in reality, there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       many solutions that are workable if the ideas are internalized. And here you waste this golden opportunity of peer to peer communication by reinforcing the media narrative of fear, anxiety, and helpless defeat.
      </p>

       You're just so damn smart and it fucking pisses me off that you don't see this.

       I speak my mind. If people resonate, that is on them. I don't claim to have the answers (and as transparent as you can get), unlike you lot claim to. I don't have shit, but to express views and opinions. That is the difference. I hope you see this. Which is why I probably resonate more than you, which is why you have a stick up your ass about me. It's pretty clear. Hope and change! amirite? Bolsheviks and fuck the elites, amirite? You're misguided. I was there, but then I grew up (and learned to seek within). I hope you do, as well. Think!

       So? Why cry over spilled milk? There are people who
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       care, who simply haven't been exposed to the information yet, because they're young or they haven't had time to explore these ideas in the past. Those people need this information, and this group of people is growing ever-larger. That's all I care about. If people want to spend their lives being deliberately ignorant, then that's their loss. You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only care about the thirsty horses, because they're the only chance there. I've given up on wringing my hands over people who don't care. There is literally nothing to be done there.
      </p>
      <p>
       But those aren't the people on this sub. Those aren't the people we're talking to here. We're talking to people who actually
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       give a fuck, so how about we act like it?

       Im a vet and I thought I was well informed geo politically and such. Definately more than my peers. I started diving deep after i got discharged and it drove me insane. insomnia, manic, and paranoid.  I had to be inpatient for 2 weeks at a mental facility. I wouldnt wish it on anyone. Ignorance is bliss. You cant find anyone to talk to about the truth. family and friends dont want to hear you "conspiracy theories'. One day the truth will reign free and shtf with people going crazy realizing their whole life was controlled and a lie.

       Exactly, look at the actors, but don't you dare think about what's going on behind the curtain. That's what they want. They want people to feel engaged and empowered, while having almost zero actual power. Like when you give your little brother the second controller that isn't plugged in, and you let him "play".
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 320 million Americans holding that second controller, thinking they're playing the game, but they're not. Not at all. The powerful people are.

       Yup, and it's designed to emotionally "hook" people. Talking about "grabbing her by the pussy" is a very emotionally-charged phrase, so a lot of people are drawn to it, not realizing how incredibly insignificant such a thing is in the scheme of things, because they let themselves get swept away by emotions instead of keeping their eye on the ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "emotional sweeping away" is a primary method of control, which is why it's so important to have a good understanding of yourself and your emotions. And perhaps why America has a relatively high IQ but exceptionally low EQ. Our society is engineered so that people fall in to these emotional traps, due to emotional ignorance. Then everyone is easy to manipulate.

       The problem is that everyone stops when they find information they agree with and that supports what they already believe and that is what they have already been told by the controllers.
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't ever asking, why am I being told this, or what is the purpose and never never compare what they believe to what is actually happening around them, around the nation and around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course they are carefully taught to not listen to this one or that one with this label or that ID.
      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of identifying the actual enemy we all slap each other around, and they keep winning.
      </p>

       And remember it is only a thought war, they can't rule without our consent.

       Ghandi and MLK knew guns only kill and and the powerful always have more guns, bigger guns and now all this wonderful technology that we paid to develop means they will always win if the choice is violence.

       REPETITION, plain and simple. Too many people, with money, are still plugged into their T.V.. And T.V. is repetition. All news outlets repeat the same rhetoric. So what gives?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with what you say, but you are really just preaching to the choir. If what you said what put on every news media outlet, twice a day, for even just Monday through Friday next week, imagine the difference in opinion those people would have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this would never happen because it goes against the interest of those already in power. Which, IMHO, would only die out when there supporters become too old and sign their power of attorney to their more intelligent offspring.

       Not really. I know that I am getting conned, but I can't really do anything about it. I know that I cannot rely on the MSM for news, but I do not have any really reliable news source. I also do not have enough time/energy/money to study everything that one would need to in order to piece together the truth.

       It's everyone's job to post 3 times a day on their Facebook, Twitter, or other "normie" social network.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Something about you, to create value for followers who actually care about you. E.g. photo, update, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Something funny and light-hearted, to create value for followers who are barely acquainted with you and don't really care about you. E.g. meme, comic strip, cat, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Something to promote your agenda. E.g. article, graph, video, etc. Very important: Stick to one topic, or a group of very closely related topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you persist with this strategy you
       <strong>
        will
       </strong>
       have an effect on your followers' perception of your topic of choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stick to that one topic, reinforce it every day, and you
       <strong>
        will
       </strong>
       convert people to your view.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people leave dissenting comments, simply "like" the comment, but do not reply. This shows respect for your dissenter, and will keep them and observers warm to your posts. When the dissenter sees your "like," they will invariably return to the post they expose themselves to your persistent viewpoint each time. 
The comment/like activity will also increase the visibility of your agenda.

       They either are or are not powerless, but my point was that powerless people are unable to make a difference. If intelligence is power and intelligent people can make a difference, then certainly I wasn't referring to them or speaking to or about anyone in particular. ;)

       That's why we need evidence-based conspiracy theory.  Or rather 'verifiable history' with credible sources.  (list of confirmed conspiracy theories on right sidebar ==&gt; )  There's nothing more subversive than taking the establishements own 'confessions of fact', tying them together in a way people can easily understand, and then showing people what a demonic system it is that they've created.
      </p>
      <p>
       People love having their mind blown, but they also like having verifiable facts so they can spread the word.  Facts are powerful, and the pen is mighter than the sword.  More powerful than the neutron bomb in fact.  They've always known this and that's why they are scrambling to deploy tens of thousands of fools on social media to control the dialogue through gaslighting and other tricks (4Ds -- 4D's Deny Disrupt Degrade Deceive)

       However the plans also count on our being impoverished. Not just impoverished of material resources, but of time, security, community...
      </p>
      <p>
       Unions as true grassroots political bodies where a group of members could stand to gain representation during a crisis are a thing of the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police brutality keeps people afraid to gather or speak out. Suburban sprawl and the marginalization of public space robs such gatherings of any real cultural impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most of all, the problem is economic. It's wage earning power versus inflation. How does anyone have the
       <em>
        luxury
       </em>
       to take a stand when they work in a right-to-work state and have no pension plan, no 401k, no union representation...
      </p>
      <p>
       Awareness is not the problem. NSA spying is so well known it's a pop culture trope, as is police brutality. Almost everyone I know cares deeply about these issues. No fewer percentage care about these issues than cared about civil liberties in the 60's. But protestors don't make headlines like they did in the 60's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the freethinking community is doing itself a huge disservice by trying to fight this war with ideas. Just look at Bernie. Bernie won hearts and minds. Bernie's platform was America's platform. Friends of mine who have been lifelong Republicans told me early in the primary race that they'd rather have Trump than Hillary, but rather have Bernie than Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of
       <em>
        course
       </em>
       we should keep the stream of education flowing. But more than that, I think it's essential to begin a resource stream. You need community investment. What resources have made representative civil action successful in the past? We need those things back. Unions, or something like them. Meeting places. Lawyers. Sympathetic businesses. Nonprofit entities. Periodicals. The era I would think to look to is the beginning of the Union era. Upton Sinclair, Eugene Debs... how did
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       achieve their goals? Of course,
       <em>
        The Jungle
       </em>
       was an act of raising awareness, but what happened after that? What closed the gap?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what the answers are, but if a community's going to be a community, it's got to start doing things for itself. Starting fair credit unions, microloans for small businesses. Community-subsidized legal assistance for small business, local business, progressive business. The creation of progressive business communities or co-ops that create supply lines and only trade with each other and not with megacorps, the creation of community economies around said businesses
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       is what it will take.

       Anything else is underpants-gnome level inanity.

       Step 1: Awakening!
Step 2: ????
Step 3: Liberation!

       It's not. Going. To work. That way. The average person is not going to give from their limited livlihood and physical and mental energy unless they see that it brings something back to their table. Even if it's just community, companionship, but especially if it's security, stability, resources. We cannot fight them with mind bullets. The rubber has to meet the road.

       Again, painting with a super big brush, to try and create a feeling of pessimism and lack of faith in humanity. If you were working for the powers that be, you could not be doing a better job of spreading their emotional messaging.
