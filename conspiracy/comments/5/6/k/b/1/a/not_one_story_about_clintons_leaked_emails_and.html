       Anything's possible. But I personally feel like everything Clinton is suspected of doing is pretty much par for the course as far as politicians go, especially at that level of power and influence. Hard to disrupt the masses with more of the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not saying any of it is excusable, nor should it be acceptable, but Trump can't go 72 hours without saying something abhorrently inflammatory. Even if our traditional view of "acting Presidential" is based on decades of bullshit, it's still comforting to most Americans that a candidate's public stance isn't filled with off-the-cuff ignorance and vitriol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the entire system need a complete overhaul? Abso-fucking-lutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       But do you think that whatever the fuck Trump is doing is really going to bring about real change? And if so, at what cost?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he's probably the reality of what many politicians truly are when they're not in character; think the Luther/Obama skit from Key n Peele. The only difference is that he's never had to answer to anyone, ever- which includes us, the American people.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I just don't see him changing his blatant disregard for other humans this late in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the wall of text.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  Yes, I know what Correct The Record is, and there probably are people being paid to post pro-Clinton things online. But calling someone names because you don't agree with their perspective seems a bit childish.

       It's just this subreddit, you're pretty spot on. Trump is the most absurd acting presidential candidate I've seen in my lifetime. It's a weird election this year and conspiracy wants to bandwagon things so the culture permeates on random variabilities in things such as up votes.

       Trump is the only thing different in this election. Whether that's for better or worse is not my point here. Hillary is business as usual. People think with her its just another 4-8 years of whatever they're going through.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Trump isn't the politician. The guy is vulgar and successful so its drawn people to him.Plus, people putting down Trump supporters just makes them support him more out of spite.

       If trump supporters get attacked at every corner, both physically or verbally, just for supporting the candidate, the reaction is not spite.

       He's only different because we haven't seen a straight up bigoted racist get so far in society in a long time and it's brought all the others of his ilk out of their holes. When Trump supporters mention being oppressed by others it is because a majority of the population doesn't want to be lead by a person like this. And they abhor the idea of someone propping up this kind of figurehead. They remember their history and what someone like this can do to a country. Maybe we want to stay on the same road because it is familiar and we understand how to navigate it. With someone like Trump at the helm, we'd basically be lost in the woods as he has no moral or idealistic compass. He can only lead us down a dark path and when we all find ourselves lost and alone, he would abandon us and blame his rivals for leading us astray. That is not a president, that is a charlatan, unfortunately for some people, they can't tell the difference.

       No one does and that's what bothers me the most. This man can't be clear at all on his policy, only that he will be a menace as is clear by how he's running his campaign. That's obviously good enough for me and most of the country to not want to vote for him.

       There is no point in arguing with CTR shills. These people can't be reasoned with. They're the kind of scumbags who take money to lie to people's faces.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were up to me, we'd round up every last person who took a check from CTR. Then we'd slit their tongues down the middle so that they can't speak and cut their fingers off so they can't type anymore.

       I'm not denying shills, they've been around for a long time, and I'm actually glad people finally listened, even if it was just because Clinton.

       The only reason i give trump my time of day is because he has held true on trade deals, specifically the upcoming TPP. i have strong feeling that's why the dems snaked bernie out of the nomination, he was against the TPP also. Hillary blatantly flip flopped on the matter for the sole reason to get votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the only reason hillary is really running is to make sure the TPP goes through from obamas hands. Trump and bernie have been dead against it  and therefor have been on the losing side to the presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Big money is behind the TPP and because of that hillary is probably going to win. She will see the deal go through with a smile on her face, yet another flip flop of a policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the dems were serious about anything else other than the TPP then they would have welcomed bernie to be the nominee.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, and maybe the anti islamification of the western culture is my only two reasons trump would have been the better candidate. His crass characteristics dont mean anything much to me in comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a shame the majority of the voting population dont realize how many horrible policies hillary has been behind in the middle east which resulted in the death and displacement of millions of innocent muslims. Trump has not gone any where near the evil that hillary has carried out.

       100% this. Initially I supported Bernie Sanders and then Gary Johnson, I even donated $125 to him but I stopped supporting Gary Johnson when he said he would sign the TPP and Bill Weld kept talking about how great Clinton is. So now I'm voting for Trump because I think Clinton will find a way to steal the election like she did with Sanders even if Trump legitimately wins.

       You say Trump has held true in trade deals...but all he's done is talk.  He's never been in any public office, so he doesn't have a record to run on.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in his business life he's made a career out of crawfishing on deals big and small--his word is garbage.  What makes you think he'll change his method as president?

       Broadly and briefly: he ran for president as a pure profit-making venture, and was surprised as anyone that he gained traction purely through bumper sticker jingoism and a limited vocabulary grounded in authoritarian strength.  He became an enabler of racists, sexists, and white nationalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       In comparison to Hillary, Trump has all of her neoliberal negatives in terms of foreign and domestic policy, combined with a truly bizarre set of quirks/flaws and a sheer lack of knowledge that would be extremely damaging for the world.

       Do you think if he were elected he would not try to really play the game with caution and become alot more "presidential" in his decision making? I think a lot of his political characteristics so far have been to gain popularity.. like "build the great wall and make mexico pay for it" type things. I wouldnt think he would maintain this loose lipped unpredictable type of show if he were to get the job. 
Thats only my 2 cents tho. I dont really know.

       Truly, nobody knows for sure.  But I'm confident that there's no hidden, presidential Trump waiting to emerge.  If there was, we'd have met him by now.  In fact, much of the media fascination with him was "when is he going to start running for president and stop running for the GOP nomination?"  The answer appears to be "never."

       Wouldn't alot of his policies have to pass through congress to get traction also? So even if he got in and had some far out ideas he couldn't exactly pull them off without any sort of process of voting it through?

He has only been in politics bssically this election cycle and hasnt been in a position to do any trade deals. My comment was about his STANCE on the TPP and the fact he would be against it.

       They attack him over things that are true but not really his fault. Like the housing thing where colored families were stamped. Thats how some of our country operated at the time. All of these pocket communities and gated communities really only wanted certain types of people there. And it meant making money to provide them that.

       Just little things like that I feel people cling to and its unfortunate they've convinced themselves hes some kind of modern Hitler. But its no surprise since most people are compared to him at some point.

       My theory is that Trump is clowning on purpose to throw us into the arms of clinton (as a country) and that clinton will carry on with status quo for the oligarchs - she is an evil POS, but Trump is doing this so he will benefit from Clinton once she is POTUS
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sure you watch the documentary called Clinton Cash, which details the corruption of the clintons - and it is apropos given the haiti suffering from the hurricane -- as in the doc, they talk about the clintons profiting off haiti's eathquake in 2010

       We know he is absurd. That is why he was selected by Hillary and the DNC

       At the same time the DNC was rigging their own primaries against Bernie Sanders they were were also getting the MSM to give Trump extra airtime and tell their viewers to take him seriously.

       Morning Joe also stopped telling their viewers that the DNC was rigged after DWS and Luis Miranda told Chuck Todd and Phil Griffin (president of MSNBC) to stop.

       We also know from James Comey that Hillary lied to voters about her email server. And we know from Robert Reich that Hillary will support the TPP.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while Trump may have shit for policy, the DNC cheated their own party by not telling them the truth or holding Hillary accountable, and they propped up the opponent they want us to vote against. That is political extortion.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        tl;dr: I will vote Trump unless Hillary and Kaine drop out, and if you vote for them you don't give a shit about our democracy or the power of the people.

       I agree Hillary is a much better actor than Trump, but that's because he behaves honestly while Hillary behaves the way she thinks the public wants to see.

      <p>
       Now you're just trying to sound smarter than you really are.  Your statement here is just plain nonsense. If you want to see a culture that permeates on random variabilities visit
       <del>
        r/HillaryforPOTUS
       </del>
       r/politics and see how they circle jerk on non presidential issues such as Trump's reality TV show.  See how the Hillary shills in that sub take to real issues such as glass steagal, embassy deaths due to her poor decision making, avoiding criminal charges, being in bed with big money, having Obama lie to protect her, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I'm not saying Trump is a great choice.  His economic policy resembles Reagan's trickle down policy and we know that doesn't work.  His life of being CEO, of being in charge, may have a negative impact when it comes to listening to advisers.   Most of all, many of his supporters are unreasonable, blowhard idiots filled with racist remarks.  Just visit r/theDonald.  I really don't want to empower his supporters with a Trump victory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way we're fucked.  Biggest problem in this country though isn't the presidential candidates.  It's the masse's dismissive attitude concerning their chosen party.  Then there's people like you that think they can say nothing, permeate nonsense while appearing articulate.  Please.  Enough of the bullshit already.  The Democrats and Republicans are both shit parties filled with corrupt people- they are of the same breed.  Keep ignoring this fact and we will get shit candidates every four years.

       Maybe he is referring to this?
      </p>
      <p>
       “Obama Administration officials, including the Secretary of State, learned almost in real time that the attack in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Rather than tell the American people the truth, the administration told one story privately and a different story publicly.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Rep. Peter Roskam (IL-06) released the following statement regarding these findings:
      </p>
      <p>
       “In the days and weeks after the attacks, the White House worked to pin all of the blame for their misleading and incorrect statements on officials within the intelligence community, but in reality, political operatives like Ben Rhodes and David Plouffe were spinning the false narrative and prepping Susan Rice for her interviews.”

       If you define "actual charities not controlled by the Clintons" as "programmatic grants," then it appears the number is 15%, with 85% staying with the foundation itself:
      </p>
      <p>
       Between 2009 and 2012, the Clinton Foundation raised over $500 million dollars according to a review of IRS documents by The Federalist (2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008). A measly 15 percent of that, or $75 million, went towards programmatic grants. More than $25 million went to fund travel expenses. Nearly $110 million went toward employee salaries and benefits. And a whopping $290 million during that period — nearly 60 percent of all money raised — was classified merely as “other expenses.” ...The Clinton Foundation may well be saving lives, but it seems odd that the costs of so many life-saving activities would be classified by the organization itself as just random, miscellaneous expenses.

      </p>
      <p>
       The problem here is not one of facts or accuracy, but ideology. Jacobson simply doesn’t like the implications of the fact that the Clinton Foundation spent less than 10 percent of its budgets on charitable grants in 2013. He doesn’t like the fact that the two single largest “charitable” initiatives of the Clinton Foundation — by its own admission — are the Clinton Presidential Library, which exists solely to put a positive spin on the 42nd president’s term in office, and the Clinton Global Initiative, which the New York Times characterized as a “glitzy annual gathering of chief executives, heads of state, and celebrities.” If hanging out with celebrities at glitzy dinners is the height of charity, then it’s time to beatify the Kardashian sisters.

       Maybe because the links are fucked. The first one is the site's page for March, 2015 and a quick search for 'Clinton' found nothing. The second link is 404.

       Thanks for providing actual, live links that contradict what these morons are citing as fact from some hack with The Federalist.

       Sad that the RNC chairman would say something so obviously false. Not surprising, just sad. It's true that if you repeat a lie often enough it will be believed. Especially by those who lack the capacity for critical, independent thought.

       No, you see, a shill has to be paid. What do you call a young white man with absolutely no social life or loved ones, who willingly spends all of his free time defending Donald Trump with a noxious enthusiasm? He's no shill, he gladly wastes his time on this lost cause for free!

       Honestly, if you think that defense sounded even

       Well, given talking about Clinton isn't remotely something I do often, I apologize if words somehow don't seem "natural" to you due to your confirmation bias. I'm not by any means a fan of Hillary; I was Bernie all the way. But, that doesn't mean I demonize everyone else, and believe that lying about them is ok. The reality is The Clinton Foundation does put around 88% of the money they receive into charitable works. The 15% (ish) number that gets tossed around is what they give in grants to
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       organizations, not what they spend on charitable actions
       <em>
        total
       </em>
       .

       Have you even, for the briefest of moments, considered that this has nothing to do with some organized CTR conspiracy brigading hundreds of threads in real time, and that maybe, just maybe, there are enough people who legitimately find Trump so abhorrent that 15 of them would down vote you and also share their thoughts on you comment?

       No, because that's the real world, and people on The-Donald use the forum to talk about Trump anonymously, because they know they'd lose all their friends if they were actually open about being a trump supported. Lol. I feel

       So 1, you don't answer the actual question, good job dumbass.  2, you're so paranoid in your own life, you have to see how old my account is, and it can't be the most reasonable explanation right.  It can't be that I simply decided to start a new account, it must be that I"m some conspirator of CTR, whatever the fuck that is.  God you are stupid.  Show proof Clinton lied to the FBI.  Fox news doesn't count dipshit. Live in reality.  Sources need to be unbiased and corroborated. Look up that word if you need to.

       Stealing from charities isn't as bad as stealing from Social Security, Education, and Veterans Aid by not paying taxes.  Oh and don't forget that Trump has to be reminded by the media that the money he raised for charity actually has to go to said charity.

       What kind of psychosocial problem do you have, that forces you to believe there is some giant conspiracy theory by Clinton supporters to just bridge an online website. Lol. That would almost be as crazy as a giant gathering of people who make up fake news stories and try to start drama out of nothing to get attention and be edgy. Oh wait, that exact thing exists on Reddit at

       I have never once in my life said I have supported Clinton.  She is a different breed of crazy but to me Trump's crazy is worse.  And because I am being attacked for a belief I am going to openly say that I am both voting for any candidate who won their nomination.   And yes my vote won't mean anything.  Maybe if we are lucky Trump wins the election just to show how frustrated our country is with our broken political system.

       He is obviously one of the these traitors that work together with the chinese to create the hoax. Would you allow a known conspirator with the chinese to continue his work?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously: Pretty much all of the environmental work is funded by some public institutions. If you have someone that thinks it is all bullshit and a big hoax there is a good reason to believe that he will work to remove funding from as many projects as possible. Depending on where he works there is a good chance to lose his job without federal government funding.

       It would make things assuredly tougher. Trump believes that environmental regulations limit private businesses, so he would try to reduce the requirements. Those requirements, regulatory in nature, are what keeps me billable (permits, mitigation, environmental assessments, etc.) and keep the company I work for going. If he does that and cuts funding for environmental protection through the government, I would have no work.

       You underestimate the importance of large environmental firms. They pave the way for countless small businesses to compete for work they would otherwise be incapable of completing (some contracts require small women owned business involvement). They employ civil engineers, construction departments, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just environmental scientists. In fact, I would say environmental consulting firms incorporate more employees that aren't directly experienced in environmental work.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, for some work on a navy installation, our contracting group hired a small company to complete almost the entirety of the work (often called pass through). The effects of reducing environmental compliance is far reaching, not even including the environmental base argument of saving the world.

       Good joke. That's why it works so good in countries like china or in the past in any other country.

      <p>
       Polluting the environment is really cheap for companies if the country doesn't force them to pay for it. Just take a look at any oil company and what they do in third-world countries. And every other company isn't better just under stricter regulations. Without the government supporting the necessary work there is no way to do 90% of it.

       Force regulations on countries that want to import is a way better way. If they produce for the western market they either have to follow the regulations worldwide or face tariffs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution for too few regulations is not less regulations. And most won't come back without higher tariffs or worse regulations than the 3rd world countries. The wages will always be lower there and shipping is extremely cheap.

       That's a simplistic view in my opinion. You can't force regulations on these companies because they have essentially become an integral part of the law making process through lobbying. It's a very difficult situation, and I don't know how to realistically address it.

       Hillary voted 2x for the Iraq war.  She's gone into Libya and Syria and now we're selling arms to the Saudi's and helping them bomb Yemen.  We are fighting with Al Queda and helping them in Syria.  We allowed ISIS to get billions worth of arms and equipment.  Obama won't tell us what the hell is up in Syria, what the F we are doing there, and what our objective is.  He's droned so many families that we have guaranteed conflict for the next generation.  Hillary and Obama's (and Bush's) actions in the Middle East have led to this massive refugee crisis which is doing SIGNIFICANT harm to all sides.  Status quo is a load of shit.

       Everyone voted for the Iraq War except for a handful of people in Congress. Because Bush and Cheney sold lies to the public and to Congress.

       We are in the Middle East because of Bush, but we've also been there since far before Bush. To blame any of this on Clinton or Obama is reaching. The only way Obama/Clinton could have avoided you blaming them for this, is for them to have withdrawn completely from the Middle East and not taken any actions whatsoever.

       Except for a handful of people???  Why didn't
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       vote for it?  Were they mistaken somehow?  Or did they know that Presidents (except Kennedy) are always lying us into wars?
      </p>
      <p>
       All Hillary does is lie.  As Secretary of State, all she did was covert arms dealing and operations in the Middle East - which Bush
       <em>
        had no part in
       </em>
       , including the Benghazi disaster - which she subsequently lied about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, Bush and others started it.  But that's a childish argument.  Obama likes to drone because he thinks it's intelligent and cool, not the cowboy way to do things.  He has done all sorts of covert things throughout Syria.  But he explains none of this to us.  He agreed to an arms deal with the Saudi's and is helping them bomb Yemen!  And Hillary is a warmonger that would make any neocon proud.  And he made her his Secretary of State.
      </p>
      <p>
       And neocons are virtually en masse supporting Hillary.  Google it.  Ask yourself why (and give yourself an honest answer).  Now she's messing with Russia.  WHY???  Gotta have an enemy.  Gotta have a reason for imperial overreach.  She was on the Armed Services subcommittee from 2003-09.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a fan of Bush or Trump, and Bush lied and made huge errors.  But to say that Hillary isn't a liar and warmonger is BS.

       No, they were all voting for the Iraq War because they believed there was intelligence proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and were planning to use them on the US. That's not me making excuses, that's historical fact.

       I am voting for trump this election season. I understand that he says polarizing shit. But my big ticket items are trade and staying out of unnecessary wars. Trump is a noninterventionist and against TPP. I know Hillary is supposedly against TPP now, but I don't believe her. She's proven to be very hawkish in her foreign policy and she is pro-NAFTA. Those two things make it impossible for me to vote for her.

       Yup, blowing up Iranian gunboats and handing out nukes to currently non nuclear nations in geopolitical hot spots... yup going to work great. Also can you enlighten me as to the actual content of trumps trade policy other than that he is magically going summon manufacturing jobs to America? Does he plan on stating trade wars and putting tariffs in place? Who in his brain trust of Giuliani, pence, Carson, Christi,Kelly Ann or oemerosa is going to come up with this amazing trade policy? Idk know if trump has the ability to put together the 1000s of people needed to run the executive let alone develop revolutionary economic policy.

       Oh, absolutely. If I were working in PsyOps, I'd be ecstatic. You can convince low-information voters that they're actually conspiracy-minded geniuses, send them en masse in to conspiracy forums to willingly brigade the conversations there and steer all discussion away from whatever awful thing you're trying to keep from being exposed.

       One of the first DNC emails Guccifer 2.0 leaked outlined their strategy to undermine the strongest republican candidate and prop up the weakest candidate. This was the same email that many people pointed to, that they said proved that the DNC was for Clinton all along. I am having trouble finding the imgur link though. The Bernie thing was probably a distraction from what the DNC really didn't want you to figure out.
      </p>

       This strategy has been wildly successful and it has been really frustrating to watch.

       Yep - and it makes sense. It's game theory. Clinton has been prepping for this moment for decades. She was thrown for a loop when Obama (who ran a transformative campaign, regardless of how you feel about his administration) beat her in 2008 and likely realized this was her last chance to become President and - given there was a weak field of candidates for the GOP and an increasingly divided electorate between alt-right, religious right, old school businesses guys, etc. - backed the weakest horse in that race. If I were a GOP voter I'd be livid that the hustle worked so well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if Trump is working FOR Clinton. Likely he has his own aims (Trump News Network, IMO) but he didn't imagine he'd be this successful. Now he has no choice but to run - which is why you hear that he offered Kasich the VP nod promising the responsibilities of President without the title.

       Hey, I repeated this further down the thread, but I wanted you to receive this message.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the first DNC emails Guccifer 2.0 leaked outlined their strategy to undermine the strongest republican candidate and prop up the weakest candidate. This was the same email that many people pointed to, that they said proved that the DNC was for Clinton all along. I am having trouble finding the imgur link though. The Bernie thing was probably a distraction from what the DNC really didn't want you to figure out.
      </p>
      <p>
       This strategy has been wildly successful and it has been really frustrating to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC controlled media propped up Trump, holding back all the controversy until it was too late to choose another candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be really grateful if someone could find this original email.

       I've been telling people this whole election that trump endorsed Hillary and gave her campaign funds in 08. They are friends. I could see him rising to the top, taking the Republican nom, and then making an ass out of himself to help his very wealthy friend that would surely compensate him for it. After she wins and time down the road in an interview I bet you will hear him say that Hillary was better prepared and most fit to hold office and the right person won the election. He will go back to being her friend publicly. This whole election process has just been a way to squeeze her in because she can't win any other way

       Since we're talking theory here, I don't think he was actually meant to win the primary. He was just supposed to get enough support that when anyone else running won, he was supposed to cast off as an independent and draw enough voters away from the Republican nominee to guarantee a Clinton victory. He was supposed to split the party votes in the general. I think both Trump and Clinton were both surprised that he took the primary and had to adjust accordingly.

       I have been saying this for months!  With how clearly unprepared Trump is in terms of policy and governmental understanding, coupled with the inflammatory remarks he comes out with on a daily basis, I have wondered just how much HRC has shelled out to Trump to hand her the election.

       The Clinton's and Trump do go like 30 years back.  I'm surprised with all the leaks no ones found something like Trump donating to the Clinton Foundation, or the Clinton's donating to Trump U.  Or maybe a tape from a Jeffrey Epstein party where Bill and Trump are Eiffel Towering some 12 year old girl.

       But maybe they've never been that 'close' and were just tolerating each other up until this election cycle, and they finally took the gloves off.  Who knows?  Assumption is the mother of all mistakes...

       Thing is that he has gone 72 hours with staying on message and not shooting himself in the foot with saying dumb things. The Clinton campaign had this recent 10+ year old footage in archive just waiting for something big to come out against Hillary so they could feed and maintain focus on Trump.

       To be fair, there has been a lot said about his lack of plans and the infeasibility of the ones he does produce.  The problem is Trump knows he would get ripped to shreds if people argued against his lack of plans so he sees it as being less harmful to have people think he's an asshole than to think he's and idiot.  That is why he floods the media with this shit that he spews.  90% of the time it is him trying to distract from his lack of capability to actually run a country and would rather the conversation be about his imflammatory nature so that he can write it off as campaign mud slinging rather than actual political vetting. The other 10% of the time it is well timed shit posting by Clinton campaign or media that realizes he cannot be president.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's where trumps actually quite successful in this campaign, is his gamble on the asshole vs idiot dilemma.  He has built a solid base that actually likes that he is an asshole and anything he says will just further endear them to him.  The problem is, it's successful enough to win him the nomination but not enough to win the election.  Because the percentage of people who like that he's an asshole is like 25-30% then he gets another 15% who are party loyalists/"Hillary is the devil"ists and that's his ceiling.  The reason he can't go higher than that is because that gamble on the asshole vs idiot has back fired with the other 55-60% of us who ended up seeing him as not just one or the other, but as both an asshole and an idiot. The reason the election is close is because not all 55-60% that sees trump as unfit, is willing to vote for Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if any of that didn't make sense, I'm half asleep and ranting.  Not necessarily trying to take a stance for one candidate or the other, even though it's probably clear.  I just wanted to make a point that people have tried to report on his lack of ability to run our country, but trump has successfully changed the conversation to something he sees as less harmful, with a little help from Clinton and the media.

       The Bushes have been against Trump this whole time. They know that not publicly endorsing him helps Hillary, aka they've already been helping her. That's why it's not difficult to come to the conclusion that it is in fact true that they've had that tape a while. Maybe you should pay a little more attention yourself.

      <p>
       However, you didn't seem to be able to pay attention to this very thread - what does that say about you? And you theories?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: for avoidance of doubt, pulling shit out of your ass doesn't even count as a conspiracy theory. Some things are not even coincidences, but just happenstance. Come back when you have a shred of evidence that the Bush family are helping Hillary and that Billy Bush produced the tape as part of that effort.

       The Bushes publicly saying "Don't vote for Trump" is clearly saying they would rather Hillary win. There's no conspiracy about that, it's just common fucking sense. I guess it is my fault for assuming you had even the most basic of logic though.

       I don't know what to say to you; politics is a game of strategy. My thesis would be that the entire Democratic party - including the campaign team - is repelled by Trump. One new piece of information isn't going change much. But releasing it a week after you get it, to maximise the damage - that seems to me to be smart and perfectly ethical campaign management.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, of course, it's only the most strenuous of speculation that i) the team has anything to do with it and ii) if they did, that they didn't release it at the earliest practical point.

       The Trump story leaked first and was followed by the Wikileaks email dump. Maybe the real conspiracy is that Assange tried to reduce the damage on Trump?

       It is disappointing that Wikileaks has exclusively tried attacking Clinton. I understand why Assange has a personal vandetta against her but It should be an unbiased source for information we normally wouldn't get. The video released on Trump should have been from Wikileaks.

       His previous inclinations are not within the beaurocracy.  If he held an official seat, then it'd be something released.  Wiki leaks has said before that they don't like to go through civilian materials unless it pertains to an office holder.  This material especially has nothing to do with Wiki leaks like material.

       Looks like they bumped that funding up a lot lately. I'm surprised more reddit users aren't up in arms about this shit. You would also think the admins would have done something by now too, I guess they're letting their own politics get in the way of making the right decisions.

       Millennials do not like Clinton, yet somehow on reddit the stupidest shit in support of her makes the front page everyday. This one of the largest instances of astroturfing I've ever seen.

       Do you have any rebuttal to the actual data presented? Perhaps to this part?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate. According to an analysis of roll call votes by Voteview, Clinton’s record was more liberal than 70 percent of Democrats in her final term in the Senate. She was more liberal than 85 percent of all members. Her 2008 rival in the Democratic presidential primary, Barack Obama, was nearby with a record more liberal than 82 percent of all members — he was not more liberal than Clinton."

       Clinton is absolutely liberal. If you think Clinton is a conservative, you know literally nothing about politics. I'm confused how you'd even think she's remotely close to conservative? At best she's a moderate liberal. Please explain how she's conservative when all her stances lean left? Sanders was an extremist, Clinton is liberal. You must be knew to politics, which makes sense because this is probably the first election you've paid attention to. It also solidifies how you'll believe anything, when almost all of those links have already been discredited by others.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes, it is time to "assassinate your character" (who the fuck says that?) because you're a wannabe edgelord who doesn't actually understand politics, but wants to support the candidate who is "off-the-cuff." At any rate, Donald won't win or even come close, so there's nothing to truly worry about in the long run.

       You know that saying " If everyone you meet is an asshole, you're probably the asshole". Yea swap asshole with idiot and that's you bud.
      </p>
      <p>
       How the fuck do you think clinton is even the slightest bit liberal? Honestly, I'm dumbfounded here. Sanders was the only liberal in the election. You don't like him though so now he's an extremist right?  Atleast you CTR shills are consistent with character assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me correct the record here. I'm old enough to be your father, I've probably voted in more elections than you've been alive to see. And to cap it all off, you acting like a child who doesn't get his way is certainly not going to sway anyone to vote for hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll let you get back to being beat by dad or whatever the fuck else is going on that's feeding your serious mental issue.

       Wow. The fact you started off by resorting to calling me retarted made me stop reading your post. If you have to call someone retarded in the second paragraph, you clearly don't have a real argument. Feel free to comment or message me when you've calmed down and become more rational though!

       P.S. The irony in your comment, especially the comment about the edgy 14 year old, is unreal. It's like you just type, and read back what you wrote later.

       No, I just don't need to respond to your post when you don't even write about politics. Really quickly, just to shit you down, you know literally nothing about politics saying Hillary isn't liberal. Here are two links for you to look at, and I have 5 more in the chamber if you'd like them too.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, knowing you, you'll link to DailyMail to refute it, or just call me retarded or other insults to make yourself feel better.

       lol. You're insulting Washington Times and OntheIssues? Oh boy. No wonder you follow the sources you do. You are so thick skulled it's borderline sad. I just gave you three major sources saying she's liberal and you're still denying it. Bernie sanders was a progressive socialist, and If you think he's the blueprint for "liberal" it explains everything. I'm sorry dude, but I'm gonna move on with my day. You obviously don't even
       <em>

       to understand how politics actually work, and I just need to respect that and let you vote how you please. Fortunately,
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald

       and republican newspapers/forums are literally the only places saying that Trump has a chance, so it'll just be a few more months of election talk.

       Destabilizing the middle east has pretty much been us policy for the last 50 years. I mean, the Iranian revolution had us backing. Iran-iraq war, same deal, Afghanistan vs Soviets, bunch of terrorists in countries we don't support. Backing the Israelis which Pisses everyone else off. Bombing suspected terrorists that are hiding in hospitals... you name it, it's been happening for the last 50 years easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is status quo for US policy in the middle east. Sure Clinton supports it but it's hardly new. And Trump would support it too, because it's what the military industrial complex wants and any president who would act against them wouldn't be around very long.

       Except there is no proof that there were breaches of national security and the FBI explicitly said that. What she did was stupid, and her staff was stupid, but there was no evidence anything bad happened. It could have, and showed poor judgment by a grandma who didn't want to go through the trouble of learning technology better.

       Clinton Emails on Libya Expose The Lie of ‘Humanitarian Intervention’

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Probably the most revealing email is dated March 30, 2011, just 11 days into the NATO bombing campaign which would go on until October, 20, when Qaddafi was finally murdered (after being sodomized).
        <strong>
         In this email (C05782459), entitled “Win this War,” Clinton’s closest adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, makes it clear that, in terms of the continuing reasons for the war, any “humanitarian motive offered is limited, conditional and refers to a specific past situation.” In other words, while NATO would go on bombing for another 7 months, Blumenthal is already admitting that there is really no humanitarian basis for continuing the conflict.

       Exposing the Libyan Agenda: A Closer Look at Hillary Clinton's Emails
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Qaddafi's government holds 143 tons of gold, and a similar amount in silver.... This gold was accumulated prior to the current rebellion and was intended to be used to establish a pan-African currency based on the Libyan golden Dinar. This plan was designed to provide the Francophone African Countries with an alternative to the French franc (CFA). In a "source comment," the original declassified email adds
        </strong>
        :
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Qaddafi's threatened attempt to establish an independent African currency was not taken lightly by Western interests. In 2011, Sarkozy reportedly called the Libyan leader a threat to the financial security of the world. How could this tiny country of six million people pose such a threat? First some background
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It is banks, not governments, that create most of the money in Western economies, as the Bank of England recently acknowledged. This has been going on for centuries, through the process called "fractional reserve" lending. Originally, the reserves were in gold.  In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt replaced gold domestically with central bank-created reserves, but gold remained the reserve currency internationally.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1944, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were created in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to unify this bank-created money system globally. An IMF ruling said that no paper money could have gold backing. A money supply created privately as debt at interest requires a continual supply of debtors; and over the next half century, most developing countries wound up in debt to the IMF. The loans came with strings attached, including "structural adjustment" policies involving austerity measures and privatization of public assets.
       </p>
       <p>
        After 1944, the US dollar traded interchangeably with gold as global reserve currency. When the US was no longer able to maintain the dollar's gold backing, in the 1970s it made a deal with OPEC to "back" the dollar with oil, creating the "petro-dollar."  Oil would be sold only in US dollars, which would be deposited in Wall Street and other international banks.

       Not really. The stuff that was ALLOWED to be leaked isn't what she's in trouble for. The problem is she had top secret info that 
1 she shouldn't have had
2 is very sensitive information 
And 3 was stored improperly, in securely, and illegally.

       Wtf are you talking about? Wikileaks shot its load and it just sort of ended up being a dribble rather than the geyser promised. We're talking about her speeches in which she pretty much advocates single payer health care, calls herself a moderate, and says she needs Wall Street's help to fix Wall Street. Btw, what is an allowed leak? Are you saying that Clinton controls what gets leaked? If that's the case, why leak anything or even intimate that there's something to be leaked?

       The point isn't to rely on others for that information, but to have the desire to find that information yourself, and for this specific topic - which has been discussed at length, time and time again on this subreddit - it's not very hard to do some light digging.

       Google clinton body count. Kind of too coincidental that that many of your contacts commit suicide with 2 different guns. In the back of the head. One guy even killed himself and then stuffed himself in a duffel bag, padlocked it and then got in the bathtub. Lmfao any of us would be sitting on death row due to circumstantial evidence.

       It's the worst kind of conspiracy. Somebody makes a wild accusation, people who want it to be true yell about it like it's true. Meanwhile a cursory read on any of the incidents basically boils down to "someone died who knew the Clintons, so obviously they had them assassinated".

       Reddit, Inc. (owned by media giant Condé Nast) can censor whatever they choose, freedom of speech doesn't apply. Similarly they can work with their brown-nosing volunteer mods to censure and shadowban individuals, groups, whomever they wish.

       The fact is, reddit is a mirror of the MSM.  The MSM, super pacs, and powerful groups are all colluding to dig up as much dirt about Trump as they possibly can.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, all of hillary's dirt is turned a blind eye to, and the new dirt that continues to float to the surface, well, that's ignored as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you imagine for one moment if the media came after Hillary the way they have come after Trump?  There is videos of hillary laughing about beating down a raped 12 year old girl and defending the sadistic rapist she knew was guilty, videos of her laughing about killing people, ordering deaths, and so much more scandalous information about her that is all being ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can imagine if the media got a few checks written by the Clinton Foundation, like they did for Trump?  Or talked about the conflict of interest with her Foundation, like they have with Trump and his tax returns?
      </p>
      <p>
       The playing field is not fate, Clinton's got her thumb on the scale, and we are witnessing another Bernie incidence.  This time it's Trump.

       As I mentioned in another reply, anything's possible. I wasn't posting to support Clinton, only to explain why people are probably more adamantly opposed to what Trump is doing/saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of Americans already see our politicians as corrupt, so what Clinton has done isn't that far of a stretch from what her predecessors have done. E.g. Bush going to war based on what appeared to be lies in hindsight; Obama giving guns to Mexican cartels, and letting the NSA run wildly unchecked even though he ran on a platform of "transparency".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to think all politicians who commit these types of offenses would receive the same legal consequences as regular citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, that's not how our society works.

       I agree with you. But the fact that your semi-apologetic post makes it to the top (and is guilded no less - why, I don't know) raises my suspicion that this is driven by shills. Also adding to my suspicions is that we know Clinton employs social propaganda techniques, and Reddit management is heavily supporting her. It is clear that Reddit has itself become a major propaganda tool.

       The rational argument to counter this, is trump will do with america, exactly what he has done with trump industries. At the best cost he can negotiate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump industries is a multinational corporation, that is solely ran by Trump's decision making. It has out lasted multiple decades of false and outright criminal trade deals, done working contracts with every nation on the planet, and has likely bailed out america itself, when we were in periods of financial ruin. 
That is what made the Trump name so Important. He is known for his experience, and ability to buy, trade, and sign when the time is right. Taking as few losses as possible, and sometimes coming back with very little to start over with.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to realize that for nearly 2 decades, the clinton obama bush regime bankrupted our nation, and accepted payments for our now cowering positions. Trading our honor and security for condos, and limo's. Cnn is paid off. That is a huge red flag...
      </p>
      <p>
       If a News agency is openly committing fraud it goes on to show that america is on the verge of complete system failure. 
That is the effective position our nation is showing abroad. That we as a nation are so corrupt, our media itself is in full swing panic mode trying to "Forcibly" steer an election into "choosing" the Liar that will keep it all together.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are built and now living on lies. Despicable ones, that those in charge will do anything to keep in the dark. 
Trump is the one thing showing the world right now how corrupt the world is.
      </p>
      <p>
       He isn't making himself look like an ass. The media is. Because they themselves are corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       That became obvious when obama repelled the media propaganda act in 2013. (to lie about the fukushima, and libya catastrophies).

       I also think that Reddit is more of a centre left leaning website in terms of politics,especially during this election cycle. Maybe it would be more evenly balanced if the Republican candidate wasnt so far to the right.

        Even if our traditional view of "acting Presidential" is based on decades of bullshit, it's still comforting to most Americans that a candidate's public stance isn't filled with off-the-cuff ignorance and vitriol.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here's the thing. "Acting presidential" is a myth, one literally created by clinton's campagin team during the 1990s. Politicans are people, they say stupid shit, they do stupid shit. It's only with the advent of mass media invading every facet of our life that it suddenly becomes a big deal for someone to say something that every other american in the country has said at some point in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president is not suppose to be a world leader, or a diplomat. He's not suppose to be some charismatic god-king that brings hope or change. He's not suppose to be someone who knows all or sees all or has all the answers. He's suppose to be the guy nobody likes. The guy that sits alone, reading legislation that the retards in congress have cobbled together and makes sure it doesn't become an actual law it if its too god damn stupid or blatantly against the country's best interests. The celebrity of the office is entirely artificial and frankly, it's unacceptable.

       CTR took over that sub. Just look at the mods post history. There was also a mod with an account that was only three months old. How does such a new account get mod to a subreddit with over 3,000,000 subscribers?

       Is there a way we can have someone offer up big bucks to a mod for these reasons and have it documented?  Obviously this person won't pay the money for the account, but just to prove it can be done.  Not that anyone is doubting that it can happen, but just to have proof of it.

       A healthy off the books donation in Reddit Platinum™ certainly helps, for those moments when you need...whatever it is...to disappear altogether. At the end of the day I'm here to distract myself, looking at cat pics and stuff, occasionally I'll hit paydirt for magical internet points, but by and large I venture 90% of everyone here is blowing off steam.

       So McLuhan was right, but the BEST part about this particular medium, is you can

       <a href="/r/politics">

       The Soviet Union learned early when it came to spys/moles you never pay them unless you are desperate. Its better if you develop spys who work for free because they support your ideology. They paid very few and only American or Europeans who where in extreme positions of importance would typically get paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really doubt any mod is getting paid they are doing it because they are true believers. Never underestimate the ability of people to sell out their responsibility like modding a forum for no cash at all.

       In a conventional sense, no. His main appeal to people up until a couple months ago was his unwillingness to fall into the conventional campaign model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Initially he was calling out every political figure for what they were, money whores. He flat out said he could buy almost everyone who was running. He started steamrolling the primaries because people are tired of the BS and we're rallying around him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's only in the past few months that his handlers have gotten ahold of him and toned him down. It started happening when all the shake ups in his campaign started happening. I'd be willing to bet a bunch of talking heads from the RNC established themselves within his circle and since then he's been floundering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going out there and hitting middle of the road talking points is something political legacies like HRC is great at, not Trump. He's allowed himself to be put on the defensive by pandering to the Republican Party and it's biting him in the ass. Instead of saying fuck you to all these people, he bent over for their endorsement and now their jumping ship to make him look week. He does much better as an antiestablishment candidate than one who tries to play the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is awash in PC gaffes. There is no denying that. If he had half of the legal and sexual harassment issues HRC has floating around her there is no way he'd still be running.

       Yup, going after former miss universe at 3am,  being totally unprepared for debates, and a 15 year old video where he talks about hitting on married women and grabbing women by the pussy is all he fault of the republican establishment that infiltrated his campaign? Oh btw the republican establishment that has to run all of trumps campaign field offices because trump can't be bothered to pay his staff or actually develop a ground game or the establishment from who trump steals policy from wholesale because he can't be bothered to create his own. Yup, the establishment republicans are sabatoging trump... womp, womp... womp.

       McCain was the first real lesson that in modern media, whoever the Republican party nominates will be absolutely eaten up and shat out myriad times between the nomination and November.  it doesn't matter at all what they actually think or do.
      </p>
      <p>
       McCain used to be
       <em>
        loved
       </em>
       the the mass media.  He would go on every show and talk to every reporter and they loved it, largely because he would criticize the Republican party leadership.  McCain was also the first guy to bring campaign finance reform to the national stage -- its still a huge issue.  But once he got nominated?  McCain became this too-old guy who was out-of-touch and probably a racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing happened to Romney.    In reality though both McCain and Romney were very respectable politicians -- esp. Romney, a republican who was governor of Blue state who overhauled health care for crying out loud! -- but it doesn't matter.  They were pilloried.  So the lesson is:  if you're a Republican, it doesn't really matter what you say or how you say it.

       The people who like Trump are fanatic about him and are way more likely to do something like go to a rally for him, as opposed to HRC who has a majority of people who aren't really crazy about her and would never go to a rally for her, but would still vote for her because of how much they dislike Trump and think he'd be a terrible president. Rally size isn't something you can just compare between candidates as a straight indication of votes. Also, it's "foul play"; fowl play would mean she's playing with chickens or something.

       How good or bad Clinton is has nothing to do with Trump.  The Democratic party has betrayed the country by nominating her in the forced, coordinated, backwards way that they did.  Her support numbers are somewhere around 20% of anyone under 30.  She's going to be president simply because status-quo old people (the Baby Boomers who brought up the ladders behind themselves) vote more.

       If you  legitimately think that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are both equally bad people and would both  be equally awful presidents, then you can vote third party or not vote. But the argument of 'even if Hillary is pretty shitty, Donald Trump would be a million times worse' is absolutely a valid argument to make.

       The demographic for this site is 16-24 year old, pot smoking, unemployed, college debt crippled youth. This demographic overwhelmingly votes democrat, upwards of 90%+ of them, and so 90% of this site is people who will defend the left no matter what. It's very easy to think that a site as big as reddit represents a fairly normal piece of society, but it really doesn't. Most of the people here won't even be voting, tons of them aren't even American, and if you ask random strangers in real life if they use reddit 95% of the time they will say "what the fuck is a reddit?" Don't forget statistics and demographics when reading the sewage that is reddit, in no way does this site represent reality at all.

       ONLY a 37 point margin last election among this age group, and that accounts for all youth in the nation - people who habitually use sites like reddit are much more likely to be left leaning than right leaning, as the trend goes for pretty much everywhere on the internet. People who constantly consume social media are more likely to be liberal, and liberals are more likely to constantly consume social media. Did I pull 90% out of my ass? Yeah, absolutely, but the number is much higher than 70%, which is verifiable, we can call it 80% and meet in the middle if it makes you feel better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do you mean the 95%?

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       6% of people surveyed had ever used reddit at all. That means 94% of people have never used reddit in their lives. And, actually, this survey was conducted on internet users already, so that number is much lower when you account for all the people who do not regularly user the internet (regularly being for hours a day).

       If you think this cancer website reflects anything close to reality, well, you are a fool, not much more to say. It is a very, very, very niche group of people.

       Good question. The primary field running against him, spearheaded by Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and fucking Chris Christy, was very weak and unlikable, and his name recognition and message of "make America great again" appealed to a lot of Republican voters. Now that people have gotten to see him be a piece of shit, his support is dropping.

       As if the RINOs haven't been trying to stop him in the first place when he KEPT WINNING! You enjoy the one party system as much as they do. I'm not calling you a shill, but it does seem you genuinely dislike him. Why? Has he not sold enough weapons to nations that kill gays, has he not deleted emails that (oh my) are now showing up showing more what kind of person is/isn't, has he not used a political position to do favours for nations that have a certain religion that explicitly calls for the death of the nonbelievers?! Have fun with a war with Russia as your Queen rules your cucked ass!

       Jesus dude, you realize using all the RANDOM CAPS and saying shit like "Have fun with a war with Russia as your Queen rules your cucked ass!" make you sound legitimately crazy right? Obviously if at this point you think Trump looks like a super qualified president to you nothing I say is going to change your mind, so we can just leave it.

       Donald Trump to my eye is the absurdist of dreams come true for Sen. Clinton. She has fine control over the DNC but was able to get one over on the entire RNC, by getting her buddy Donald to run, and see just how far the collective GOP knuckledragging exercise goes. We see today as Senators and bloggers alike run for political cover from Mr. Trump's latest escapade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only now, a few scant days from the eve of the election, is it beginning to dawn on the GOP , that they were outmaneuvered, in that way, such that I am kind of reminded from that scene from Game of Thrones, when the smartest woman in the Great Sept realizes they need to leave, and
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LfIpW6f0l8">
        by then it's far too late

       , perhaps that's what makes that show so engrossing, because it's' disturbingly relevant sometimes.

       Same way Trump posts are in all the places they are. 4chan is just different turf for different shills. Any waking moment there's 3 Trump General threads and 90%+ of the first page is pro Trump. Just shills reinforcing the us vs, them narrative to a specific demographic in their language: memes.

       What kind of an idiot would post in a city's sub that doesn't live there, even worse in Salem's sub? Holy crap you think that's a defense?! That's the saddest thing you could have said hahahaha. You fucking loser haha.

       Question? But how strict are the mod rules on large subs? do you just add someone when you are a mod? does it have any vetting process?
      </p>
      <p>
       But I agree, the new leak is not getting traction, but that is the fault of Wikileaks for taking so long to release and a string of questionable and non-starter leaks. Like how the leak that came before which was Guccifer's was nothing, so that when the real release came from Wiki, people cared less. We also have the "bad Russia" narrative that taints everything out there that is released, further muddying the waters.

       It's all because the new leak has nothing incriminating in it. Some people are so desperate for a story painting Hillary in a bad light when really, compared to Trump, she hasn't really done anything wrong.

       But compared to what's coming out about Trump, there is no wonder it's buried in comparison. And for good reason too, Trump's debacle is much worse. It's not some conspiracy about post suppression on Reddit, it's just that the up votes from people far outnumber anything people might post about Hillary. Simple.

       Was Trumps tape really that surprising? for me no, I figured he was this level of dick in private.

       I guess I care about policy more than banter, but I also don't either choice and feel they are both bad, just to varying degrees depending on your disposition.

       To be fair a lot of prospective default subreddit mods commonly create new accounts to avoid doxxing issues. Especially important when you have a bunch of people dehumanizing them to the point of accusing them of being involved in a broad conspiracy.

       treating him like shit is one thing. its 'modern' politics and ok, yeah you trash the other person. like how hillary started the whole "is obama even born in the US" thing
      </p>
      <p>
       but manipulating the media and rigging the DNC against sanders so he had 0 chance to win, i dont see how any person in the US, let alone any bernie supporter, can be ok with that kind of underhandedness and someone so undemocratic can be a possible choice for the presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       thats not even getting in to how the FBI gave her a free 'get out of jail' card, which reinforces the fact that such a corrupt piece of shit should not be in public office at all
      </p>
      <p>
       until the retarded public wakes up, and clears ALL the useless career politicians out, republican and democrat, this shit will keep going on. but they don't care, and actually at this point i've pretty much stopped caring as well. the only thing that bothers me now is that people pretend the system is not rigged &amp; corrupt

       Nope, someone who supported her in 2008 floated the idea around apparently late on in the 08 primary, but no one in her campaign had a direct hand in starting it.

       A lot of people feel the same way, they just don't feel like they don't have any agency. What can your average person do to achieve those ends? When you're presented with two options and told to choose one, and that there's no other options and it doesn't matter whether you feel the system shouldn't work like that, it feels like your only option is just to pick one and get it over with. It's not encouraging.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your average person will make a small stand, see no results, and give up. There's no incentive to be the only person working against the system if you feel your efforts aren't going to resort into anything meaningful. If nobody finds these people and puts them in a group or gives them access to resources and options then they give up and accept the current system as the only option.

       Well a big one was ignoring the entire southern United States. It was hard because Clinton has spent a long time building her reputation down here but it seemed like his campaign made a conscious effort to not just not campaign down here but minimize the importance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another major one though was the GOTV. While his base might have been more excited, Hillary's campaign did all the little stuff, making sure older voters had their mail in ballots set up was huge.

       I guess PR is one thing, but Bernie lost so early in the primaries that they were working to promote the candidate before it was technically over, which does look bad but that's one of the main reasons a lot of the DNC quit

       The non-conspiracy answer would be that most of Reddit is liberal and supports Democrats to begin with. Yes, Reddit largely ate Hillarys ass out during the primaries, but after the the last few months they've come to the realization that the only choice now is Trump or Hillary. Most of them accept that they have to support Hillary even with all her flaws because the alternative is much worse. Trump makes it easier to support Hillary by the week with all his statements.

       All the top comments were talking about how saintly Hilary is. Did you even bother to look? People have forgotten that if you compare almost
       <em>
        anybody
       </em>
       to trump, they look better. As a result, people have become fervent Hilary supporters. Wait until she's elected, when that orange menace is out of the picture, everybody will realize how shitty she actually is.

       America is at 2am at the bar, we struck out with the people we wanted and we have a choice between really bad and bad to go home with. We're drunk on media bs and spin, worn down from reddit, FB, Twitter arguments, so we just put our vote with bad, cause well; we HAVE to chose one.

       But in the morning light, with no more need to have to choose, we will see it's still a bad choice but one we have to live with for 4 years.

       Every once in a while, an anti-Hillary post gets posted and succeeds, but it's like 1 in 100. It's heavily biased. Obviously Trump is more of a billionaire socialite instead of a politician, but it would be nice to have a more even split of posts.

       I think the real goal of the people not plugged into the proverbial Matrix, like us, should now be making them realize that that kind of thinking (I better vote for so and so because the alternative is worse" - is fallacious and exactly what kept our our mothers and fathers from accomplishing anything for the passed 60 years. It's literally "lesser of two evils" mind prison going on STILL.

       Ummmmmm most of Reddit is not liberal. Do you not remember the Donald constantly on the top of Reddit ? 
Then the admins changed the upvote algorithm "for diversity" and now the Donald no longer shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now it seems like all of Reddit is liberal when really it's just censorship dictating Reddit .

       I actually like the new algorithm. I've found so many new subs that I never would have if they hadn't changed it. Now
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       has such variety. (And some good porn) I still see the_donald there all the time too. Plus they still dominate

        /r/all/rising
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is mostly liberal. No doubt about it. The_donald is the one big exception, but that's 225k people compared to ten times that many elsewhere. Plus a good chunk of them are trolls.

       Sanders supporters who do not like Hillary, but still hate Trump and are not racist, don't really have anywhere to go, and no place to speak that won't result in instant downvotes.

       If you really want to vote your principles and you hate Clinton and trump, pick a third party you agree with and vote there. I'm a former sanders supporter but I'm voting Johnson. I think most government is corrupt and we would be better off with less. If you're more populist, you might prefer Jill stein.

       Not true. Mathematically, your vote almost never matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only in the edge cases like in Florida 2000 would your vote remotely matter, and even then your vote can be reduced to a counting error.  In the grand scheme of things, it's better to vote with your principles rather than trying to game the system.

       No it's not. It's going from voting for a democratic socialist to a right wing libertarian. Otherwise known as a complete 180. I hate how people think Johnson is similar to Sanders cause he supports recreational marijuana.

       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and I didn't find one post that was pro-Trump or anti-Hillary. As an undecided voter, it's this disgusting type of bias that most media outlets show  that's pushing me so far from Hillary. How do people rip on trump when this woman is trying bring Bill back into the White House where he cheated on her so many times a few decades ago? Like I said, I'm not a trump supporter, as of now, but this is getting ridiculous.

       You realize two of the first six Presidents were related right? People usually prefer familiarity over something new. Democracy was about giving people the right to choose their leadership, not about dictating who that leadership would be.

       It was about self representation and self rule. There have been political families as long as there have been aristocracy and politics. Democracy was not about diversity in rule, it was about how the rulers were chosen.

       I mean you do realize that r/politics has always skewed leftward? It's not like this is a huge conspiracy to silence republicans, it's just that the posts that make it to the front page are the ones that resonate most with Reddit's traditionally liberal readership.

       Reddit really shouldn't be your source for unbiased political news in the first place.

       Most anti trump people I know are more turned off by his bigotry and lack of coherence than anything else,a lot of  non racists can't  get over it, can't support hate like that.

       The cheating but most people don't care about. His policy Vs hers, his agenda Vs hers. It's a clear contrast. Im a regular democrat voter but not blindly dedicated, if reps ran a reasonable candidate I think things would be different.

       Well the same way that people think because Trump
       <em>
        wants
       </em>
       to grab some other woman by the pussy, the same way Joe Biden was always so close to women and just one second from a knee to the balls, it could effect him. Couldn't Bill being in the oval office again having an orgy not possibly rattle for Hillary when a Saudi leader comes by to visit? (Cause you know they will be the first she asks to come visit, instead of Assad or Putin.)

       "bring back Bill to the white house?"  She is trying to get herself into the white house, ans since Bill is her husband, yep, he will come too.   Doesn't put him in power.  He cheated on her? Yes.  Why does that reflect on her ambition or career?   And the reason you don't see any pro-Trump posts is because there aren't many idiots stupid enough to publicly shame themselves, but of course there are always a few.

       I don't know how you reach that conclusion.  She has 30+ years of experience.  The fact that here HUSBAND would come along with her is a no-brainer.  But then, a brain is something you are probably not familiar with.

       The First Lady (gentleman?) usually has a strong presence in the public eye, so yes it really does matter that he'll be back in there. And that says so much more about her career than anybody is mentioning. If Hillary is such a strong woman, why in god's name is she still married to that man? It's absolute hypocrisy to think that she's a strong figure and not only married to him still because it helps her own political career somehow, which is just so scummy. Sure, there are some damn idiotic trump supporters but acting like some Hillary supporters aren't as blind as uneducated is just an absolute fallacy.

       Because she loves him?  Indiscretions happen more often than not over the course of a marriage, and most survive.  And she can and does stand quite well on her own.  You don't see Bill holding her hand during debates, do you? And she tore Trump up like the child he is.

       The one not against Trump was defending Hillary about the (fake) "bucket of losers" statement.

       It's not about people who preferred Sanders whle he was still an option.  The issue is the lack of coverage/transparency in one direction over the other ever since the candidates were decided for both parties.

       There are some major anti-Clinton stories that didn't get posted to r/politics, or at least if they did they got removed or disproportionately down-voted to an extent outlying the normal bell curve.

       Also Donald is now funding the BLTT. "Big League Truth Team" that directs people how and when to post on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't feel the effects yet since Donald is too despised to have astroturfing make a dent but I will have a look out for them.

       I tried to include a variety of sources. But yes, manufactured Donald shilling is now official. You sign up for it
       <strong>
        on his official campaign website
       </strong>
       . There is no denying it for him anymore.

       Yes, Clinton personally pays a German with a 5 year account to talk about Trump's astroturfing campaign.

1 post about Clinton on the Front Page would bring out a ton of criticism on her - which would impact any independent voters in swing states.

       Honestly, unless a lot of redditors are just sheep it seems fairly obvious how bought the hillary love is. Even with a reasonable mildy anti hillary but still admission that I will vote for hillary post I was downvoted quickly to -15 or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary is the best option, but you can see the shills starting to try to make hillary look cool by trying to make hillary memes by losting mfw style things.

       We seem to be in the middle of a bit of an attempt to make it seem like she is level headed and not bought. Lots of whitewashing of her character is going on in the past few weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want her to win over Trump, but unless you are praising her blindly the paid for accounts will downvote or the sheep will downvote. Dissenting opinions on the election are unwelcome on reddit. And this is comong from someone whonhates trump with a passion and is very mich not anti immigration and pro woman.

       You have to look at which demographic of redditors favored which candidate. The best litmus test is account age. Most "shill" accounts are less than a year/ 6-months old. Most of the big name S4P contributors and organizers had accounts for years

       I was a sanders supporter and I understand how to compromise.  Passing liberal policies is clearly much easier under Clinton than trump.  Plus,  Clinton is actually capable of doing the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       People keep trying to say "they're both bad" but they are orders of magnitudes different.  Hillary will be just as liberal as Obama.  I'd like more but I'll take it because I'm not an idiot.  In that time I'll also do what I can to get our election process reformed.  People hate hearing it, but we all know that voting third party will not change anything except maybe make you feel better at night.  Until we get a different election process it's pointless.  So for now I'll vote for okay and keep trying to get a system where there's more than two possible parties.  To be fair though, I did donate to Johnsons campaign because I actually really respect him and his ability to argue different economic policy reasonably.  I don't plan on donating to Clinton.

       Unfortunately there were a handful of Bernie supporters that thought it would be one election and done.

       I respect your opinions even if we have different views, but I think if we do not give the third party options a fighting chance, then it will never change. If everybody has the attitude of pushing it off, it will never happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a bummer for people like us, where neither candidate directly fits our views. I would like a candidate that is more like how this country was founded. One, where the states have more control and the federal government takes the back seat. I don't agree with many federal policies and aid programs because they do not work across the whole country. America is vast and very different from coast to coast. Things like a $15 minimum wage makes sense in New York City or LA, but does it make sense in Eau Claire, WI? In Eau Claire, you can buy a 2 bed, 2 bath, 2 car garage, 2 lot house for under $100,000, you couldn't even share an apartment for $100,000 a year in NYC.

       I like choice and governments that work for the local people. People always point to Europe as their ideal liberal government state, but all of those countries are smaller than Texas and much more easy to manage due to size.

       I don't disagree with that I just disagree on how to best get there.  I'd actually like a smaller conservative federal govt and the ability to make New Jersey my big govt liberal paradise and stop sending all of our tax dollars to red states that don't take care of themselves.  If I could get Johnson as president and a Sanders type as governor I'd be a happy dude.

       The worst kind of disaster is the slow avoidable one.  Like how Obama is killing government transparency, trying to point to statistically anomalous shootings as proof that we need more gun control, and pretending to argue from the left while actually arguing centrist positions, ensuring that left positions are never expressed.

       It's not funny though. It's about avoiding Trump. And there's not much Hillary praise either, she's seen as negatively as before. Your bias is distorting your perception, I believe.

       I think it's more a case of choosing the lesser of two evils. Hillary is scummy but if you but her next to trump...

       As a Bernie supporter, the second to last thing I want is for Hillary to win the office. Though like the majority of Americans, the last thing I want is for Trump to be the "leader" of my country.

       You're probably right about that. Since I've had it blocked I can't say for sure. But I don't know if there's really a conspiracy here in this case. I just think people hate Trump more than people hate Clinton. It's like the dumbest pissing contest in history, lol.

       Top post over there right now is something along the lines of "clintons emails are what we expected, boring" when they're totally not. And then the top comments are about how people switched from Bernie to Hillary. Ridiculous.

       they kinda are boring though, no one has even found anything worth talking about - none of the threads about them i've seen on reddit or off have had any even slightly interesting links to emails, i mean honestly can you find a single one of these newest emails to link me to that isn't boring?

       What about the illegal coordination with her Super PAC? And her private and public opinions? And her only holding Wall Street accountable for political reasons? And the fact that she wants all open borders and all free, open trade? Or what about her complaining about her failed foreign policy as SoS with wasted resources and training just for all the soldiers they trained to defect with all their weapons? Or about knowledge of weapons going to Hezbollah? Or about her coordinating attacks and working with media networks to write smear stories on Bernie Sanders? Or how she wants to hold guns and other weapons manufacturers accountable and legally responsible for any injuries/death involved with said weapons? Etc, etc.. maybe it's just me, but I certainly didn't find these latest leaks to be boring

       Okay, so I said I would find you that copypasta that had everything from the most recent leaks broken down, categorized, and hyperlinked but I'm having a little bit of trouble tracking it down seeing as I don't remember which thread it was on. It's 6am where I'm at and I haven't gone to sleep yet and NFL Sunday starts in 6 hours so I need to call it a night. I promise to track down that comment as soon as I wake up and if I can't find it then I promise to make my own for you! For now, if you really are curious I would go to r/DNCLeaks and I'd look at either the megathread or I'd go through recent and top posts because they're all labeled and have direct links to the emails there! But like I said for now it is time for rest. I apologize for letting you down for the time being but I promise to be back with everything as soon as I wake up!

       No, they really are just the same old shit everyone knew. Like it's not fucking shocking that a corporately owned establishment politician said things that Wall Street wanted to hear in a fucking paid speech to Wall Street. Everyone already thinks she's a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as much as Trumptards try to blow it off the reason this audio release from Trump is so shocking is that it explicitly jumps another level: from just saying things about women's bodies to admitting to kissing and touching women "by the pussy" without their permission. "When you're a star they let you." I.E. a presidential candidate bragging about getting away with sexual assault.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a tape leaks of Hillary Clinton gleefully bragging to some celebrity about how easy it was to delete her emails so all the stupid plebs would never know how secretly evil she is, then you'll have a case if it doesn't dominate the news cycle. But until then it's just more Trump supporter bullshit.

       There were over 2000 emails in the leak, sites like HuffPo and Buzzfeed cherry picked 12 or so of them and then wrote crafty articles implying that that was all there was to the leak. If you only read the emails that the media gave to you and didn't bother to look up the rest, how can you say they were underwhelmingly tame? The articles posted in /politics were carefully written and chosen exactly because they made the leaks look underwhelming.

       Depends on what you find interesting. If you don't care at all that Hillary flat out lies to the public when telling us what she will do as president, only to promise wall street something entirely different in private, then yes, buzzfeed/huffpo pretty much covered those things already. What they fail to mention is that the leak included more than just her paid speech transcripts, and as the leak itself is titled, are more about what a piece of shit Podesta is in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-08/podesta-files-show-illegal-coordination-david-brock-super-pac">
        http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-08/podesta-files-show-illegal-coordination-david-brock-super-pac
       </a>
       That's a decent enough summary of one of the most popular emails. The only thing preventing Podesta from being in jail right is the timing of this email, though he will still be in court over this. Is this going to get Hillary arrested, herself? Of course not, she is far too intelligent to do any of the dirty work herself. She uses minions like Podesta and Schultz to do the illegal shit so none of it can be directly pinned on her. It's how she got this far to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The culmination of this impending lawsuit on Podesta is not being discussed anywhere that I have seen, except in the far right leaning media channels that are pretty much banned universally on reddit except for in the_donald. I haven't read the rest of the emails myself, I couldn't care less honestly because I'm not voting for her anyway. But to pretend sites like Huffington Post and Buzzfeed are fair and balanced in their reporting of anything that could make Hillary look bad is hilarious. The fact that Buzzfeed is the article that /politics chose to upvote to the top is the biggest joke of 2016 and a great indication of just how far reddit has fallen. A website that exists simply to churn out clickbait garbage content for ad money is now a legitimate source of news, well done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, also, this was 2000 of supposedly over 50,000 (that's not even 5%) emails they have, and many articles I have seen have implied that this was the whole leak and it was the end of wikileaks involvement with Hillary. Combined with the convenient timing of an 11 year old recording of Trump talking shit, it seems that they very much want everyone to stop looking, which should be interesting enough on its own.

       As long as the msm doesn't even mention the facts in the story anyone who does report so much as facts ie names, dates and the act/news they are considered shills. They have been trying to turn alternative news media into the magazine rack at the supermarket check out aisle for years.

       "Wikileaks themselves highlighted emails related to the “Uranium One Deal,” where Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, signed away significant amounts, one-fifth, of US Uranium resources to Russia.

       When I visit my parents I'm much tamer and reserved. It's not a bad thing. Everyone is looking to absolutely devour her. Take trump for example, he fucked his campaign up with the shit that he said in public. And now in private. Maybe he should've had a different public appearance if he wanted to become president. He's gonna be the same guy behind closed doors, and that's his prerogative, but you gotta be tamer in public.

       That sounds like perfectly reasonable advice.  She's just saying that people are getting nervous about these callous banks and their backroom dealings, and while banking will always be an industry of cut throats, the banks really need to put a better public face on it.
      </p>

       Sounds pretty diplomatic to me.  I mean compared to "grab her by the pussy", her speech was downright presidential.

       Didn't say anything of the sort, as that wasn't even part of the topic I was replying to.  I don't advocate for Clinton, I was simply comparing the two sound bites.  Actually, if you look at my comments, I referred to her as a steaming pile of shit earlier today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Giving banks run of the mill PR advice isn't damning.  Trump supporters trying to drum up outrage is futile.
      </p>
      <p>
       But so is the futility of the "Clinton told the truth" Democratic push.  We all know she's crooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, you cannot advocate for either without ignoring the vileness of the candidate you picked.  So I advocate for neither.

       can still make tons of nukes for 4/5ths of US uranium? also who knows what it was actually for-maybe russia was threatening to go after another one of it's neighbours and a deal was brokered. i want to know why it was done but i can't exactly say it was done for the lulz and the money. feel like someone would say something to such blatant x=y dealings. hillary was secretary of state not gaddafi in disguise, the govt signed off on the deals right?

       Wasn't much of a tangent. Simply quoted an article. I agree. I would love to know more but until then I will remain skeptical of her motives as she is basically the definition of a career politician and said herself that she needs to have a public opinion and private opinion to keep public happy.

       tired of this naive story... it is pretend nuance from a show for teens. as if we are voting for the individuals, as if downballot votes are meaningless, as if the republicans are equally bad for the average person, as if hillary and trump can be compared in terms of experience in government... look at who suppresses votes of blacks, of the poor, and look who takes their sides. Let's accept that Hillary is the fake, the fraud, the lie that everyone believes she is, and that her cabinet and every staffer under her is in on this fraud, that she's bloodthirsty and trump is the true isolationist he isn't, and let's assume that everything people want to believe about her is true. voting democrat is still a step in a better direction. we won't have bernie now, maybe a bernie next time. possibly depending on where you live all the downballot folks are much more bernie than they are hillary. even granted all these unreasonable and untrue arguments, unless you are a god damned millionaire you are a fucking moron to vote anyone but democrat.

       Too bad being a douchebag wouldn't affect his performance as president.  Obama is very well spoken and likeable but has been a bad president.  Rare relations are worse than ever, economic growth is low, debt is twice as high, healthcare system is worse, etc.

       His policy is that blacks should hate whites and that it is illegal for whites to defend themselves against blacks trying to murder them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why he tasked the DOJ to make damned sure that any white that defends against black assault has their lives ruined. See Zimmerman, that cop in Ferguson that now can't get a job at Walmart because he defended himself against a black man punching him in the face while trying to take his gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The official stance is that a white being beaten by a black should just take it and hope to not die or be maimed for life. If not they get a civil rights suit and a media lynching making sure they never work again.

       Millions. It's illegal to hire whites in the proportion they merit.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance fire fighters in NYC. Merit based testing lead to 80%+ whites. Then they changed the test to pass/fail so easy that 98% pass so that they could discriminate against whites by looking at personal qualities not involving stuff like knowing what saw to use on a metal door.

       Just saying 'reverse racism' is an attack.  He's basically telling the whole world that white people invented racism.  Plus FBI stats show wether you're white or black, you're much more likely to be killed by a black person than any other race.

       Well the modern use of the word racism usually refers to white racism. In the olden days people were more xenophobic, hating anyone who wasn't from their country even if they looked similar. Like Japan vs Korean or England vs France. Basically everyone though that everyone not from their country sucked. But when europeans discovered America and explored Africa there was such a huge gap in stuff like scinece and technology that they actually thought that other races were inferior. Like it was the educated scientists who first believed this.

       But that's besides the point. Even if Obama made untrue statements I don't think it would have a significant effect on race relations. His words aren't that important.

       It literally is like watching a rigged boxing match. He's pulling his punches. He's letting her walk all over him. She says "he doesn't pay taxes" and he replies "that makes me smart".

       Anyone with half a brain would know not to counter with that. He's known about this attack for a while. He acts like he didn't expect it coming, like he has no counter-argument to the most played out scandal against him. If you had prepared to debate in front of the nation, wouldn't you prepare a number of arguments why you wouldn't display your taxes to the world? Would you say "I don't pay taxes and that makes me smart" when people are pissed about the idea that he doesn't pay taxes?? Anyone would have told him ahead of time a million better ways to counter that.

       No, they covered it multiple times, especially FOX, who seemed particularly dedicated to hurricane footage last night while everyone else was talking about Trump's announcement. I mean they didn't even break to mention it, but that Network is built around promoting conservative views. However Hillary's stuff just isn't that damning. Sanders of all people hasn't withdrawn his support and meanwhile Trump is hemmoraging endorsements on top of already painful post debate slump. What's more women represent 53% of the electorate.

       The leaks show Hillary as contradictory on some stances and even more crucially point toward her being OK with saying one thing and doing another, but it's nothing all that new, and merely reinforces a bunch of already well trod talking points about her weaknesses.

       Trump on the other hand is in a situation where many top GOP officials can no longer support him and hope to win their races. We're looking at a major schism forming in one half of the American political labdscape. Established politicians who normally fall into line at election time are actually calling for him to step down with 30 days left until election time, which is utterly unprecedented in modern presidential politics. Compare that to a politician giving different messages to different groups and tell me why that's the more important story. Nothing destroys a politician in America like a sex scandal, and this one hits all of the right buttons for Americans.

       This is the thing that bothers me about this though. Both of these things are already showing us stuff we know. One is undeniable proof that Trump is a scumbag... except we've already known this. We've known it since we've known Trump existed that he's a scumbag. This is nothing new.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have pretty solid proof that Clinton is not going to keep her word on anything because her positions are not what she says they are and she will lie and cheat and say anything to get what she wants and it's all meaningless. We already knew this too though.
      </p>
      <p>
       We already know these are both completely fucking terrible people to try and put into this job and there were so many better options. Why the hell isn't that the story here?

       Actually fivethirtyeight has an interesting theory on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Writing about what makes political scandals stick in 2008, my colleague Nate Silver pointed out that the most potent scandals reinforce a “core negative perception about the candidate, particularly one that had henceforth been difficult to articulate” — but not a perception that’s already received so much coverage that “little further damage can be done.”
      </p>
      <p>

        http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-trump-tape-have-a-bigger-effect-on-the-race-than-past-controversies/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Trump's flaws haven't been particularly difficult to articulate, however the big difference between his remarks to Fiorina at the debate, his history on Howard Stern, his row with Megyn Kelly and others is the candor of the hot mic. The particularly graphic word choice certainly can't help either, but for once he's pinned and can't easily explain away his mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stuff about Clinton, by ckmparison, is more of the same. Not that she has any good explanations for the email server. I think the right may have shot themseoves in the foot here strategically by hitting her so relentlessly over this throughout the campaign. If it hadn't been so well covered this might seem more like a bombshell, at least going by Silver's theory.

       The schism already happened friendo. The tea part was organic at one point but became heavily infiltrated and co-opted much the same way Occupy Wall Street. They have honed that down to a science. They infiltrate sometimes at conception.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a way of thinking about it: you know how the global chess game in the middle east right now has involved them via fake grass roots "revolution" (Arab Spring, hello), uprooting governments, making entire regions unstable and thrusting them into chaos, only to also back forces in the power vacuum that ensues?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republican party has been no different. They started a schism, co-opted and/created any organic reactions in the growing power vacuum, and now sponsor the engineered dialectic coming back out of it. They are completely reshaping and restructuring culture and society.

       Well it is interesting to consider. Tim Weiner who has covered the U.S. Intelligence Community for over 20 years with the New York Times wrote one of the better researched histories of the CIA, "Legacy of Ashes". In that you can see one of the tried and true tactics for pushing any national agenda is to find the people in the country who support your ideas and either openly or covertly support them with money, weapons, intelligence, and sometimes a little nudge in the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is pretty well documented throughout U.S. history. In Afghanistan in the 80's we had a vested interest in keeping the Russians out and were able to arm the Mujahadeen (and specifically Osama Bin Laden) at unprecedented levels. Believe it or not there were some ethics involved here. The CIA had trouble getting the OK for this plan until it was confirmed that the Mujahadeen weren't being pushed in front of the Russians as U.S. cannon fodder. Once they confirmed that with or without CIA support Osama and his buddies would be taking on the Russians, then it no longer seemed too Machiavellian to provide them with better equipment. Of course we all know what happened only a few decades later, and soon it was us, not the Russians invading Afghanistan where began a pattern of arming and funding the Northern Alliance rebels.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was actually watching a lecture on C-Span today where in the Q&amp;A they covered this very topic. (Amazing lecture btw, by this guy:
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extremism-America-George-Michael/dp/0813044979">
        https://www.amazon.com/Extremism-America-George-Michael/dp/0813044979

       ). He pointed out that there are some Russian white sepratists who have been endorsed by Putin (whose government you'll recall has now been formally accused of meddling in U.S. elections with hacking and cyberattacks), who advocate a global alliance of sorts among various disaffected groups on the political fringe. Indeed, I have heard of Palestinian freedom fighters being in contact with BLM activists, and let's not forget Al Quaeda has an English language magazine to say nothing of the sophisticated media  arm of ISIS. Heck, even Russia has RT and SputnikNews which are funded and run by the Russian state and which Putin humself has even said cannot help but taking on the Russian perspective. The Columbia Journalism review has covered their blatanly biased reporting too.

       It's probably a mix at best. It's a lot more costly and difficult for a nation to create a movement out of thin air. When you fund, arm, etc. a group that's already taking things the direction you want you utilize their resources and dave yourself money and time. The big bonus though is authenticity which is difficult to fake.

       Well, early access voting has been going for a few weeks now, which was what pushed Obama over the top in a few states last time, so a Pence vote would start at a pretty big disadvantage, however the bait and switch could work in their favor given Clinton's massive unfavorability.

       This is what surprises me. People have seen him on TV, he has always been in the media eye. I am not American but even I knew about Trump even before the apprentice. People knew what he was and he is still true to that form. I am not sure what people expected would happen. He is just being himself. To his credit, at least he is not putting on a face. With Hillary no one can be sure what face she has put on.

       It is news! News is whatever gets you watching/reading that gets advertising dollars and viewership. It just so happens that the most recent news is that of Trump making a baffoon of himself before he ever had presidential ambitions. This October surprise is an example why so many politicians strive to keep their appearances clean, regardless of if they are clean, and vet candidates when running for higher office. Your skeletons and even seemingly inconsequential details will be dug up and used against you. It's happening now. That's news. Oh also how republicans who want to survive the post-election environment  by bailing on their already reluctant support of Trump is huge news. When has this happened in presidential history?

       If you research Trump, you'll note he has had presidential ambitions long before he had a TV show. Hes waited as long as Hillary, but he opted for a TV personality to give him the brand name rather than direct politics.

       How was what he said even referencing sexual assault? I keep hearing you people throw this term around but when did he say that it was against their will? First of all the entire statement was rhetorical and secondly he implied that these women would LET him grab them.

       The speeches were not the only thing to come out of the leaks, in fact the speeches were hidden deep in the leaks and there was much, much more important news to come out of the leaks. Some of it proving HRC knowingly broke the law
       <em>
        again
       </em>
       . And there was
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       interesting bits to come from the speeches - such as her public and private opinions on things, only holding Wall Street accountable for political reasons, holding gun manufacturing companies legally responsible for any crime done with a weapon, wanting all countries to have 100% open borders with free and open trade, etc etc.

       Also the only people actually upset about Trump's comments are the same guys busy taking care of their Wife's boyfriend's children.

       Sorry kiddo, if Hillary actually broke the law, it'd be big news by now. You're trying to prove something that educated professionals have been unable to do, and for some reason you act like your 14 year old brain can somehow discover something the

He carried such classified materials on his unauthorized media when he traveled off-base in Afghanistan and, ultimately, carried those materials back to the United States at the end of his deployment. In the United States, Nishimura continued to maintain the information on unclassified systems in unauthorized locations, and copied the materials onto at least one additional unauthorized and unclassified system."

       Weird that apparently HIPAA law is more restrictive than what gets applied to heads of state.  In healthcare this would be grounds for fines or prison--PERSONAL ones, not just applied to the organization.

       I'm saying what she did was wrong by my standards and basic industry standards.  It is impossible to be both a competent leader and ignorant of these standards in 2016.  My standards aren't unreasonable, they're the standards I enforced when I worked as a HIPAA security officer.  They're the standards applied by that same government.  If the company I served did what Clinton did, we would have rightly been fined out of existence by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignorance isn't an excuse.  And incidentally, judges don't tell people right and wrong.  They just make legal decisions.  Anyone in the legal field knows that.  The law can be completely backwards, spend a few hours in a legislative session and you'll see how.

       Hillary actually broke the law. And you're literally hiding from the facts if you think otherwise. That's why there's multiple ongoing investigations. If you think what she did with her email server was legal, than you're just being ridiculous.

       Clinton is a corrupt oligarch, but your hyperbolic criticism of her actually shields her from the criticism she deserves, because you make it look like all anti-Clinton folks are delusional morons. That is actually the CIA's favorite technique for shutting down government criticism. So I say that you my friend, are the shill.

       If your assertion is true and that kind behavior is a trademark of paid native advertisers, then this thread really is full of shills.

       I like the part where you abandon the "everyone who disagrees with me is CTR and getting paid 20 cents per post," line and just decided to go with "Hillary Clinton directly paid you 2 million dollars to post this on reddit."

      <p>
       Who the fuck is going to put up $2 million for someone to post some snarky comment on a conspiracy board on reddit?  Not a politics board, Hillary decided to send her cronies into the conspiracy boards to try to swing all the loopy conspiracy theorists.

       Because OP and people upvoting this shit thread are bitter about Trump not winning, so they're trying hard to find an explanation. The cognitive dissonance of admitting that the reason Trump is not winning is Trump himself would be too painful. They have to find something else. It must be a conspiration ! The whole world hating Trump is a conspiration, and anyone disliking him is in fact a bot or a shill, or even a shillbot !

       This is why this sub is shit. Instead of credible and interesting conspiracies, you get this kind of people in denial thinking their bias is proof. "Oh but if I blatantly ignore what proves my logic to be wrong, don't you think this looks
       <em>
        strange
       </em>
       to you ?" Yep, 100% conspiracy material here.

       I disagree, I think a Trump presidency would be worse than a Clinton one, but I think either are deleterious for anyone who is not rich and powerful, and I think we ignore Clinton's flaws at our own peril.

       Oh okay the story is just that Trump said things. That isn't an insanely glossed-over oversimplification, and it certainly isn't relevent that the things were abhorrent enough for the GOP to basically  completley dump him.

       If you have to dishonestly simplify Trump saying that he likes to just grab women by the pussy without their consent to "Trump saying things" in order to have your argument not sound ridiculous, you probably have a pretty weak argument.

       Uh, I read the email leak. If that's the worst they can find in her speeches, I'm even more ready to vote for her. The worst I see in there is that Hilary's speeches are boring AF.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe that's why they didn't hit the front page; cuz nobody on Hilary's side gives a shit, and the Trumpers were disappointed with the results of the leak.

       Other highlights include more evidence that Hillary is colluding with mainstream media sources like the NYT, John Oliver, etc. on what they say about her/Trump, which is something everyone should have known she did already, but nothing is wrong with having more evidence. People should be disgusted but apparently everyone still trusts these media sources to be fair and impartial, so it still needs to be pointed out. As I said in the linked post, I haven't read through all of the emails myself because I honestly do not care, I am merely responding to people in this thread because I have seen the brainwashing machine working magically this weekend due to people's blind faith in sites like Buzzfeed (one of the biggest pieces of shit on the internet) to give them the whole story from a neutral point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really people should be asking themselves why Buzzfeed was chosen as the article linked in /politics, it's almost like the Hillary campaign knows people have already lost faith in sources like the NYT and decided to go with a new face. Resorting to that garbage to break the news is the most interesting thing about this cycle, shows that the average internet user actually trusts fucking
       <em>
        Buzzfeed
       </em>
       more than they trust veteran media outlets.

       I read the latest one. The one OP is talking about that wasn't even her email. You know, the one with the speeches that everyone was chomping at the bit about, claiming "she won't release her speeches, so they
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be terrible!
      </p>
      <p>
       The one where they had someone go through her old speeches to find anything that might bite her in the ass, and the worst he found was Hillary admitting that she's a little out of touch with the lower class, and that sometimes getting shit done in politics involves not saying in public exactly what's happening in private.

       I mean, you're wrong, but I'm not really arguing about that, I'm arguing about how the articles popular leftist media has spun to talk about this leak have been extremely misleading (big surprise) in order to downplay the significance of the leak. If you think there is nothing there then I can already tell it's a waste of time to try to change your opinion. Promising voters one thing and wall street another thing is pretty fucked up.

       I haven't actually read any articles about the leak; just the emails themselves. The whole time, I was thinking "wow, she really should have just released all of this months ago", because there is literally nothing scandalous in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the thing about people claiming how the "leftist media" is always defending Hillary and going after Trump; Hillary keeps getting made-up scandal after made-up scandal thrown at her, and
       <em>
        none
       </em>
       of it sticks, even when we spend millions on congressional hearings
       <em>
        looking
       </em>
       for a scandal, despite thirty-plus years in politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump, on the other hand, has actual scandals piled up in his closet, and the media just ignores them because stories about Trump acting crazy yesterday get more clicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the real conspiracy in political media; money outweighs any political bias in reporting, every day. They're going to report on what gets clicks and views in a landscape where the news media is becoming more and more irrelevant and they're just desperately trying to hang on.

      </p>
      <p>
       And don't be so naive, if the media only cared about viewers and money CNN wouldn't be quickly on its way to bankruptcy. Their formula of promoting Hillary at all costs is going to run several of them out of business, they would change their strategy by now if they cared about money. If the ship is sinking you don't keep steering into the iceberg.

       I already told you, you are a waste of time, I'm not going to bother with you because I can already tell you made up your mind the second you saw the buzzfeed headline. You can check my other posts in this thread if you want more information, otherwise you'll have to actually read the emails yourself (sorry I don't believe you've actually read any of them).

       The funny part to all of this is that you think I got to the leak via a buzzfeed article. I didn't even know buzzfeed had written one. The link I clicked to find them was one with a headline that was very clearly anti-Hillary, acting like
       <em>
        these
       </em>
       emails would be the ones that
       <em>
        finally
       </em>
       bury the Hillary campaign. At last!
      </p>
      <p>
       I though "oh interesting! Let's see what's in here... oh. Uh... k."
      </p>
      <p>
       I've looked through your comments on this thread, and you haven't posted anything I haven't already read, so either you've read exactly as much as I have, or you read more and didn't find anything more damning than what's being pushed by the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you, a pretty clear anti-Hillary, possibly pro-Trump alarmist didn't find anything remotely scandalous, why should I waste my time by reading all of the emails?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can tell yourself whatever you want about me, but assuming that everyone that disagrees with you is naive or uninformed is kind of the definition of "having your mind made up", so maybe you shouldn't be throwing stones.

       I found plenty of scandalous things, but you clearly don't care and don't think that crimes are scandalous, so why are we bothering to have a conversation? Let's go back to crying about Trump saying the P word.

       The thing is her emails and speeches really didn't have anything that juicy in them (that I've heard of). To the point where I don't understand why she didn't release the speeches to begin with. That's small potatoes in comparison to a candidate who can't go a day without a major headline about a new scandal and was caught talking about trying to fuck a married woman while his new wife was pregnant. He is running as a Republican, a party whose entire platforms surface is all about Christian  family values. Trump literally said he was so famous he could get away with grabbing pussy and kissing women without their consent. The fact that it got more media coverage is not a conspiracy, in this case it's appropriate.

       You can watch plenty of her paid speeches on YouTube and they are all really boring and similar. I think she was hoping she could get a "gotcha" moment someone either that or she knew trump loonies would just find a way to spin it regardless of what she says which seems true looking at some ofriends the other comments in this post.

       I completely agree. It's really a no win situation, especially considering how blown out of proportion its gotten. At this point it's a headline to get people's blood boiling. The content doesn't matter, only the reminder that it's a "thing".

       <a href="/r/politics">

       has become completely for Clinton recently.

       Trump has said dodgy things but enough to fill the whole front page with him and none of Clinton's stuff? Clinton stuff that is much more relevant and damaging but none of it is there. A conspiracy indeed

       I'm not defending Trump. That stuff has every right to be published and reach the top or
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . But Clinton has had a very questionable email dump and that isn't in sight on their subreddit other than a "clinton email dump is boring" post.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they're going to call themselves
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       they should be neutral in their moderation/censorship. The donald subreddit can post what it wants because when you visit there you know what the bias is.
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       presents itself as neutral but, from what i have seen this last month, it is not.

       Maybe it's because people are sick of reading the same two hyperbolised stories over and over? As soon as something new and substansive happens it'll shoot to the top, just like it always does. On the other hand, her opponent says or does something insane that'd be grounds for disqualification in any other election (i.e. news-worthy) every other day. Also, does it seem obvious to anybody else that this sub has been co-opted by Republicans? I think you might be right about the paid shills, but you might want to shine your little spotlight elsewhere...

       Yep this shit shack now has sponsored comments and the shill admins can just give hundreds or thousands of up votes automatically to the sponsored comments. No, 3,000 people don't really believe the bullshit lies I see in top comment. But if it's heavily "up voted" then other idiots who don't know any better start to believe the lies.

       Important information, information that is deeply meaningful to know as a US citizen, can also be "boring."  Like how journalism works (or doesn't) in 2016.  I'm not sure "boring" is the best descriptor, because things like proofs of anthropogenic climate change are regularly derided as such.  Hell, hearing them described as boring so uniformly makes me want to read them more.

       This list is pretty accurate but varies on sources links.   In a recent resources check the main sites that had reported pulled the article.   Also do not use google to fact check Hillary bullshit they are colluding as well.

       That might be because of any combination of the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) People are in general immune to "HILLARY! EMAIL! SCAAAAANDAL!". This is all the result of literally years of Republicans continuing to push a retarded narrative about Hillary's supposed role in the Benghazi attack. Nobody cares anymore. Everybody who isn't unhinged knows she had nothing to do with that. Sorry, but the anti-Hillary crowd has poisoned that well already.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Some of the content "leaked" is provably false. Mixed with much that is provably (or at least believably) true. The easiest way to make people disbelieve a source of information is to find one provable falsehood.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) People constantly push such stories about Clinton that turn out to be complete malarkey. I mean there's literally thousands of people in this sub alone that genuinely believe the Clintons have been having people killed for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Networks aren't going to push stories that don't get ratings. Info people aren't going to care about isn't going to get ratings.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Trump's campaign has just gone from a train wreck to an industrial train wreck.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure why people keep asking this question. "Why isn't Hillary getting the extreme negative coverage I think she should be getting?!" Because the people who hate her have made her bulletproof. I don't particularly care for her either but as her primary opponent is Donald "Grab 'em by the pussy" Trump, it would seem to be an easy choice.

       How does every article about Hillary being a horrible person get turned into a trump bashing. Can we just discuss all the bullshit that she has done for once? Go home paid Hillary supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her charity is all about evading tax dollars and getting into other countries to exploit there natural resources. She has lied over and over and changed her stance every 3 days. She doesn't want to ever be seen by the American people. She has as much ties and more to Russia. She thinks drone bombing people or just plain having them murdered is a solution. She blamed her shortcomings in Benghazi to a video! A video! She lied to the parents face about this. Her husband is twice as deplorable as trump and she has covered up and shamed any woman that went against her. She is all powerful and thinks she can't be touched. With that mindset you do whatever you want. If you think for a second she gives two shits about the American people you are living in a fantasy land. Vote for her and say good bye to American because it won't be here.

       has been dragged down so far they are just an anti-Hillary arm of the Trump machine.

       What is with the "paid speeches"?  As though no one else gets paid?  It's a pathetic attempt to manufacture outrage, since even Republicans aren't falling for it.  Of course she gets paid.  You might be born yesterday and not be aware that MOST speeches are paid events, including graduation speeches and speeches given by Republican representatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       had a certain intelligent edge?  Yeah, there was some tinfoil stupidity but you guys weren't led around by a ring in your nose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now when the Trumpets say "Hillary"
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       jumps like they got goosed.  Did he grab your pussies?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm embarrassed for you people.  You can't even be real conspiracy buffs, you're just another Trump forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man, the Trump folks sure did a great job taking over and ruining a bunch of subs.  Fortunately most of them didn't allow it.  But you guys did.  They had to create uncensorednews because they couldn't take over
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But you guys rolled over and presented those glistening little minds, just ready to be pumped full of Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good lord, this is shameful.  Nut up and take back your manhood, cucks.

       I have no love at all for either of these candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton is a criminal bought and paid for by private interest. She is duplicitous in nature and holds complete contempt for the people she claims to represent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump is mentally unstable and literally a fascist. He is high on his own self built delusion and wouldn't think twice about tearing up the constitution.

       I would vote for anyone or anything to keep HRC out of the white house. If the election season looked like I had to vote for Charles Manson to keep Killary/Shillary/HRC/Satan, whatever you want to call it/her out of office, I'd do it without hesitation. Literally anything would be better, anything.

       The Clintons corruption is insane. I've been creating a list of corruption since the 70's. I mean you have Watergate, whitewater, filegate, chinagate, cattlegate, padongate, the Clinton foundation scandals, irs harassment of the Clintons enemies, the Clinton defense fund, the Mena airport cover-up,  the multiple election frauds ( this isn't the first election she has been fraudulent), Haiti, the paid speeches, the 114 murders surrounding the Clintons, the rape accusations and I'm sure I've missed a few..

       It's true r/the_donald has an editor on its mod team, censors any news or opinion that's different. Has been using Alts and scripts to manipulate votes, have threatened reporters , doxxed users. Hell they even make up headlines to fool people. They create multiple subreddits. One was created to report people to the authorities. Accounts are only handful of days old and make it to the front page........ oh wait we're talking about Clinton, maybe that's because people don't find it as interesting as trumps comments or other news. Her emails have been in the news so much that new leaks don't carry the same weight as they used to. Also hasn't some of the e-mails been debunked?

       As opposed to r/The_Donald, where you can criticize freely and contribute differing viewpoints without ever getting banned!
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you delusional, or just retarded? Nobody is censoring you, the majority of the people outside your spam safe space are tired of someone who talks about sexually assaulting women like its nothing. And before you go "but muh Bill Clinton," he's not the one in the fucking race, and he's never been on camera saying he can do anything he wants to women because he's rich and powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to think you're the majority here and that the only reason you see bad things about Trump is because of evil shills who care so much about a relatively niche website who's largest demographics are some of the least likely groups to vote, but it's honestly just people realizing that they hate Trump more than they could possibly dislike Hillary.

       All I know is I posted a comment about violating title 18 and that was the last time I was able to post on r/news. Know it all, brainwashed cunts like you seem to think that Hillary is a champion of women when she joked about getting a rapist off on a technicality, called Bills rape victims bimbos and liars and enabled a predator like him to continue his abuse. I'm not delusional, retarded OR a Trump supporter but it will be a cold day in hell before I vote for that murderous, war mongering psycho. Obviously you support people that laugh about the brutal murder of a head of state so I know how you'll be voting. Psycho.

       I'm not a conspiracy person but I am genuinely curious. Do you think it's possible that the reason Hillary's stuff is not hitting the front page right now is that trumps stuff is so much more horrific at this point in time? Basically a case that the typical crooked politician stuff Hillary does has been been totally outplayed by the lecherous old man groping up women at every opportunity stuff?  Both the media and the public are prone to running directly towards the biggest fire and putting it on the Front page.

       I have to agree, the presidential campaign is a joke. I know because I've worked on them. 2008 was a dodgy election, after that I decided my vote is not to participate in this crooked system. Then I can complain all I want because I didn't vote for anyone. Thanks Obama

       If Hillary wins by rigging an election, what proof do you have that Trump had more supporters.

       They control the media and the web. Facebook, Twitter Google (to some extent)and Reddit and countless news agencies.

       People will look on the web and only find information supporting the idea that Hillary was the popular choice.

       Maybe everything these emails reveal about her dishonesty and venality is true and nobody doubts it, denies it or even tries to cover it up in some conspiracy. Maybe people just realize that she's running against a monster and don't want to lob any more grenades at the only thing beating that monster.

       I did see one earlier that basically said that her speeches were released and it was exactly what she said would be in them the article they linked to was bull shit. I want to say it was world news or something other than this sub which is the only reason I read it because I thought someone had finally caught on to it but it was a white wash. I saw it while I was at work and I can't find it now for the life of me. I looked at the comments and they were things like "I used to be a huge die hard bernie supporter and I hated Hillary Clinton but this makes me trust her so much more now" and "If there was something there to find then the officials would have charged her already" I just about threw up. I had to nope the fuck out. I suppose I should have said something cause then I would actually be able to find it now. It was pretty much shill paradise. Nothing is going to happen with this unless we make it happen.

       I wasn't looking for evidence within them there was already more than enough to convict her present and they didn't do anything with it I knew this would just be more of the same. I just read them so that I wouldn't have to hear it second hand. I'm disappointed in our justice system for not taking the evidence already present of her crimes and prosecuting as opposed to the obvious cover up we already got, and I am disappointed that the DNC is being allowed to launder money into Hillary's campaign and keep other candidates from being able to run a fair and just race. I am also disappointed that Hillary is so corrupt she has placed herself above the law. I am disappointed that we are going to have yet another president coming from the same 2 families, which just about conclusively shows me that you can no longer rise to the highest office of the land unless you are born rich and can buy out an election. I don't believe that her opposing candidate is an accident that no one saw coming this is all just a farce to get her elected since the major corporations started buying into her almost a year before this election. More than anything I am just disappointed that America has sunk so low that these are our choices and we have yet to take to the streets to demand change in large enough numbers to actually get it. If you could look at those emails and feel like you trust her more then you did before you are a fool, my hope is most people didn't read them and they don't honestly feel that way.

       Lots of secretary of states and other high ranking officials used private servers for emails- you're part of the Twitter generation who were bombarded that Hilary did it and it was very naughty but had no idea how common it was so just retweeted it to hell
      </p>
      <p>
       Nearly all top ranking people in politics do paid for speeches. The biggest corporations pay the most. Are you suggesting you wouldn't do it? Why shouldn't Hilary have done it? Again most people in her position do. Most from the bush regime are available for speeches
      </p>
      <p>
       Again you're from the twitter generation without being condescending. You see a tiny bit of information and you think Hillary is new to all this. She's not
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a deep breathe. Research. Look into things. Maybe realise that the people bombarding you with "Hilary's done this!!!" Are maybe trying to take advantage of your lack of research

       Have you ever heard of conflicts of interest, appearance of impropriety, or regulatory capture?   Those are three distinct reasons why Clinton is in the wrong and incapable of actually representing the left in this country.

       I'm not agreeing its correct but the fact of the matter is it happens constantly and everywhere.
      </p>

       But its targeted against Hilary only as its "LOL HILARY IS EVIL!!1" its a complete agenda to discredit her with "crimes" which have been done by most politicians repeatedly.

       However the twitter generation are banging their drums and retweeting passionately not knowing this.

       I've said before and I'll say it again. There needs to be a great reddit jubilee. All accounts set to zero, all subs scrubbed and de-modded and no defaults! Let the users re-build from scratch. It's high time we strip the power away from those who have hoarded it all to themselves for reason of abuse and propaganda. BTW if you're still subbed to r/news and/or r/politics...you are the problem!!

       Yea... Those stories ran their course in January and March respectively.  The media isn't going to spend 24/7 talking about year-old news to appease a subsection reddit.  We're not talking about Malaysia flight 270.  We're not talking about Freddie Gray.  We're not talking about Ukraine.  We're not talking about Nice.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before you get up and arms because it's a presidential campaign:  We're also not talking about Trumps KKK endorsement,  Trump's comments about paying for lawyers if his supporters commit assault, Trump's spat with the Fox news anchor, Trump calling a black supporter "My African", Trump's Kim Jung Un style singing girls, Trump's refusal to pay for said girls, Trump not knowing Russia invaded Ukraine, Trump's horrific chaplain at the convention, The convention's plagiarized speech, or many of the other things trump has done.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't some conspiracy to promote Clinton.  This is simply a candidate who is thoughtful and patient when she speaks and as a result, slips a lot less often than Trump.  Because of this, she ends up with bad press a lot less often than Trump.  If you wanted to see fewer anti-republican posts on the front page, you should have picked one of the other 14 candidates.

       Reddit is a giant conglomerate of every corner of the internet. A veritable dataminer's wet dream. All this info in one place, near complete anonymity. Pair that with the ability to hide your presence and a large brigade of individuals to trawl for a purpose and you have Reddit's secret police.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything Reddit is the best PsyOp tool ever made. Just like Facebook. Each move you make is tracked and publicly available, difficult to make truly private. Public opinion and knowledge has been shaped by things that start here, least of which are just memes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pile on top of that "heuristics" that magically create "top comments" via a "voting system" and you can make any thread say anything you want. Then in the comments just pay another brigade to troll or stir the shitpot when something intelligent and critical pops up into discussion that the client does not want talked about.

       Edit: And now every comment I've made in this thread is being downvoted like crazy after being upvoted for a bit. And even though all my comments are spread out, they're all being downvoted by 1 at the same time. Thanks shills.

       Or maybe people realize that 1. A post about the transcripts was on the front page yesterday and 2. It's not a big deal because they were very tame. And 3. Trump can't go 20 minutes without sounding like a bigoted, racist idiot.

       This year's election is to determine how many citizens think it would be a good idea to have a chimp go downstairs in the dark at 2 am because they listen to scary stories. And to take care of things for them they're handing Mr. Bubbles a shotgun, except it's a nuclear shotgun.

       Yeah anytime you speak against them in forums you get automatically banned and labeled a troll. Reddit is stepping all over our second amendment right to free speech. Like you can't even speak your mind anymore here.

       The way you are describing it though it should be blatantly obvious and it isn't. I read r/politics daily as well as the other political subs and I'm not seeing what you're claiming. You're saying any criticism of Hillary results in an automatic ban and that's simply not happening. I've seen a few bans of people not abiding by the subs guidelines and even in those cases it was only after several violations.

       Pay attention to the kind of supporting comments that Hilary gets. Most of the ones that I've seen start out the same way. "I am a Bernie supporter but..." Or "Hilary isn't my first choice, but I got in line."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like the shills love any kind of comment that encourages grudging zupport, either in what they create or what they chose to upvote. Even now, with all the money spent on dominating Reddit, they cannot manage to push the narrative that people actually do like Hilary, and are supporting her for any reason other than Trump.

       Unfortunately we just talk about it and I am just as guilty. Sometimes I wish they would just take over the internet and then, maybe then we will do something about it all. I think it will be too late though. Before the internet, protests weren't just protesting. It was a place to meet people and exchange information.

       Sorry, I check The_Cuckald, but those kids dont know what they are doing. They pore over emails and find stuff like "Oh shit, she pays people to write her speeches!" or "look, her campaign researches voters to appeal to them"...Yes, thats what a campaign is. None of it is incriminating.

       Measured against a racist, misogynistic, vulgar, loose-mouthed bigot like Trump, Clinton looks very electable. 
I think the poster below has it when he/she says Clinton lies like a politician, Trump lies like an alcoholic. 
I can't believe Americans would want to be represented by this man. He would never speak or act for me. The conspiracy is how he got this far and has been taken seriously.
It is time for the Republican party to withdraw their backing and give up on this presidential race for a greater good than their own- that of their country and their people.

       Buzzfeed is part of NBC and the Daily Beast is owned by a company with Chelsa Clinton on board. Some are plastering the politics board with buzzfeed pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM is now trying to down play third party candidates with more than the usual 'why waste your vote' routine. Not only attacking but creating false narratives like Johnson and Weld in particular have given up and/or are in the tank for Clinton.

       The most important thing I have ever learned is that in politics you must choose the right opponent. HRC couldn't have done a better job. No one talks about her speech to the Banksters when there is so much more vile material to talk about with Trump.

       No they're not. The basket of losers speech was fake - and it also didn't come from Wikileaks, it came from another source. Wikileaks goes through an extensive process to ensure the validity of all their leaks. The leaks are not fake. Not even close.

       that's not true, i do remember mention of the leaked emails being on the front page of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       i think
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/56dyvg/wikileaks_appears_to_release_hillary_clintons/">
        this
       </a>
       was one of them. there were some from the_donald and hillaryforprison that might have briefly made appearances as well (oddly enough, front page posts from those subreddits don't seem to stay up very long).
      </p>
      <p>
       but that doesn't mean you're wrong about this website being manipulated. almost every story about this was instantly downvoted in
       <a href="/r/politics">

       This post reeks of it being someone's first election cycle on reddit. Here's how reddit worked in 2008:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Barack Obama announces his canidacy. Internet falls in love with him.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         For the entire first half of the primaries
         <a href="/r/politics">
          /r/politics
         </a>
         totally ignores the Republican race and fills the page with positive articles about Obama and attacks on Clinton.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Clinton concedes, and overnight
         <a href="/r/politics">
          /r/politics
         </a>
         returns to non-stop Republican bashing.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In 2012 it pretty much stayed 100% Republican bashing because there was no Democratic primary.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr Reddit has, and always will be, a Democratic circlejerk. There's no shilling going on, just the basic fact that reddit skews heavily democratic. Please stop with this shill nonsense, and unless you can find users and conclusively prove they are on the payroll of someone (and proof does not inlcude "but they put nothing but pro-Clinton stuff!") sstop.

       You really think there isn't a huge overwhelming CTR presence on this website now? Because that's not even close to being true.. and multiple users and mods have been identified. There was also a huge amount of support for Ron Paul when he ran, it definitely wasn't all democratic propoganda

       Yeah, a hemispheric free trade zone (her dream) is real progressive. A no-fly zone over Syria is real progressive. Supporting Simpson-Bowles is real progressive. And now to use a meme from the 90s (in honor of the triangulating politics of Clinton I) NOT!!!.

       Really. Free trade is not supported by progressives. Hence Sanders opposition to the TPP. Also the EU is pretty anti-democratic if you would pay attention. None of the bureaucrats in Brussels are actually elected by European peoples. Democracy is the bedrock of progressive politics.

       Go look on Twitter Moments. There's at least 4 moments saying something bad about Trump 24/7. I'm moving out of the country soon but this is just fucking insane. The reach and the amount of corruption that is very blatantly happening.

       The worst part about it, in my opinion, is that you literally have to go to r/conspiracy to not get thrown in with the_donald posters. Not saying everyone who posts there is crazy, but there are some pretty wild things being written about on both sides of the coin.

       I can't wait for the community to rebuild this fucking site once the American Election cycle is done and the paid shills on all sides are gone. This was once something I loved and defended as the front page of the internet. Now it's a shell of its former self, which I treat with the same shame as being a smoker.

       I've 'researched' enough to see that Trump is literally the most disgusting waste of a human being I have ever seen outside of a junkie. Lived under Johnson, and both him and Stein are idiots. I'll take a corrupt politician over those 4 any day of the week.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who buy into this Hillary for prison pro trump bullshit are all bigger idiots than he is, and that's saying something. Call it what it is, she hasn't committed treason, at worst she's guilty of being a corrupt insider politician. So fucking what? They all are. The other 3 being obviously worse candidates despite this is exactly why she is going to win, and should win.

       You people are morons. There is no conspiracy, Trump's news is just more shocking and interesting than Hillarys emails which ended up being anything but shocking and interesting. Trump supporters think they are Woodward and Bernstein,  when in fact they are Beavis and Butthead.

        I was completely dressed. I had a skirt and a blouse. He tore the waist of my skirt. And then he ripped my pantyhose. And he raped me. It was very vicious. I was just pinned down… I did not know what to do. I was so frightened. I was only 35 at the time. And it was horrible. I just wanted it to be over with. So he would go away.
       </p>
       <p>
        And then as he points over my shoulder, he grabs me and turns me to him. And that was a shock. And I tried to push him away. And I only weighed about 120 pounds at that time. He was a very large man. And I kept telling him, “No. I don’t want this at all.”
       </p>
       <p>
        And he grabbed me again, very forcefully. And started biting on my top lip. And this was extremely painful. I thought he was going to bite my lip off. And that’s when he pushed me back onto the bed.

       What does this have to do with the email "conspiracy"?
Also this isn't even about Hillary...so her husband allegedly, before they were even married, raped a woman? How is this at all Hillary's problem?

       I can link bad stuff about Trump, but what would that have to do with the emails and paid speeches?  You can all pat yourselves on the back, though.  Good research, Woodward and Bernstein.

       Yes it is a big deal? How can you think it's not? Have you not been following any of the leaks and only been paying attention to the headlines and mother jones/buzzfeed articles of r/pol?

       Maybe no one cares about her leaked emails and paid speeches because I for one don't understand how they would affect her being a president, except maybe favoring the banking industry. And really, how much better can it get for banks with the way it is now? Honestly, I woke up this morning all giddy with anticipation to see what stupid thing Trump did that would be reported today.

       I was thinking exactly the same thing.... Hillary is a disgusting human being, Everything she gets involved in is laced with illegal activity and fed to the public as an ice cream sundae complete with the cherry on top. 
  Sadly, the american people just eat it up and allow her to continue making us all look like begging bottom feeders that are desperate for welfare and a free college education. She should be ashamed of herself and jump off of a bridge. 
  Trump is no Joel Osteen but I like the fact that he is not a politician, I respect his grittiness and his honest straight forward way of telling you like it is. He isnt about "political correctness" and that in my opinion is refreshing.
 It seems everyone has blinders on when it comes to Hillary, I don't understand it.  Seeing how the media is soooo "offended" at what he said over 10 years ago during a conversation between two men is pathetic. He sounds like a normal red blooded dude that you can overhear anywhere nowadays. The naive virgin ears people are pretending to have is a joke. When your offended at words that don't even involve you is only showing your brainwashed mindset. 
BE BETTER. BE MENTALLY STRONGER. DAMN!!

        Jeffrey Epstein
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender’s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the “Lolita Express” -- even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records.
       </p>
       <p>
        Epstein, who counts among his pals royal figures, heads of state, celebrities and fellow billionaires, spent 13 months in prison and home detention for solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on “Orgy Island,” an estate on Epstein's 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
       </p>
       <p>
        Florida attorney Brad Edwards, who represented some of Epstein’s alleged victims, is suing the federal government over the secret non-prosecution agreement in hopes of having it overturned. Edwards claimed in court records that the government and Epstein concealed the deal from the victims “to prevent them from voicing any objection, and to avoid the firestorm of controversy that would have arisen if it had become known that the Government was immunizing a politically-connected billionaire and all of his co-conspirators from prosecution of hundreds of federal sex crimes against minor girls.”

       That wasn't the question. Maybe you should learn to read and comprehend. Also, Clinton could be Pablo Escobar in disguise and I'd still vote for her over Trumpf, the village idiot. That's how much of an embarrassment Trump is to human kind.

       Maybe like the population of Reddit just doesn't give a fucking shit about your fucking stories on how she opens her mouth every now and then...  Every fucking time she says a word, you guys take it to 16 levels and analyze everything to justify your bullshit...

       Really. Free trade is not supported by progressives. Hence Sanders opposition to the TPP. Also the EU is pretty anti-democratic if you would pay attention. None of the bureaucrats in Brussels are actually elected by European peoples. Democracy is the bedrock of progressive politics.

       tired of this naive story... it is pretend nuance from a show for teens. as if we are voting for the individuals, as if downballot votes are meaningless, as if the republicans are equally bad for the average person, as if hillary and trump can be compared in terms of experience in government... look at who suppresses votes of blacks, of the poor, and look who takes their sides. Let's accept that Hillary is the fake, the fraud, the lie that everyone believes she is, and that her cabinet and every staffer under her is in on this fraud, that she's bloodthirsty and trump is the true isolationist he isn't, and let's assume that everything people want to believe about her is true. voting democrat is still a step in a better direction. we won't have bernie now, maybe a bernie next time. possibly depending on where you live all the downballot folks are much more bernie than they are hillary. even granted all these unreasonable and untrue arguments, unless you are a god damned millionaire you are a fucking moron to vote anyone but democrat.

       No, they really are just the same old shit everyone knew. Like it's not fucking shocking that a corporately owned establishment politician said things that Wall Street wanted to hear in a fucking paid speech to Wall Street. Everyone already thinks she's a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as much as Trumptards try to blow it off the reason this audio release from Trump is so shocking is that it explicitly jumps another level: from just saying things about women's bodies to admitting to kissing and touching women "by the pussy" without their permission. "When you're a star they let you." I.E. a presidential candidate bragging about getting away with sexual assault.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a tape leaks of Hillary Clinton gleefully bragging to some celebrity about how easy it was to delete her emails so all the stupid plebs would never know how secretly evil she is, then you'll have a case if it doesn't dominate the news cycle. But until then it's just more Trump supporter bullshit.

       Jesus dude, you realize using all the RANDOM CAPS and saying shit like "Have fun with a war with Russia as your Queen rules your cucked ass!" make you sound legitimately crazy right? Obviously if at this point you think Trump looks like a super qualified president to you nothing I say is going to change your mind, so we can just leave it.

       Stealing from charities isn't as bad as stealing from Social Security, Education, and Veterans Aid by not paying taxes.  Oh and don't forget that Trump has to be reminded by the media that the money he raised for charity actually has to go to said charity.

       3 things most of us here do/possess, myself included.  Yet you're still the only one with a clinton foundation statistic on hand to defend it.

       Honestly, if you think that defense sounded even
       <em>
        slightly
       </em>
       natural, you're not very good at your job.

       *** That's how this shit works, folks.  Speak out against their hag Queen and less than 20 minutes in and already 3 welfare recipients are in my inbox with pro-Hillary faggotry, downvoting everything I say.  On a 9 hour old post.  Think about that.

       Have you even, for the briefest of moments, considered that this has nothing to do with some organized CTR conspiracy brigading hundreds of threads in real time, and that maybe, just maybe, there are enough people who legitimately find Trump so abhorrent that 15 of them would down vote you and also share their thoughts on you comment?

       Yes but we were talking about
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       . It's noteworthy because that is a huge political story and it was buried in the politics sub.

       That's because her popularity is false. 
1 post about Clinton on the Front Page would bring out a ton of criticism on her - which would impact any independent voters in swing states.

       That's a simplistic view in my opinion. You can't force regulations on these companies because they have essentially become an integral part of the law making process through lobbying. It's a very difficult situation, and I don't know how to realistically address it.

       I actually like the new algorithm. I've found so many new subs that I never would have if they hadn't changed it. Now
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       has such variety. (And some good porn) I still see the_donald there all the time too. Plus they still dominate
       <a href="/r/all/rising">
        /r/all/rising
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is mostly liberal. No doubt about it. The_donald is the one big exception, but that's 225k people compared to ten times that many elsewhere. Plus a good chunk of them are trolls.

       You underestimate the importance of large environmental firms. They pave the way for countless small businesses to compete for work they would otherwise be incapable of completing (some contracts require small women owned business involvement). They employ civil engineers, construction departments, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just environmental scientists. In fact, I would say environmental consulting firms incorporate more employees that aren't directly experienced in environmental work.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, for some work on a navy installation, our contracting group hired a small company to complete almost the entirety of the work (often called pass through). The effects of reducing environmental compliance is far reaching, not even including the environmental base argument of saving the world.

       No one does and that's what bothers me the most. This man can't be clear at all on his policy, only that he will be a menace as is clear by how he's running his campaign. That's obviously good enough for me and most of the country to not want to vote for him.

       If you want to throw your "degree in econ" as some sort of claim to expertise, I'd advise you as someone with an engineering degree and P.E. license (me) to review the author's credentials before just dismissing as conspiracy.

       You millennials have google don't you?  There's nothing in that article that can't be checked in other sources.  Time for you to understand the reason these specifics aren't being covered is the same reason this mainstream press lied to America about motivations for the Iraq war, Iraqi nukes, Iraqi mobile bio-labs, Iraqi ties to al Qaeda, over 12 years ago when you were still a toddler.
