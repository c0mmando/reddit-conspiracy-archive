    <div class="md"><p>Psilocybin-containing mushrooms have an ineffable effect on our consciousness; a breakthrough dose defies description, language, and our ordinary constructs of reality.</p>

<p>One strong dose, just ONE, is enough to break the illusions currently plaguing the majority of the world. The jig would be up. Civilization stops looking so civilized. One understands that there is far, far more going on in the Universe than our scientific materialism understands.</p>

<p>Your question begs the question: what really matters? 
One way to answer that is to quote Alan Watts: If an Apple Tree apples, then the Earth peoples, and Nothing matters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>aminita is best served live.........  hahah. it has a certain amount of toxicity  as all mushrooms do. even the grocery store models. so cooking takes most of it out. they are best when you find them as they are growing. the natives in the southwest only used them in ceremony when they were living. you can drie them but i have never seen those. after you pick them they deteriorate quickly so you have to freeze them. will make some people throw up, hence its negative reputation. i personalty have never had any problems.  but you should cook them and drink the tea. im telling you now, its a completely different scene. get ready for a sense of presence.  i have had some amazing experiences. was up on mt. lemmon near Tucson one time, we were all seeing fairy&#39;s, little people, and all kinds of so called mythical animals and colors. colors and trails. fukin&#39; amazing. the sights are in the peripheral. so you have to sit and GAZE. dont focus. aminita if your not ready can be scary. you should always have a partner. this stuff makes the woods come alive. dont do this in a sterile environment. it puts you in touch with what makes us alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have a babysitter, sure I can agree. But only if that babysitter is able to let you trip freely. By that I mean, not asking you if you are tripping every 20 minutes, and bothering you at all really. </p>

<p>A babysitter should do nothing more than make sure you are alive. Other than that, a babysitter should be a tripper themselves, so they know when someone is having a bad trip, but even then, I&#39;ve learned more from bad trips, than some good trips. Mushrooms are the answer to most internal problems or dilemmas, even if they are horrifying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done both several times, IMO they don&#39;t compare. Wormwood just made me feel different. Mushrooms opened new pathways in my brain. Glorious pathways of truth. Not joking. Would highly recommend them for anyone.</p>

<p>*Also, there&#39;s no such thing as a bad trip. Sometimes the truths that are revealed can be intense, emotional or upsetting. When people can&#39;t handle the truth they get scared and call it a bad trip. (could be as simple as suppressed guilt coming to the surface, etc.)</p>

<p>Obviously too, don&#39;t do them in a dumb situation (i.e. don&#39;t go into a dark cave filled with water up to your neck and eat mushrooms unless you want a &#39;bad trip&#39;...yes my friend did this last weekend)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Did you drink the authentic absinthe, and not the shit they allow in the US? My wormwood experience kind of reminded me of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Definitely hallucinated and tripped bawls. This was in Russia though. I also heard they have this stuff that is from chicken shit or something. I presume it&#39;s like mushrooms, never tried it though. Really interested in your experience. I wanna try mushrooms, but it&#39;s kind of freaks me out, plus it&#39;s illegal.

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, I drank it both in Russia and Kiev. And locally, but it came from there. It was a subtle high from my experience. Mushrooms aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve eaten mushrooms and closed my eyes in bed before. I was shown the fabrics of the universe (it&#39;s what I went into it hoping to learn about). This may sound crazy if you&#39;ve never tried them... I&#39;ve heard LSD is similar but I haven&#39;t done it - I prefer natural things.</p>

<p>Try them, by all means. If you eat a small dose, you&#39;ll experience the sensory effects without really tripping in your mind, so don&#39;t worry. Start with like 1 gram, or even a half. You&#39;ll end up laughing your ass off for an hour, seeing physical matter a bit differently, and that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>Goodness, I love mushrooms. I can ramble about them for ever. I truly think everyone should try them (at the right time and in the right setting).</p>

<p>My 65 yr old dad wants to try them with me, I&#39;m excited.</p>

<p>This couldn&#39;t be more true. If you have internal problems to still deal with, then mushrooms are only going to magnify such problems, and probably not help. But if you are content inside, then its time to take some mushrooms. A natural clean environment for the next six - ten hours of your life and you will experience things you cannot imagine. First time I took 1.7 grams, half an eighth, then then following that, with at least a one month break, I took a full eighth, which is plenty if you don&#39;t over do it. The reason I think mushrooms should be plentiful in our society is because they are impossible to abuse. If you take them every day you won&#39;t trip in the slightest after day two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you have to be content inside to eat mushrooms, in fact I think they can help you sort some of those internal problems out. Of course there are times when my mental is not in the right state to eat mushrooms, but you don&#39;t have to wait &#39;til you&#39;re happy. If you want to eat them solely to have &#39;fun&#39;, then you&#39;re right, it may not be a jolly few hours.</p>

<p>And for sure, a couple grams will do me just fine too if they&#39;re decent mushrooms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your comment, and I may just indeed take the leap. I know where to get em, it just has always spooked me. We shall see. I&#39;ve definitely been heading down this road for some time. I drink (I know it&#39;s bad, but my mind reacts differently to it than others), but have been looking to be more holistic and seek natural things. Just sucks because the State can lock you up for having a fuckin&#39; plant or mushroom. SMH, so much wrong with that....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I&#39;m leaving out how the elements can ruin your crops or that you won&#39;t be able to grow some plants because of the weather conditions of your land. </p>

<p>Because of that, most of us will move to places where we have fertile and usable land, making it scarce, the ultimate resource in an economy. Even then, how bad can things get? Well, as bad as they are now because that is what&#39;s happened. Eventually, some realized they have advantages with their resources because of scarcity and they used this for their personal gain. Unfortunate, but true.</p>

<p>Not everyone can have land that is both fertile and yielding. So those that do, eventually gained the advantage. Then, after some time, technology advances made even rarer scarcity possible. So, here we are in the year 2016, with a world where the generation&#39;s generation&#39;s generation&#39;s children are ruling the world. Why? Because, the one&#39;s ruling the world&#39;s great, great, great, great-grandfather&#39;s figured out, before anyone else, that their resources were best used to develop scarcity, and to take advantage. </p>

<p>Well, there I go, into deep economical/philosophical thoughts, fuck me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, I drank it both in Russia and Kiev. And locally, but it came from there. It was a subtle high from my experience. Mushrooms aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve eaten mushrooms and closed my eyes in bed before. I was shown the fabrics of the universe (it&#39;s what I went into it hoping to learn about). This may sound crazy if you&#39;ve never tried them... I&#39;ve heard LSD is similar but I haven&#39;t done it - I prefer natural things.</p>

<p>Try them, by all means. If you eat a small dose, you&#39;ll experience the sensory effects without really tripping in your mind, so don&#39;t worry. Start with like 1 gram, or even a half. You&#39;ll end up laughing your ass off for an hour, seeing physical matter a bit differently, and that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>Goodness, I love mushrooms. I can ramble about them for ever. I truly think everyone should try them (at the right time and in the right setting).</p>

<p>My 65 yr old dad wants to try them with me, I&#39;m excited.</p>
