        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>During the primaries I was wondering why the media was giving Trump so much attention, I know he said some things that were at first off the wall, but then as they started happening right after he said them that kind of gave validity to what he was saying.</p>

<p>Still, the media gave him hours and hours of coverage every single day, every single channel.  They weren&#39;t giving him condemning coverage as they are now, it was more coverage that allowed him to establish his theme and core policy positions.  As they said they gave him 2 billion dollars in free coverage.  </p>

<p>With everything that has been coming out over the past several weeks, it is obvious he was propped up to win by the media so they can then use all of this crap against him, and it would work because Hillary is a woman.  There was no other candidate that this would work on in the Republican primary.  </p>

<p>They knew that the scandals she was involved in would have killed her campaign unless she had something to counter the scandals with, Trump&#39;s comments about women made him a good target for them.  I am sure NBC just had this tape in some back office like they claim, then somehow the post leaked it first.  I am not sure why these comments that happened a decade ago matter so much that it is getting days of coverage when the Wikileaks release actually talks about Hillary&#39;s policies, things that could actually have an impact on the future of this nation.</p>

<p>I think the media is still surprised at the resiliency of the Trump campaign or the extent of the Hillary scandals.  This has been the worst election to watch in history, candidates cannot even discuss policy because they have to defend every single scandal the media puts out.  The difference is Hillary&#39;s scandals should have put her in prison for one, and the latest release shows she is not telling the public the truth on policy positions.  </p>

<p>It is frustrating to see what is happening in the media.  The economy is headed toward a cliff regardless of who wins, the only difference is that if Hillary wins she will give them the war in Syria to hide the economic collapse.  The collapse will be blamed on the war if Hillary wins even though most won&#39;t believe that any more especially since Trump has been saying we are in another bubble.  </p>

<p>If Trump does win then he can say that he knew we were in a bubble and he knew there was going to be a crash because he has said it during his campaign.</p>

<p>When we go to war, few will sign up to fight, so they will have to implement a draft which Women will now be a part of, and we will not win the war anyway.</p>

<p>A part of the migration crisis in Europe is likely to staff companies when their citizens are off fighting world war three in places like China, Russia and Iran.  The immigrants will be left behind to run the countries while the young men are off fighting for the country.</p>

<p>The West will likely lose the war completing a power shift to the east where the Elite like how the people in power over there can do what they want without over sight while the little people cannot publish anything negative about them.  </p>

<p>Soon capitalism and free market will be blamed for it all, when we havent been a part of a free market for a while.  </p>

<p>I think people should be ready for the world to take a very different turn if the war does break out, and it looks like it could at any moment.  Put money in investments that do well during times of war and uncertainty like gold, Don&#39;t put everything you have there, but even if war doesn&#39;t break out the economy will crash.  There has never been periods of artificially low interest rates that have not resulted in a huge crash.  The Fed&#39;s balance sheet is above 4 Trillion dollars now, at some point they will have to reduce this balance sheet which will kill the market when they hint that they are actually going to reduce the balance sheet.   </p>

<p>The low interest rates make it impossible to save money, but it encourages the borrowing of money.  Unfortunately companies have been borrowing at alarming rates only to buy back their own stock to prop up the market even longer, which is why their hasn&#39;t been a collapse yet.     </p>

<p>Gold has dropped over the past two weeks, so it is a good time to buy it.  even if it drops farther, when the inevitable happens, you will be wishing you bought into it today.  Like I said, don&#39;t put all of your money their, but put enough that you will be ok when the market collapses.  Even Alan Greenspan has taken a bearish tone for the future.  Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently began paying a lot of attention to this subreddit and I kept wondering since people here seem to know that the system is rigged, why worry about what the media says about each candidate and what the public believes. I kept thinking, since it&#39;s all rigged for HRC, why complain that they are constantly making Trump out to be a horrible person, even if he got the vote he wouldn&#39;t win anyways right. It is starting to click for me thiugh, they are trying to make it seem like there is no way Trump will get the vote so the public doesn&#39;t realize just how rigged the system is. They couldn&#39;t leave him be the good guy and have Hillary win anyways so they have to make people believe no one will vote for him. It is just getting more and more frustrating everyday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mainstream media followed Trump around with cameras and microphones because every day he said some off the wall shit that raised eyebrows and provoked debate. It kept people watching the news and it was good for media business. Yes, it was free advertising for Trump.  They inadvertently created the Trump candidacy the same way any ad campaign does - repetition. It was all fun &amp; games and profit until he won the nomination and now they&#39;re trying to kill the monster they created out of their own low brow greed and journalistic negligence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s not, this is my opinion.</p>

<p>You&#39;re putting too much stake in the politicians. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like this: You ever see the show &quot;Who&#39;s line is it anyway?&quot; It&#39;s older, probably not on TV anymore. I used to watch it a long time ago. Anyway, every time the show opened, the host would say &quot;Welcome to WLIIA, where the rules are made up and the points don&#39;t matter!&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much the state of the nation. The rules are made up, and the politicians don&#39;t matter. </p>

<p>They are just middle managers. Good public speakers. Good lawyers. Good at not getting caught red-handed, more than anything. They control nothing, dude. Nothing at all. They are simply a facade for a whole gang of <strong>real players</strong> in the game. Just a facade. Every real player has multiple contingency plans for what happens if their candidate doesn&#39;t win. It probably doesn&#39;t even matter that much to most of them. </p>

<p>They masturbate to the thought of the anguish and turmoil that the election causes the proletariat. The meaningless, sham election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re totally right, I only have one small disagreement and it&#39;s just a matter of my opinion, I literally have no facts to back it up. I think there could potentially come a point where Hillary is so far down in polls, loses election by such a high amount etc. where her masters are no longer in support of fixing it for her, and move on to one of the contingency plans. I don&#39;t think she wins absolutely <em>no matter what</em>, however I definitely agree and think there&#39;s substantial evidence that she&#39;s the chosen one as you said.</p>

<p>Really a very minor difference </p>
