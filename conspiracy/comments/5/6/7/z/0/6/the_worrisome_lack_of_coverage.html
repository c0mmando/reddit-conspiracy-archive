It seems the only time you hear about anything to do with Russia is when a democrat has to show their bonafides by trashing Putin. There&#39;s not really any spin going on. Most people I talk to had no idea about the russian nuclear still or the temporary end of talks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like they&#39;re trying not to spook the cattle.  Anyone else bothered by this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s staged. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t mind wiping out the Middle East while they bankrupt every powerful country who could stand up. Russia is our closest ally, covertly. We will use each other to allow the rich to gain full control, all so they can satisfy their psychological need to dominate. </p>

<p>It&#39;s science, in the words of Ron Burgundy. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve been threatening us with World War III since 1949. It not going to happen. </p>

<p>Instead they&#39;ll continue to rob us all and pollute our minds and bodies until we decide were stupid enough to trust them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could agree with except history doesn&#39;t back this up. Russia is unique in the fact that their history is one of constantly trying but never succeeding in being accepted by the European elite. Russia has always been looked down upon by Europe. </p>

<p>On the other hand they don&#39;t share much in common with the Asian continent either. They look and behave in a more European manner. While they exist on two continents, they belong to none and since they&#39;ve proven to be nearly unconquerable, they&#39;ve never really had the cabal&#39;s tentacles in them.</p>

<p>For this reason I truly believe they&#39;ve been excluded from the cabal and are seen as a threat.</p>
