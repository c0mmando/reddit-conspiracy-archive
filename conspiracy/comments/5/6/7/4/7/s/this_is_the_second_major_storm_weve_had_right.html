    <div class="md"><p>What proof do you have that humans have manipulated hurricanes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course the publicized versions of these technologies are about weakening - not weaponizing. And if the government had the technologies and was going to use them to influence an election, I sure don&#39;t think it would say so in a press release.</p>

<p>To pretend that our government doesn&#39;t use negative events to influence political outcomes is naive. Memos and emails show that one of the purposes of the Fast &amp; Furious debacle was to link American guns to Mexican Cartel violence - and using it as a foundation to legislate for stricter gun laws. </p>

<p>Rumors of the weaponizing of weather have circulated for a long time. It&#39;s remarkable coincidental that these two disastrous storms are happening at a four-year-interval, right before a tightly contested election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So no evidence then?</p>

<p>You&#39;re basing your whole argument on &quot;there are rumors they&#39;ve been trying to modify the weather&quot; and 2 storms happened around election time. But no evidence.</p>

<p>Let me explain it to you this way. Say I had no idea what weather modification is. How would you convince me that this hurricane was modified?</p>

<p>Rumors of cloud seeding, sure. Was supposedly prevalent during Vietnam, creating rainstorms that caused flooding and whatnot.</p>

<p>Do you even understand how hurricanes work? And I&#39;m not saying, do you watch the weather channel. I&#39;m talking much more in depth than that.</p>

<p>And 2 events hardly equal a correlation. And you&#39;d need evidence to prove there is a correlation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The nature of conspiracies is that the evidence is scant or not readily available. Since this is a &quot;conspiracy&quot; sub, my post is appropriate. If this were a &quot;science&quot; sub, then I would probably need to post a published, peer-reviewed journal article to substantiate my claim.</p>

<p>There have long been rumors of weather manipulation. The fact that the last major storm was the month before a tight election - and THIS major storm is a month before a tight election is interesting to some. Specifically those that frequent conspiracy subreddits like this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The nature of conspiracies is not that there is little to no evidence. There can be loads of evidence (fuckery with 9/11, the election, Syria, etc) and there can be little to none.</p>

<p>Perhaps you&#39;re unfamiliar with supporting your claim? So you can&#39;t explain to me why I should believe you? You can&#39;t provide evidence?</p>

<p>Have you heard about cars that explode into confetti? President Obama does it himself from the oval office while people are driving! I don&#39;t have evidence to support my claim, but there are rumors of Darpa hacking cars so it just makes sense, obviously. I don&#39;t need evidence because this is a conspiracy sub and this is a conspiracy. You should believe me because I said so. </p>

<p>The GOP still blames Chris Christie for helping Romney lose his bid for presidency, against Obama.

<p>In the aftermath of this hurricane, who will be getting photo-ops with Obama and the director of FEMA? It won&#39;t be Trump. It will be Hillary showing more of her &quot;compassionate side&quot;.</p>

<p>For anyone versed in politics, the timing is very convenient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a notion on this sub: politicians do their best to turn a disaster into a platform for themselves.</p>

<p>That does not mean they are responsible. Are they taking advantage of the situation? Sure. Are they responsible? There is no way to say without evidence</p>

<p>So is there evidence that hurricane matthew is being modified? Any anonymous leaks? Any leaked gov documents? Any video or pictures of some devices they&#39;re using? Anything?</p>

<p>Where&#39;s the evidence? You claimed my confetti car scenario has no evidence so where&#39;s the evidence that matthew is being manipulated? Not evidence that the gov <em>wants</em> to manipulate weather. Not evidence that politicians capitalize on shitty situations.  In order to say &quot;Matthew is being modified&quot; you must have evidence of such. Until then, you&#39;re fitting square pegs into round holes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there is no physical evidence for the creation or exacerbation of the storm. My point is that the timing is very convenient - and mirrors the circumstances of the last election. Further, and not previously stated, hurricane activity has been at historic lows since the 1950s - which makes the concidental timing of these 2 hurricanes even more curious.</p>

<p>Your confetti car scenario is ridiculous because there are no confetti cars - exploding or otherwise. These 2 hurricanes did and do exist. The timing of these hurricanes is eerily similar. The missing piece is evidence of government involvement.</p>

<p>Incidentally, that&#39;s the same missing piece that the &quot;crazy-Berners&quot; lacked when they accused the DNC of colluding with the media to torpedo Bernie&#39;s campaign in favor of Hillary. That conspiracy was a conspiracy precisely because of the lack of physical evidence. And that conspiracy became a fact when the evidence was revealed - through the release of hacked emails.</p>

<p>Time will tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are multiple listed on Dictionary.com</p>

<ol>
<li>the act of conspiring.</li>
<li>an evil, unlawful, treacherous, or surreptitious plan formulated in secret by two or more persons; plot.</li>
<li>a combination of persons for a secret, unlawful, or evil purpose:
He joined the conspiracy to overthrow the government.</li>
<li>Law. an agreement by two or more persons to commit a crime, fraud, or other wrongful act.</li>
<li>any concurrence in action; combination in bringing about a given result.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Nowhere in any of those definitions does it say &quot;no evidence&quot; so idk why you have that notion.</p>

<p>Hell, look at the sidebar and there&#39;s a definition for you.</p>

<p>A secret plan or meeting by two or more people with the intent to cause harm or illegal behavior.</p>

<p>Nothing about evidence</p>

<p>As I said, a conspiracy does not mean lack of evidence. There are plenty of theories with troves of evidence. Evidence only differentiates between conspiracy theory and conspiracy fact. Enough evidence and the right evidence, and you no longer have a theory.</p>

<p>The GOP still holds a grudge against Christie for hugging Obama and thanking him for the Federal support after Sandy. Many feel that it hurt Romney and aided Obama in his re-election bid. There&#39;s a reason why presidents tour disaster areas - that&#39;s beyond humanitarian and purely political. </p>

<p>Politicians since Churchill have seen the advantages brought about by crises. Here&#39;s the notorious mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, expositing about the benefits of crises: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb-YuhFWCr4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb-YuhFWCr4</a></p>

<p>If you don&#39;t see the politicization of crises as a rampant tactic in todays politics, then you simply are unaware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So no evidence then?</p>

<p>You&#39;re basing your whole argument on &quot;there are rumors they&#39;ve been trying to modify the weather&quot; and 2 storms happened around election time. But no evidence.</p>

<p>Let me explain it to you this way. Say I had no idea what weather modification is. How would you convince me that this hurricane was modified?</p>

<p>Rumors of cloud seeding, sure. Was supposedly prevalent during Vietnam, creating rainstorms that caused flooding and whatnot.</p>

<p>Do you even understand how hurricanes work? And I&#39;m not saying, do you watch the weather channel. I&#39;m talking much more in depth than that.</p>

<p>And 2 events hardly equal a correlation. And you&#39;d need evidence to prove there is a correlation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My previous email explained exactly why: because these two hurricanes coincide precisely with the presidential elections, during a 60+ year period where severe hurricane activity is at an all-time low. Because this hurricane, like the last, will be exploited for political purposes. And because disasters &amp; crises are already being used to serve those looking to maintain and increase power - Katrina, Sandy, Fast &amp; Furious, Mass Shootings, etc.</p>

<p>Where a conspiracy has a direct, indisputable line to physical evidence, there is no conspiracy - only facts.</p>
