        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">28</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-10-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/gabby-gums.html">gabby-gums</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, this requires a little explaining and backstory. Bear with me. Or skip to the end for a recap.</p>

<p>Brave Frontier is an iOS/Android/Windows App, published by <a href="http://gumi-america.com/">Gumi</a>. The game is free-to-play, but has a premium currency in the form of gems. You fight monsters in this game with units. Newer, stronger, better units are released on a regular basis for players to try to summon, and summoning requires gems. 1 gem = $1 USD.</p>

<p>Whenever a new batch of units is released, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/565w7i/summon_megathread_20161006_gabriella_initial/">a thread is created</a> on <a href="/r/bravefrontier">/r/bravefrontier</a> where people post how many times they tried to summon for the new units, and how successful they were. The data from the thread is placed in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1knP7P777gQwRZ8CuO7OsOzoqGdQbQ6tx9cFxSc15Sdw/pubhtml">spreadsheet</a> to calculate the summon rate, or the percentage chance of acquiring one of the new units in any given summon attempt.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that recent iterations of these summon megathreads have had an influx of people claiming to have acquired the new unit in a statistically improbably low amount of summon attempts. These outliers are artificially inflating the calculated summon rates with their apparent &quot;dumb luck&quot;. Using <a href="http://www.snoopsnoo.com/">snoopsnoo</a>, I decided to look up the posting history of these outliers&#39; accounts, and have discovered that a large percentage of these accounts are fairly young (less than a year old), and post almost exclusively on <a href="/r/bravefrontier">/r/bravefrontier</a> and other Gumi-published game subreddits (such as <a href="/r/phantomofthekill">/r/phantomofthekill</a>).</p>

<p>I decided to post my findings on <a href="/r/bravefrontier">/r/bravefrontier</a> (henceforth referred to as <a href="/r/bf">/r/bf</a>) in a thread <a href="https://www.ceddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/569ywm/a_large_percentage_of_people_claiming_to_get/">HERE</a>. The first red flag was that I received a response from not one but two <a href="/r/bf">/r/bf</a> mods in less than five minutes. The first tried to brush it all off as a coincidence, whilst simultaneously accusing me of trying to stir up trouble. The second just said &quot;wut&quot;. I explained that I was merely trying to stir up discussion, not trouble. People started coming in, and soon the mods&#39; comments were bombarded with downvotes. Then, out of nowhere <a href="http://snoopsnoo.com/u/DonQuiXoTe888">another &lt;1 year old account that exclusively posts on Gumi subs</a> calls me shady, and claims that there is vote botting going on in the thread. The mod who said &quot;wut&quot;, <a href="/u/twofu_">/u/twofu_</a> , agrees and immediately deletes the thread.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing about Twofu: that account is not his first reddit account. His original account, <a href="/u/twofu">/u/twofu</a> , was <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/2v05nn/exmod_of_rbravefrontier_reveals_moderation_team/">banned by the reddit admins</a> after he <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/2v051l/hi_im_twofu_mod_of_the_rbf_subreddit_ama/cod8ixp">admitted to receiving payments from Gumi</a> (in the form of gems) in exchange for moderating the sub. You should give that SRD thread a read, there&#39;s some great stuff in there. My favorite is when he deleted the <a href="/r/bf">/r/bf</a> css and sidebar in a hissy fit after being banned. He then created the <a href="/u/twofu_">/u/twofu_</a> account to circumvent the ban (which is itself <a href="https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy#section_prohibited_behavior">a bannable offense</a>), regained mod status, and restored the subs css and sidebar. Also note that now that the whistleblower on the mod team is gone, there is nothing preventing the <a href="/r/bf">/r/bf</a> mods from collecting gems from Gumi in secret once again. Twofu freely admits he still has direct contact with Gumi employees.</p>

<p>So, to recap:</p>

<ul>
<li>New(ish) accounts that only post on Gumi-related subreddits post in <a href="/r/bf">/r/bf</a>&#39;s summon megathreads, inflating the calculated summon rates. These may or may not be dummy accounts posting false data to skew the results to promote spending gems.</li>
<li>I make a thread pointing this out, and two mods and another possible dummy account sling accusations at me, and delete the thread.</li>
<li>Mod who deleted the thread has been banned from Reddit before for receiving compensation for modding. Is currently modding using an alt made to circumvent the ban, which violates the Reddit ToS.</li>
<li>Mods might still be compensated by Gumi, now that the whistleblower is gone. This would explain why they are so quick to defend/cover up for Gumi.</li>
</ul>
