<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLzo5nkXGCo">Deutsche Bank</a> is unraveling, the central banks are intervening, due to the whole global financial system being at high risk. Last week Deutsche Bank got fined 14 billion by US authorities, for fraud in 2007, it wiped out their remaining liquidity.   </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Friday (1/10/2016) the Central Banks attempted to intervene, by buying up Deutsche Bank stocks, to prevent an outright collapse, after a week of bad news and a collapse in stock prize.   </p></li>
<li><p>The cover up, for the central bankers emergency buy back of stocks, was an unconfirmed &quot;maybe rumor&quot; about a settlement for the fine. The thinnest of excuses for such a staggering rebound in the stock prize. </p></li>
<li><p>During the weekend and Monday morning (2-10-2016) the central banks also intervened in the gold and silver market, HAMMERING down the <a href="http://goldprice.org/">gold prize</a> by $ 60, in a very very ham handed attempt at manipulating the market, by selling 1000&#39;s of paper options within a few minutes. This effectively shut the emergency exit from the burning Wall Street casino, preventing the investors form fleeing into Gold and silver, thereby stabilizing the situation and keeping everyone warm!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Forget about reptilian aliens, UFO sightings, government mind control, celebrity fuss or the odd puppet politicians making odd noises. This is the beginning of a new 2007 style crash, but much bigger and much nastier, diligently orchestrated by the same cabal of T.B.T.F. banksters and central bankers who fucked everything up in 2008. I encourage everyone to search &quot;Deutsche Bank&quot;, &quot;Gold fix&quot;, &quot;Silver fix&quot; and &quot;market manipulation&quot; to be informed and ready for next incoming shits storm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is going to be bad, unless you belong to a very very small segment of the population (Banksters)</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Cash</em></strong> - It is always good to have some savings in your own home. Cash for 1 month. <strong><em>DO NOT TRUST</em></strong> your bank. The financial sector will eventually have to do a &quot;bail-in&quot; or completely default on everything. Go to your bank and take out all your money once every months, but don&#39;t make a fuss about it, the bank doesn&#39;t care, unless they need you as collateral!  </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Gold and Silver</em></strong> - It will soar in prize once the crisis starts to unfold. If the dollar goes into a state of fluctuations (deflation/inflation/deflation/hyperinflation) you just stay calm, eventually gold and silver will become the preferred method of payment. </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Food and Medicine</em></strong> - Food and medicine for 1 month.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Allies</em></strong> - There is no substitute for good friends and family you can trust.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Underground Bunker, Ammunition &amp; Weapons</em></strong> - You don&#39;t need a fucking bunker, you just need to apply some fucking common sense! And don&#39;t kill anyone. Stay calm ;-D </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Don&#39;t panic, don&#39;t act like an idiot, no matter what happens. I am sure something unexpected will come along, just to add to the general misery and carnage, that will eventually unfold. My biggest concern is a war with Russia, Iran and Syria. When everything else fails, they always take you to war or instigate a major false flag operation. /cough9-11cough </p>

<p>If your government starts to ban cash and introduce negative interest rates, that will be a <strong><em>CLEAR WARNING SIGN</em></strong> of an incoming tsunami of financial craziness. You should immediately convert your cash into commodities, precious metals, fuel and food as fast as possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is good advice. I always urge people (if they ask of course) to have at least 1 month&#39;s worth of expenses in cash on hand. This will get you through the first month of bank holidays and chaos operating like normal.</p>

<p>Precious metals (silver is my personal go-to) are key too. Look, buying a few here and there, like the ASE tubes or just generic rounds can be built up over time. I recommend about 3 months of expenses in precious metals. Preferably at your residence, hidden, locked away. Safety deposit boxes are &#39;ok&#39; in my book... just remember to withdraw if you see shit going down. Also, be friendly with your bank, preferable a less known, local one. Everyone knows us at ours and would probably let us get our stuff if needed. Bank transactions they&#39;d have no control over.</p>

<p>Food, water, medicine. No brainer. At least 30 days worth. This will put you light years ahead of most of the sheeple.</p>

<p>Firearms - have some form of protection. Doesn&#39;t need some tactical AR and thousands of rounds. A pistol you know how to use and 100-200 rounds should be fine. More if you can. Practice often. Get training.</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s concerning considering that Pakistan and India have been fighting recently in the Kashmir region and hostilities seem to be increasing.</p>

<p>&quot;War in this region is all too common between the two nuclear powers, so what makes this time any different? Unlike in the past, both sides now have advanced nuclear weapons and the ability to deliver them to each others countries for use either on the battlefield, or strategically against harden targets or cities. They both also have larger, better equipped  armed forces with new allies and new policies. Only a few soldiers have been killed during this current conflict, but all the signs are present that this may be a more serious and protracted conflict than usual. India conducted what they are calling surgical strikes on targets inside the Line of Contact on Pakistani installation, and both sides continue to fire at each other in and around the LOC. An exchange of artillery fire has been reported and heavy fighting is starting to ensue between both sides. Both armed forces are at their highest state of readiness and both are positioning large numbers of troops in and around the Kashmir region.&quot; (<a href="http://defconwarningsystem.com/?p=146">http://defconwarningsystem.com/?p=146</a>)</p>

<p>Additionally, China has announced support for Pakistan in the event of foreign aggression. There are also reports of Chinese troop intrusions into Indian territory.</p>

<p>&quot;The United States is expanding its espionage operations against Russia on a scale not seen since the Cold War. The Senate Armed Services Committee has been informed that China and Russia are rapidly building space warfare capabilities and that the United States is lagging behind its ability to defend against these threats. Russia continues to run snap exercises with its nuclear forces, and is increasing the amount of bomber exercises it conducts every month. The United States has begun to match this by increasing its own nuclear exercises. Both sides have recently inspected their nuclear facilities and Russia says that it expects 40 million citizens to attend civil defense drills later this month. Chillingly, the United States has recently changed its nuclear policy which would allow it to combat what it believes is and increased amount of Russian Aggression with a more willingness to use its nuclear forces. The United States has said that it believes there is a new Cold War between the United States and Russia.</p>

<p>The Philippines reluctantly agreed to hold war games with the United States, indicating a weaker military alliance between the two countries. Russia has signaled a shift away from its neutrality over the South China Sea, moving toward support of China’s claim. China will have the ability to strike Australia from new bases in South China Sea.</p>

<p>North Korea conducted a fifth nuclear test and claimed that it was a successful test of a miniaturized nuclear warhead. If true, it is a significant step toward miniaturization and the ability to launch a nuclear missile. Meanwhile, Iran had begun manufacturing rotor tubes for centrifuges as part of its nuclear work and begins work on second nuclear power plant.&quot; (<a href="http://defconwarningsystem.com/?p=150">http://defconwarningsystem.com/?p=150</a>)</p>

<p>Also, Russia is deploying their most advanced missile defense system to Syria in order to deter any US air strikes not targeting ISIS. Things are heating up fast. :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont worry to much guys! The German taxpayer got your back. Our government will bail in for you. 
I dont have english sources but Deutsche Bank is since a couple of weeks in talks with our government. It looks like they will buy 25% of them. Officially they deny it but hey... wouldn&#39;t be the first time they lie to us.

<p>Seriously though; Deutche Bank is just a distraction from Italy, which is likely to go belly up literally any minute now. All the banks in Europe are not enough to right her, and the US already shot its wad. Only a major war can hold the EU together, and US-NATO is working feverishly on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were &quot;unconfirmed reports&quot; that some people had had  the cryptocurrency stolen from their mymonero accounts.  That was either bullshit or their PCs got hacked.  Then there was some selling off.  At one stage it was down to $6.50.</p>

<p>I had guessed that there would be efforts to disrupt Monero as it has the potential to replace cash and remove bankers from the process.  I still think that at some stage they may just try to buy most of it. Maybe this is part of their optimal purchasing strategy.</p>
