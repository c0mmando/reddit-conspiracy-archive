       Here is a good one: every one should know what
       <strong>
        Teneo Holdings
       </strong>
       is.

      <p>
       This is Clinton Foundation's Doug Band speaking about Teneo and Chelsea Clinton (I believe). What are they trying to hide exactly?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         I'm also starting to worry that if this story gets out, we are screwed.
        </strong>
        Dk &gt; and I built a business. 65 people work for us who have wives and husbands &gt; and kids, they all depend on us. Our business has
        <strong>
         almost nothing
        </strong>
        to do with &gt; the clintons, the foundation or cgi in any way. The chairman of ubs could &gt; care a less about cgi. Our fund clients who we do restructuring and m and a &gt; advising the same just as bhp nor tivo do. These are real companies who we &gt; provide real advice to through very serious people. Comm head for goldman, &gt; dep press secretary to bloomberg, former head of banking, and his team, from &gt; morgan stanley for asia and latin am. &gt;
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         I realize it is difficult to confront and reason with her but this could go &gt; to far and then we all will have a real serious set of other problems.
        </strong>
        I don't deserve this from her and deserve a tad more respect or at least a &gt; direct dialogue for me to explain these things.
        <strong>
         She is acting like a spoiled &gt; brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she's &gt; doing because she, as she has said, hasn't found her way and has a lack of &gt; focus in her life.
        </strong>
        I realize she will be off of this soon but if it doesn't &gt; come soon enough....

       YES. As much as I think Assange has politicized the leaks, exposing the crony network is EXACTLY what needs to happen.

       It is interesting to watch her and CF's Doug Band go at it. In an email Doug apparently was feeding the idea to Bill that Chelsea was plotting to take over the Foundation.

       This shit is better than any political show (way better than even
       <em>
        House of Cards
