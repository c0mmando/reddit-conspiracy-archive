        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is a good one: every one should know what <strong>Teneo Holdings</strong> is.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2874">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2874</a></p>

<p>This is Clinton Foundation&#39;s Doug Band speaking about Teneo and Chelsea Clinton (I believe). What are they trying to hide exactly?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>I&#39;m also starting to worry that if this story gets out, we are screwed.</strong> Dk &gt; and I built a business. 65 people work for us who have wives and husbands &gt; and kids, they all depend on us. Our business has <strong>almost nothing</strong> to do with &gt; the clintons, the foundation or cgi in any way. The chairman of ubs could &gt; care a less about cgi. Our fund clients who we do restructuring and m and a &gt; advising the same just as bhp nor tivo do. These are real companies who we &gt; provide real advice to through very serious people. Comm head for goldman, &gt; dep press secretary to bloomberg, former head of banking, and his team, from &gt; morgan stanley for asia and latin am. &gt; </p>

<p><strong>I realize it is difficult to confront and reason with her but this could go &gt; to far and then we all will have a real serious set of other problems.</strong> I don&#39;t deserve this from her and deserve a tad more respect or at least a &gt; direct dialogue for me to explain these things. <strong>She is acting like a spoiled &gt; brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she&#39;s &gt; doing because she, as she has said, hasn&#39;t found her way and has a lack of &gt; focus in her life.</strong> I realize she will be off of this soon but if it doesn&#39;t &gt; come soon enough....</p>

<p>She called me to tell me the stress of all of this office crap with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton">wjc</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Clinton">cvc</a> as well as that of her family had driven her to the edge and she couldn&#39;t take it anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is interesting to watch her and CF&#39;s Doug Band go at it. In an email Doug apparently was feeding the idea to Bill that Chelsea was plotting to take over the Foundation.</p>

<p>This shit is better than any political show (way better than even <em>House of Cards</em>).</p>
