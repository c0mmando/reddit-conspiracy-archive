Bernie is campaigning for Hillary now, speaking on the same script as every other cuck in politics. &quot;Anything but Trump&quot; they all say, and sure, Trump is bad, but so are they, they&#39;re all bad, Hillary being the worse. Bernie should know this, but he still speaks in rhetorical circles, saying &quot;anything but Trump&quot;, following the script, when he knows Hillary will engage us in more war. He is a fucking pussy who did his part in ruining our country, and people need to see this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People appear to not have appreciation for principals.. they still back him even though he bowed out of the race without speaking a word of the blatant cheating in the primaries. Bernie is a cuck, he has no principals, and he bows down to suck the globalist dick on the issues that matter. He&#39;s campaigning for Hillary, how are so many blinded by him? He&#39;s not even fucking anti-war, I mean, he&#39;s more anti-war than hillary, but he has voted many a-time to increase funding for wars, he voted for the patriot act, he voted FOR the NDAA. Idiots who participate in this sub and like Bernie at the same time just don&#39;t make sense to me. The amount of cognitive dissonance is astounding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks mate. People are downvoting me like I&#39;m telling them to vote for Hillary or something, when that&#39;s not what I&#39;m doing. I&#39;m not advocating anyone vote at all, but if we can be honest for a dang minute here I think it&#39;s important to call him out on completely keeling over. He had over a million supporters and he just went limp, I mean, doesn&#39;t that piss you guys off? You people who downvoted me as some sort of retaliation to protect his honor? Doesn&#39;t this bother you guys that he basically turned his back on you? That doesn&#39;t sound like someone who cares about the people, that sounds like controlled opposition. That sounds like someone who was meant to give the illusion of choice to the voters. To keep you invested in the system while they pull the fast one and all of the sudden you find yourself invested in a system that doesn&#39;t give a fuck about you, and you wonder how you got this way. It happened by Bernie, and it&#39;s gonna happen again and again until you realize it&#39;s government that is the problem, and more statism is not the solution.  </p>

<p>No, you&#39;re calling someone we like and still respect childish names.</p>

<p>What do you propose he do?  Sacrifice himself?</p>

<p>He fought the good fight, he got so much further that I ever expected, but he eventually lost.  I&#39;m glad he didn&#39;t go down in flames beating his head against the Hillary monolith.  If he&#39;d shouted it, &quot;It&#39;s all a farce!&quot; - how long would he have lasted? </p>

<p>Seriously though, how can anyone think that a billionaire is ever &quot;rogue&quot;? His golfing buddies, business partners, investors, creditors, friends and family are all running the alrgest corporations and government agencies around. Somehow he <em>magically</em> didn&#39;t absorb their ideas? He hasn&#39;t had to kowtow to any banks or financial firms to get where he is now? </p>

<p>It&#39;s so glaringly obvious, he&#39;s even got acting experience in the MSM&#39;s version of reality! This is absurd, and i wish i had the time to show you how wrong you are. On the other hand, i used to come to this sub for the critical thinking, not the Trump circlejerk. The inanity of the responses i&#39;ve been getting to this idea, the lack of research and actual thought you people put into shilling your billionaire sun-god, have made me loose any residual respect i had for the posters of this forum-- some of whom have actually braved some serious backlash to break stories of real conspiracies. You know, the stuff billionaires get up to to protect their wealth?</p>

<p>He&#39;s just as corrupt as the rest of them. Hell, he&#39;s part of the establishment that helped corrupt politics in the first place. But sure, if he becomes president it will all suddenly be great. Corruption will vanish and all the immigrants will dissappear.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First Clinton is an absolute scumbag who deserves everything that is happening, I&#39;d say the same if she were Republican. Second if <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> hadn&#39;t been destroyed by her shill army maybe this sub would be more balanced. This sub has always been about free speech (if you follow the rules) so unsurprisingly right wing people and &#39;racists&#39; come here because the rest of reddit has become unbelievably left wing and narrative controlling.  </p>
