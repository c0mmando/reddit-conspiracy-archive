       How sad is it that r/conspiracy has become one of the few places to post anything negative about Hillary Clinton or the 33,000 missing emails or her weird health concerns or the Clinton Foundation or failed foreign policy gafs... I could keep going but you get my point... I think it is disgusting that Reddit has sold out just like the rest of the MSM... Sad...

       Exactly. I'm not mad at him. I'm sure they just showed him a child size coffin then asked if he'd like to make his endorsement now or at the DNC convention.

       So sick of hearing this, it's lies. Bernie is campaigning for Hillary now, speaking on the same script as every other cuck in politics. "Anything but Trump" they all say, and sure, Trump is bad, but so are they, they're all bad, Hillary being the worse. Bernie should know this, but he still speaks in rhetorical circles, saying "anything but Trump", following the script, when he knows Hillary will engage us in more war. He is a fucking pussy who did his part in ruining our country, and people need to see this.

       Pretty sure he was cheated out. It's been proven. In my eyes he was the only leader. He's listened to his constituents, went against his own personal beliefs, and even though Hillary was getting called out about the emails he never mentioned them. He is a true politician.

       People appear to not have appreciation for principals.. they still back him even though he bowed out of the race without speaking a word of the blatant cheating in the primaries. Bernie is a cuck, he has no principals, and he bows down to suck the globalist dick on the issues that matter. He's campaigning for Hillary, how are so many blinded by him? He's not even fucking anti-war, I mean, he's more anti-war than hillary, but he has voted many a-time to increase funding for wars, he voted for the patriot act, he voted FOR the NDAA. Idiots who participate in this sub and like Bernie at the same time just don't make sense to me. The amount of cognitive dissonance is astounding.

       Thanks mate. People are downvoting me like I'm telling them to vote for Hillary or something, when that's not what I'm doing. I'm not advocating anyone vote at all, but if we can be honest for a dang minute here I think it's important to call him out on completely keeling over. He had over a million supporters and he just went limp, I mean, doesn't that piss you guys off? You people who downvoted me as some sort of retaliation to protect his honor? Doesn't this bother you guys that he basically turned his back on you? That doesn't sound like someone who cares about the people, that sounds like controlled opposition. That sounds like someone who was meant to give the illusion of choice to the voters. To keep you invested in the system while they pull the fast one and all of the sudden you find yourself invested in a system that doesn't give a fuck about you, and you wonder how you got this way. It happened by Bernie, and it's gonna happen again and again until you realize it's government that is the problem, and more statism is not the solution.

       He fought the good fight, he got so much further that I ever expected, but he eventually lost.  I'm glad he didn't go down in flames beating his head against the Hillary monolith.  If he'd shouted it, "It's all a farce!" - how long would he have lasted?

       Are you that blind that you consider Bernie to be fighting the good fight? Actively campaigning for the devil = fighting the good fight! You heard it here! Someone needs to tell the people the truth, that it IS all a farce. I don't know why you say that mockingly.

       I think there's some kind of keyword software that you can run. It alerts you to posts/subs when certain names or phrases are used.

       So post something here about
       <em>

       including the fact that Trump is running a controlled opposition campaign and met with the Clintons before deciding his candidacy? this forum has become an extension of the psyop that Trump and Clinton are different candidates. furthermore, there's some pretty obvious pro-Trump shilling and brigading destroying posts that attempt to demonstrate that they're the same pro-billionaire candidate.

       Oh my, it's conspiracies all the way down isn't it?

       Seriously though, how can anyone think that a billionaire is ever "rogue"? His golfing buddies, business partners, investors, creditors, friends and family are all running the alrgest corporations and government agencies around. Somehow he
       <em>
        magically
       </em>
       didn't absorb their ideas? He hasn't had to kowtow to any banks or financial firms to get where he is now?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so glaringly obvious, he's even got acting experience in the MSM's version of reality! This is absurd, and i wish i had the time to show you how wrong you are. On the other hand, i used to come to this sub for the critical thinking, not the Trump circlejerk. The inanity of the responses i've been getting to this idea, the lack of research and actual thought you people put into shilling your billionaire sun-god, have made me loose any residual respect i had for the posters of this forum-- some of whom have actually braved some serious backlash to break stories of real conspiracies. You know, the stuff billionaires get up to to protect their wealth?

       What fucking planet do these people live on? Even if you don't buy that he is running a controlled opposition campaign, what has he ever done or said that would make you  believe that he is substantively different than any other major party candidate in the last 40 years?

       The establishment opposition IS a reason to vote for him and it is a very big reason.  Of course there are others though.  His policies stated in speeches and laid out on his website, the fact that he is funding most of his own campaign and not funded by Wall Street, opposition to globalism, controlled borders, ect.  Is it really that difficult to understand why he received the most votes of any other Republican in history?  What are you missing that millions of citizens and some of the brightest alternative media minds aren't?

       There's a debate going on in this sub so saying there's a Trump circle jerk because a portion of the membership support him is more concern troll whining.  Show me proof of the corruption of Trump of the same extent as the Clintons and I'll take it into consideration.  Saying he's bad because he's rich is not enough.

       Europeans too, but at least all parties get an equal ammount of air time (in NL at least). At the end of the page they all lie though, so idk if it even matters if we take it up the ass from the left, right or through the center.

       She's not even that liberal by European standards tbh, just a tad left of the center. But don't worry, I dont get to vote in your election anyway.

       r/Conspiracy is also becoming a Trump circlejerk. People who have no problem believing the President is a secret muslim and the moon landings were faked seem to find it hard to get their heads around the idea that Trump is running a controlled opposition and the ruling classes control both parties.

       I think Trump has proven by now that he is not controlled.  I don't know why people are still sticking to that story when there is no proof whatsoever.  The guy is rogue. Who has bought him off?

      <p>
       Even with the entire establishment of mainstream media and both parties combined against him, and given what he says, how can you still think he's controlled?

       Wait, you're going with that as your logic? That's exactly what controlled opposition is
       <em>
        for

       . He's presented as the least reasonable option, so that people actually

       He's presented as the least reasonable option next to Hillary? Come on now.  He received more votes than any other Republican candidate in history because he represents anti establishment, anti globalism, anti corrupt political insider.  How can it be controlled to do the exact opposite of your intention.

       What doesn't make sense to me is that Trump is part of the establishment. He is one of the wealthy owners of this country and doesn't give a shit about anyone but himself. Yet because he isn't part of the perceived political class he gets support.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's just as corrupt as the rest of them. Hell, he's part of the establishment that helped corrupt politics in the first place. But sure, if he becomes president it will all suddenly be great. Corruption will vanish and all the immigrants will dissappear.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end it doesn't matter who between the two becomes president. Same shit will keep going down  and the United States will continue to circle the drain like it has for the past 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       But shit, maybe I'm just too cynical for my own good.

The real conspiracy is the trump psyop. They want you to think your vote matters, but it doesn't. The ballot box is the same as the slave owners suggestion box.

       The mods are bought off paid for shills here too, so it's definitely a safe space for you, but I'm always laughing. The world is laughing.

       The mods are clearly shills. Every single one of them is male, and majority white, and all conservative. This place is shit.

       Not at all. I know how this sub is run. I know everything in the side bar is always Clinton this or that. Never any thing about trump. Attacks on msm, like brietbart is the truth. Mods let this place become a dumping ground for trump bots and racists. It's no longer for conspiracies. It's racist right wing rhetoric. We all know it. Why kid yourself?  This place is Hell now.

       First Clinton is an absolute scumbag who deserves everything that is happening, I'd say the same if she were Republican. Second if

       hadn't been destroyed by her shill army maybe this sub would be more balanced. This sub has always been about free speech (if you follow the rules) so unsurprisingly right wing people and 'racists' come here because the rest of reddit has become unbelievably left wing and narrative controlling.

       And who's counting the polls? It's not like they're an incorruptible medium. If the Senate can make a case about her blatant corruption 'we' won't have to do anything. She can get away with it again but every cut drains away a few hundred thousand more voters.

       If you are for the establishment go to r/hillaryclinton.  This sub has always been anti-establishment and so the majority here will be leaning Trump by default.  Get over it and go elsewhere with the concern troll whining.
