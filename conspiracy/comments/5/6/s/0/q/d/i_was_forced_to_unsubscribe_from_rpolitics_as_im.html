    <div class="md"><p>They might be out of work, but no doubt DNC or whoever will still be in control of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. CTR can upvote/downvote/comment/report, but if they have any admins/mods they will KEEP those for sure. Too much power there.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t something you just give away. Reddit is huge and the ability to manipulate <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is huge. You hold on to it for each major scandal, each election. There&#39;s going to be a scandal at some point, and <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is still going to be compromised.</p>

<p>I think we can safely give up on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> now because it&#39;s too big of a win for them to just give up. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is the only place safe to read shit simply because the name. Any posts here are automatically conspiracy theories. They automatically lose credibility among the people just because they were posted here.</p>

<p>What we need is a decentralized reddit that works off of bitcoin technology like the blockchain, something IMMUNE to censorship, something where the behavior is 100% transparent. Some comment/submission removes are fine, but the main problem is it&#39;s completely transparent to the general user. You could create a client where it&#39;s an option to see the removed comments for better or for worse. You could have it so the client hides comments with lots of reports, then have people audit those later. It could be all public, but for convenience the default client would hide them.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s how we end the bullshit. You use the blockchain for submissions and comments. You lose mod powers. You create an account by generating a gpg key and signing your username and signing your comments. You submit signed &quot;actions&quot; that are proven to be signed by the same key as the person who signed their account data. Clients could manage all this themselves. You don&#39;t need central servers. You just need opensource clients and a decentralized database.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an engineering undertaking, but I think we have to move this direction at some point. This would be immune to censorship. The only problem is it&#39;s hard to defend against a sybil attack (one person, ten thousand usernames), but I&#39;m sure that could be worked out and mitigated. I think bitcoin has to deal with that as well.</p>

<p>This is the direction you need to go in today&#39;s world, because centralized authorities and information services are so easy for interested parties to subvert. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think steemit is trying to do something like that, but the problem is anyone can just inject a ton of bitcoin into the system and steer the narrative as they wish. </p>

<p>I do agree with a decentralized platform, and there are a number of them in the works, with higher or lower degrees or success. Some of the problems are technical, but the more intractable ones seems to be sociological and game theory. It&#39;s just really hard to have a truly uncensorable, ungameable platform. As a platform grows, the more incentive adversaries have to game it. And our adversaries will always have more resources than the people trying to maintain the platform. </p>

<p>And even if you do make one, it&#39;s going to be hard to convince your average redditor or internet user to adopt it. Most people don&#39;t see the need to download a separate client when they feel they&#39;re getting all the news and cat pics they need from reddit. You could end up with a similar situation as now, where users sharing the type of content we&#39;re talking about being siloed into one corner of the internet, or in the present case, one corner of reddit. </p>

The Internet is quickly becoming centralized to the point that many people rely on relatively few websites for their media consumption - Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, etc. Add to that Google being essentially a controlled gateway to the Internet, it won&#39;t be long before the narrative on the Internet is completely controlled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I kinda doubt it. If she wins - and lets be real, I think its easy to believe that its fixed already - CTR will probably continue spreading misinformation. They don&#39;t want someone like Bernie Sanders to gain a foothold again. </p>

<p>If they can keep the media from accurately reporting on someone, and if they can keep people from assembling on some place like Reddit to discuss someone, then its going to be really easy to keep another Bernie Sanders from happening to their operation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really wish that was true... But I doubt that CTR will stop.  The DNC has accumulated a huge amount of power through Internet propaganda and censorship.  I doubt that power will simply be relinquished.  I think they have seen how effective it is, and that we are seeing the beginning of an arms race to control propaganda and narrative on the Internet.  The worst is still yet to come in my view...</p>

I thought the shills thing was a little overblown, and that most people had the fairly reasonable leftist thought that Clinton was the lesser of two evils, and decided jump on board.

<p>Her actions relating to email were unacceptable, but the end result was not as catastrophic as they could have been. The law doesn&#39;t have much wiggle room in sentencing for treason (there&#39;s no &quot;attempted&quot; treason), so a conviction would be 5 year minimum, or death.</p>

<p>I feel that Clinton really has done a lot of positive for the country -- this is subjective, but my perspective is clearly echoed by a large number of Americans.</p>

<p>I think that she should get a fair trial, and if she were convicted, I would be in favor of a presidential pardon. I honestly don&#39;t think that the country benefits from locking up a 70 year old for more than a few months.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Educations or indoctrinations? They are different but happen in the same classroom. The intelligence level of the student makes the difference. With liberal professors outranking conservative professors by 10 to 1 (someone check that stat, i might be off), it goes without saying that the liberal message will be indoctrinated into lower intelligence students. </p>

<p>You see, I&#39;m one of those educated. And I&#39;ve seen the kind of people that recieve the same education. Quite a few of them are there to be told what to think. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not doubting what you say is true. But I also dont take it at face value. There is always a deeper level to consider before accepting an agenda. </p>

<p>Im not a trump supporter. But, given the illusion of choice between the two pieces of shit presented by the media, and given that both of those people consider the american populace to be just cattle to make a profit from, i will choose the one who makes my life before the slaughterhouse a greener one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I just wanted to make sure that we were on the same page. The argument works on you because you are sold on the idea that because you have a degree you are smart. If you studied psychology, you would understand concepts like herd mentality and socisl programming. If you were educated in criticial thinking, you would understand that your argument is an appeal to widespread belief. Also, its a wild generalization. </p>

<p>Im sure that you raised your intelligence. You probably learned plenty. You have a degree that says you learned how to do a specific thing. Not necessarilly thinking critically. </p>

<p>Im also a person with a degree. I know how easy it is to attain one. Remember that person who you were so much smarter than in school, but they got the same degree as you? Those are the people who are easily sold. You are one of them. Its not an insult. You&#39;ve been trained to do it since birth. </p>

<p>Im telling you that your argument is fallacious and you should stop using it. Like the askscience people like to say, correlation does not imply causation. But you&#39;re educated. You should have known that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still dont get it. It just goes to show that obtaining an education doesnt make you smart. You are stating a data point to prove something which it doesnt. The &quot;fact&quot; you are using relies on people like you thinking that degrees equal intelligence. Without that your statistic has no meaning. Who cares if people with degrees like hillary. Most of them like what they are told to like. Just like you were told this stat and without thinking you assumed it meant higher intelligence people like hillary. </p>

<p>I will reiterate what i have said before but this time i will put it in simpler terms so that maybe you can understand. The majority of people obtaining degrees are doing it because they are susceptible to advertising. Hillary clinton is a major advertiser. So is the media. So are the liberal professors. So for a group of people who are susceptible to suggestion, it makes sense thst they will accept whatever is most advertised to them. </p>

<p>If you cant show cause as to why your &quot;fact&quot; has merit, then STFU. It saddens me that it is people with your intelligence level who are going to be voting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re shilling or what. Given your handle, I&#39;m going to guess you&#39;re shilling/trolling, but regardless, it is a faulty and prominent talking point that is worth addressing.</p>

<p>I see no way a truly educated person can endorse Clinton, unless they have nefarious designs for the country. Nobody educated in history, economics, psychology, law, politics, who understands the country, its beginnings, the laws that founded it, the Bill of Rights/Constitution, the current situation of life in the U.S., or anybody who cares for its future can claim education and support Clinton if they want a better future.</p>

<p>The hanging question is: Do Clinton supporters actually care about the country? That&#39;s another question. But, then again, one could not be a citizen of the U.S. and possess intelligence and education while supporting Clinton. It&#39;s just too incongruous to be possible.</p>

<p>Now, there is a fine line between indoctrination (as another gentleman <a href="/u/climberoftalltrees">/u/climberoftalltrees</a> pointed out) and education. As a person who has been to college and has experienced the rigid vacuum of its methods, I can in good conscience label those who adhered to it as &quot;indoctrinated&quot; and not &quot;educated.&quot;</p>

<p>I saw many people breeze through college who could use words and even define them, but they left with little or no understanding of the information they possessed. Intelligence is what you do with or without knowledge. Indoctrination is what you do with information. </p>

<p>Intelligence is understanding math. Information is knowing a formula. One is a puzzle maker, one plays with puzzles. Information retention is a problem with the indoctrinated. The educated understand it, so they don&#39;t need to retain the key because it&#39;s always there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm well unfortunately you would be in a really tough spot if you actually had to prove any of what you said in any serious fashion, even though you are making it all out to seem very obvious. itf it was as simple and clear as you suggest, to see how bad Hillary is and how dumb going to college makes you, you could maybe actually argue that point instead of jut stating it. ultimately, anti-intellectualism is sad, i feel like both you guys didn&#39;t get your money&#39;s worth out of college.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, most of &quot;academia&quot; IS a joke. It is the very institution of indoctrination. It is NOT education for the most part. And if you suspect that I find it amusing that those who&#39;ve gone through it attempt to elevate themselves  because of that fact, then you&#39;d be correct.</p>

<p>The irony of it all is that I wrote a research paper detailing why it is dangerous when I was within &quot;academia.&quot; I had to fight to write about the subject because they did not want me expressing any alternative ideas. But I went into the breach head on and would not be dissuaded.</p>

<p>It is a nest for pseudo-intellectuals to churn out more like them so everyone is thinking the same way. What they&#39;ve done is standardized the approach to intelligence, while sterilizing it in the process. I came out of &quot;academia&quot; with respect for a single professor who happened to teach one of my math classes, a class which reduced a lot of &quot;intellectuals&quot; to tears.</p>

<p>We&#39;re more &quot;educated&quot; than ever and, I feel, dumber than ever. Although &quot;intellectuals&quot; will cite IQ markers while voting for Clinton and not seeing the rationale in protecting our borders. Most &quot;intellectuals&quot; I see can&#39;t even change a tire. And if civilization should reset, they&#39;d be the first to go without aid.</p>

<p>No offense, but the content of your replies are kind of driving my original points home. With all the information out there, you&#39;re still indoctrinated to think how you do, so there&#39;s really no potential to educate you. See how indoctrination interferes with education?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I&#39;ll tell it to you like this. All of my life I&#39;ve noticed a general malaise in the psyche of the general person/citizen of the united states. An awareness among them that there is a political class separate from them/you/me/us. What it amounts to is that the American citizen has been disenfranchised and rendered mute. &quot;They&#39;re going to do what they&#39;re going to do and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it.&quot;</p>

<p>That mentality is just as observable today as it has ever been.</p>

<p>And now, we have the ultimate political class politician running for POTUS and you &quot;intellectuals&quot; have appropriated purpose in her sponsorship. When, in effect, it&#39;s the exact opposite of anything that can be construed as &quot;intellectual.&quot; There is NOTHING intellectual in that point of view. In fact, I have a hard time imagining a philosophy that is less informed or self aware than that. It can only be defended as a psychological operation with nefarious design. If intellectuals are  hoarding support for Clinton, then those intellectuals are the low informatioon, ignorant voters.</p>

<p>But I notice this trend with your type. It&#39;s the same sort of double think trash that says &quot;I&#39;m a liberal&quot; while demanding safe spaces and kneeling at the altar of academia and trying to wedge all of society into neat little wedges of descriptors and hierarchical victimhood values. There&#39;s nothing liberal or intellectual about you folk. You are fully indoctrinated into a cult with a predatory ambition to dominate others through double think and confusion by extracting all meaning out of words, actions, and tradition.</p>

<p>First, it has been shown that she cheated on the primaries. Or would you like to take her route and claim that its a lie. Even after the evidence has been presented. </p>

<p>The signs are indicative of people who think that trump will do a better job than her. Hes done basically nothing for the country in the past. So what has she done that is so great that people would prefer someone with no track record over her? </p>

<p>Pardon? Are you fucking serious? Who is going to pardon her? Herself? First, she has to be found guilty of something to be pardoned for it. If she is ever prosecuted for her crimes and found guilty, this should make her UNELIGIBLE to hold office. How stupid are you? You want a person that should be in a prison cell to be the president? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The primaries are not the only case that evidences that some large number of people like her (or, at least were convinced to vote indicating that they like her), but since you bring them up: the allegations of cheating that I&#39;m aware of is the suppression of votes for Sanders, not the manufacture of votes for herself. If you have other sources, I&#39;d be interested to learn more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what has she done that is so great that people would prefer someone with no track record over her?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She (like Trump) is a polarizing candidate. I expect that many people would prefer a zombified Nixon to Hillary Clinton. This doesn&#39;t mean that her work has no value, it just means that a lot of people hate her a whole lot right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who is going to pardon her?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody, obviously. If she were on trial right now and convicted before end of term, Obama could (and likely would) do it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How stupid are you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dunno, 5/7 maybe?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You want a person that should be in a prison cell to be the president?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody in their right mind would vote for someone with a treason conviction, even if they received a pardon.</p>

<p>Better yet, just look at celebrities and VIP&#39;s . . . they get caught with drugs and it&#39;s nothing but rehab and a fine, no jail time.  For you and me, it&#39;s jail time with no exceptions, end of story!</p>

<p>Why just look at Michael Phelps who happens to have a DUI and was caught smoking marijuana, but he&#39;s our Olympic gold metal winner, so he gets a pass?

Running for president every four years while doing nothing in between is meaningless and is basically just a vanity project. They clearly aren&#39;t serious about being taken seriously. Try getting elected to a school board or state legislature or something before you shoot for president because it&#39;s quite simply not going to happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s not really an option to split the presidency so no matter the margin, the victor unfortunately is going to represent <em>everyone</em>. There&#39;s a good deal to be said about the lack of satisfaction in the decision but that&#39;s in part the culmination of a series of decisions we didn&#39;t give quite enough attention to. Those decisions stretch out for much longer than the past year and, like every decision we&#39;ve made, they&#39;ve involved the efforts of the same voters you see now and the counter efforts of the political loopholes that we have yet to seal off.</p>

<p>The numbers you give are misleading, too. 15-20% of &quot;voters&quot; is incorrect because you&#39;re including the 60-70% who chose not to vote (non-voters). The 30-40% who do actually vote represent 100% of all voters. Correcting that detail yields 38-67% of actual voters choosing the winning candidate. It doesn&#39;t make sense to include non-choosers as choosers. They represent a different statistic, an important one no doubt but still a different one.</p>

<p>The unfortunate reality of the general election is that the major candidates we have are flawed while the third party candidates aren&#39;t enough of an improvement to draw the votes they need. Even voters who are getting exactly what they want out of this election probably don&#39;t feel as if they&#39;re making a choice.</p>

<p>The lack of coverage and debates is a valid and strong criticism but it&#39;s sadly not something that&#39;s going to change in this season. That&#39;s the type of decision that third parties need to be pushing for as they move forward. There&#39;s an enormous interest in closing loopholes right now and that will lend them support while securing their ability to compete in the future.</p>

<p>As to wanting more voices on stage, I guarantee that there are voters on all sides who agree with you. The more unsatisfied people are, the more critical they become of their own candidates. If Hillary&#39;s all we get, then it&#39;s important to challenge her and improve her perspectives as much as possible the way Bernie was able to do.</p>

<p>I do think that the wishful thinking can get a little overblown at times. I don&#39;t really want two more Trumps wandering around sniping cheap shots the whole time. I&#39;d rather emphasize the need to increase the intellectual side of the debate, taking away some of the flowery self-praise and replacing it with genuine discussion of ideas. I don&#39;t really think either third party candidate can magically say what needs to be said the way it&#39;s often imagined they will. They&#39;ll rush to say something nice, to put together criticisms, and recall information. They&#39;ll make the same mistakes that any human might in that situation.</p>

People with legitimate reasons for wanting to leave the EU were too scared to admit it and talk about it.

    <div class="md"><p>Same same.. I live in Norway, and it is, I must say, rather impressive how effective the methods of old (divide and conquer) really works.</p>

<p>I will never forget the old saying of the British Imperial Establishment (sorry, I do not have the concrete source at hand...), but it goes something like this: &quot;We have rules. We have very <em>old</em> rules&quot;, and it always reminds me of The Knights Templars, who&#39;s symbol is that of a Cross in a Crown; &quot;In this Sign we will Conquer&quot;.</p>

<p>I did my research, and traced the Templars to Tavistock Institute, which today is a US think-tank and University, influencing the minds of men and women in so brilliant subtle ways, it goes on undetected.</p>

<p>The only way we are able to withstand and beat this manipulation, is to speak to our loved one&#39;s about psychology. It took me over a year to get through to my mother, but we finally are able to speak the tongue of truth together. There is no other way to get through to people, than to do good diligence, and never stop speaking truth, no matter how painful it is.</p>

<p>Humanity are still infants, and so self-absorbed it&#39;s disgusting sometimes, but we have to keep the torch of intelligence and truth alive - no-one else can do it for us.</p>

<p>Regarding EU - We in Norway have always been against it, but the resistance is mellowing, thanks to the Socialists, who now rule us with &quot;iron rods&quot; (sorry, can&#39;t help with the biblical connotations, but they do fit, and I am a former atheist too...).</p>

<p>You know, EU is a good thing in one way, because they force us to think <em>bigger</em>, but even though the environment is so incredibly important, the politicians are still stuck in their old ways of forcing us to <em>behave</em> differently, and never has, and never will communicate plain and simple reality like proper humanbeings should.</p>

<p>Civilization is a compromise, it really is, but the fact that human brains have the capability to hypnotize themselves to such a degree, will never stop to astonish me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I just wanna rant about another argument of which I&#39;m getting tired. I understand the message from &quot;<em>there&#39;s only two possible candidates, back the one less dangerous</em>&quot; voters. They spout this as if 3rd party voters don&#39;t understand the realistic possibilities. I&#39;ve got a lot to say about that, but I&#39;ll stick with countering this view on their terms. It&#39;s desperately obvious this comes mainly from H.Clinton&#39;s camp, the basic message on top of the main 2 realistic options is &quot;<em>we concede she&#39;s bad, but be afraid of the alternative</em>&quot;. What they fail to address is how Trump will <em>actually</em> be worse. I agree with them, he&#39;s a fucking dumbass who knows nothing about politics. Premise granted. That&#39;s why I&#39;m not afraid of him. As much as I don&#39;t like him, I&#39;m not afraid of him becoming president. America isn&#39;t a dictatorship, there&#39;s only so much he can do to fuck shit up before our checks and balances step in. In this aspect, Clinton is actually worse. She&#39;d set a precedent for future presidents to give them more power, so if/when some one more evil and smarter than Trump wins the position they&#39;ll have the same powers as a dictator. She knows how to maneuver through the roadblocks. Even if she&#39;s pure at heart, and only uses that power for good, she&#39;ll just give future president (there&#39;s definitely going to be an evil one eventually) the power to have their way with this country. I will not be coerced to choose between the two. I&#39;m voting for a candidate I think would be the best president whether they have a realistic chance or not. I keep seeing &quot;save your protest votes for less important election.&quot; Fuck that. This is the <strong>perfect</strong> election to vote for who you think will be best. Show you&#39;re not gonna back whatever candidate they try to spoon feed you. What both sides don&#39;t realize or accept, I (speaking for millions of voters this year) am unhappy with either side winning, I believe either way this country will suffer. That&#39;s how horrible these two are, I can&#39;t even fathom which would be worse than the other. I&#39;ve been voting in the past five presidential elections, and the fact it&#39;s ( <em>look at how bad your other option is</em>) even a talking point, let alone the main strategy with <strong>BOTH</strong> of this year&#39;s candidates is a fucking disgrace. I&#39;ve never seen such condescending campaigns. Fuck you GOP and fuck you Dems for trying to guilt me into wasting my vote on someone who doesn&#39;t deserve it.  </p>

<p>Edit: sorry for the wall of text. The TL;DR is my comment to which you replied. I have a lot of thoughts and emotions with this election. I&#39;ve had a long day, and focused those frustrations towards towards them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries man. I appreciate and can definitely relate. All this election has proven to me is that the Dems are just as bad and the Gop. I&#39;ve voted Dems ever since I started voting but currently I have no plans to support a party that is just as corrupt and willing to manipulate as they have been saying the republicans have been all these years. So they lost a voter as far as I am concerned. I am really hoping a lot of people realize it and vote for who they believe and not vote because they are afraid of the other guy. Voting because you&#39;re afraid is a true wasted vote as far as I am concerned. It&#39;s giving away your right to vote which is quite disgraceful.</p>

<p>Clinton is deceptive as fuck, and holds hidden agendas and secret interests. It makes her almost as unpredictable as Donald.  While she isn&#39;t nearly as overtly narcissistic and will maintain a status quo. Electing her also sends a message to America that the shoot first think later mentality doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>While trump is a monster, electing him might educate people on how the government works, and show them that PC culture might be expanding to aggressively and unchecked 
... checks and balances, he won&#39;t accomplish any of his promises.  Also it sends a message to politicians that there is unrest and the typical status quo their maintaining isn&#39;t sustainable.</p>

<p>Somewhat related, I&#39;m in a way glad the &quot;78 Americans die each DAY from opiate overdose&quot; statistic is becoming well known/used, because it&#39;s an excellent way to demonstrate we place FAR too much emphasis on the fraction of deaths causes by mass shootings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fail to see what the bias is? Clinton is up in the polls. That&#39;s true. Paul Ryan won&#39;t defend Trump&#39;s actions. Ryan did say that. A third of Republicans refuse to support Trump. That&#39;s true. Where&#39;s the bias?</p>

<p>Is it because Clinton isn&#39;t at the top of r/politics? Well, that&#39;s mostly to do with Trump consistently doing and saying crazy, stupid shit. And single handedly tearing the GOP apart. It&#39;s a bigger story than Clinton doing and saying the same thing she has been for years.</p>

<p>Get Trump to stop acting like a moron and he won&#39;t be criticized as much. Calling it bias it ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t entirely disagree with you, but:</p>

<p>1) A bias doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that what was covered was untrue.  It can also be reflected in how much focus and/or outrage is given to what issues, and how close is that mix of foci to reality. It&#39;s about a choice of balance.</p>

<p>2) Each candidate&#39;s scandals that they brought upon themselves seem to be of differing ethical magnitude from the other candidate&#39;s, IMO.  I would categorize Trump&#39;s scandals as reflecting character flaws and poor judgement, while Clinton&#39;s scandals have been reflective of illegal cover-ups and general abuse of power.  While neither of these categories are desirable, I&#39;d argue that one is fundamentally worse for society, even if only occurring 20% as often as Trumps &quot;lesser&quot; but more frequent offenses.</p>

None of the important issues about Hillary, and there are a lot that is worth at least mentioning, gets printed. Trump has gotten much more bad press all over. Just fire up a news web site, a mainstream one that 99% of the voters read and check out the headlines. This should upset you no matter who you vote for as it is poison to any democracy. Supporters of Ron Paul would agree, so would supporters of Sanders. Since we are on Reddit, go read the top 50 posts on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and tell me what you see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll try. That&#39;s a two-sided coin.</p>

<p>&quot;Two choices for President - pick one&quot; is nonexistent right now. In today&#39;s election no one votes &quot;for President&quot;. People are voting for change vs for stability. Majority of views is divided mainly like this: &quot;I have my welfare check/iphone 7/food and shelter/tens of thousands dollars worth of investments, and I&#39;m living pretty good. Trump is a dumb shit and he will fuck everything up&quot; VS &quot;I have my job, I pay taxes, Clinton steals from my taxes, my kids are unemployed and already in debt, there are long-term consequences of making dumbshit decisions, I&#39;m also worried about socjus and attempts to divide the country and segregate whites. Fuck this, we need some radical change, luckily Donald is running, and has a big movement&quot;. People choose &quot;stability&quot; vs &quot;change&quot;. Some people choose &quot;stability&quot; over &quot;cheeto buffoon&quot;, shame on them. But no one supports Clinton directly. People can be pro-change or against it, people can love or hate Trump, but people do not choose Clinton - because very few people actually like her. You don&#39;t choose between Trump and Clinton, you choose between Trump - or else. Be that bad or good, it does give you very little actual choice.</p>

<p>And that brings us to voting for third party. &quot;You can always vote third party&quot; in current grand scheme of things does not mean much. However, in case when people are obliged to choose between 2 major candidates of whom they hate both - they might spend more time actually looking tinto 3rd party programs and their ideology in order to cast their voice for someone of them. When binary &quot;dem vs rep&quot; does not cut it, third option provides a &quot;relief choice&quot;. Even if there&#39;s no impact of that vote on a major scale (we can only have 1 potus), voting for third party sends the message &quot;I&#39;m not partaking in this round of circlejerk, I&#39;m not choosing between bad and worse&quot;. And numbers for third party might be much more noticeable this round just because of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll grant all that, and notwithstanding it, I just don&#39;t see why <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would care much about Trump. There&#39;s nothing much clandestine about his corruption, and there&#39;s not much smoke in terms of media bias that we can&#39;t trace back to FoxNews. Rather, what smacks us in the face everyday is that the rest of the big &quot;legit&quot; news sources have done nothing in response to the laundry list of complaints we might have with Clinton et al., except perhaps acknowledge them occasionally and when necessary spin them. Do I really believe it&#39;s a conspiracy? No. Is it institutionalized bias? Yes. Are those established in the mainstream media getting a paycheck from Clinton? No, but at the same time, their livelihood depends on a few things, including convincing everyone that, when it comes down to it, they can determine an outcome, whether it be a race for president or a bill passing or aggravating/suppressing regular people&#39;s ire for big gov/big biz, and for the next few years, re-establish itself as a legit source of news. This election is going to leave a terrible taste in the mouths of millions and most of them will point their finger, in addition to other players, to the mainstream media. </p>

<p>So long story short, I agree that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has a hard-on for Clinton, but honestly it&#39;s more about the media&#39;s portrayal (or lack thereof) of Clinton than anything about the bumbling Trump. Honestly, I can&#39;t think of anything newsworthy re: Trump and a possible cover-up, except stupid shit about his taxes. No non-biased person has ever given a shit about his taxes. We all know why he&#39;s not releasing them, it&#39;s because he&#39;s not making nearly as much money as he boasts. With Clinton, however, she&#39;s withholding in every area of her life, and that the media hasn&#39;t pushed her on that (or the fact that she never gives an interview that isn&#39;t completely scripted) disgusts me and I think a lot of other people, whereas Trump is no mystery at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if it&#39;s not war with Russia, I urge you to look up the history of the Glass-Steagall-Act that was put in place after the great depression to prevent the economy from ever going into full meltdown again. When in the 90s citigroup got too big they called their buddy, then President Bill Clinton, who promptly held a long speech how Glass-Steagall is uselss and helped removing it. Less than 10 years later we had the worst recession since the 30s...</p>

<p>Now all candidates (Trump, Stein, Johnson, Sanders) said they would reinstate it, exept for Hillary, who pocketed just as much wall street donations as her husband did. She wants to do something better...</p>

<p>Europe barely survived the last crash and will surely not survive anotherone and if Europe goes down, so will the entire world economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glass-Steagall also separated investment banking from personal banking, and personal bank accounts were insured by the Feds up to $100K (now $250K) via the FDIC. Yet when they repealed Glass-Steagall, they left the insurance in place, without requiring the separation of funds. So the banks essentially had Federally insured money to play with, and if they lost it then the taxpayers would cover the loss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So? None of the banks that had retail banks were badly affected by the recession.  JP, Wells Fargo,  BoA all ended op saving other banks due to their solvency... Glass steagall have likely made the recession way worse since these banks wouldn&#39;t be allowed to buyout those others. </p>

<p>The banks that failed,  like I said,  did not have retail deposits. And while taxpayers did bail out some banks,  they made money off it since all of the money was paid back with interest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I agree that war with Russia would be terrifying and something to avoid...</p>

<p>But do you guys really trust Putin? This motherfucker is ex-KGB and has been in power since forever. He&#39;s pretty much taken over Russia for life, dictator in all but name. And Russians love him because every previous leader has fucked up and he&#39;s the only one they&#39;ve had where they&#39;re actually prospering and... eating. They remember what times were like before him.</p>

<p>But that motherfucker scares me. He&#39;s a brilliant man, powerful and terrifying. He&#39;s kind of a super-dictator IMO. He has the love of all the Russians, he&#39;s aggressive, he knows how to gain their affection and stay in power. He&#39;s held on to power for something like 26 years?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think going to war with Russia is at all close to a good thing, but that doesn&#39;t mean I trust Russia. Maybe being outwardly friendly to Russia is a good thing, but I don&#39;t trust that country&#39;s leadership for a second.</p>

<p>wot?</p>

<p>He was director of FSB in 1998 for like a year. I think he was deputy mayor of st petersburg for a few years. He was appointed prime minister and then acting president and then won election in 2000. </p>

<p>So he&#39;s been president for 16 years. Hardly 26.</p>

<p>He&#39;s obviously a dictator.</p>

<p>I mean it wasn&#39;t fair from the start. She shouldn&#39;t even be the Democratic nominee. It should be Bernie running against Trump. But that didn&#39;t happen because Bernie isn&#39;t one of them. </p>

The press and the establishment in both parties need a rude awakening that we want our country back.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. This is where we are now. Clinton will surely win, it&#39;s a waste of time trying to do anything except focus on pointing out how Clinton will proceed as if the win is a mandate for all the posturing she&#39;s doing with Russia, instead of what it actually is: the slightly-lesser of two evils. That NPR and the rest of the mainstream are feeding right into all this Russia shit is the prelude to another cold war. I fucking hate the Clintons.</p>

<p>Go read about Geobbels and show me the bit where he talks about user generated rankings. Show me the bit where he explains how to get the public to do its own editorializing. Point me to the pages on how an open internet is subject to total government control.</p>

<p>But if you want to see good old fashioned top down, talking points, his masters voice, marriage of media and elected authority style propaganda, then say hello to Rupert M and his little wanna be rival Stephen K. Bannon.</p>

<p>Bias is not propaganda. </p>

<p>You want to pretend Hillary and Trump are the same? fine. Show me the articles tweets and statements from all the democratic party members fleeing from Hillary in the wake of all that career destroying, guilt by association crushing allegations of  email/Benghazi/laughing at rape victims crap.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> - You guy downvoting my post is proving my point you twats. Either you are all propagandists &#39;JUST LIKE GEOBBELS&#39;, or you are just taking part in user driven ranking kinda exactly like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>Your comments about two dumb ass conservatives supposed to prove something? If don&#39;t think both &quot;sides&quot; do the same, well might want to think again.</p>

<p>The same? Who said that?</p>

<p>They&#39;re not the same, but they are both equally shit.</p>

<p>A rich political criminal and a rich celebrity douche.</p>

<p>Ever hear of that thing a few months ago called correct the record?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll assume not. They are people/bots that go around trying to make Hillary sound good, talk her up, post positive things about her. How do you tell difference between &quot;bias&quot; or propaganda at that point? Ya don&#39;t and that&#39;s the point.</p>

<p>And on the subject of bias, why should news coverage ever be biased? Shouldn&#39;t that only be something those nasty conservatives you mentioned do?</p>

<p>I dunno man, if you don&#39;t think it&#39;s funky that every story is positive about Hillary and negative about trump, I dunno what to tell you.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> used to have actual conspiracies with actual proof and an actual internally logical narrative.

But Trump has unleashed the idiotic &#39;feels&#39; as a valid replacement for rational thought and the level of proof here has become less than required for a Starwars fan theory.</p>

<p>My point is that online politcal warfare is <em>nothing</em> like WW2 propaganda of <em>any</em> type, be it Goebbels or Churchill or Truman. Your point is &#39;correct the record exists, therefore global conspiracy.&#39;</p>

<p>Of <em>course</em> both sides are trying any dirty exploit trick they can in social media, both sides would fire any campaign manager who didn&#39;t try and rightly so. &#39;Correct the record&#39; is just as partisan and just as prone to outright bullshit as Brietbart.

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, apologies for the wall of text. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t deny that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has gone downhill a lot, but there is still some quality floating around. Hell, look at reddit as a whole, shadow of its former self.</p>

<p>Plus you can&#39;t really know what proof is required for everyone. </p>

<p>Yeah the loud mouth Trump people are spamming the shit out of the sub, but that doesn&#39;t mean the people who talk about false flags, for example, are gone or that the general view of them from the people of reddit has changed. People have always shit on anyone talking about those ideas much in the same way you are now about Trumpers.</p>

<p>It just sounds like the type of thing people have always said about this sub. &quot;there&#39;s no rational thought, there&#39;s no proof.&quot; </p>

<p>There are still people around that do the things you mentioned, did you see the glyphosate post that was sticked for a bit?</p>

<p>And nah my point isn&#39;t that because CTR exists there&#39;s a global conspiracy.</p>

<p>That is just one of the many pieces of the puzzle. Yeah, some of the pieces do not have any hard evidence, they come from hunches and observation, on the other hand there is evidence a plenty if you are willing to look. </p>

<p>CTR is something that was brought to light recently and is actively happening, so of course people are gonna want to bring it up a lot ATM.</p>

<p>I feel like when you call it &quot;secret cabal&quot; it just minimizes the reality or possibility. Just sounds like something Alex Jones would say. (though apparently he&#39;s a major conservative news source now?)</p>

<p>But of course things like &quot;secret cabals&quot; exist, plenty of evidence for that. Just look at what happened after the second debate, Warren Buffett came out with his tax returns waving it in Trumps face.</p>

<p>Could it be that he was just doing so because Trump brought his name into it? Sure. Could it be that he did so to help his friend Hillary? Sure. Probably both. That isn&#39;t really proof that he&#39;s getting on the phone and making plans about it, but seems likely.</p>

<p>It&#39;s natural for people to gravitate to others similar to them. If you are in a country club with a billion dollar a year membership fee, you are hanging with other super rich folks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the just the natural course that these people are mingling, and the ones with similar views would be getting together and making plans. </p>

<p>The problem is, well they are super rich, and with the way the political system and government is set up right now, they can have a very, very large sway in the way things work and what happens.</p>

<p>That&#39;s when you get a &quot;secret cabal&quot; type of deal happening.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying 2 people control everything. A few hundred and a handful of large corporations paying people off, and giving a lot of money to politicians and other stuff, for sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;Correct the record&#39; is just as partisan and just as prone to outright bullshit as Brietbart. But that just means both sides are shit at being behind the scenes sneaky. It does not mean that there&#39;s a secret cabal running the world to install Hilary as empress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No doubt that CTR is going on for both sides, no doubt, and plenty of other topics, views, ideas. Trying to control opinion and sway people. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right though, it&#39;s deceit and lies and if there were an honest government at the reins it would be illegal. </p>

<p>But to say that there isn&#39;t a secret cabal, well that&#39;s just incorrect. The very definition is just that of a secret political faction. CTR was secret, now it&#39;s not, Trump&#39;s side of CTR is still secret. </p>

<p>How about Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton having that secret meeting on a plane, suddenly Hillary is off the hook, the FBI director seemingly covering for Hillary. If true wouldn&#39;t those things count as a cabal? Seems as though they are likely to me.</p>

<p>When you&#39;ve got the Bush family and many other right wing people endorsing good ol&#39; conservative Hillary, and the &quot;left&quot; wing democrats pushing for her, it seems obvious to me that shady shit is happening behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Honestly, I have no idea if a &quot;secret cabal&quot; is running the world. I think that it is possible and seems likely, but I can&#39;t prove it to you.</p>

<p>I do know that shit is corrupt as hell right now and there is way too much money, and power for people with money in the government and political system. It&#39;s rotten to the core and it&#39;s where the majority or problems come from. The only real way to &quot;MAGA&quot; is to get rid of that trash. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can suppose a secret cabal with some quite back channels, or you can just imagine a group of colleges and like minded self interested folks who network. One sounds cool, the other sounds like a council meeting. </p>

<p>But either way I don&#39;t think you grasp the abhorrence that people have for Trump as a person. Buffet will have needed zero input or direction from anyone you rub Trumps face in his tax returns like a puppy in its own shit. This man has De Niro making arthouse passion plays about how much he wants to punch him. His own defacto party head in Paul Ryan want nothing to do with him as do dozens of GOP stalwarts. Even rumors that his <em>own running mate</em> is done with him.</p>

<p>I know you think all politicians are trash, and you have a point. But supporting Trump as a protest is like pissing in your own drinking water to protest the water works. He <em>IS</em> trash. He is a TV product that came to life and believed its own promotional material. But his political role models, well thats less funny. </p>

<p>But the main point here is that it takes zero communication clandestine or otherwise and zero censorship to get to the media landscape we have right now. Just takes a large and wide ranging selection of the journalists online and a large and wide ranging number of reddit users for <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> to be rendered a wall of anti Trump &#39;propaganda. </p>

<p>This all actual turned after Trump held that &#39;press conference&#39; where he did an infomercial for his own building project and the said two sentences about Birtherism. He was actively trolling the &#39;main stream&#39; media and it was beautiful to watch the whole lot of em turn. For the whole Trump show since he announced his own running on escalator one, news anchors and field reporters had basked in the reflected rating of talking about Trump. Till he pulled that shit and as one organisim, INCLUDING FOX NEWS, went &quot;Fuck that guy&quot;. go back, find that date and match it up with 538&#39;s tracking. That&#39;s where he lost it, that&#39;s where he made this tape feeding frenzy inevitable.</p>

<p>So apply Occams razor and ask whats more likely, theres a secret organisation out to get Trump, or Trump is suffering from being universally despised after collapsing under the weight of his own bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>*Quick edit about your first sentence. I agree, one sounds good the other sounds bad. But the thing is it all depends on what said people were discussing. A plan to take over the government, or a plan to start a new business and go to the moon. *</p>

<p>Oh I grasp the abhorrence many have for Trump, but I also grasp that many have the same feelings for Hillary. (I mean she did have to steal the primaries.) </p>

<p>Yet many do not see her for what she really is, because every story on her spun in a positive light and that the real dirt on her is hidden by the media. And places like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> are havens for the pro Hillary circlejerk, just like the MSM. </p>

<p>I also grasp the amount of influence the media has over the population.</p>

<p>And back on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, you really don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything fishy going on there? I mean the difference is insane to me. Plus think about all those people from <a href="/r/thedonald">/r/thedonald</a>, they don&#39;t seem to have any trouble getting multiple posts to the top of reddit. I feel like they could easily get many stories in politics for their side to the top if the sub wasn&#39;t compromised. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t support Trump, I wouldn&#39;t in protest, and not because I like the guy. He can rot in hell in my books. He is the same and would be the same as any other republican president, or any democrat president for that matter.</p>

<p>I would never support Hillary for those same reasons, she is shit. </p>

<p>Which is why I often wonder how the hell are these two the choices people get, the world is fucked.</p>

<p>When I apply Occams razor I come to the conclusion that both of the candidates should be getting shit on by the media. Both are garbage and are both unfit to be president of the US. Yet when you look at the situation honestly you see that Hillary is held up, while Trump is put down.</p>

<p>Despite what he has done, and I don&#39;t dispute anything you wrote in your last comment about why the media hates him, why should that give Hillary a free pass and backing from the media when she is just as or even more corrupt.</p>

<p>To me, it&#39;s not about anyone being &quot;out to get Trump&quot; it&#39;s about putting the person who would benefit &quot;them&quot; the most into power. It was the same with Sanders, he got shit on while Hillary got all the praise. Remember the &quot;Do you feel as though you are standing in the way of history&quot; question to Bernie? The race was the same story the whole way, and she had to cheat to win even with all the media bias lending her a hand.</p>

Because this page provides more than just Trump/Hilary nonsense. 
There&#39;s a reason why this sub is predominantly anti-Hilary.. And that because it&#39;s called &#39;conspiracy&#39;....

Must of Donald&#39;s ridiculous antics are in plain sight. Hilary is the queen of coverups. Hence why r/conspiracy comes off as anti-Hilary. 
You missed my main point though... 
If anything, conspiracy should be filled with propaganda, not r/politics </p>

From the start until the point at which Sanders dropped out it was 99% pro-Sanders with the occasional &#39;You won&#39;t believe what happened at the republican debate&#39; post. Then we move into the denial period where it was nothing but posts about why sanders should still be in the race, followed by Denial-Overdrive after he endorses Clinton. Then i feel we had this period of people acting like &quot;I don&#39;t even like politics, can&#39;t wait for this stupid election to be over&quot; followed by what may have been 1 glimmer of hope, 1 solid week or so of solid, unbiased posts on US politics. Then 1 week that was oddly pro-Trump. And now here we are, 100% biased, not even trying to fucking hide correcting the record anymore posts 24/7, desperate grasps to try any and all they can to support Clinton and bash trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying someone could go there and have a legitimate conversation about their concerns HRC has been treated as being above the law, and there won&#39;t be an immediate influx of downvotes and grandstanding about how HRC is the most progressive candidate ever and that Trump is akin to the next Hitler? </p>

<p>Because that is exactly how every fucking conversation goes. Don&#39;t try to make those mods sound intelligent. They are dickheads that are attempting to cover up and remove any thought that doesn&#39;t agree with HRC being the anointed one. I think it is entirely possible to support HRC and have the ability to carry on a civil conversation about perceived weaknesses and strengths without the vitriol thrown around there.

<p>The latest leaks seem to describe the organization starting in a small office, but I imagine they&#39;ve had to shift to wfh with the numbers they seem to have now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton pays online saboteurs to take over communities. They&#39;ve taken over most of reddit. As for all the scares. I&#39;ve been leftist so long and I&#39;ve heard it all before how you HAD to vote democrat OR IT WAS ALL OVER. And after 16 years of democrats it&#39;s all in the crapper and abortion is as complicated as it was before. So this time I am with Trump and I don&#39;t care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just curious, what 16 years of democrats are you speaking of?  Democrat Obama has been in office for 8 years, Republican Bush for the 8 years prior to that.  If you are truly a &quot;leftist&quot; as you describe yourself, did you per chance support Ralph Nader in 2000 (thus insuring that Bush was elected over Gore)?  As for Abortion, that issue will always be complicated, no matter who is President, but will likely be more accessible in more places for longer period of time if Democrats are elected to the White House.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Clintons ran the USA for 2 consecutive terms (even though power mad Hillary was not elected) before Bush. The past 24 years have mostly not only been &quot;Democratic&quot; led but even Bush has come out in support of Obama and the Clintons. </p>

<p>So when I see: cities in ruins, racial riots, the Middle East wars still going, I blame it on the past 30 years of no change and that was mostly Democrat party incompetence.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really trust Republicans either. Only with them, because Trump is associating with them.</p>

<p>Trump is a firing squad and HRC is us continuing to bleed out slowly as we have for years. How do we want to die is what they are asking the people.</p>

<p>I have another idea, I think it is finally time to take off the chains. A massive domestic terrorist act that actually targets the halls of power may be enough to break the illusion as the tptb stomp down on us. Once the illusion is broken people will either wake up or at the very least we&#39;ll know that the people have officially lost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As support for particular candidates wax and wane, different folks who previously just lurked become more participatory and others hold back. It&#39;s not some grand conspiracy like T_D and others claim. Hillary support was heavily bashed when there seemed to be an alternative for libs, now she&#39;s the only option and is contrasted against another poor option... It&#39;s only natural that the tides have turned and more folks are comfortable with posting in support of her. No number of anecdotal &quot;well I don&#39;t know anyone who actually supports her&quot; quips from Donnie fanboys and Hillary haters actually makes it true... she&#39;s got plenty of support, she&#39;s always had a decent base of support, those people are becoming less afraid to participate now that blood is in the water and it&#39;s getting close to election day, simple as that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I wrote this Facebook post today:</p>

<p>I hate Trump
I also hate Hillary. 
Neither candidate is a good choice (yes I know there are other parties, so before you type that comment out, I want to make sure you know I&#39;m aware) for the future of America and frankly it&#39;s sad that we, the American people, have managed to dig ourselves in this hole.
But to many of you, too many of you, it actually seems like one of the candidates is the the second coming of christ and if I didn&#39;t have the internet to read up on things and see anything other than this echo chamber that has been created, I would totally believe the same thing you guys do.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t figured it out yet, I&#39;m speaking of the people who believe Hillary Clinton is the greatest thing that has ever graced this earth. Hillary Clinton, the &quot;woman who has never and will never do anything wrong&quot;.</p>

<p>We live in the age of universal communication, the internet, where people can talk freely with eachother and discuss so many different topics and opinions, and it&#39;s a wonderful and beautiful thing. However, unfortunately, we also live in a world where we can lock ourselves in a bubble and refuse to ever hear of the opinions and ideas and facts that contradict what we want to hear|believe. We all shout against censorship and praise the idea of freedom of speech, yet we willingly block thoughts contrary to our own.</p>

<p>When you do that, really, what makes you different than a sheep? Happy to graze on grass people allow you to graze on, never asking or even bothering to look and see if there are greener pastures elsewhere.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be a sheep. </p>

<p>This kind of action has angered me for a long while now and unfortunately for a friend of mine, they got the brunt of my frustration in the form of a comment I posted on a video they shared (That also had a long added post of their opinion about it, asking the question &quot;how anyone could possibly vote for Trump&quot; right after attacking him on his unfortunate and awful treatment of women in the past.)</p>

<p>So without further adieu, here is the comment I wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m honestly so tired of this one sided leftist chatter. It&#39;s he a good candidate? No. But neither is Hillary, yet I&#39;ve failed to see you mention a single unfortunate thing about her. It&#39;s frankly a real shame when someone willingly decides to completely ignore information about a candidate because they like them so damn much. It really makes you look like a shill. Trump has said some horribly racist things. Trump has also said some horribly sexist things. However he did not break any federal laws regarding a private server, nor destroying evidence, which is another huge offense. #stonetear</p>

<p>I can see that women&#39;s rights are a huge topic for you, however you seem blind to some of the facts about Hillary being anti-women as well. </p>

<p>When Bill Clinton had sexual relations with other women than Hillary, Hillary didn&#39;t take the anger out on him like she should have. She instead berated and destroyed the reputation of the women he had relations with. That&#39;s crazy. It&#39;s the exact same thing as, in this &quot;rape culture&quot; you speak of, claiming that &quot;she asked for it&quot; because of the clothes she was wearing at the time.</p>

<p>Stop this &quot;Hillary is the best thing since sliced bread&quot; thing you have been keeping up for the last half a year, because frankly she isn&#39;t. Not at all. Unless of course you completely filter out all information painting her in bad light (which there is a ton of) like what you have been seemingly doing for quite a long time now. </p>

<p>Hillary isn&#39;t fit to be president either. Not at all. Horrible security practices (and I mean freaking horrible) . Easily bought opinions. Constant flip flopping to popular social opinions to stay in power (do a youtube/Google search. Just one.). Having completely different opinions on what should be done with fracking, trade, and government practices when talking to people who will pay her tons of money to keep their practices afloat.</p>

<p>Stop drinking the kool-aid. You&#39;ve had enough.&quot;</p>

<p>Normally I wouldn&#39;t repost a comment I had written since it&#39;s just redundant and silly to do so, however I felt the need to as it was deleted very soon after. And by soon after, I really mean it was removed seconds after it was posted. Only then to receive a message immediately saying:
&quot;You&#39;re feedback or comment is not worth my time. Nor does it allow an open, healthy, welcoming discussion. Thank you, for being apart of the paradigm, in which people fucking attack one another instead of opening up a healthy conversation.&quot;</p>

<p>If discussion and opposing views is something you seek, then how is deleting|censoring posts holding opposing views logical in any way? Not to mention having &quot;open, healthy, and welcoming&quot;  in the same message as the aggressive, unfriendly word choice of &quot;fuck&quot;. </p>

<p>Anyway, here is a post you can&#39;t censor, nor will I delete any opposing responses anyone may wish to leave here.</p>

<p>Ill refrain from name dropping as I care far more about the content of my opinion on the matter of social echo chambers than I do about getting a jab back.</p>

<p>In closure, keep your eyes and ears open. Nothing and nobody is ever perfect and believing that shows nothing more than ignorance, or worse yet, blatant and willing disregard for the facts.</p>

<p>As it should be right now. Yes I&#39;m a liberal, and generally vote Democrat. But I gotta say, we need strong viable candidates in both parties for as long as we are a two party political system, for many reasons. Please Republicans, PLEASE, give me a Republican candidate I can hate and oppose because s/he is a conservative jerk, not because s/he is a crazy scary psychopath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world is brain dead. Point blank. Yeah I&#39;ll be voting, I was a rand Paul guy R.I.P. lol but for the main stream media to not bring up any talking points that trump hits on against the Clinton/Obama administration is just a complete disgrace to staying neutral and protecting our supposed democracy. The administration&#39;s of past tones have led to this point to where the American people want/need a change. The fact that Hillary has said she will tax the middle class should have DESTROYED her campaign, but it hasn&#39;t. Benghazi and all the pro abortion policies and laundering of money through all her foundations, which are in off-shore bank accounts btw, should have DESTROYED her campaign. Like I said the world is brain dead and we need a change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hate to break it to you, but the entire administrative structure of Reddit is pro-Hillary, pro-SJW, and anti-intellectualist.</p>

<p>The only reason we still use the site is because the platform is fully functional, fast, and convenient. Voat, no matter how hard it tries, simply does not have the hardware or the financial backing to provide a meaningful and equally functional platform.</p>

<p>The upside is that eventually Reddit will collapse, either because further efforts to censor the site become so intrusive and irritating that people simply flock somewhere else or the cancerous growth of sjw-ism becomes so rampant that meaningful dialogue cannot take place.</p>

<p>And much like a dying star, Reddit&#39;s remaining userbase, comprised of die-hards and fanatical nutjobs, will see this exodus as a confirmation of their flawed reasoning and declare victory, completely unaware that there is no one of the opposition around to hear them. Over time, the dim glow of their fervor will fade until they retreat back to 9gag, tumblr, and any other place they find shelter for their beliefs.</p>

<p>Or u/spez gets indicted on obstruction, destruction of evidence, and goes to jail and the site gets shut down.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s obviously very pro-Trump. But it&#39;s really good if you have questions about Mr. Trump and his campaign. It&#39;s a discussion sub, so any question is a valid one (as long as it&#39;s related to policy/campaign) </p>
