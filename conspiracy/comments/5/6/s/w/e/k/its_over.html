<p>I&#39;d also suggest prayer. And going to church. Even if you don&#39;t believe (now). Try to find a good pastor; if the first church doesn&#39;t grab you, keep trying. Took me a while, but it has changed my life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not easy to find a good church. I&#39;ll give you that. But a healthy one with a wise pastor is a blessing. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t really feel like I&#39;m sitting around waiting for change, either. Feel like I&#39;m a small cog in the great Divine Will of what&#39;s yet to come. That&#39;s what I pray to be as well. </p>

<p>But I do agree &quot;the church&quot; at large has been co-opted by the so-called &quot;elite&quot; as a method of control. </p>

<p>Very quickly everyone without a gun and/or the correct security measures when browsing conspiracy sites by that point will be purged by Russian and Chinese troops along with ISIS mercenaries and Mexican gangs. If you want to know how it looks like, go watch &quot;The checkist&quot;.</p>

<p>Plus starvation will make a key as well in the beginning of the nwo so stock up lots of food to survive at least 1 year.</p>
