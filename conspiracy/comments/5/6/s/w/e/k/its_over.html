       If you read "The Art of War," you'll see one of the top pieces of advice from Sun Tzu is "When you are at your weakest, you must make it look as if you are at your strongest." Keep that in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also suggest prayer. And going to church. Even if you don't believe (now). Try to find a good pastor; if the first church doesn't grab you, keep trying. Took me a while, but it has changed my life.

       The church is another institution by which the elite control us. What would you do if you didn't believe in an afterlife? Would you be content to sit back and wait for change? The elite love a pious people.

       It's not easy to find a good church. I'll give you that. But a healthy one with a wise pastor is a blessing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't really feel like I'm sitting around waiting for change, either. Feel like I'm a small cog in the great Divine Will of what's yet to come. That's what I pray to be as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do agree "the church" at large has been co-opted by the so-called "elite" as a method of control.

       World war 3 is a theatre that basically ends in no more than 3 months and consists of hordes of russian and chinese tanks and infantry taking down the weak and corrupt western armies of US, EU, Japan and Korea.

       Very quickly everyone without a gun and/or the correct security measures when browsing conspiracy sites by that point will be purged by Russian and Chinese troops along with ISIS mercenaries and Mexican gangs. If you want to know how it looks like, go watch "The checkist".

       Edit: The fact that this subreddit is constantly barraged by crazy posts to help discredit some of the actual conspiracy shit that's occurring in the world, this shit needs downvoted.  There is absolutely no substance here.

       Whenever my morale gets low, I put all my sad thoughts into a whisper box that I keep under my bed.  That way I can't spread my shitty morale around.

       Some days I just want to run through fields of daisies and shed some thoughtful tears while scrapbooking.  Oh well... I guess the daisies can wait until after we've defeated satanic evil.

       Hey brother. Hang in there. You need to look at the bigger picture.  Yes the world is shit, but there is also an awakening happening.  The rebel alliance is being formed.  The cabal that is currently in control knows this.  They are trying to stamp it out before it catches fire. Realize that their truly evil games are played out over decades and sometimes even centuries. Keep reading, keep researching, keep communicating, keep fighting.

       He's also called the Good Shepherd. Distinct from all other "shepherds" who have gone before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine." - John 10:11-14

       Forced slavery, the draft, police state killing everyone off. I feel like it's imminent and it makes me really anxious to know I won't be able to have children.
