        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Greetings.</p>

<p>Long time lurker here, and in various other places scattered across the vast reaches of the internet. I have noticed something alarming going on, that I hope many of you will open your eyes to. </p>

<p>We all know by now about the Hillary Shilling in r/Politics and how stupid it truly is. But now what I want you to do, is put down your perspectives for a minute. Scroll through the posts and comment sections of r/Conspiracy and what you will see is pretty interesting.</p>

<p>While r/Politics is filled with Hillary Supporters, and anyone who supports Trump is immediately shit on, r/Conspiracy is the exact opposite. There is all this pro-Trumping going on and anyone who says they support Hillary is just a shill paid by the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at this more closely.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of the phrase &#39;divide and conquer?&#39; I&#39;m sure many of you have. For those that have not, it is when you take a group of people, and cause them to argue with one another about essentially meaningless nonsense. The reason is because when you split a group of people down the middle like that, it is far less likely they will work together and fight the powers that be.</p>

<p>Can you not see that&#39;s what this is? I even saw a post blaming &quot;jews&quot; on here, as if every single jew in the United States somehow has these strange meetings at night with other jews where they plot the destruction of the world. I saw another post about how women never had it badly in the course of world history.</p>

<p>Be logical, friends. 
The time is now.</p>

<p>Step away from your perspective, and look at the bigger picture. For a long time, this has been a great sub. For a longer time, the underground groups of people who know that the elite will do whatever they want for power have tried to work together and spread the word. Why are you hindering this?</p>

<p>Be Anti-Hillary.
Do not be Pro-Trump.
Do not support people who hide under the guise of freedom and sovereignty when they want nothing more than power and wealth. 
Do not fall for the trick.
Don&#39;t divide, do not be conquered.</p>

<p>EDIT: This was an interesting experiment. What you will find in the comment section, is that there are people having a normal, rational conversation, and then there are the &#39;outliers.&#39; The outliers all seem to have these similarities, and work in a hive mind: pro-trump no matter what, everything is the fault of jews, refusal to acknowledge that trump is part of the two party system even know he is running as a republican, and so forth. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting read. My personal conspiracy theory is that while r/politics is basically the Hillary subreddit, r/conspiracy is turning into the opposite, where those who are the die-hard Trump fans, won&#39;t even acknowledge they are supporting the very system that they oppose by voting for a republican. </p>

<p>Take a look. Let me know what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but that is the problem.</p>

<p>Its all just a mindgame; a trick. The entire purpose of having a two-party system is the illusion of choice. When you choose republican or democrat, you are allowing one of them to win. They both know this, which is why regardless of what anyone believes, they work together to uphold their two-party system.</p>

<p>Voting for either is equally terrible and it is destroying the United States. I would expect a mainsteam news junkie to choose one of the choices laid before their eyes. I would expect a true seeker of truth and justice to vote for someone who actually gives a damn about truth and justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies... is a foolish idea. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy. Then it should be possible to replace it, every four years if necessary, by the other party which will be none of these things but will still pursue, with new vigor, approximately the same basic policies.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are synonyms for the word justice as defined by Merriam-Webster: fairness, justness, fair play, fair-mindedness, equity, evenhandedness, impartiality, objectivity, neutrality, disinterestedness, honesty, righteousness, morals, morality. </p>

<p>Using that, I think we can all come up with some sort of similar idea about what Justice truly means. </p>

<p>Secondly, this blaming of everything on jews things has be a bit perplexed. Where does this come from? In the entire history of the world, every time someone blames a single group of people for the mistakes of everyone else, it never ends up well for either party.</p>

<p>That said, would you mind elaborating on why you specifically believe that one of the largest issues is the Jews? I ask because I find that I have a lot of jewish friends, and none of them seem to meet up in underground caves and talk about taking over the planet. I mean that jokingly; harshness not meant.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t understand that particular conspiracy so if you could elaborate a little from your specific perspective that would be fantastic.</p>

<p>Read <em>The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</em> to see the policy positions, and then read the public statements of every political jew in the last century (yes, including the bolsheviks) to see the facts behind them.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In fact, the Founding Fathers warned us about the threat from a two party system.</p>

<p>John Adams said:</p>

<p>There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution.</p>

<p>George Washington agreed, saying in his farewell presidential speech:</p>

<p>The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries, which result, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public Liberty</p>

<p>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight,) the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.</p>

<p>It serves always to distract the Public Councils, and enfeeble the Public Administration. It agitates the Community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.</p>

<p>There is an opinion, that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the Government, and serve to keep alive the spirit of Liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in Governments of a Monarchical cast, Patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular character, in Governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And, there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and assuage it.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s how I look at it, and going to use your post as an example.  In 2016 the biggest problem we have beyond all else is everybody wants to tell everybody else what they are doing wrong.  Nobody wants to look in the mirror and say you know what, I should probably make sure I&#39;m doing the best I can before I presume to have the moral high ground and tell everybody else what they are doing wrong.  So instead of fixing the problems from the ground up, we&#39;re trying to fix them from the top-down.  </p>

<p>In other words, we&#39;ve gone from &quot;Leading by Example&quot; to &quot;Leading by me telling you what to do but not doing it myself.&quot;  IMO, we need to get back to the former.  </p>

<p>This is not the manufacturing industry or the entertainment industry. You have got to be joking, or trolling at this point to compare P.T. Barnum to the leadership of the country and the ability to utilize executive orders.</p>

<p>Its not my opinion. In fact its the opinion of 63% of the population of the United States. That is his unfavorability rating. Hillary&#39;s is almost the same number.</p>

<p>The fact that the majority of people are not in favor of either of them, and yet here they are, the leading candidates, should be a gigantic red flag to any unbiased, logical person.</p>

<p>However whether he believes it or not, congress still pulls most of the strings in the background. They will not allow him to take down any part of the system that will jeopardize the two-party system. Until we get someone other than a republican or democrat, this will keep happening until people realize that the solution is to vote for a different group of people. </p>

<p>French Revolution was brutal. While effective, I think (hopefully) nowadays we have better ways to handle things. I will say though, that the French people were pretty quick about it compared to our current method. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand. If Congress won&#39;t &quot;allow him to take down any part of the system that will jeopardize the two-party system&quot;, then how will a third-party candidate? </p>

<p>And unfortunately, I&#39;m only half joking about the French Revolution. I really do believe it will take something of serious magnitude (a mass revolt) to fully change this system we&#39;re in. No single politician will be able to do what we need done, but I&#39;m seeing a tiny pin dot of light in Donald Trump supporters that are saying enough is enough. What his campaign has done to wake people up is the catalyst I refer to. Just look at all of the corruption exposure we&#39;ve seen now. MSM will never be trusted again. The DNC cannot be trusted again. Even the party he&#39;s running with are being exposed for who they really are, corporate ran shills. Things like this are a catalyst for much bigger change. If anything, the climate is heating up. </p>

<p>With all of this being said I just want you to know that I agree with the bipartisan system being a complete sham. I don&#39;t agree with it at all. But, unfortunately, here we are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry about that. I&#39;m back on. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not Jewish. I&#39;m Irish and German. My family were mostly poor bog farmers before the famine, and on the other side, tool makers and wagon wheel builders. When my Irish ancestors came to the USA they were seriously oppressed, and couldn&#39;t find decent work for honest pay. That is why I am concerned about blaming a specific group of people. Because of the innocent people that end up getting hurt (at the fault of the blame game, that the elite like to play up).</p>

<p>Women didn&#39;t have the right to wear pants until a short while ago, nor did they have the right to claim their husbands raped them until the mid 1980&#39;s because previously the courts ruled that a husband cannot rape their own wife. Even today, we see a lot of male rapists getting off the hook in under 6 months. That right there should say something very clear about how women are viewed in our society, off paper.</p>

<p>But my one dream, that I&#39;ve had since I was a child, was that I would wake up in the morning, and we would work together as a species, not as people who identify with geographical map locations. Think of how advanced we could have been if we had made it there sooner. Eh, its just a dream though. </p>

<p>Aw man, double whammy of historic abuse at the hands of others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Women didn’t have the right to wear pants</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IT’S NOT A GODDAMN RIGHT. Holy shit.</p>

<p>There are 2 types and 4 subtypes of power: Conventional and Unconventional, with the subgroups of Political, Economic, Educational and Social. Social is the only Unconventional.</p>

<p>Women are the majority of the electorate, and so as a group have more Political power. Women control the majority of the currency, and thus have more Economic power. Women are more likely to be teachers and course setters, and so have more Educational power. Socially, many norms–such as men giving up seats on the bus for women, or competing for women’s affections–mean that women likely have more Social power. We can quantify conventional power, and women possess more of it, but we can’t quantify unconventional power. However, conventional can influence unconventional, and so we end up with women having AT LEAST equal power, if not superior power, over men.</p>

<p>Women are the majority of the electorate, and in a democracy they can thus exercise their will. If all men vote for a male president and all women vote for a female president, there will be a female president. Further, the large amounts of Federal and State authorities for women–as well as the female oriented pressure groups flooding the system–mean that women exercise EVEN MORE political power than simply voting. For example, in the UK, there’s an insider pressure group with regular privileged access to government officials called the Fawcett Society. It’s Sectional, meaning it supports women as a group and all of their interests. There’s no such group for men. This means that women’s issues have the ear of the government and men’s do not. It’s easier to get the government to help with women’s issues as a result.</p>

<p>Next, Gynarchy by Proxy–the rule of women, without conventional power. For example, women can influence their husbands (who have power) to use that for their benefit. It’s why there are laws in place harming men and helping women, even with a majority male government. Take the lack of a Rape Shield law providing anonymity for the accused. The London Feminist Network fought this law, and without any conventional political power, they influenced politicians to vote it down. This hurts men and helps women.</p>

<p>We see, all throughout time, women who get their way without even needing to vote. In 1917, a group of men took to the Supreme Court, protesting the draft as unconstitutional. They were told that since they could vote, they could be drafted. This is law in the USA. Women on the other hand, are not drafted, but can still vote. Thus, without even needing to do anything, women gained a right without a corresponding responsibility and men did not. This, even in a time with few to no female politicians, a government decision hurt men and helped women.</p>

<p>Women control the majority of the income in the USA. They control most domestic spending, household income, GDP, etc. Women are the spenders, men are the earners, on average. Thus, advertisement companies cater to females. Without even producing half of the GDP of a country, women control it. Currency is power, and so women have more power. This one’s fairly simple. Pahl and Vogler found that most households use “pooling” for income, where there is a shared bank account and both partners withdraw from it. Women contribute less and withdraw more on average. Women control not only their currency but the currency of their men. Its why Toy Boys are so uncommon when compared to gold-digging women. Men will spend lavishly to impress and help women, and the reverse is simply not true. Social norms reinforce this situation, such as the convention of men paying the check and women eating the free meal. Or men paying the bills in their name whilst the deed of the house is in both names.</p>

<p>Women are more likely to teach. Girls do better in every level of education–for reasons unrelated to their skills–getting more degrees, better grades, etc. Syllabi are designed for girls, with an emphasis on verbal skills and the like over analytical skills. Women are also far more likely to be in decision making positions around education, boards of education, and similar.</p>

<p>Even with this, as well, there are many laws and incentives designed to help women achieve in the (few) areas they don’t. Girls Into Science and Technology and Women In Science and Education, for example. As well as the fact that Brunel University is paying female post grads £15k extra to do engineering. When women lagged behind in education, laws were made to “fix” education. Now that men do, people talk about hegemonic masculinity and the male gaze and things like that, and so they want to “fix” men. When women were disadvantaged, we “fixed” the system. Now that men are, we refuse to change it at all. Also, power over education is power over youth, and power over youth is power over all. Women influence the tender years of life, whereas men do not, and so successive generations become even more gynocentric and indoctrinated with even more pro-female, anti-male perspectives.</p>

<p>Social is the most nebulous and hardest to quantify. So here’s a simple list of some social norms which benefit women over men.</p>

<ul>
<li>  Men paying for women’s meals</li>
<li>  Men saving women seats</li>
<li>  Men laying down jackets for women to step over puddles</li>
<li>  Men giving up lifeboat seats for women/women and children first in all emergencies</li>
<li>  Men being drafted</li>
<li>  Men being the ones to explore downstairs when you hear a suspicious voice</li>
<li>  Men having the burden of starting romantic interactions and bearing potential rejection</li>
<li>  Men paying alimony/child support and women not</li>
<li>  Men moving out of the house they pay for when a separation/divorce happens</li>
<li>  Men working extra hours so that women can stay home with the kids </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m sure you can think of many more. </p>

<p>I am not a globalist. I am a man of science. Ants, one of the unfortunately lesser species on the planet work together for the greater good of the species. This likely happened over millions of years of evolution. A single ant is weak, but many ants working together create advanced housing in an extremely short period of time.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be killed for my dream? I may be. But many good men have died for their dreams, and many of those good men had dreams freedom, which is why you get freedom today. I do not fear people like you. Death is nothing to fear. What I fear is that generations down the line will be stuck in this system where its considered normal to act like neanderthals when someone has a different religion/skin tone. That is what is scary. Death is peaceful.</p>

<p>I&#39;m wrong? So far I have been completely right. The truth is, that we are a species, and in every study that involved the workplace, working as a team yields better results than working as individuals in the same room. </p>

<p>Before you devolve into calling me a liberal or whatever, I do not support any government that doesn&#39;t alot full power to all people, in the form of a direct democracy, period.  </p>

<p>So prove it.</p>

<p>He’s not a politician. He has no peers.</p>

<p>No. Either stop putting words in my mouth or stop posting.</p>

<p>Magical. No one said this. Fuck off or have a real argument. Trump is the first step. Always has been.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t truly believe this right? He has a large amount of peers, and near all of them are extremely wealthy. Just because he has nobody standing next to him during a speech hyping up the audience, doesn&#39;t mean he has no peers. </p>

<p>This is not Criss Angel. That is, &quot;What you see is what you get.&quot; This is a crooked couple trying to point fingers at eachother, and laughing hysterically as the populace flocks to choose one, while the people who use reason and logic are sitting on the sidelines with popcorn.</p>

<p>You were speaking from the context of the political establishment, and thus he has no peers in that regard. He’s not the only billionaire on Earth.</p>
