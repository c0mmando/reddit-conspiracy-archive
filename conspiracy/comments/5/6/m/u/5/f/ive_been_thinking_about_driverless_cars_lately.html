    <div class="md"><p>If a generation of people have never seen a car wreck that would be big time news like a air plane wreck they happen but it makes big time news.  That car crash would be investigated like a murder. Also are all new cars made by the government or by corporations? Why wouldnt the government just crash trains with dissidants now? Cause its way to obvious thats why. </p>

<p>Good point. The mortality rate from car accidents is only around 10-15 per 100,000, driverless cars will improve our standard of living, but is it really worth it, for the loss of control we will suffer.</p>

<p>muh white people destroying the Earth!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the truth:  If we stopped allowing the Third World to export its excess population to the First World, the birth rates in the First World (where, as you correctly indicate, the rates of resource consumption are higher) would stabilize in a sustainable way.</p>

<p>Immigrants in Western countries consume resources at First World levels but breed at Third World levels. This creates an obvious demographic imbalance with severe political, cultural, and environmental implications.</p>

<p>If anything is doing so, free-trade globalism and open borders are what&#39;s killing the Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I don&#39;t get about the elite and global warming. The earth has a natural way of keeping homeostasis which on the way to this would kill off a huge chunk of the population. Supposly they want population control but why wouldn&#39;t they want this. I know they would have a way of surviving and keeping a portion of the population alive. I&#39;m not a scientist and I have no way of ever physically measuring carbon so I just believe what he says based on faith that he has no political ulterior motive Even though we don&#39;t believe any other portion of what&#39;s fed to us in life. My question is do you never doubt global warming at all based the bullshit we hear on a day to day basis?btw I&#39;m not saying I believe one way or the other. I really can&#39;t have a stance since I can&#39;t know for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because global warming will raise sea levels and will have a massive monetary impact that the elites don&#39;t wanna have to foot the bill for. quite frankly there are very few people(read none) who are educated on the issues completely and don&#39;t think global warming exists and will be an issue in the future. i was on the fence but studied climate science in several classes at uni.

<p>I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll even bother outlawing user-driven cars.  Most people will move to the tech without being forced. The rest of us, who still like to drive, will see our insurance premiums go up and up until we simply can&#39;t afford to drive any more. &quot;You&#39;re not as safe as the bots.&quot;   Also, as self-driving cars and trucks become the majority of vehicles on the road, they will adopt computer-to-computer coordination tactics, which will allow greater efficiency for them (for example, drafting each other, bumper-to-bumper), but will make it much more difficult for human drivers to fit in to the traffic stream.</p>
