    <div class="md"><p>Even his rape isn&#39;t as bad as his ongoing relationship with pederast Epstein and their frequent trips aboard the Lolita express, Hillary&#39;s padowan relationship to sweet ole genocidist Henry Kissinger, or the fact that in the 80s Bill as governor signed off on knowingly tainted prison blood collected by a friend whose derivative plasma factor 8 pharma product gave some 60,000 hemophiliac children in canada and europe AIDS and Hepatitis C, and then allowed Bayer to take the blame.  This last story to me is the most important because it shows them as psychopaths, who present themselves as hard-scrabble political bumpkins from arkansas who worked their way up in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to be very clear.  Anyone who supports the Clintons after knowing these things is an immoral person.  I&#39;ve already decided to never contact my uncle again, because he will not respond to me after I sent him the Arkansas Prison Blood scandal documentary and all the evidence of my research.  He calls it &#39;propaganda&#39; instead of History.  </p>

<p>So he has revealed himself in my mind, to be a psychopath.  Sheridan says, &#39;never contact again&#39;.  I&#39;m down with that.  He was a crap uncle anyway--stole my fries and such.  If he can&#39;t trust his nephew who is trying hard to prevent another Hitler from rising to power (and yes I do mean that), then I can&#39;t help him.  Contrariwise, he&#39;s compared Trump to hitler.  I don&#39;t have any evidence to suggest Trump has done anything close to what the Clintons have done.  He&#39;s conducted <em>lawfare</em> on people (used his money to tie people up in court, even if he&#39;s going to lose), which is shitty and unethical and bullying, but it&#39;s legal and he&#39;s probably had reasons to do it.  What the clintons have done is both illegal and immoral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way you fight is like this:</p>

<p>Throwaway Twitter account and follow every single MSM account and &#39;journalist&#39; account and counter each one of their posts with the facts, while asking why they aren&#39;t covering &#39;insert sourced story&#39;</p>

<p>Do the same on MSM websites that allow comments at the bottom (this is wht NPR got rid of theirs because people were calling out their false illusion narrative bullshit)</p>

<p>Do the same thing on YouTube and reddit, and that&#39;s how you fight the ww3 information war we are currently in</p>
