    <div class="md"><p>Maybe not, but the stuff about the clickers is a massive mental illness red-flag. There is nothing wrong with checking up on your mental well-being, and if you&#39;ve got a full bill of health- then you can be certain some shady shit is going on.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ve got to add in response to you saying &quot;I&#39;m not a mass shooter type&quot;, schizophrenia usually doesn&#39;t present in a &#39;mass shooter&#39; way. Nor do a lot of other mental illness&#39;. Sometimes people can appear to be completely asymptomatic.</p>

<p>If this was nutty speak, I wouldn&#39;t post it. I guess it all reads nutty no matter what, but it happened, and there are still some strange things happening, but they have vastly slowed down.</p>

<p>If I was mentally ill, wouldn&#39;t the imagined stimuli still be at a consistent level, or had gotten even worse? </p>

<p>I may have a few things wrong, it&#39;s bound to happen, but the logical, intelligence-driven clicks are real... and a really stupid ass way of communicating with someone, imo. Mind control, I guess, but when it turned more into communication, it was terribly innificiant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, I&#39;m not trying to talk down to you or anything. I just have a lot of family and friends who have dealt with, and are dealing with mental illness&#39; and your story stuck a chord with me. </p>

<p>It really depends on what&#39;s going on, and before I go further this is my opinion, and I am in no way a medical professional. </p>

<p>The rate of occurrences of stimuli don&#39;t necessarily have to follow a logical order, nor need to stay consistent, it would depend on what is wrong in the first place.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, no problem on you, my bad for being defensive. I mean, it does sound wacky, and I&#39;m  sure I have some things wrong, but the people following me, the clickers and the hacked comps are an absolute, or I am truly insane and have lost complete touch with reality, but I still function as an adult, still pay bills, and soon will start working full time again, as I took a few months off. </p>

<p>What I don&#39;t  understand is what arm of the government, as I must assume that it is an arm of the gov, and maybe another org, would do these things to me, and for what goal? All they managged to do was harm me profesdionally, temporarily, harm a few relationships, and waste my time, and a great deal of thiers. I am not seeing the profitable tradeoff for their resources spent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats okay, you weren&#39;t being overly defensive, I just wanted to make sure I didn&#39;t come across as insincere. Like I said you could be for the most part asymptomatic, but I should stop trying to diagnose you. I think the best thing you can do for now (although you probably already have) is just discuss everything with your wife and ask her how she truly feels, and what she thinks should be done about this whole situation.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, we&#39;ve discussed it at length, many times.</p>

<p>She knows that one, possibly two, groups of people set out to control/hurt/ me using various methods, and attempted to kill me on three occasions.</p>

<p>I promise you this, there wasn&#39;t a 120mph car chase over nothing... and just so much more things that happened that I didn&#39;t even post in the story. It was bad, absurdly fucked up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to delete this post, and this account now, as there are some things in the works, and I&#39;d like to just move on with my life if we can calm things down.</p>

<p>I have a few meetings, and depending on those meetings, determines if things get bad again, or if we all can just move forward. If I die, I have things positioned where I will not go un&#39;avenged&#39;, and I promise that I was/have been fairly clever about it all. If others die, I understand that I die, and have come to peace with that sometime ago.</p>

<p>It is very surprising just how crazy life can become, even when you try to stay out of the way/mind your own business. What a world!</p>

<p>It is/was happening to my friend. I sat him down and told him he might have schizophrenia. Now I guess they&#39;ve decided I&#39;m more of a target as this shits daily harassment. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been of sound mind.. Until this year now almost everyone thinks I&#39;m crazy or on drugs. There&#39;s a few observant ones that pay attention to little shit and they for the most part believe me. I have one friend that definitely believes me as he&#39;s been stalked walking home twice now. Oh shit ! I forgot he has footage that needs to be reviewed as he was stalking the stalkers.. Totally fucking forgot. Damn.</p>

<p>I&#39;m taking the fight to them, in my case here in Cali it&#39;s government... Well major corporations, feds and government subcontractor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I&#39;m sorry but I seriously don&#39;t understand most of what you just wrote, I think you might need some serious mental help?</p>

<p>I tried to read the whole thing, I&#39;m from Edmond, OK so I was obviously interested. I&#39;m sorry you had a bad experience here but I think it&#39;s actually a really nice place and people are pretty friendly for the most part. I&#39;ve travelled to NYC and other northern areas and I was really surprised by how different people are there. I never thought it was weird to smile at strangers or hold the door open for someone and I got some very cold responses up there. Anyway, you kept mentioning that people seemed nervous around you a lot. Do you think it might be because you had a negative stereotype about Oklahoma before you even moved there and probably attributed that to its residents as well? You know like you were probably being an asshole and rude to people.</p>

<p>Wow, way to assume and attack at the same time. He was probably on edge and people sensed that and didn&#39;t want to set him off. I have my doubts that everyone was a part of his ordeal, but my guess is that definitely something was going on aside from him just being crazy.</p>

<p>I needed asthma meds, thus the doc appointment. Yep, he rear ended me on my way to the doc apt.</p>

Something big is going down and I can only try to connect the dots with what I&#39;ve already learned. It helps to try to keep tabs on govt programs, government contracts and local bullshit. It also helps to pay attention to everything. Everything, but don&#39;t get sucked in. </p>

<p>You need to fight. They started this BS, we have to end it. As far as killing you.. I don&#39;t know... Supposedly another in this town was going on about the same stuff I am, they called him crazy and put him on meds, the same meds he overdosed on.</p>

<p>So far they&#39;ve tried to inflict mental damage, get me to crack. Don&#39;t buy it, don&#39;t fall apart. I almost cracked but I&#39;ve had my victories. </p>

<p>Victories for me have been : getting a good friend to stalk them. Uncovering my shady neighbors real name and talking to someone who was/is trying to sue him (he was contacted by the secret service). Catching them launching a drone on video, setting things in motion which led to the destruction of said drone. Finding their password and kicking off the admin. Gaining access to the system folder and grabbing all I could. Using some files I grabbed to gain access to even more info, Macing one of the fuckers while he was trying to sneak into my house, drawing blood with booby traps twice (razors were smeared with cat shit) and in my opinion/experience connecting the dots a bit, trying to see the whole picture. I also surprised one of the fucks with a crossbow and we had a fun game of &quot;hide n go chickenshit.&quot; I also might have an ace up my sleeve right now, depends on how I play it. They actually left me alone for a few days, but not today.</p>

<p>So fight. They probably weren&#39;t expecting me to be this much trouble, but hey, don&#39;t start a fight unless you plan on finishing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. </p>

<p>Luckily I&#39;m of sound enough mind to not hear voices or talk to clicks. Really I try not to let it get to me. I give the stalkers I see numerous times nicknames and even wave to them in public. </p>

<p>Right now the gang is &quot;Toddy&quot;, Bikebud and the bikebros, Joggybitch, laughyman, bugfucker/shitfingers and their loyal raccoon companion Pierre. </p>

<p>Their real goal is they&#39;re really a very old powerful group of people in power who obsess over dick pics. They pick an individual with a dick they like and stop at nothing to amass a few TB hard drive full of super high resolution dick (and some ass) pics. These pictures are going to power the next Global world leader : A very powerful AI based on the thought patterns of dicks around the world.....</p>

<p>I&#39;m joking. See I can make light of being under surveillance. Really though when it first started I thought it was just law enforcement doing a sting as I might&#39;ve had more marijuana growing than allowed. I&#39;d been busted before for selling weed and assumed this was some &quot;neighborhood clean up.&quot; </p>

<p>My friend was gangstalked before I was. He was sure it was satanists and then he thought I was with them and that tried to kill him. I&#39;ve seen that first hand and don&#39;t want to go anywhere near that mindset. Everyone in town definitely calls him crazy and it&#39;s sad it&#39;s effected him like that and that quickly.</p>

<p>There&#39;s definitely something going on and I&#39;m just going to hang on for the ride, be observant and collect what evidence I can to expose this madness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you run around and criticize the government, illuminati or zionists on a regular basis and they already knew about it, and you were not the regular type that just visits conspiracy sites and posts comments in them, but actually did something like criticizing some major secret society (Skull &amp; bones, B&#39;nai B&#39;rith etc.) openly and in the public (Internet counts too)?</p>

<p>If you really did go around criticizing S&amp;B or B&#39;nai B&#39;rith or any other secret society (Especially obscure ones that the public rarely know) openly and don&#39;t know who you are talking to (So watch out for businessman, doctors, teachers etc.) and/or don&#39;t do the correct procedures to be cyber-safe, it won&#39;t be surprising if this happened to you.</p>

<p>By the way anyone who actually owns a conspiracy site or researches conspiracies are under the risk of being data-gathered and purged in the future, but criticizing or researching some stuff (Mind Control, Secret Societies etc.) will garner more risk than some others like the presidential election frauds or color revolutions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the comment.</p>

<p>I do not follow conspiracy sites, other than the off-chance of watching a video about UFOs in a joking &quot;B&quot; movie sort of way. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a fuck about secret societies or w/e. That&#39;s their business.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who you are talking about S&amp;B and stuff, sorry.</p>

<p>No, I think that I&#39;m a fairly innocent guy, maybe some parties, maybe some speeding in a car, but nothing too bad, and, well... I just don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>S&amp;B is &quot;skull and bones&quot; and is the secret society that George bush was in. People had been assassinated or fired and unable to get any form of employment after they talked about it in the television.</p>

<p>I hope you are not a paranoid maniac, but it seems like a situation that can only happen when you or someone else you known was trying to expose or research them (Or any other conspiracy that can end up in assassination/unemployment/persecution upon researching or criticizing). </p>

<p>Could it be someone you knew closely was trying to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Research Mind control</li>
<li>Expose Secret Societies</li>
<li>Expose Russian Crimes</li>
</ul>

<p>And they did not let you know or did not perform the correct cybersafe procedures before they do so?</p>

<p>You said that it isn&#39;t you, so i think that it was related to someone you know. </p>

<p>If really and i mean really nobody is into these type of stuff (you could not be aware of it), you could had been subject to mind control or you need mental help.</p>

<p>And be noted that the suspect i say was NOT simply trying to criticize Israel or the Jews, those are censored by Jewish lobbies like anti-defamation league which had their personnel in sites like facebook or wikipedia.</p>

<p>The suspect should had been actively tried to in-depth research and expose the crimes of those secret societies or criticize them in the public. And they could had been done so openly and publicly (Which includes the internet).</p>

<p>This does not seem to be the thing they will do against a person if he simply regulated sites like this reddit or infowars and sometimes stopping by and make some comments. </p>

<p>(What they are doing against this is waiting for the big day and send all of the internet records to &quot;peacekeepers&quot; and use them to purge suspects). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Duuuude, I think I know what it feels like to be in your position. Not with nearly the level of connections like you hacve illucidated, but still, some well-known names cropped up in my experience. And I have this strange theory that it has to do with the nature of the cosmos as well... Um, how do I address your incredibly interesting, forthright and brave accounting? Thanks would be first. To those experiencing something similar, even if they are delusional (I don&#39;t think you are being delusional like u/cthulu1221 is suggesting. In fact, I am suspect of this user from a previous post... Gotta give em cred for trippin&#39; and stuff, seems edgy, but to highlight the &#39;hating Oklahoma&#39; aspect of your story as a falsification or exaggeration is a bit weird. We all know that generally normal people are normal... I will say that outsiders in OK are not smiled at.), your post gives a ray of hope that they are not alone, because this ordeal that you were subjected to is very isolating and I am just happy you had a strong wife to go through it with.</p>

<p>I am gonna keep adding to this because I have a bit to say and qusstions to relate to see what experiences are similar. Definitely the Airforce and church are similar themes, and while I never experienced the clicking to my awareness, it is easy to see how a technique like this could work. I definitely felt like I was receiving suggestions, and had to perform a but of mental jiu-jitsu to keep my free will intact. Definitely all mainstream doctors are gonna seem like, or are part of the system, whether they are aware or not. Essentially, you have been targeted as someone with a strong will and drive for true patriotic action, and they desire to break your will down lest you influence the public in ways that might pick up momentum. Even little sparks are dangerous to this pile of dried up corpses running our government.</p>

<p>I guess my first question would be, do you feel like you were possibly grromed at any point, do you think it is possible there was a plan in the case you had acted upon your subliminal cues properly? ( I am assuming thats why nothing hapoened at the airport) The T-Gel shit is terrifying btw. I hope your helth is alright. You need to do a lot to destress! Shit I know how stressful it can be. Took me months to  feel somewhat normal again.</p>

<p>Finally, I hope you find balance and good fortune in your life again. Stay strong in your beliefs, relax, and try to enjoy your life. I wish I knew how to stop these people from this assinine behavior.</p>

Hired you for IT stuff etc. And stop talking that you are gonna get killed... i mean maybe, but if you lose hope, then it implicates you, makes you look delusional.

<p>Clearly u/lovinglifemoo has no desire to seek mental help of any sort as he is completely convinced that this is all real which is <em>really, really sad.</em></p>

<p>Please u/lovinglifemoo - try to step back, take a deep breath, and maybe lay off of the recreational drugs for a while. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right....it must have been the &quot;clicking machines&quot; installed by the CIA in your rental car that were communicating with you guiding you through those back roads.</p>

<p>Dude. I&#39;m not trying to be a dick...but this entire thing is off the charts insane and I would guess that it has to do with serious mental issues + prescription drugs + recreational drugs.  That&#39;s a BRUTAL fucking combo right there man.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to go through your original post and pick apart every piece I view to be paranoid/schizo but you legit blamed downloading a torrent, surfing the Internet to certain sites, deciding to leave your wife to go to the airport for no reason, using an elevator that was &quot;out of order,&quot; taking somebody&#39;s boarding pass that wasn&#39;t even yours...and MANY other things on a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; system of &quot;clicks&quot; that you hear that you literally came up with at your own accord.  Think to yourself...how do you know what 1 click or 2 clicks means? Who told you that? Or...how did you imagine that?</p>

<p>I have no reason to be responding to a random stranger on the internet about such crazy ridiculous things other than for the reason that I am legit concerned for your own safety and wellbeing. It is tough to see somebody going through such episodes. Please...PLEASE seek some professional help.</p>

<p>The matter-of-factness in which you&#39;re replying makes it sound like you&#39;re trolling.</p>

<p>Well, in my opinion, it is very obvious that you are dealing with some mental issues...you also have admitted to being on Adderall, Prozac, and then were also prescribed antipsych medication by the Dr. you went to...you use recreational drugs (one of your first posts on reddit is about how <em>DRUGS ARE SO AWESOME!!!</em>) so, yea.....I&#39;m not &quot;assuming&quot; anything.</p>

<p>Dude. Please do NOT encourage OP to go buy a firearm. He clearly has a severe mental health problem (seems like classic paranoid schizophrenia) and will only be a danger to himself and those around him if he owns a gun. </p>

<p>OP, I know it may be hard to wrap your head around...but nobody is out to get you. The mind is a very powerful and at times frightening thing but you need to realize that all of these connections and strange &quot;out of place&quot; things that you&#39;ve been noticing are literally just your own imagination linking completely unrelated insignificant events together in a paranoid fashion.</p>

<p>Please seek mental help if you care about your well being or the well being of those around you! </p>
