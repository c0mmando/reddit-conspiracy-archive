<p>the Dr Oz segment says: these are brand new</p>

<p>wrong</p>

<p>from October 28th, 2004 - Digital Angel chip now FDA approved for medical use  - <a href="http://newatlas.com/go/3339/">http://newatlas.com/go/3339/</a></p>

<p>it says its &#39;similar&#39; to pet tracking devices</p>

<p>wrong - its the same</p>

<p>There are 3 types of technologies currently commonly used on finding  pets.</p>

<pre><code>Microchip implants (RFID Chips)
Radio Frequency 2.4GHZ (Zigbee)
Global Positioning System (GPS) &amp;amp; GSM
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://pettracking.co.nz/pages/how-do-pet-trackers-work">https://pettracking.co.nz/pages/how-do-pet-trackers-work</a></p>

<p>interestingly this site goes on to asserts that long range tracking of pets is impossible via RFID
&quot;Before we get into available tracking technologies, let&#39;s first discuss the myth on Hollywood driven Microchip GPS implants that don&#39;t exist in real life.  There is no such thing as a real time tracking GPS implant and there won&#39;t be for a very long time. &quot;</p>

<p>but is is simply not true</p>

<p>A new tag from Numerex and Savi Technology can intelligently determine whether to communicate via an active RFID network or satellite communications, thereby promising more thorough, end-to-end visibility in a global supply chain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work with RFID chips every single day at my job at Animal Control.  Our county requires microchipping by county ordinance and I get this kind of thing all of the time from people worried that we are going to use their pet&#39;s microchip to &quot;track their movements&quot;.  I&#39;ve had people think the government is going to track their walks with their pets, listen in on their conversations and even somehow (I have no idea how) watch them through the microchip. </p>

<p>The microchip is a simple RFID chip the size of a grain of rice that is subcutaneously injected between the shoulder blades.  The only thing it does is provide a unique I.D. based on the microchip company that links back to your animal.  The only way this number is read is with a special scanner.  It is incredibly beneficial as it helps return a ton of pets back to their owners.  I&#39;ve had instances of pets getting back to their rightful owner YEARS after they were lost or stolen from them.</p>

<p>To think that RFID chips are going to suddenly be able to provide GPS coordination in an affordable manner is asinine.  GPS collars are far bigger and bulkier and run anywhere from between $75-$100 on average with higher end, accurate ones costing several hundred.  They also usually come with a subscription fee to use their app/coordinating software.  </p>

<p>Modern RFID chips aren&#39;t going to provide this and it&#39;s going to require a far more costly endeavor to make all RFID chips perform like this.  </p>

<p>The Digital Angel is NOTHING like a standard RFID microchip.  You are vastly over estimating what functions a standard pet microchip provides.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen and heard about this chip.  One of the big reasons I say that this isn&#39;t feasible as a subcutaneous chip - it requires a lithium battery that requires recharging.  The beauty of the current RFID microchip is that it requires no battery pack/power source.  </p>

<p>The chip you linked, while a great step in technology, has that huge limitation that we haven&#39;t been able to overcome of a useable, renewable power source.  </p>

<p>The average hobbyist consumer WIFI module is also about the size of a quarter and has a lot of wasted space. <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/112075778240?lpid=82&amp;amp;chn=ps&amp;amp;ul_noapp=true">http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/112075778240?lpid=82&amp;amp;chn=ps&amp;amp;ul_noapp=true</a></p>

I think their argument is that the government doesn&#39;t require they carry a cellphone but they are being required to microchip their animal.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fine.  I&#39;m not promoting them for human use.  I&#39;m just saying do not overestimate the abilities of an RFID chip.  If they were going to start injecting people with a chip that records/provides real time gps data/monitors your vital signs it would have to be FAR more sophisticated.  All of that sophistication comes at a cost - size.  </p>

<p>I am not saying they couldn&#39;t get all of that down to the size of a grain of rice, aka the standard size of an RFID microchip.  But the cost of such a chip would be FAR higher than the standards RFID chip (sold between $10 to $40 depending on quality).  The cost of mass producing such a chip and then placing them in people would be astronomical.  This doesn&#39;t even include the multitude of software, the manpower to monitor them, etc.  </p>

<p>For pets it is a incredible device and I really hate seeing people try and tell me &quot;You aren&#39;t microchipping my dog, its the mark of the devil&quot; because that is just straight bullshit.</p>

Eventually the better technology will come along, and just like the new iPhone - everyone will want the &quot;upgrade&quot;.  Their trick isn&#39;t to force this upon you, the trick is to get you to want it.  </p>

<p>This company, Digital Angel, was a penny stock in roughly 2001.  It was bouncing between $.12 and $.20 with decent volume.  It would bounce like this a few times a week.  I&#39;d seen that it was pending FDA approval for use in humans.  I bought $2k at $.18 and it spiked to over $1.20 the day of the approval.</p>

<p>People have a reason to be skeptical. We&#39;ve all seen how tech is hijacked repeatedly for nefarious bullshit. It&#39;s hard to imagine that implanted tech could be an exception to what is quickly becoming the rule --- and this is tech you can&#39;t easily put down &amp; walk away from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this sentiment 100%. Although Dana Burnidge and the developers have designed this tool with convenience in mind, what&#39;s preventing it from it falling into the hands of those that wish to use it for control? Don&#39;t forget that Facebook was meant to be a social platform to connect with people and now it&#39;s surveillance tool. How do we know that this technology won&#39;t be abused? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not worried about it forcibly being implanted on me, I&#39;m worried that it will be an absolute necessity. I made a post about this and a user replied to me with the plot of a book called The Feed. This user said it best so I&#39;ll quote him/her. </p>

<p>&quot;the scariest part of this book was that anyone without a chip was basically outcast from society by necessity. Without a chip, you couldn&#39;t perform basic functions. Communication. People didn&#39;t always speak out loud, there was no reason to. It could be done via brain waves - telepathy through technology. This was the norm. Without a chip, you were blind, deaf, and mute, and people took for granted that everyone had one. Why would you not? A chipless person would stand in a room of silent people, a crowd of silence, a world of silence.
In the story, it&#39;s all for the common good. People are the internet, they are never severed from it. In real life, I begin to see something among teenagers and adults who never let go of their smartphones... we have the chip, it&#39;s just not physically attached to our bodies yet. I sometimes wonder if anyone else feels a piercing sense of loneliness when sitting in a room with people staring down at their screens.  It may not need to be a cure/prevention that forces the chip on people, but simply needing to be a part of society. That&#39;s stealthy, that&#39;s slow, that&#39;s happening right now. From socializing and job applications to managing your money in your bank account is not a huge leap. Imagine the day when you can only access your funds by an App. It won&#39;t shock you, because it will be introduced so slowly, so elective at first, until it is necessity.
This won&#39;t be forced on us, we will accept it as it is put into our hands.&quot;</p>

<p>If being skeptical of such a technology makes me a luddite moron, then I will happily accept that label. Anything that can be abused, will be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Props for directly addressing a segment of people that many in your position wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my question.  Given some of the evidence for air-gap hacks existing in the wild (Shamir of RSA fame did some stuff on this somewhat recently), what are the concerns that your devices are subject to the same exploits?  </p>

<p>And as followup question, given that this tech exists on the person and is somewhat difficult to remove, it introduces a signal that can uniquely identify a user by whomever has the ability to pick up the signal.  That also means that the signal can be intercepted, and duplicated.  What are the checks against reverse engineering of your device?  What protocols / processes are you using to ensure that spoofing is prevented?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are excellent questions! Thank you!</p>

<p>Air gap hacks rely largely, almost exclusively... on antenna geometry, credit cards especially. The trick is cards use flat plane antennae, this greatly increases range and subsequent vulnerability to surreptitious intrusion.
What our design ensures is that one would literally have to be in possession or physical control of the implanted hand, the very laws of physics demand skin contact. So, either the implantee wants the interface to occur, or they are otherwise being physically coerced, and have bigger problems.</p>

<p>To your second question:
   These devices have ZERO capacitance, they do not broadcast on their own. 
   They require an energized antenna outside of the body to engage a magnetic resonance which then energizes the chip, and facilitates transfer of data. They do not in any way shape or form, have the capacity to operate Stand-alone or broadcast! 
Hollywood wants you to think these things are a lot cooler and more badass than they are really capable of being...</p>

<p>As well, we went to great lengths to make sure that these tags ARE EASY to remove. They do not feature anti-migration coatings, which allows them to be popped out like a sliver in an outpatient procedure that lasts only about 5-10 minutes. You can even do it yourself, if you have a strong stomach.</p>

<p>Encryption is the last best hope of humanity, Clones of tags and spoofs are not impossible, however, the interception factor is a backend vulnerability. Like any other piece of information sent over the internet it is open season so to speak, however data is secure in the tag until it is read. Closed systems like door locks and smart home configurations are the most secure. Ultimately it falls to the end user to secure their data, on-board encryption is easily facilitated, and while we don&#39;t recommend embedding sensitive data onto your tag; the best way to keep it safe is to (1) keep it secret, no one needs to know whether you have a tag, where you have it, or especially what you use it for. Keeping those three pieces of information to yourself makes abuse expressly difficult. We make lifetime security easier by providing the necessary basic software to lock the device in such a manner as to prevent vandals from damaging the ability to rewrite or format tags.</p>

<p>I hope that was helpful. :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great info in your response, regardless.  </p>

<p>I should have been clearer with my question although I think you may have answered it sort of.  Is it possible for someone to write to the chip from a greater distance than 1 cm, if they had sufficient power?  What in the design prevents someone from activating the RFID in this way?</p>

<p>Also, what crypto do you use?</p>

<p>Short answers are Yes, up to about 20ish feet should the assailant go to great lengths, such lengths that destroy covert intrustion. </p>

<p>The design security comes in the form of its size, the geometry of fields and the applications&#39; ability to transmit energy and data are limited to very short distances by the design of the antenna, it is about the smallest design of its nature that physically works, the scale of the antenna coil dictates the scale of range.</p>

<p>&#39;Locking the Chip Open&#39; secures against long term damage and makes it so vandals cannot do permanent harm. The practical manner of encryption is largely up to the user.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of us.  There&#39;s a lot of people invested in making things appear a certain way so as to mislead others.  The nerd community that tries to understand the situation is capable of slicing through the bs.  Sadly, the vast majority of people, capable nerds included, don&#39;t spend the time on water, so to speak, to gain familiarity with the tactics used.  This can be quite demoralizing because it gives people the false impression that &quot;most of the rest of us&quot; are children both emotionally and intellectually.</p>

But it’s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is and it&#39;s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus and 23 million new jobs were created and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33%. And it’s not just because worked with George W. Bush after 9/11 and I was very proud that when I told them what the city need and what we needed to recover, he said you got it and he never wavered. He stuck with me. And I have worked and i admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.</em></p>

<p>Seriously... I pipe up to be informative and the first thing I get is all this crap? A couple of good souls here had the decency to ask questions, but a deluge of crap precedes and follows...</p>

<p>Yeah, I need that like I need prostate cancer...</p>

<p>If you want to be helpful why not read my posts chronologically. I didn&#39;t start the hostility, and I won&#39;t finish it either, nor will I take it lying down!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll observe rule 10 because it is simply the nice thing to do, ban me from posting if it makes you feel good, but I DID NOT COME HERE TO START A FIGHT!  I expect the mods of this sub to appreciate the spirit of seeking the truth. 
I offered it from an insider&#39;s perspective. Nothing more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this sentiment 100%. Although Dana Burnidge and the developers have designed this tool with convenience in mind, what&#39;s preventing it from it falling into the hands of those that wish to use it for control? Don&#39;t forget that Facebook was meant to be a social platform to connect with people and now it&#39;s surveillance tool. How do we know that this technology won&#39;t be abused? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not worried about it forcibly being implanted on me, I&#39;m worried that it will be an absolute necessity. I made a post about this and a user replied to me with the plot of a book called The Feed. This user said it best so I&#39;ll quote him/her. </p>

<p>&quot;the scariest part of this book was that anyone without a chip was basically outcast from society by necessity. Without a chip, you couldn&#39;t perform basic functions. Communication. People didn&#39;t always speak out loud, there was no reason to. It could be done via brain waves - telepathy through technology. This was the norm. Without a chip, you were blind, deaf, and mute, and people took for granted that everyone had one. Why would you not? A chipless person would stand in a room of silent people, a crowd of silence, a world of silence.
In the story, it&#39;s all for the common good. People are the internet, they are never severed from it. In real life, I begin to see something among teenagers and adults who never let go of their smartphones... we have the chip, it&#39;s just not physically attached to our bodies yet. I sometimes wonder if anyone else feels a piercing sense of loneliness when sitting in a room with people staring down at their screens.  It may not need to be a cure/prevention that forces the chip on people, but simply needing to be a part of society. That&#39;s stealthy, that&#39;s slow, that&#39;s happening right now. From socializing and job applications to managing your money in your bank account is not a huge leap. Imagine the day when you can only access your funds by an App. It won&#39;t shock you, because it will be introduced so slowly, so elective at first, until it is necessity.
This won&#39;t be forced on us, we will accept it as it is put into our hands.&quot;</p>

<p>If being skeptical of such a technology makes me a luddite moron, then I will happily accept that label. Anything that can be abused, will be. </p>
