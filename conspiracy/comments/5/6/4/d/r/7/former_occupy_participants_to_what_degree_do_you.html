       They keep every piece of data that goes over the wires that they can store.
       <br/>
       Obviously - all metadata, probably - all email and digital message contents, possibly - recordings or transcripts of phone calls, and not impossibly some amount of transitory info picked up by smart phones (chose your depth in the rabbit-hole).
       <br/>
       I imagine much of it is fairly disorganized and merely tucked away  in digital storage archives until they develop improved systems for filtering, filing, and more robust profiling.
       <br/>
       At this point I imagine they have systems that seek out keywords, numbers, addresses, and other specific signifiers to find the needles in haystacks that eventually, if enough criteria are met, will reach human attention.
       <br/>
       I'd wager they are saving pretty much everything on all of us. But that's likely as deep as I personally am watched, maybe I am on some extremely low level virtual sub-list, - meaning a list that could be compiled from info they have; people who do, have done, used to be "x" etc. . .
       <br/>
       Edit: 1. used the wrong paragraph formatting 2. finalized my point

       That's a

        <em>
         lot
        </em>
       </strong>
       of hard drive space.  They'd also need extremely sophisticated methods of search, to be able to sift through it in any meaningful way.  I don't doubt that the NSA have tricks which can at times seem to border on supernatural, but I am still skeptical of them having the degree of logistics necessary to truly be as omniscient as they like to appear.

       If nothing else, there would be ways of slowing them down.  Snowden has said that strong cryptography is somewhat effective against them.

       It's a lot of data for sure, but they didn't build the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Data_Center">
        Utah Data Center
       </a>
       for nothing. That one deals with data storage in the range of exabytes and It's not like it's the only facility of its type.
       <br/>
       And you're right,  I doubt they have the ability to filter even a  notable fraction of the info they gather in real time; I suspect the do have some tricks to help them narrow what they analyze at the moment, but I also am convinced they store the rest to analyze later when they have access to more advanced and powerful super computers

       I dont understand encrytion well or know as much about Snowden as I probably should, but if he's wrong or lying, I would think you sure paint a target on your back just by using encryption.  Obviously if you have accounts you don't want hacked it probably helps against lower level threats, id theft and 4-chan Pepe invasions or what not.  But I'm not sure I understand how even an organization like anonymous really thinks they can hide from something like the NSA.  Besides other major world power government agencies I dont believe anyone but maybe a few tech billionaires and some really high level, vertically integrated terrorist groups or narcotrafficers could possibly hide anything from the U.S. intelligence apparatus.  Look at how much more advanced our (U.S.) military is then everyone else, it's staggering.  If you are some low level bad guy, dope dealer, activist, freedom fighter, whatever, and you are an enemy of the United States or even just a p.o.i. I'm betting the NSA has easy access.  I'm still amazed that anyone on the dark web/silk road thought they could get away with anything considering it was the U.S. Navy that designed the damn thing.  Not many other people or organizations have access to trillions of dollars worth of tech, let alone places like NORAD to hide it in and stealth fighters and aircraft carriers and satellites and nuclear subs all integrated together plus a bunch of fucking ninjas to run the whole thing.  If "The Man" wants to look at your cyber, then "The Man" is gonna look at your cyber.

I have a blog with 30k subs, admin on 4 fb pages with over a million likes each, and have 3 websites which receive over a million views a month each.

       I was apart of occupy Tucson. Eventually there was a falling out among the main members. Ron barber said he couldn't be the face for it anymore and became paranoid, eventually he stopped showing up. For me, I was butt dialed by police officers regularly and my mom would tell me she was worried my phone was tapped because she could hear herself talking whenever she called me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was also 'interviewed' by a 'college student' whose business card states he worked for the secret service.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had that place on lock down. I eventually became so paranoid I wrote my first book about my experiences for the sole purpose that I thought eventually they would kill me and atleast I would have had my word out.
      </p>

       It's free to read the whole thing under the preview column.
I wrote the thing and self published it fast because my paranoia was following me into California. I was worried I wouldn't get my word out there fast enough. So it may need a lot of editing.

       I'm the person who started this thread, and I had very similar experiences to you. I was very active in Occupy (not going to mention which city, but I was there every single day.)
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just a few of the things that happened to me. Never had a problem before Occupy...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Nearly every package and letter I received arrived damaged
       </li>
       <li>
        I participated in Meetup and at nearly every event I attended I would meet someone who said they worked for Dept. of Defense. No joke! They were often older than the rest of the group and would always be very friendly and introduce themselves to me...and they never failed to hand me a business card!
       </li>
       <li>
        Buggy house phones (constant clicking, static, echoes) and buggy cell phones (lag times, camera takes pictures before I click, etc.)
       </li>
       <li>
        There were a few times I felt like I was being followed and had strange vehicles (vans with tinted windows, etc.) parked near my house.
       </li>
       <li>
        I was walking in a park with family members and a man jumped out of the bushes, took our photo, and ran away.
       </li>
       <li>
        My computer would run both hot and slow, and often seemed to have a mind of its own. I was constantly removing spyware like key loggers but even with Spybot they would return.
       </li>
       <li>
        I thought someone was trailing me on foot so I changed direction and I saw him circle back around the corner.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The worst part about it is that no one takes you seriously! You are immediately put in the paranoid category, and this is very isolating. I started photographing the mail damage and the strange vehicles but people were still very dismissive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a master's degree. I pay my taxes. I have always been a solid and law abiding citizen, and my psyche is intact! I was not imaging these things; they truly happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's cold comfort to hear that others dealt with the same thing, but it's reassuring that this wasn't only happening to me.

       Totally. Very very similar happenings. 
That's how occupy went nowhere. Anybody who was a leader of the movement was subject to heavy intimidation and eventually made paranoid. I heard at the time other camps had faced death threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most frustrating part was that some people wouldn't believe me. Only my poor mom who was scared shitless when she told me my phone was tapped.

       I think Occupy was a hybrid false flag/astroturf op, personally.  I say "hybrid," because I'm inclined to believe that groups like Adbusters are definitely payrolled by people like Soros, but I think it did attract a lot of people with genuine motivations, as well.  The Occupy demographic were intensely and wilfully idealistic and naive, in my observation, and equally intensely Marxist.  They also like to tell themselves that they accomplished something, but aside from temporarily making the NYPD look bad, and drawing attention to the obvious fact that Michael Bloomberg was a raving psychopath, I can't really see what was achieved at Zucotti, long term.  It was mostly effective in a networking sense; it allowed a lot of people to meet each other who would not have otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt too many of them would be watched, at this point.  Most of the legitimate or sincere group were completely normal people, whose only real distinction was the fact that ideologically speaking, they might have caused Joseph McCarthy to roll over in his grave.  Urban Communism is hardly a rare phenomenon these days, though; the NSA would actually
       <strong>
        <em>
         need
        </em>
       </strong>
       quantum computers if they were going to try and track everyone in that demographic.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were people associated with Occupy who had also been known to be involved with other things, then yes, they would be monitored; but I've believed for a while now that surveillance in general is never as big as the people running it, want everyone else to believe.  If you think the NSA are omniscient, then that makes their job easier, because it causes you to self-censor without them actually having to monitor you at all.

       Of course it didn't.  It never does.  Occupy was really the point when Anonymous got hijacked, as well.  Then again, as written above, I've always had my doubts about Adbusters.  They were just too photogenic and clean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occupy's single biggest weakness was its' obsession with "leaderlessness," which by definition does not exist.  That particular meme made it incredibly easy for someone like Soros to pay a few people to unaccountably, invisibly lead by exploiting ego dynamics, which always, always exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the things that being an engineer teaches you, is to never, ever be idealistic, because all idealism really means is refusing to plan for negative contingencies.  Then they predictably happen, and your design blows up in your face.  A fairly consistent theme in the works of Confucius, is that the less people a government contains, the more effective it is going to be.  Monarchy is only a bad thing when the monarch is a psychopath, but a monarchy with a
       <strong>
        <em>
         good
        </em>
       </strong>
       king is better than a democracy can ever hope to be.  Decisions get made much more quickly, and accountability is much greater because there is ultimately only a single person making said decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       With democracy, when there is a problem, you can never identify who is responsible.  With monarchy, conversely, when something goes wrong, because you only have one person deciding things, you can immediately identify who the source of said problem is.  Democratic buck passing is very conducive to corruption and shadowy cabals getting control of things, which is why democracy is as fragile as it is.  Having too many points of failure is just as bad as too few.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Athenian system was not controlled by the people to the degree that we like to pretend it was; it was essentially a rotating aristocracy.  Yes, with the ostraca, difficult or overly ambitious people could be exiled, but an exile was sometimes able to come back later with an army and take over the place.  Democracies allow people to vote on whether to accept the passing of a certain measure, or the candidacy of a certain leader; but what a democracy does
       <strong>
        <em>
         not
        </em>
       </strong>
       allow, is for the people to decide
       <strong>
        <em>
         which
        </em>
       </strong>
       candidates or measures are available to vote for.  You can choose what to have for dinner, but you only get to choose from a set number of selections on the menu, and you don't get to choose what those selections themselves are; and you normally have no clue who actually wrote the menu itself, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing to understand, is that historically, we've actually had monarchy for a much longer period of time than we have had democracy.  This tells me that, again, monarchy is only a problem when the monarch is someone like Caligula, or arguably Henry VIII.

       The above link is something I wrote a while ago, about the people who were not only responsible for the hijacking of Occupy, but who to a degree, I believe, were also responsible for founding it.  You may find it interesting.

       Seems we need a modern Cincinnatus. :)  I noticed a lot of the faulty elements to which you refer, probably made the co-opting that much easier, or as your earlier writings suggest, some sort of Shake n' Bake Soros outfit... 
I would posit that one element that makes 'movements' a lot harder to achieve the critical mass and ultimate leverage to get 'them by the short hairs' as it once did, in the 18th and 19th century, is the sheer scale of the systems in place. It's comparatively a milk run to get 30 or 50 million people to act on something, or even a few things, than it is to get 100 or 200 million people to act on something. Sure it's one thing to sign an e-petition. It eventually gets to the point where there needs to be petitions to have petitions read though...
       <br/>
       A lot of idealists don't want to acknowledge the social ape nature of the human species. This is something I endeavor to keep close in mind when adressing human issues. As a cyborg, and a mutant; I've taken great pains to distance myself, while still striving to be an active participant for what I perceive to be for the greater good. That said, this Cyborg-mutant is still bred from social ape stock. Nothing will change the nature of the social apes' need for hierarchical 'order'. Star Trek and the society of the Federation is a fantastic example of an 'Ideal' culture, however; that ideal culture still maintained a leadership organization, and any facsimile will likely be no different.

       In my experience, humans are only a problem in groups of more than five people.  When I've had parties, I've never invited more than that number, and that was the standard group size within
       <em>
        World of Warcraft
       </em>
       as well.  It's pretty much purely a cognitive overload and accountability issue.  When you have more than five, a scenario develops where one person's brain simply can't keep track of what everyone else in the group are doing on a constant basis, which is the origin of the secrecy and cover that psychopaths need to start running their games.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conglomeration and the drive for it is our single biggest problem, IMHO.  We ideally need
       <strong>
        <em>
         less
        </em>
       </strong>
       unity, not more.  The reason why psychopaths flock to corporations like flies on shit, is because the only thing they are able to derive emotional gratification from, is having a justification for viewing themselves as superior to the rest of the species, and being the CEO of a big multinational gives you a lot of authority over a presumably large number of human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       My ideal scenario would be one in which the equivalent of what we call nation states now, would only consist of around five people each; although I'm not talking about the nuclear family as the Christians would necessarily recognise it, either.  It would probably be closer to the Borg in a sense; they would only be populated by individuals on genuinely like mind.  The larger your group size, the less likely it is that real ideological and psychological commonality and unity are to be present.

       My biggest shock was back before Snowden was even a name. I used Peerblock to block IP addresses on my computer. This also has the ability to block and log known IP addresses, including government addresses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The catalytic converter was going bad in our Forester, so I was googling ways to get around emissions with the O2 sensors and fool the ECU. I checked Peerblock and what do ya know, probably 50 pings from an IP address listed as the EPA being blocked. I was not visiting any government or EPA sites - only like car forums and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another time, I was browsing somewhere and saw something weird being blocked. Some system facility or something. Googled it. Oh hey, another name for the Utah Data Center. Multiple results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are just my first hand experiences. I can say for sure, they're watching you. All probably automatic, but they can and are accessing your computer. Not to look at files and do whatever, but they are doing something or logging what you're doing.
      </p>

       It's a shit ton of information on everyone. Think of how much you personally use Google everyday or brows the web. Multiply that by 300 million.... a day. We currently don't have the processes to sort and filter it all, but I'm sure they're collecting it.

       Not particularly, no. That said, there are definitely the occasional weird things that do happen with my phones and connectivity portals. Strange things I notice every now and then that I'm sure the all intractable illusive 'They' don't want me to be aware of. I rather like the attention to be honest. Call me crazy but I simply announce my intentions and command my Public Servants, I know what their place is and I remind them in plain terms... the secretary of state was contacted by my county auditor personally regarding what I expected regarding a certain matter some months ago, I have the emails somewhere... They don't like it when you tell them what to do but the dears need it now and then.
At any rate; some of us who were in Occupy are probably on that fabled RED LIST, others on the BLUE LIST, I wager nobody who participated in Occupy is on the YELLOW LIST.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally; I'd take it as a compliment to be on the Red List... So help me, I'd consider myself a failure should I learn someday I made it on the Yellow!

       candidates or measures are available to vote for.  You can choose what to have for dinner, but you only get to choose from a set number of selections on the menu, and you don't get to choose what those selections themselves are; and you normally have no clue who actually wrote the menu itself, either.

       The other thing to understand, is that historically, we've actually had monarchy for a much longer period of time than we have had democracy.  This tells me that, again, monarchy is only a problem when the monarch is someone like Caligula, or arguably Henry VIII.

       The above link is something I wrote a while ago, about the people who were not only responsible for the hijacking of Occupy, but who to a degree, I believe, were also responsible for founding it.  You may find it interesting.
