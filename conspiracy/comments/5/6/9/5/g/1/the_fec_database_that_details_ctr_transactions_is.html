        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>First off:</strong> Go export this <a href="https://beta.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?two_year_transaction_period=2016&amp;disbursement_purpose_categories=other&amp;committee_id=C00578997&amp;min_date=01%2F01%2F2015&amp;max_date=08%2F05%2F2016">database</a> from the FEC website. </p>

<p>It details all of the transactions officially attributed to Correct the Record.</p>

<ul>
<li>The export link on the website will give you a compressed (zipped) .csv file which you can then open up in Excel and play around with. </li>
</ul>

<p>I am hardly proficient at using excel but I have been able to come up with some interesting findings which I am sure many of you will put to shame once you get digging.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong>
<em>Payments to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/nVyWu">Google</a></em> for email services between 7-2015 to 10-2016 = <strong>$159,012.87</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong>
<em>Payments to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/wjj8y">Uber</a></em> for transportation services up till early october 2016 = <strong>$32,766.52</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong>
<em>Single transactions to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/uSE0V">Individual Contributors</a></em> between 2015 and early October 2016.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Min: $7.65</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Median: $592.25</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Max: $62000.00</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Total: $5,462,741.57</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 4:</strong>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/Gue0r"><em>Payment totals for top ten individual contributors:</em></a></p>

<p>The last names of these individuals will be withheld in this post.</p>

<p>Please refer to this <a href="https://beta.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?two_year_transaction_period=2016&amp;disbursement_purpose_categories=other&amp;committee_id=C00578997&amp;min_date=01%2F01%2F2015&amp;max_date=08%2F05%2F2016">FEC</a> website for legal and public disclosure of their identities. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wilson was paid $181,355.00</strong></li>
<li><strong>David was paid $120,866.87</strong></li>
<li><strong>Samuel was paid $93,559.34</strong></li>
<li><strong>Benjamin was paid  $71,993.86</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adrienne was paid $64,679.49</strong></li>
<li><strong>Barbara was paid $62,000.00</strong></li>
<li><strong>Anthony was paid $46,025.97</strong></li>
<li><strong>Benjamin was paid $41,527.93</strong></li>
<li><strong>Joshua was paid $40,426.87</strong></li>
<li><strong>Elizabeth was paid $38,573.01</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Wilson didn&#39;t use his full name for all transactions so the total in the linked image is incorrect.</em></p>

<p>Also linked is a regular pay schedule, suggesting these people are on a salary of some sort.</p>

<p><strong>Largest disbursement amounts overall:</strong></p>

<p><strong>$466,776.75 to <a href="https://thefranklinforum.org/about-us/">Franklin Forum</a>:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>$465,000.00</strong> split over five payments between 7/24/2015 and 4/12/2016</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$1,776.75</strong> (for rent) Once for April 2016 and twice for June 2016.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>$407,977.38 to <a href="https://americanbridgepac.org">AMERICAN BRIDGE 21ST CENTURY</a>:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>$7,977.38</strong> (for computers) -5/15/2015</p></li>
<li><p><strong>$400,000.00</strong>  -12/31/2015 </p></li>
</ul>

<p>It would be absolutely amazing if some of you excel experts were able to make this easily navigable (adding pivot tables, advanced filter, active charts, etc.) and if some of you artist types were willing to create infographics or at least better formatted posts.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/datcv#!/vizhome/CTRDisbursementsQ22016/AllDisbursements">Here is a chart</a> which graphically represents all disbursements to date.</strong></p>

<p><em>Total disbursement amount as of October 6th 2016</em> is <strong>$8,072,842.70.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely with this. At the same time we should consider the implications of posting their names left and right on the internet. These are real people with real lives.</p>

<p>That being said... Their actions are considered legal. No government official will pursue them with criminal charges. So then what do we, the people who feel like our democracy was robbed, do? Do we sit idly by and worry about the lives of the people who profited from this mess?</p>

<p>I say hell no. &quot;These people need harassed and shamed&quot; is accurate. We will not tolerate this kind of disgusting behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah. I think people are smart enough to know how far they can go on reddit without getting in trouble. What I am amazed at is how cheap it was to buy game changing influence online. $8,000,000 is nothing in the grand scheme of political elections and it&#39;s completely changed the landscape of reddit which is one of the most visited sites on the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is definitely interesting... I agree, $8M is nothing to the elites or for these &quot;political games&quot; but can you imagine getting paid ~$1,500 (I&#39;m assuming tax exempt?) for a couple of online posts, for several consecutive months? That&#39;s your mortgage right there. I can see why people did it, and in turn I see why politicians think it&#39;s so easy to manipulate people with cash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Frozen Pizza Guy,</p>

<p>I wanted to discuss the data you posted. I&#39;m strictly focusing on individual disbursements since I believe they&#39;re the low-hanging fruit in this context.</p>

<p>This is a <a href="https://postimg.org/image/f2gb5sngz/">list of the people</a> who received the most money over the span of roughly two years.</p>

<p>I&#39;m seeing slightly different numbers. Mr Woodhouse received a total of $160K and he&#39;s on top of the list (he even received an additional ~20K but his name was spelled differently so it wasn&#39;t included in the list). That&#39;s twice the &quot;max&quot; you listed. Can you confirm?</p>

<p>Edit: updated image link</p>

<p>Source: I downloaded the database that OP mentions, created a pivot table with it and filtered/ordered accordingly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly why I asked people with more excel experience to help look through this data. Thank you! </p>

<p>I am not great at excel. I really wanted to set up separate sheet and have it automatically sum up everyone&#39;s separate disbursements. I also wanted to make a chart which showed to trend in disbursements, to see when the most money was being spent and other such things.  </p>

<p>My MAX is simply the maximum single disbursement to individuals, it didn&#39;t account for multiple payments to one person. </p>

<p>The $60,000 was a one off payment to Miss Lee.</p>
