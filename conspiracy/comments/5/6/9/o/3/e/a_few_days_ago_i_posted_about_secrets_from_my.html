<p>(Software Related) Everything you do on the internet is recorded. I mean everything. No matter if you&#39;re using a VPN, TOR, or some other software that is unknown. IF you&#39;re using the same internet as all of us are, then every single action is recorded. AND CAN BE DECRYPTED AT WILL. No the FBI, CIA might not be able to decrypt your drive. And that&#39;s by design. But in-fact if you were a big enough target that those in power (not the president, but the presidents employer) wanted to know about something you had on your encrypted drive. They would literally just take your hard drive out, plug it up to this particular machine, and they have instant access to everything, no hoof, no fuss.</p>

<p>True. Furthermore, AES is a quite recent development. Not that I want to imply any credibility to OPs satirical post but if it&#39;s from his youth, he&#39;s probably thinking of the much weaker DES, that could indeed be cracked with the necessary resources. </p>

<p>You expect me to believe that these people have essentially ultimate power over internet surveillance and computer encryption (which I&#39;m sure does or will exist eventually somewhere). Your father is directly involved with these people, and obviously trusted so much that they let his son have a looks-see on their fallout civilization, and play with all of their future tech? None of that strikes me as impossible in some form or another, but I&#39;ll tell you what makes me too skeptical to believe a word of it:</p>

<p>If you read all the post and the previous days submission, it is enough information to put those on the path further while also intriguing the imagination of others.  I said then I would not give certain details that are just unnecessary for anyone here to know.</p>

<p>I give enough information.  </p>

<p>Most in this current generation have become massive consumers of information just for the sake of consuming information.</p>

<p>It serves no purpose to know any more details than what I&#39;m willing to share.  How would me sharing this or that change your life?  It won&#39;t.  </p>

<p>Read all that is posted and you go on a search for the deeper truth of your existence.  And maybe, eventually, you will have your own story to share.</p>

<p>Yet.  Which in my opinion is more than enough reason for them to stop someone, if that person was disclosing accurate descriptions of their otherworldly telepathic technology.  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really matter that much whether or not people buy it... if you are describing accurate examples of alien technology, the people that use that technology would know you are telling the truth, and would probably be opposed to that information being distributed among the humans they are trying to telepathically control.</p>

<p>Saying &#39;at most ill receive a phone call&#39; lends even more credence to what i am saying... as if these inter-dimensional beings (or whatever) that are controlling the minds of the humans on this planet with alien technology, would look at this and say &#39;oh hey, we should ring this chap and tell him to tone it down a little bit&#39;.  </p>

<p>Logically it doesn&#39;t add up.  They can control the entire human population with telepathic whirlygigs, which they are trying to keep secret, yet they allow someone to describe them online... and when they dont like what they see, they have to ring him up and ask him to chill a little, because for some reason they cant telepathically control this one dude.</p>

<p>Research what went on with the secret police during the Nazi and Stalin regimes for a clue on how they operate.</p>

<p>Threatening the safety of your family from the police, fbi, cia, nsa etc., vs threatening your safety of your family from the over-seers of this world are in two totally different threat classes.</p>

<p>What do you know about outer space or space travel</p>

<p>Space travel is possible. You would think this is obvious by watching TV and by other news... but it&#39;s not and I&#39;ll explain why.</p>

<p>There is a something a IT, that is locked here on this planet and it can not get off for whatever reason.  So in turn it uses a specific species of human to do its dirty work.</p>

<p>Allow me to go further...  Just think about the genius it would take to build a robot, then fly this robot up into space, and then once in space ACTUALLY fly to a planet millions of miles away.... and then once there it recognizes this and literally drops down to the planet.  Unrolls itself and starts searching the planet... and in the process even taking samples.  And sending sample data back to earth.</p>

<p>Just really meditate and ponder the above.  IF this is possible than fixing earths many problems is actually EASY.  BUT, earths issues keep getting massively worst, food, air, water, etc.  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense right?  Something is missing... a link between the two.</p>

<p>I digress.</p>

<p>The FOOD is only found in a few places on the surface world.  It is talk that in the caverns beneath ground there may be more BUT obviously there are dangers with that.</p>

<p>The FOOD is not disguised, but since it has been purposely destroyed, it will be very difficult to find.</p>

<p>I have no idea what it looks like.  It&#39;s name is not any any western books.  I have seen one reference to it in a old latin book of magic (take that as you will), but there are some references to it in ancient Chinese medicine.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your response!
I read a lot of articles (read with open minded skepticism)  that discuss how there are positively oriented higher dimensional beings actively working with groups on earth to free humanity from the methods of control you&#39;ve discussed here, do you think there is any truth to this? </p>

<p>Or is this just another method of control to keep the populous searching for a Savior instead of actually rising up? </p>

<p>And for the sake of covering all the bases, is it possible that you, being so integrated in this &#39;next level&#39; city, are subjected to it&#39;s own form of propaganda to make you think these people truly have total control?  </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t they want to keep their workers in these cities or their workers on Mars in a similar form of limited disclosure servitude?  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you as a human being feel a moral responsibility to at least attempt to let this technology see the light of day?  Or have they covered all their bases so well that there would be no point? And with their technology and if your being real then aren&#39;t you worried that you&#39;ll face some repercussions from this?  How do we know you aren&#39;t part of some limited disclosure to steer people off of the correct path?  </p>

<p>I truly trust my intuition so it&#39;s not like I need proof, just any answer would be appreciated. Thanks for your responses.  </p>

<p>Also, let&#39;s say for argument sake their are two types of cabal.<br/>
1. Those high up in the system itself regardless if they know or not, working for it, allowing it to destroy more lives.</p>

<ol>
<li>The 2nd type is those who have the spirit of the cabal internally, these would be for example your neighbors etc.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>How do you know?  In their conversation&#39;s, are they literally just repeating what you hear on tv/radio?  Or do they actually have a thought form that is their own?  Next, when they speak, is their language against humanity or for it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet again, thank you for your response, I read your first post when you posted it but I will re read it again for sure, finally I have just a couple more questions, thanks for bearing with me!  </p>

<p>Do we each have the power within us to learn, grow, and create our own thought forms and frequencies to combat the cabals frequencies <em>and</em>  influence the minds of others in a positive manner? Or do we <em>need</em> the assistance of an outside source such as frequency medicine or the &#39;wake up&#39; food? </p>

<p>In terms of how to free ourselves from this servitude,  would we stand a better chance sending out thought forms to influence the world, or would be stand a better chance spreading this knowledge via internet and word of mouth in the desperate hope that even when unconscious cabal members disbelieve every word,  the idea is planted, and can blossom into a spark of thirst for the greater truth?  </p>

<p>Thanks again I seldom can ask questions like this without a barrage of down votes and sarcastic answers relating to the bs flat earth theory! Whether your telling the truth or not is of little consequence when I feel like I&#39;ve gained insightful knowledge that resonates with my being.  </p>

<p>This food, would super charge every aspect of your physical being.  You would not get sick, your life span would be extended etc.  I have a way to create something similar that maybe, just might mimic certain aspects of this food, but I&#39;m still in my research phase.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>would we stand a better chance sending out thought forms to influence the world,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and No,  Yes because it would be great.  But No, because most humans are currently corrupted by these thought forms so your thought forms would just lead to more corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome answers, I know I said final questions but your responses endlessly intrigue me, too many here are looking for concrete proof but I feel like the only real trust you can place is in your own personal intuition.</p>

<p>Anyway, your research into an alternative for this super food has me very intrigued, it sounds like you have some research leeway in terms of what advanced technology you have at your disposal. Once you move more deeply into the research phase,  would you be willing to share technical aspects of this super food replacement? So it could be replicated at home with the proper materials and technique?  Or would the technology to make this be so unavailable that it could never be quietly produced at home?  </p>

<p>Some more questions I&#39;ve thought of:
Does this city use replicators? 
If so is hemp oil the main fuel? 
Are buildings and structures made with similar surface building materials or do they work with easier alloys? I can&#39;t imagine things are built conventionally, so do they use what I would call &quot;frequency weight cancellation&quot; (I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a better way to say that)  to essentially levitate building blocks into place?<br/>
Is this the same lost technology that (based on what I&#39;ve read and resonates with me) existed before a meteor caused a massive melt of ice age ice shelves and flooded the world 11k years ago?  </p>

<p>Or... I haven&#39;t read this I&#39;m just trying to be creative... Do they simply design a building, and use a special type of alloy to &quot;frequency mold&quot; these buildings into the exact desired shape? </p>

<p>In terms of power do they use &quot;infinite energy&quot; devices?<br/>
I once heard that the field that these devices pull from is consistently and relentlessly monitored, so even if someone does succeed in making one of these machines, the area of the field being pulled from will instantly give away the exact location  of this device to be shut down immediately.  Anytruth to this?  </p>

<p>Is there any sort of monetary system in this city?  With technological abundance it would seem completely unnecessary for there to be a monetary exchange of goods if everything is automated and user friendly.  </p>

<p>I know you&#39;ve said you have your reasons but with large underground (or cloaked above ground?)  Cities on earth and Mars, how is it that more people don&#39;t come forward to discuss this?  Is there some sort of NDA that results in death if broken? Or is it just a general knowledge that there is literally no escape from this extensive cloaked drone surveillance program? Basically what is the incentive to stay quiet? (Obviously people aren&#39;t <em>that</em> quiet considering I&#39;ve read a lot into these topics already)  </p>

<p>Also in your experience do psychedelics such as Ayahuasca,  and Psilocybin play any role in physically awakening ourselves?  Or does it really come down to the state of the mind of the user?  I can say I attribute much of my spiritual awakening and thirst to discover the truth regardless of evidence (which some would call naive) to psychedelics. </p>

<p>And as I will say every time you respond, thank you for this, this is literally the single most open minded non judgmental conversation I&#39;ve ever had with literally anyone, online or not.  I appreciate your patience and understanding with not only me, but all those whose strongly doubt every word you say as unconscious cabal members.</p>

<p>The equipment needed, I wouldn&#39;t have direct access to.  But I may be able to mimic certain aspects.  As this time I see no way it could reasonable be done on a very small scale.</p>

<p>On a small scale I&#39;ll make enough room to noticeably increase certain aspects of my being, but not enough for all the things the &#39;whole food&#39; provides.</p>

<p>I have been in since 1994, so they could be using all sorts of bio-fuels.  Nothing there looked like alien technology so no levitating blocks.  There was no lost technology.  Man has been doing this at least 200 years before 1994.</p>

<p>We live and experience life in multiple dimensions simultaneously.  Most people think of alternate realities having some other version of you.  Separate from you.  But that&#39;s not the case.  &quot;You&quot; experience them all.  </p>

<p>The brain has adopted to reconcile the differences by being malleable to what memories it chooses.  You only remember what makes sense to you, based on the present.  We see the brain more directly in corpus callosotomies.  The left brain doesn&#39;t know what the right is doing, and will make up whatever it needs to for things to make sense.  Which you will fully believe.  </p>

<p>But, to a lesser degree, we see this in action ourselves, daily.  It&#39;s the reason people can&#39;t agree on details of an event - no matter how clearly they recall the details.  It&#39;s not that the memory is bad, you <em>did</em> experience it exactly as you remember.  But, so did the person who remembers something in stark contrast.  In both cases the brain is sticking with the reality that resulted in the consequences that individual later experienced.  Something of a revisionist history.  </p>

<p>Death is interesting.  There are realities where someone you lost didn&#39;t actually die, but the brain rejects memories of the interactions you have with that person going forward, as it can&#39;t be reconciled.  You are effectively disconnected from the memories of all realities where they continue to live.  You have died in many realities.  But you only register these events as near-death, or maybe nothing at all.  You only truly experience death once it&#39;s happened in all dimensions.  </p>

Maybe lots of small spikes or like a golf ball. It seemed to be about 2 or 3  feet across (hard to tell if close and small, or big and far away). I ran inside to grab my binoculars, by the time came back, it was gone. 
It&#39;s the only &quot;UFO&quot; sighting I&#39;ve ever witnessed and everyone I tell usually tells me it was a weather balloon. When you described your surveillance object it&#39;s the closest thing I&#39;ve ever come across to describing my experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve always understood conspiracy stuff to ultimately be rooted in a cosmic good vs evil battle, good being high-consciousness (concepts like peace, oneness, love, unity,) and evil being low-consciousness (concepts like separation, conflict, duality, fear)</p>

<p>any thoughts on spiritual enlightenment? jesus, buddha type individuals who have transcended the ordinary &#39;human condition&#39; and attained superhigh levels of consciousness and superpowers - were they opponents of the Powers-That-Be throughout the ages?</p>

<p>it would seem that the powers-that-be(PTB), despite operating on a relatively advanced technological and intellectual level, are of low consciousness (thus the disposition towards conflict and duality). would the PTB be able to negatively affect high-consciousness individuals, or does an individual with high-consciousness simply automatically repel any attempts of PTB?</p>

<p>my perspective is that the PTB rely on keeping humans operating with low-consciousness in order to keep their rule/control, and if humans simply decided not to stand for it, their rule would simply crumble. in that sense, humans get the leaders they deserve.</p>

<p>and if one studies spirituality, it would seem that spirituality is a kind of transcendental solution towards this PTB muckery. the spiritual approach to the PTB problem is simply to completely drain out the importance (elimination of desires and attachments) in the things that the PTB relies on to &#39;enslave&#39; humans. for instance, at the most fundamental level, the PTB relies on the human desire for survival to control us (eg, work or you will starve to death; secondary desires/fears are money, status, &#39;love&#39;, fame, etc), but the spiritual approach is to completely eliminate the fear of death such that whilst one is still able to take action to ensure one&#39;s survival, one cannot be threatened or controlled with the threat of death because there is no attachment to one&#39;s own existence.</p>

<p>What is love?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a specific frequency (vibration/tone), in humans this frequency give ways to feeling close with someone and caring for them.</p>

<p>If you are able to feel this frequency (love), be happy, because many in humanity are less able in these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are these foods you talk about? I am trying to change my diet for a few reasons, and to some extent, it has worked. Meat... I can&#39;t stand meat anymore. Most people I talk to don&#39;t even realize it until I say something, but meat doesn&#39;t taste good anymore. But it is necessary...</p>

<p>I feel like no matter what I do I can&#39;t get the nutrients I need. I&#39;m trying to eat clean, eat to support my weightlifting. I have a great Neuromuscular connection, and I can feel the lack of nutrients in my body. I can feel my muscles weakness. I have struggled with depression for years now, and I can&#39;t help but think that something is missing from the foods I am eating to make me this way. </p>

<p>I have kids... unvaccinated, and eating healthy foods, much of which is home grown. But I am afraid for their health, and mental health. I keep going back to food, to diet. Something is missing. I wonder, what we could be capable of, if we were healthy.</p>

<p>I also have a fascination with hidden history. I believe we have been on this earth for far longer than we have been told. Why the effort to hide how long we have been here?  </p>

<p>Nope, all over.  But more around major population centers.  On clear days, just sit out for at least 30 minutes and just look into the sky.  Eventually you will see one.  They are out in the rural area&#39;s but there is much more of a abundance in the heavy populated cities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Shared my ego&#39;?  What are you referring to?  My slight use of sarcasm?  I think its a bit of a stretch to say that mild sarcasm means i have an ego problem.</p>

<p>Dude im just like millions of other people... i would love for there to be something more than this life, and hope that there is, but there is exactly zero evidence that supports stories like this... it&#39;s all anecdotal... so i conclude that there is a high probability that there is nothing more, and all of these stories are either intentionally created, or brain tricks that the person being tricked doesn&#39;t realize are brain tricks.</p>

<p>You stated that if you watch the sky for 30 minutes you will see alien controlled metallic basketballs floating overhead.  My rebuttal was that people have been watching the skies since time began, for great lengths of time, and there is exactly ZERO evidence of what you say someone will see in as little as 30 minutes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an absurd claim to make, and you know it.  I say that because you know as well as i do, that watching the skies is an incredibly easy task to do, which millions of people already do, and there is ZERO evidence of what you claim.</p>

<p>To take it further, earlier you told someone they were invisible until you wore these super high tech googles... yet now you are telling someone that they can be viewed with ordinary binoculars.  That&#39;s a pretty big contradiction, no?</p>

<p>I dont even know what you are talking about.  What was sarcastic in my last response?  I gave some insight on why i am skeptical of such things, and expounded on the issues i took with your claims.</p>

<p>Also, i&#39;m pretty sure my last sentence was a question.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Who was it with the ego problem again?  I mean, yeah, i used some sarcasm in my post, but i didn&#39;t assume to know what you do and dont refuse to do, and whether it would &#39;shatter your reality&#39;.</p>

<p>I mean, what does that even mean?  I <em>literally</em> just told you that i desire to find evidence that there is something more to this life... so why on earth would you say that i would be opposed to such knowledge?  That makes no sense.</p>

<p>Back on the ego thing, i think its funny how you downvote everything i say.  I mean, what&#39;s even the point of doing that?  No one is going to read this except you and I, so why even bother?    </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Anecdotally.  Which i specifically addressed in my response.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll repeat the main point of my skepticism, because you pretty much dodged responding to it, to say something i already acknowledged:</p>

<p>Watching the skies is an incredibly easy task to do, which millions of people already do, and there is ZERO evidence of what you claim can be seen in as little as 30 minutes.  What is your explanation for the lack of evidence?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, people have seen them without the goggles. The goggle allowed me to see all of everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats not what you said.  You said you saw absolutely nothing, and it was only after you put on the goggles that you saw the spheres.  How is this not a contradiction, when you told that guy he wouldnt need special goggles to see them?  If a person doesn&#39;t need special goggles to see the spheres, then why didnt you see any?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi - Have no idea if your story is legit, but oddly enough it matches a &quot;dream&quot; I had years back, somewhere around 2008 maybe, don&#39;t remember.  I&#39;ve had a lifetime of weird experiences, including MILABs, which I&#39;ve written about on my website, to provide a one sentence background.  With that in mind, I had a dream where I was suddenly in an underground &quot;town&quot; of sorts.   I of course was very familiar with the idea of underground bases, but anything I&#39;d ever read about, or whatever fragments of memories I do have from abductions were clearly military and/or hospital looking installations.  I had no idea they could be anything else.  Then this &quot;dream&quot; happened.  (either astral projection, or something mentally plugging into me while I slept using the mind for remote viewing purposes, etc.)  But I was suddenly in some sort of underground place, in an area that was designed to look like an actual suburban neighborhood, complete with houses and sidewalks, light posts, streets, you name it.  I turned towards my right and then saw on the far end of wherever I was that they had an actual <em>fake sunrise</em> going on.  Complete with audio being pumped into the place of birds chirping.  It was &quot;dawn&quot; in this &quot;neighborhood&quot;.......that was deep underground.  At that point, seeing this fake sun and hearing the &quot;birds&quot; I was just dumbfounded.  Arms just hanging there slack at my sides, mouth agape, like &quot;WHAT THE....?!?!?!&quot;   For me it was shocking.  Then the scene suddenly switched and I was trying to hightail it out of there because I&#39;d been spotted, and so next thing I knew I was running up a long incline, which matches something else you said, and was very close to the exit, with armed &quot;thems&quot; soldier looking guys behind me.   And then the scene jumped again, to where I was running around in the downtown area of where we currently lived at the time, still being &quot;chased by them&quot; for having intruded into this place that I had no business being in. </p>

<p>Sure it could have been &quot;just a dream,&quot; but again considering everything else that&#39;s gone on in my life it&#39;s highly suspicious.  Plus, where would I come up with that?  I had no prior knowledge of underground bases looking like cities with actual &quot;suburban neighborhoods,&quot; complete with fake sunrises and fake tweeting birds to give the human inhabitants the illusion of the surface world. Also made me realize how much of what we think we know about life on the so-called surface is really what we think it is.  O.o  I never let this dream go, and have periodically thought about it whenever finding myself in some suburban neighborhood that looks similar to what I saw.   So anyway, while nobody can be certain of anything that anybody on the &#39;net is saying, especially when they&#39;re posting anonymously as somebody with supposed inside knowledge, doing the usual &quot;I know _____ ....ask me a question!&quot; thing, on the other hand what you&#39;re saying does line up with what I saw in my &quot;dream.&quot;   So who knows...............!</p>

<p>So many here have said a variation of what you said above.  So now you know that I know.  This is the external evidence of your internal dreams.  No one could have known what you stated, but yet I do.</p>

<p>From my fathers research and my continuing, I will say this.  It seems we are in the REAL universe, BUT we are locked into like a recurring theme.  This recurring theme forces us to live/act/abide by its rules. </p>

<p>This is why for any who think outside the box of the system, or do things that challenge the system, all hell is dropped on those individuals, because all have to remain in this &#39;awake dream&#39;.</p>

<p>Some of us pickup on this, and can even FEEL that something ISN&#39;T RIGHT.</p>

<p>My father loved his family, and even though he did keep things from us.  He felt it was important that we knew.  So family/blood over government.  It&#39;s odd how people such as yourself and many many others can&#39;t seem to understand tight family/friend bonds as this.  THIS IS ACTUALLY REALITY, the reality that you live which shows the opposite is the problem (kindly).</p>

<p>What are your plans for the near future, next couple of years, to stay safe and avoid danger?</p>

<p>Do you have any information on current economic collapse of European and Western Nations?</p>

<p>Finally my last question which is the most out there. What are your thoughts on the supposed shift from current reality to 5D reality. Do you think the planet is really going through the shift in consciousness or is this in part propaganda from the &quot;Elite&quot;? </p>

<p>Most western countries have been in a semi economic collapse for a while now.  Most of them survived off of parasitic way to sustain themselves for hundreds of years.  Well this is naturally coming to an end.</p>

<p>Reality is always changing, has always changed.  It&#39;s just during certain times or places in the universe, this action is made easier for most.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A shift is happening.  But guess what?  This shift has always happened, all the time.  It is nothing new.  </p>

<p>There was a major vortex over the world, but especially America between the years of 1930 (approx) till about 1990 (approx).  More has changed within that time period than any before it and so far any after it.  That was the ascension time.  </p>

<p>So the time chart is off in this world, and more than likely it is on purpose.</p>

<p>Barbara Marciniak has provided information similar to this in her books and audio. She claims that nanotechnology is being introduced to our bodies from many different vectors, (prescription medications, vaccines, atmospheric aerosol injection, etcetera) and that the nanobots self-assemble into antennae arrays inside the body, leaving us far more susceptible to certain technological influences and control. She also speaks of the soul net (your edit#4) and the recycling of souls, of how we are tricked into re-entering this consciousness trap over and over to serve the needs of those in control.</p>

<p>From your perspective, is Barbara Marciniak a decent source of information, or is she more similar to Dolores Cannon (bits of truth wrapped in deception used to further the agenda of STS entities)? </p>

<p>I think the environmental nanotechnology infusion is related to the Morgellons phenomenon; the CDC insists it is a mental disorder despite the obvious physical manifestations. Would you care to elaborate in this area?</p>

<p>When you speak of technology in the cave, you make it clear that it is basic earth tech being applied in ways that most are not aware of. These surveillance spheres though.... they seem not of this world. Are the spheres alien in origin, a mixture of earthly and ET tech, or human tech that is simply unknown to most?</p>

<p>What, exactly, is their purpose? Do they function solely in the realm of surveillance, or are they capable of interacting with us? Will they be there to supply a bit of extra &quot;numbing frequency&quot; should they notice a person becoming a bit too aware? Do they function in any sort of bioenergy collection capacity?</p>

<p>She&#39;s a liar, she channels demons.  She has absolutely no idea who she is channeling, or she knows and is a active deceiver.

<p>Yes, this is very similar to the Hindu&#39;s perspective on Kali Yuga age we are currently in.</p>

<p>Any known chemicals that are super beneficial or anything?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This.. this is what I&#39;ve been searching for in the last few years.  There is something massive missing from our nutrient chain and it is not on the periodic table of elements (aren&#39;t they say nice for giving us that).  </p>

<p>What I will give as a tip is that this food would more than likely be found some where within great forest ranges.  So look at google earth find 2 or 3 of the biggest forest on the planet.  Well then narrow it down to the largest of them all.  Well some where in there it can be found.  Without divulging my private notes, that is the best I can do publicly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anything about this key process?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides the consumption of this true &#39;whole food&#39; there is nothing more that even needs to be done.  The processes are taken care of automatically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anything about the foods in particular that may be related to these previously existing fruit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From what my father has said about his research is that eating this food would be equivalent to meeting the controller of our universe.  BUT, it is not that this food is just so magnificent, it is just that we are so nutrient deficient, that it would cause this massive surge within us.</p>

<p>Yes, it is atrophied by a lack of nutrition, BUT even though this is the case.. AGAIN, MAN is a wonderful and strong species.  And many of humanity would still have a enough juice to potential pull through. So for them, fluoride, genetically modified food, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that this topic of The Food is nutritional, and thus we are limited by our lack of this missing dietary element. However, I am not sure I am able to start foraging expeditions in my current state. In addition to my lacking skills, you&#39;ll have for forgive me as I must remain skeptical of your findings.</p>

<p>You have mentioned a few clues as to the whereabouts and leads pertaining to this ambrosia. You have also spoken on a few oppressive detriments placed on the human people due to outside forces, frequencies and misinformation about our diet. Do you believe there are activities, practices, or skills one can cultivate which could assist with this elusive deficiency and negate the interference?</p>

<p>I do not think it is a jump to say you are equating this plant with the ability to reach a potential. You mention physical longevity and strengthening as well as mental prowess. You even allude to a spiritual quality in witnessing a truth of reality, one thing many search for with the help of psychotropics. Seeing as how I, and others, may not be experienced herbalists or mycologists or what have you, do you believe that the benefits of this substance can be achieved in other ways? Or is it purely nutritional and no amount of exercise or meditative practice can get us close to this potentiality?</p>

<p>Finally, do you believe that ingesting this &#39;fruit of the world&#39; is necessary and encouraged for people? I think it&#39;s easy to want such a benefit for ones self, but do you believe that it is beneficial to our global community as a whole? Would there be risks, obvious or not, involved with a hypothetical resurgence of this food?</p>

<p>There is nothing at this time that will provide the needed nutrition that human body needs to live a long healthy life.  IF humanity decided to focus it&#39;s genius on nutrition, than maybe.  But this is not the case.</p>

<p>It is purely nutritional, other physical practices may make your stronger, more flexible, more healthy.  But you would still be in a negative nutritional state.</p>

Than, if these fruits or let&#39;s say plants exist on several places around the universe(?), what is there exact purpose? It sounds like they were an artificial creation and nothing that would randomly through evolution occure. Also about (8), what exactly do you mean with &quot;unable to remember&quot;? </p>

<p>Colony</p>

<p>Where did the universe come into play here?  This food was once abundant on this planet until it was intentionally destroyed many years ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It sounds like they were an artificial creation and nothing that would randomly through evolution occure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The food you see around you is nutrient deficient food.  Most food (fruits/vegetables) take more energy to process than what it gives you back.  So you are on a steady decline, which ends with death.</p>

<p>This place once had foods that gave you more when your body processed it than taken away.  This were true nutrient rich foods.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also about (8), what exactly do you mean with &quot;unable to remember&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unable to remember everything, to it&#39;s smallest detail of what you&#39;ve been doing.  </p>

<p>If I asked you, what did you do last week.  You&#39;ll be surprised how must people wouldn&#39;t be able to UNLESS it was something major.  Let alone them trying to remember things of insignificance.</p>

<p>People think this is normal... it is not.</p>

<p>It depends in what context.  Many references to manna or mana or dealing with eating melanated flesh.  </p>

<p>No, far from.  As long ago as species of fauna, floral and fungi have been here, man has had a intimate relationship with her.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  For those who need it, the plant kingdom could take one beginner to advanced state if taken in the proper order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and they seem to correlate in my mind</p>

<p>Well the correlation would only be that they are plants.  The true &#39;whole food&#39; is a physical food, that brings the physical body to a super state.  It would be something you eat as you eat an apple.  Not something you use for ritual/learning purposes.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t spoon feed the answer (kindly).  You have to come to the ultimate answer for you, by you.  The answer is within this post which I stated over and over again.</p>

<p>Man was still going through the downfall at this time.  Even though the technologies in that area were wonderful and many men at that time were much stronger than men today.  Still, it is during the downfall.</p>

<p>You need to go back quite a bit further think in the range of 100-500 thousand years ago.  Seems like a long time, but in actuality it is not.  It is just a blink of an eye to some species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting!</p>

<p>There is a lot of information online regarding spiritual development and also a lot of misinformation. There seems to be no right or wrong answer, implying a duality. If it speaks to intuition and resonates with the self then the path becomes clearer to the user seeking truth. Would you disagree with this statement? </p>

<p>I understand that this is a personal quest and if a direct answer were to be given, it would be met with ridicule and disbelief. Direct experience is the true way of learning and understanding. So, I wanted to say that I appreciate the answers you have given, collectively there&#39;s enough to go on to start the adventure.</p>

<p>That date (100-500 thousand years ago) speaks to me about our human anatomy, the coexistence of homo sapiens with their ancestors and ilk. I don&#39;t really have a question surrounding this but I find it interesting to note how we have been anatomically this way, for this long, yet HOW we developed like this is still critically debated. The imagination runs wild with possibilities surrounding the development of self-awareness, intelligence, cause and effect and also the imagination itself. Personally, I can&#39;t fathom how spirit links into this and the implications it would have on our understanding of our self and future development. </p>

The all seeing eye and the iiluminati, so i decorated the set with those symbols, the music video came out and internet trolls were certain the artist was a member, all the while i was laughing all the way to the bank.

<p>It is not as hard as you think.  There are secret societies all around you and yet you wouldn&#39;t even know where to start to find out who they are etc.  And I&#39;m not talking about Freemasonry, they are new on the block.</p>

<p>The spiraling downfall of humanity has been going on for a very long time.  And the overseers profit on secrecy but humanity does not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have meditated. There are mantras, visualizations, focusing on breathing, paying attention to every inch of your body, producing an &#39;inner smile&#39;, moving energy around the body, fixing mind on a thought, fixing attention on an object you&#39;re looking at, and so on. Was just wondering if there are any in particular that are especially valuable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even though some of the one you named aren&#39;t as useful and were just made up by the new age generation, but if you have been doing all those different types then you are much further along than many.</p>

<p>In short, meditation is not doing most of what you have.  Meditation is just sitting quiet and emptying mind.  THAT IS ALL.  Literally all the meditations you named above you&#39;re doing something!</p>

<p>So I suggest meditating how many have for 1000s of years for peace, powers, and spiritual insight.  And that is just finding a comfortable position, and closing eyes, and just meditating in nothingness, THAT&#39;S IT!</p>

<p>The nothingness, is what brings about the change.  Many especially in the west find this extremely hard because their minds operate on the premise, doing something = change.  Not doing something = doing nothing.  </p>

<p>You have to be empty as a bowl so you maybe filled with the cereal of the universe. =)</p>

<p>What do you know about outer space or space travel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Space travel is possible. You would think this is obvious by watching TV and by other news... but it&#39;s not and I&#39;ll explain why.</p>

<p>There is a something a IT, that is locked here on this planet and it can not get off for whatever reason.  So in turn it uses a specific species of human to do its dirty work.</p>

<p>Allow me to go further...  Just think about the genius it would take to build a robot, then fly this robot up into space, and then once in space ACTUALLY fly to a planet millions of miles away.... and then once there it recognizes this and literally drops down to the planet.  Unrolls itself and starts searching the planet... and in the process even taking samples.  And sending sample data back to earth.</p>

<p>Just really meditate and ponder the above.  IF this is possible than fixing earths many problems is actually EASY.  BUT, earths issues keep getting massively worst, food, air, water, etc.  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense right?  Something is missing... a link between the two.</p>

<p>I digress.</p>
