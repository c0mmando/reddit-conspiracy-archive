        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anyone else feel like here lately we are being bombarded by American propaganda via MSM and Russian propaganda via AM? Is there anyplace that posts true news stories any more, or is this just the propaganda phase of WWIII and we&#39;ve missed the boat? Past the point of no return and we as Americans are just stuck with what we got because it&#39;s nearing the end of its empirical cycle? If we get involved in a hot war with Russia, that would pretty much kill any chance of achieving any real change here right? Because the powers that be will almost certainly not give up without some sort of violence towards dissidents which in turn would anger dissidents into violence. And we couldn&#39;t risk fighting another civil war because we&#39;ve already pissed too many folks to go through a phase where the state is weakened, citing national security as a very real concern in that scenario.  So how do we change the position we&#39;re in now? Please spare answers like, &quot;should have 40 years ago&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave you that and see what you make of it. I&#39;ll also drop you some knowledge. Ghosts/Demons/Aliens/Archons are all the same thing. I am not religious but all those holy texts are trying to tell you something.</p>

They live in this fake world and believe it to be true and grasp onto everything to stay in the real world. If that&#39;s not insanity idk what is.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting read. And am I correct in assuming that you are referring to ghosts/aliens  ect.  as some sort of interdimensional entities, all of the same source but manifested in different ways into the material fabric that we can detect with our God given senses?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can be trained to see them better. Taking drugs, drinking, fasting, and sleep deprivation are all ways to heighten senses towards it. They in my opinion have a way to affect our minds by implanting idea&#39;s and possibly other things. For all I care the humans who are in government and running the world today are basically spawns of all the dark entities in that article.</p>

<p>I believe the dark ones like everything negative, fear, hatred, anger, helplessness, they take and take and never get enough.</p>

<p>The light beings are God beings and they give everything good, in this world there is nothing that can describe it, words can&#39;t put it into picture. Imagine the love all your family has for you, combined, well these beings love you even more. They give you knowledge based on how well your spiritual being can handle it.</p>

<p>As Jesus said Satan has rulership over the world right now. It&#39;s true the dark entities are running the world and that&#39;s the reason things are the way they are. From the perspective I have been given I would say quite literally everything we see is a lie. We are immortals and we never die, when we die we are spirits and we are in another world.</p>

<p>Some people are different than others, I&#39;ve always been different than everyone around me. Early on in my life I was very smart and good in school but over the years I couldn&#39;t make sense of it anymore. I know now it&#39;s because if I could make sense of it I wouldn&#39;t have been able to make sense of how I see the world now.</p>

<p>We basically all have a 6th sense, everyone&#39;s 6th sense is slightly different in my opinion. My 6th sense gives me very good visualization of the bigger picture. I can also now see entities around me sometimes based on if I am tired or intoxicated.</p>

<p>Our 6th sense is our pineal gland, as you will see all over ancient pyramids. <a href="http://www.occultopedia.com/images_/the-eye-of-horus.jpg">The eye of Horus,</a> <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pSFhcf6kLe0/maxresdefault.jpg">in the dollar bill it sits above the pyramid and is represented by the all seeing eye.</a></p>

<p>There is tons of symbols all over the world and even on the very internet and computer you are using. I would predict from all my research that we believe we are advanced right now but we are quite literally in the stone age compared to where we once were. The end of the Age is because the dark entities are currently in control, it&#39;s going to swap over to the God entities.</p>

<p>I know everything and it took me months to know I can&#39;t fix anything and the world is stuck how it is. It really sucks because I could literally give people the knowledge to fix all the world literally over night, but I can&#39;t. It&#39;s because there is some spiritual aspect to being able to see it. I have done bad things don&#39;t get me wrong, even things that others would look down on, but I&#39;ve also always tried and woke up with a smile on my face facing the world head on. Even when I was waking up to a slap in the face lol. Detecting the entities is part of it, realizing they exist is the biggest part though.</p>

<p>Everything is a mind game, behind every negative emotion and negative thought is a negative spirit tricking you. God entities teach you that in reality we have little control as weird as that sounds lol.</p>

<p>Basically what I am saying is, our 5 senses perceive the world and try to make sense of it. But our soul, our pineal gland (The seat of the soul), our heart, whatever you wish to call it, if you get in touch with it, there are no questions. You get all knowing. It sounds messed up but the world is perceived and it makes sense. But once you get all knowing you realize how in reality everything is backwards. The natives would say everything is upside down. I heard people say that to me before and I could never understand what they meant I just thought they were crazy. It couldn&#39;t be closer to the truth. Everything is backwards for now and we can&#39;t change it. There is a climax coming because as I said the entities love everything negative. They feast on negative emotions. So they are ramping up the world so that everyone goes through the most misery possible so that they can feast. Once you understand the truth though you can&#39;t really get sad anymore. I am completely disconnected from the world because I know it&#39;s helpless and anyone who believe in love and truth get&#39;s saved. I figured it out in less than a year, makes the 13 years I spent going through school seem super pointless because to learn the truth you basically have to unlearn a lot of beliefs you used to hold.</p>

<p>Basically it&#39;s really understanding what I am trying to say. If you live by love and just think in your mind, I&#39;ll leave you a Tesla quote and I will add, the reason he figured out everything he figured out is because he knows exactly what I know. He just didn&#39;t know all his work would get hijacked and used for nefarious reasons.</p>

<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xRdgTIF2wJg/UQvAVZfeXxI/AAAAAAAAg-c/-IxOqeRsueU/s1600/The+gift+of+mental+power+comes+from+God.jpg">Tesla on God</a></p>

<p>To be quite serious in the end I will say, I tried to make sense of the world and it just led me to going down false paths. Do exactly what Tesla said. I don&#39;t know anything myself I don&#39;t even have to think. Thinking is for people who don&#39;t know God. If i want to know something I just think and know God is going to grant me answers. I did that, I made sense of what I learned, and now I have all the information to wake up mass amounts of people. The day will come and I will do it. They can burn me at the stake I seriously don&#39;t care lol. In the end I will reveal all the corruption and teach everyone the truth. People won&#39;t believe because like I said, it comes from the God beings. If they don&#39;t choose the people and leave them for the demons, it&#39;s not my job to save them. It&#39;s their own job. In the end I will release literally everything I know in various forms so that anyone can understand it. I will also likely hold my own place where people can come and ask me questions. God listens to all of our thoughts, all of our love, all of our beliefs and everything we say. He bears no judgement. I have done bad things trust me and to them it doesn&#39;t matter, they just love you.</p>

<p>I hope this break down was good, sounds insane to the unbeliever so I suggest you believe. The world is fucked, just know God is lord and he wants us to be gentle, kind and loving to everyone around us.</p>

<p>There is a chance for everyone. I can&#39;t wait for the future because when things get bad is exactly when people need to realize this truth. Understanding that single truth can allow you to be blissful 24/7 with literally nothing. Just writing this quick thing I feel so much love in me because they are everywhere and since so few people recognize their existence they really love the ones who &quot;wake up&quot;</p>

<p>They love modesty, but not in this world. I am a God.</p>

<p>Edit: Thank you for the support you other dear souls who understand, wait until we show up on the surface and take over this planet. I laugh thinking about it, all these PhD bearers won&#39;t know what hit em.</p>

Open source all information (within reason) and allow everyone, via the majesty of the internet, access to and ability to comment upon it. </p>

<p>Obvious applications for government by forum/upvote/likes, via platforms whose financing must be visible to all. </p>

<p>Companies can restrict outside access to their information, but are transparent from within. Hopefully self correcting their morals due to the constant fear of whistleblowers within their ranks as they grow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting. I like this ideology on many different levels. 
A.) This would be the cornerstone to a true and free democracy 
B.) With the ability to keep secrets, it is human nature to keep those secrets thus putting even the most upstanding and good natured citizen at risk for corruption. 
C.) There is no reason for the electoral system we have in place today to still be in operation with the advanced computer technology we have access to. </p>

<p>A couple questions, do you think population could be a problem with this system? And by that I mean ignorant population. Because let&#39;s face it, some people are too interested in sports and pop culture to even begin to care about these issues. Do you think the major social change needed to educate people on how to access their own belief system is possible? Perhaps it could be possible within a generation, given the indoctrination techniques employed by the department of education are systematically done away with and true education replaces them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s always cool to find someone that gets it right off the bat. Nice. </p>

<p>Pretty much the only perk of having a government is that as an average guy you don&#39;t have to care. I think the ability to assign your vote into the hands of a close relative/local leader/most politically aware friend could help with this, with the ability at all times to change your vote should a discussion actually take your interest should be a possible set up. </p>

<p>And hopefully with all the secrets, money, lobbies etc. open for everyone to see should their interest be piqued, any nefarious abuses of the system will already have been vetted by those in the community who are interested. </p>

<p>I steal believe there&#39;s a huge cultural shift needed, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be an entire generation forcibly unplugged from the matrix or anything to drastic... more like, just make it &#39;cool&#39; to be politically/socially minded. We&#39;re aiming for that hundredth monkey, I can&#39;t remember the exact number but only like... 12% of the population were actually keen at the onset of the American revolution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it&#39;s three percent, as that&#39;s where the three percenters draw their name from. And I like that idea too, having the pop culture used for good purposes, like being politically aware. that could also be a slippery slope on the other hand though because at what point does it cross over into the propaganda realm? One could not show the world of political and social structure for anything more than it is. It should be just something humans do naturally, passed down through the generations. Just like fishing and hunting, woodworking, metal working, how shelter is made, ect. It is something that certain animals do for the betterment of their species, naturally and it just so happens that humans are able to take it to all new levels. I believe Japanese snow monkeys have a complex social structure very close to human social structure. I think it could catch on like that. And to teach political &quot;tools&quot; to everyone, such as diplomacy, and interstate relationships. Expose as many to it as possible and produce the cream of the crop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  We&#39;re just accelerating their plan, inducing hologram aliens and a war of the worlds that will unify us &quot;<em>finally</em>&quot; under one world government, which they&#39;ve wanted all along.  I mean, they&#39;ve leaked there are aliens, so expect them, within a week before, during or after election in early november.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s not aliens it will be another terrror attack.  A nuke scare.  It will culminate in Obama freezing elections and instituting martial law and then his third term (prorated one, after many months of deciding how to &#39;redo&#39; the elections&#39;).  It might even be some kind of alchemical marriage wherein both Trump and Hillary are blown up together in a debate or some other event.  And that will be the beginning of the true NWO, the completion of their work of global alchemy.</p>

<p>Lots of stupid people who haven&#39;t been paying attention to history will kill themselves, but keep in mind, those people are ones who didn&#39;t question 9/11 either.  Sayin&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmfao I like the fact that you called bonus points for their overt phoenix and rose symbology.  Interesting fact, lots of people who did question 9/11 and other unrelated scandals killed themselves already. By shooting themselves.... twice... in the back of the head... with different guns.. .. and then stuffed themselves inside duffle bags. And padlocked  it.</p>

<p>Edit: spelling, guess the autocorrect on my phone is stuck on drunk</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most terrifying thing to me is how propped up Hillary is.  If anything we know that those who control tend to bet on both sides.  </p>

<p>On one side of Hillary is the obvious, the Clinton background of drug smuggling. </p>

<p>But what about the other side?</p>

<p>That&#39;s where I start getting really scared. Hillary&#39;s past is so obvious to anyone that wants to look for it. So what does that mean along with some of the opening up of UN forces able to be used on American soil and the cranking up of pointing out Police Abuse in American media (which to be fair has gone on and been an issue forever, but now is getting prime coverage...again, why?).</p>

<p>I&#39;m terrified the other side of this coin is heading to war and America getting blasted and Hilary&#39;s abuse getting shown to the world as a reason for us getting sanctioned or destroyed.  I mean think about times when a woman was propped up as a leader... We saw it here on Reddit itself. It&#39;s usually been used as a circus where things go wrong fast at some point and the truly devious happens in the background.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested if anyone has any thoughts since even this place has been invaded (14 out of 15 mods here in this subreddit were put here in the last year... Not saying they&#39;re crooked, I&#39;m just saying there&#39;s a significant change in the politics going on here).  </p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested to know what those who see a little more think like <a href="/u/911bodysnatchers322">/u/911bodysnatchers322</a> and any others you guys know.  I&#39;m sure there are a ton more, but those who actually believe some of the illuminati shit that&#39;s pretty much out in the open anymore.  I also saw George Soros (who was always good to follow when investing money) took his money out of most American markets and invested heavily in China.  </p>

<p>Worry is the worst thing we can do, worry is paralyzingly.  I&#39;m thinking more what can actively be done to make sure we&#39;re not on the wrong side of both sides of the coin. Even worse is both Trump and Hillary are both actively for war, it&#39;s painfully obvious that we&#39;re going to war in Syria and then you add all the propaganda and some of the pictures of American fighter jets painted like Russian jets... A propaganda war is setting the stage for a very real war, with two hated people as the leader...  </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy if you look at the right information to see what&#39;s coming, but what are some of your guys&#39; thoughts on what&#39;s around the next corner?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting. I like this ideology on many different levels. 
A.) This would be the cornerstone to a true and free democracy 
B.) With the ability to keep secrets, it is human nature to keep those secrets thus putting even the most upstanding and good natured citizen at risk for corruption. 
C.) There is no reason for the electoral system we have in place today to still be in operation with the advanced computer technology we have access to. </p>

<p>A couple questions, do you think population could be a problem with this system? And by that I mean ignorant population. Because let&#39;s face it, some people are too interested in sports and pop culture to even begin to care about these issues. Do you think the major social change needed to educate people on how to access their own belief system is possible? Perhaps it could be possible within a generation, given the indoctrination techniques employed by the department of education are systematically done away with and true education replaces them?</p>
