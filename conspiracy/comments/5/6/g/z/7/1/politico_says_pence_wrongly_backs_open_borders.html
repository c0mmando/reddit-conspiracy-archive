       Probably because Trump is saying all the things they don't want said, and you can literally see the entire establishment ganging up on him to stop him from having a chance to be President. You have to wonder if that's all an act then what's their motive? It makes no real sense.

       Oh get out of here with that shit. Any publicity is good publicity, and the establishment knows this. You're saying dynasties of families that have been in some form of power, and have been DOCUMENTED to have gamed both sides of major wars for the passed 300 years (being EXTREMELY generous there) have somehow got bested by a reality show real estate mogul baby boomer? Really? That's what you're saying? Let's put that into perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but no matter how you slice your logic here, it's at best woefully naive, or at worst deliberately misinformative. If we were to rewind just 2 years ago we'd find that most people would tell you without a doubt that they knew the MSM was entirely controlled. Hell this was a major aspect of the entire 9/11 conspiracy theory - an utter distrust of the media. And what happened? Trump, just one man, caught the gatekeepers like Rupert Murdoch sleeping? Listen to yourself, lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what the media does to people who are organic and don't want to follow the status quo and change things up? They treat them like a fucking 1970s Star Wars Christmas Extravaganza: nobody talks about them. They understand the Streissand Effect. They understand almost everything about data trends and macro level cultural trends and how to manipulate them. They know exactly how to push government agenda, how to spin anything, and how to package it in multiple languages, and make it shiny. They have honed this down to a science all the way back from hiring Edward Bernays to manufacture public opinion to get into both World Wars, to co-opting the social revolutions of the 60s into corporate, fashionable revolutions that could be controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you REALLY believe someone who fucking puts on parties for and parties WITH the elite got the best of it all because he's just a righteous crusader who wants to "make America Great Again".? Remember what they did to Ron Paul? I'm talking WEASEL-LY, nefarious shit like, simply presenting poll results graphics in very misleading formats on screen, or sometimes completely out of order like, even though Ron Paul got 2nd in a huge poll with the rest of them, they'd present him 4th or 5th in order to make it appear quickly to the viewer, as their sensory inputs are overloaded by what's on screen, that he indeed is unpopular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't they doing that to Trump? Why didn't they not acknowledge him in the beginning when "being popular" wasn't an excuse? Just treated him like a ghost? Why didn't he HAVE to resort to alternative media and town-hall style gatherings like Gary Johnson? I mean, after all he wants to make America great again for the common man, right? Remember how Fox ACTIVELY helped spin the Ron Paul newsletters? FOX? Fucking red team channel? Now WATCH how Fox will help Trump save face. Watch how they will shill for him.

       If you are comfortable with how deeply you think you critically think, you need to think deeper. They are steps ahead of us because they are working on a multi generational time scale.

       Yes.  See some of the leaked docs.  Politicio asked HillaryLand if they wanted to cohost a party with them during the primaries.  Lots of communication btw. Politico and Hillaryland.
