       This is like going to Drudge and claiming a right wing conspiracy because the comments are Trump leaning.

       Is there fuckery going on. Yes. But the headline itself destroys the whole theory here. If correct the record was so powerful, why couldnt they make

       You're neglecting the obvious censorship. Many top posts are deleted with thousands of upvotes for no reason (other than they are critical of Clinton). Other issues are regularly deleted as well, such as criticism of Israel.

       He said there is fuckery. So he didn't ignore it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying it's 100% CTR is frustrating though. People not paid have a bias too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or should we suggest that THIS sub is infiltrated by, let's say, Canadian shills that want to deflate the USD by electing Trump? It's just as substantial as claiming that because we know there's paid shilling, that it's ALL paid shilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not. People hate Trump more than Hillary. And unfortunately are hesitant with third parties. To me, that's the most frustrating part. It's not just shills, people I talk to in real life (give it a shot) are in the same boat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the primary ended, that sub was pro bernie and anti Hillary. And anti Trump. Now just anti Trump

       Well in my opinion, there is more than enough  evidence that HRC should be convicted and sentenced. 
Also somebody's username is a very small piece of information that typically lends very little to the identity of the poster. I'm just saying criticize the message not the name of the poster. However I do agree with your clarification that things do get out of hand. This sub tends to attract unhinged people and saboteurs with their own agendas, as well as curious folks and people who seek alternative viewpoints.

       It's true, many of the people on politics who are belligerent and insultive trolls in their support for Hillary aren't paid off. You know, the ones that argue in circles and result to insults and thinks providing sources of information about your argument is stupid, comes across as extraordinarily belligerent. Believe it or not most aren't shills, the sadder state of affairs OP is that most Americans are just retarded. We can blame "the elites" for pushing shitty foods and vaccines and dumping toxic chemicals on us, but at the end of the day we do it to ourselves. I wonder how many Mexicans built that prison wall knowing it would be a cage for him and his kind, but did it anyways because paychecks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder how many cameras that guy installed on military missle drones before he thought "this will be used to murder children"  but decided fuck it, paycheck. I wonder how many military veterans joined knowing that the war was wrong, knowing that we are the new Nazis come to invade other lands and steal, knowing we would commit atrocities that our future children, if we have future children, would never ever forgive us for if they ever knew.  But fuck it, GI bill, I need to pay muh college.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can complain about the 999 "super elite" (just worthless pedo fags is all they are) all day long but in the end, we do it to ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politics is of course shilled and manipulated, no doubt about it. But the sad, pathetic, disheartening truth OP, is that most Americans are just as much of a warhawking soul sucking worthless skeezy pedophilic murderer as Hillary Clinton. Or Trump for that matter.

       I have yet to see one positive post about Jill Stein... Ron Paul has spoken out a number of times about her and how great her policies are. So explain to me again how r/politics is unbiased. Shit I even posted a demographic the other day on post/up vote manipulation in one of their threads and had over 800 upvotes. Today that same post went down to 2... anything that gains traction calling out bias is down voted to oblivion wants it reaches the top of the thread.

       reddit is so pro Hillary that she dominates r/politics but not enough people support her to get r/hillaryclinton running. So obviously correct the record isn't influencing r/politics. great explanation using logic to back up your conclusion

       Upvoted. I don't understand why people think it's strange. Whether we like it or not, is a two part system. We can and should work to change that fact, but it didn't work out this time. We can now practice American democracy and shoot ourselves in the left foot or the right, dealers choice, it is a democracy after all.

       We don't. Have you not noticed, it's all anti-Trump and in case you haven't noticed, it seems like it is well deserved hate for Trump.

       Clinton is just the guy by default. But on the scale of evil from hitler being -10 and Lincoln being +10, clinton is at least on the positive side of the scale. Trump is well into the negatives.

       I mean, if he was somehow elected president, he could easily get a meeting of dozens of experts to fill him in. Its not like presidents need to be experts on every single topic.

       He doesn't need the funds for an expert team of advisors.  He has not even the simplest understanding right now.  The idea of getting a meeting of 'experts to fill him in' is ridiculous.  Right now is not the time to vote third party to make a statement.  Certainly not a vote for a guy like Gary Johnson.  This type of thinking is part of the problem.

       Lmao, that is literally the game plan for any politician with access to knowledgeable people either by money or by connections - what is easier, asking a group of people for their facts and opinions about a topic, or reading dozens of articles and books about a topic?

       i'm not even arguing in favor of Johnson, I'm just arguing against the silly notion that not knowing exact details on one out of millions of topics is somehow the worst thing in the world when politicians will have dozens of advisers giving them research, facts, and opinions on those same topics.

       I agree. It would be nice if our government represented both by class, as well as by region.

       Different states matter less than certain areas.

       Depending on where you are. Kansas? Trump gets those electoral votes for sure, so you might as well make a "statement" vote. Ohio? May be a tossup, so now you have to worry about if your principles are worth it. It's only in these close states that a vote for third party means a vote for Clinton or Trump.

       So you support expanding NSA spying powers, mass censorhip of the Internet, resigning in the Patriot Act and the 911 state of emergency that essentially places the country under martial law, as well as being okay with the fact that he was listed in the names of the note book that convicted pedophile and child rapist Jeffrey Epstien where they flew to a private island where they raped child prostitutes, of whom trump referred to as, and  I quote,  "a great guy and a great friend."

       The same Trump that posted a 990 million dollar loss in one year that he has never gotten back that can be verified in any way, which happened after multiple casino hotels he ran into bankruptcy and ended up owning hundreds of millions to the backers? The same Trump who's most stable part of his career was hosting a reality TV show on Fox network?

       No the tone of all of your posts has been snarky. You sound like you're 15 and can't comprehend the complexities of the world. Do I like additional surveillance? No. Do I want censorship? No. I want more opportunities for Americans and less debt. The best candidate for that is Trump. Is he my ideal candidate? No, but I'll take the best we've got. I would never vote Hilary because of how dishonest and corrupt she is. And she is going to expand government way more than trump would. Gary Johnson is nowhere close to a libertarian. He is being pushed by the establishment republicans to give hilary more votes to win because they need their uniparty corrupt system to work. And on the tax issue, I'm not sure if you've noticed one of the subs I post in, but it's accounting because I'm a CPA. Carrying operating losses forward for many years to offset gains is allowed by the tax code. We are all laughing about the ignorance of people and this issue. If you are wealthy and can afford good accountants and lawyers you can substantially reduce, if not eliminate taxes you need to pay. Go look at some of the public companies effective tax rates and see how similar they are to your tax rate because of their write offs and deductions.

       Actually evidence shows Johnson is hurting Clinton and is a major reason for the race being so narrow. Johnson and Weld are the libertarian parties best chance at getting federal funding next year if they reach 5% of the popular vote. Not telling you to vote for him, but just trying to give you my perspective as to why I'm voting for him.

       Do you have a link for the johnson hurting clinton? Im curious about reading it. Everyone i know touting Johnson is a republican that is listening to the msm about Trump. That is a good point about the funding. I guess I'm holding out hope that Trump isn't a part of the system and can do something to help. If this was uniparty vs uniparty then Johnson would have my vote.

        Johnson takes votes from Clinton
       </a>
       This is from about a month ago, but keep in mind, a wikileaks dump could bring a wave of Clinton jumpers to vote for Gary Johnson.
I don't blame you for holding out hope with Trump. He has really shaken things up and I can see it being a positive change.

       As conflicting the ideology is, I've found there are definitely ways to compromise (been testing with libs at work). For example, they would be good with replacing the over bureaucratic welfare system with a basic income. Also, they are OK with a cap-n-trade program to limit carbon emissions. And both parties want to remove all subsidies for corporations.

       It's a good start, but won't do shit if we keep the FPTP vote.

       it doesn't matter, the votes don't count, and the sooner we admit it the better off we'll be for the future.

       you boys and girls still talking about "voting" might as well be in Russia or DPRK talking about "voting" and "swing states" while 1 or 2 families pass the highest offices and appointments back and forth between their wives, sons, and business associates/campaign donors/family friends (which is what Trump is to both the Bush and Clinton families). The institutions of government have been seized by criminals and anti-democratic subversive elements of our society, and they're not accepting your "votes" anymore. See the past 30-40 years worth of elections for source/proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       your votes don't matter, they don't count, they will always provide false results that appear to show a "close-run race" (like 54/46, or 51/49, or 48/52, like the current trump/clinton II polls, and like the way they scammed the primaries between sanders/clinton), so that their fraud seems believable.

       Oh it's much worse than that. Worldwide oligarchy has been present for 100s of years. The only thing threatening to dislodge it, is the power of corportations, but most of them with any power are owned by the oligarchy.

       Considering OP very specifically said s/he'd be voting "none of the above" I'm assuming OP is Nevadan where it's a constitutionally valid ballot choice. If that's the case, OP is in fact in one of the few toss-up states.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, it might not matter. 538's most recent analysis suggests the electorate is so pro-Clinton that she could lose every toss-up state and still walk away with a majority of electoral votes.

       Yeah, last count I saw suggested she was likely to get over 300 votes from the electoral college, and Trump still has weeks to shove his foot further down his own throat.

       I dunno I get downvoted for reminding people of every Hillary fact we've been elucidated with so far this year in every subreddit but this one, political_revolution, jillstein, and socialism. CTR is really aiming at helping the already-short term-memory-deficient American population fully forget why Hillary is a dangerous elitist neoliberal.

       Going to r/politics would lead one to believe that almost every Redditor is a rabid, pathological Hillary fan.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when you go to r/HillaryClinton, it's lame, near-devoid of enthusiasm by comparison.  Some might even call it "low energy".
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason:  CTR folks aren't being paid to make r/HillaryClinton
       <em>
        great
       </em>
       , but to make the rest of Reddit
       <em>
        suck

       I was always careful to not break any rules in r/politics as well. I had heard the mods had trigger fingers and never ever called anyone a shill or anything that could even remotely be sen as breaking the rules. After maybe like a month or two of going on and on about election fraud and exit polls in the comments however, I was eventually permanently banned with a gaslighting lie in the ban notice.

       Yep. Coming off of a 21 day ban from politics right now as it were. The first few bans were for supposedly calling out another user for being a shill (even though they obviously are biased towards HRC), but my most recent ban was for "insinuating another user is a shill". The offense is already subjective in nature, but it's insane to me that other users can't call out the users with &lt;1 month old accounts posting exclusively pro-HRC/anti-Trump rhetoric. The politics subreddit is a joke, but I suppose I'll keep fighting the madness.

       A couple weeks ago, r/politics suddenly went back to normal for a few days. It was like CTR's website was down and the shills didn't know what to do with themselves without their instructions from David Brock.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they're back in full force. The mods obviously are being paid off. This is deception, pure and simple, and it should be illegal for political campaigns. It's false advertising on a grand scale and Reddit is more than happy to participate.

       The SandersForPresident sub was equally popular. It's insane how bad the HRC campaign is concerning enticing former Bernie supporters. I don't know a single Bernie supporter who is now supporting Hillary since the nomination. She's just the worst fucking candidate and I don't know how her corruption and collusion have continued for so long. When is the tipping point?

       It seemed to me that Bernie was painted as "the enemy" during the primaries. Many supporters were vocal about HRC's corruption and collusion, but her supporters weren't the ones being attacked. People were and still are seeking answers about Hillary's questionable actions and past, though the answers never come. HRC and her campaign have been on the attack since day 1.

       Nobody in their right mind saw the DNC corruption first hand and now thinks the MSM isn't painting Donald the same way they did Bernie

       Every single newspaper/celebrity/CEO and politician is forcing Hillary down our throats

       But I was skeptical and started to listening to his speeches first hand rather than hearing how the news wants me to interpret them and have already jumped ship fully from the Democratic party

       Now I will vote them into the Senate but never hillary

       look at Bernies positions on trade and compare them to trump's positions on trade they are almost identical.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was pro Bernie aswell but after hearing  him talk of breaking up banks and lamenting Wal-Mart for all of the welfare paid out to their employees  then watching him turn around and endorse a former Wal-Mart board member and recipient of $700,000 in speaking Fee's from Goldman Sachs really made me think he was controlled opposition from the start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of endorsing someone who's positions on trade he completely agreed with he endorsed the exact antithesis of his policies, all because DAS RAYCISIS

       Yup I was a staunch Bernie supporter and no way in hell I would ever give my vote to Shillary, she can pry it from my cold dead hands.... I'm sure she would have no problem with that though. I don't think I've met anyone who was supporting Bernie that's now supporting Hillary, they all hate her.

You  can get banned from r/hillaryclinton for litterally quoting Hillary Clinton... try posting about super predators there and see what happens.

       I'm sure CTR plays some roll. But I'm not surprised the progressive young community of reddit would take such a one sided stand toward keeping scary Trump from becoming president. On the other hand, it's disgusting that they can turn such a blind eye to Clinton's illegal misgivings and crookedness. I'm voting 3rd party per usual, especially since I live in a state without a chance of swinging.

       I think CTR has effectively shaped the narrative for  lot of left-leaning people. They are still there for sure, but a lot of people are doing the shilling for free because they have bought into it pretty hard. It's sad that we can't have discourse without psychological manipulation. Notice that both Hillary and Trump have started slinging mud, name calling, just really pandering with cheap emotionally charged arguments. At least when Sanders was still viable there was a semblance of critical thinking online. It's devolved into the childish Drumpf vs Killery narrative that just completely trivializes the hardships facing so many people in this country. Sad. Really really really sad.

       Yep, I check every comment and post now in certain subs to verify that they are showing up. I then have to periodically check later to make sure they weren't manually removed as well. It's bullshit, but it's something that we have to deal with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes they even remove comments that have gotten a lot of traction, such as
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mcZSd#pSzUwYg">
        this
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://imgur.com/aowCRsS">
        this
       </a>
       . They especially hate it when you spread  credible information about shilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is one of the best places to spread information. It's worth it to keep going even when we have to deal with bullshit like this.

       I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make and I genuinely have no dog in the fight with regards to your elections, I unsubbed from

       That explains her own bad week where every headline was anti-Clinton. Trump has way more scandals surrounding him, and much less nuanced scandals. Especially recently. Cuba embargo. Taxes. Charity abuses. Not to mention the endless comments he makes precisely because that's how he grabs media attention. Your conspiracy sucks shit.

       The same happened when Ron Paul ran in 2008. Liberals are really really against Trump. Can you blame them?

       IMHO, as long they have a different model number, that's all that's necessary. This really peaked my interest, cause I hadn't thought about it much. But if you're buying a big ticket item like a TV, I'd stay away from Walmart. This would be especially important if you're buying oil for your car. The oil might not be as good. Tires might wear out faster, engine might wear out faster. I looked at the oil packaging today as Walmart, and some of the gallon sizes are special packaged for Walmart. IMHO, I'd recommend being very careful what you're buying at Walmart, especially if it something as critical as oil or tires. There has to be some reason you can get an oil change so much cheaper at Walmart.

       It seemed to me that Bernie was painted as "the enemy" during the primaries. Many supporters were vocal about HRC's corruption and collusion, but her supporters weren't the ones being attacked. People were and still are seeking answers about Hillary's questionable actions and past, though the answers never come. HRC and her campaign have been on the attack since day 1.

       We don't. Have you not noticed, it's all anti-Trump and in case you haven't noticed, it seems like it is well deserved hate for Trump.

       Clinton is just the guy by default. But on the scale of evil from hitler being -10 and Lincoln being +10, clinton is at least on the positive side of the scale. Trump is well into the negatives.
