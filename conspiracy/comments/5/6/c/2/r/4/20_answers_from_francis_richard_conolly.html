<p>Q1. Is there an organized end game or is it just opportunism deriving power and money from random events? In other words is there a cohesive plan for an end game and if so what might it be?</p>

<p>A.  &#39;End Game&#39;  is an interesting phrase.  It rather presumes that the elite want to fix humanity into a state of suspended animation for all time.  I hope anyone interested in this question will carefully read Orwell&#39;s  &#39;1984&#39;  if they haven&#39;t already done so.  One of the most crucial concepts he advanced in that book is that the rich would completely understand, by this stage in our history, that history itself always follows a familiar pattern in which the poor are periodically led on by vague dreams of freedom and human brotherhood to follow a discontented middle class who have become power-hungry.  This itself is always a trick and they are finally &quot;enslaved all over again by new masters&quot;.  The essential plot of 1984 is that this was to happen one more time and then, due to the advantages of new technology being able to spy on everyone all the time, the ruling class would become untouchable and immovable.  It&#39;s a concept, perhaps I should say a warning, that the public should always heed.  However, I doubt that things will ever get so neat and tidy.  History is never neat and tidy, because change does seem ineluctably to be the law of life.  What the rich seek in an ongoing fashion is to have in place a system which can respond instantly to change and yet still allow the Oligarchs to maintain their grip on power.
In this sense there definitely is a cohesiveness which can rightly be thought of as &#39;method in the madness&#39;  ( which is how I believe that saying originated ).</p>

<p>What I think the person who asked this question has in mind is Prince Philip&#39;s cavilling about all of us being nothing but &quot;useless food eaters&quot;  and whether the Bilderberger types are now making plans to commit planet-wide genocides in order to make certain that the earth&#39;s limited resources, which definitely are getting scarce  (  peak oil etc )  will only be used for their benefit in the future? I would say this is highly likely, and that the system they now have in place for planet-wide phoney war is simply the dress rehearsal for much worse things to come.  It would not surprise me in the least, especially since Bill Gates recently killed thousands of Indian children with bad vaccines,  ( a crime for which there is still a warrant out for his arrest )  if the elite managed to reduce the world&#39;s population to around 2 Billion through various methods including biological warfare.  But would we let them get away with it?  Well, we&#39;re letting them get away with child sex abuse, phoney terrorist acts and electoral fraud.  So whilst I don&#39;t think there will necessarily be a fixed, rigid &#39;end game&#39;  which will finally make the elite immutable, and change impossible as in &#39;1984&#39;,  I can definitely see a protracted period in which the third world will essentially be eradicated, and that those who remain will simply be slaves growing food for the super-rich.  As the oil runs low we will of course be told that to &quot;protect national security&quot;  the military will have to take most of it, and we will finish up in a situation where most folk will bicycle to work in the rain while the rich speed overhead in private jets.  That is the kind of supreme inequality and Pyramidal hierachy which existed in the Edwardian age, and that is what I believe our &#39;end game&#39; will resemble.   </p>

<p>Q2. Total surveillance perverts the design of power structures - that is to say, if the NSA has all information on judges/elected officials/everyone, they ultimately have the ability to shape our reality.
My question is, what is the movement behind the intelligence agencies that conduct/analyze this information? Is there a group directing this growth of surveillance for a purpose, or did the technology just happen to advance while they were in power at their respective agencies?</p>

<p>A.  This is a very astute question, and one I like a lot, because any Historian worth his salt knows that an awful lot of our past was just an accident of history.  However, whilst it is certainly true that the technology has, so to speak, moved forward while the Oligarchs sat still, we can be certain this happened because surveillance methods, more than anything else in our world, have had their R&amp;D funded to the hilt, because nothing conveys more power than knowledge.  And the rich know this better than anyone.  They may not always have been able to predict where it was going or just how powerful it could become, but if one remembers they ordered the building of the U2 spy plane, which could photograph a packet of cigarettes from 70,000 feet up, as long ago as 1959, it&#39;s pretty clear how the rich have been thinking in this age.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q3. What exactly do you think we as citizens should do/can do to reclaim our sovereignty against the malicious overlords that stole this country, civilization, and planet?
I mean a lot of us here know things are pretty horrible and that, generally speaking, there is a covert power above the law and government responsible for it. Many of us KNOW this at this point. What many of us need at this point is a real PLAN of action. What do you think is a good step in the right direction that we citizens can move toward to help begin bringing this civilization away from the manipulation it has been subject to?</p>

<p>A.  Our first priority right at this moment is to educate the entire world as to the phoney nature of modern terrorism. If everyone wakes up to this, change will be inevitable. To speak plainly, the best thing all concerned people can do right now is spread the word, especially to the third world, that we are all being had;  so that it won&#39;t matter if you&#39;re an Arab or a Chinese Bricklayer or a French Waitress or a Black American college student - everyone must be taught to see that the entire modern Western system which dominates the planet is a con-trick. This is why I am trying so hard to get a  world-wide distribution deal for &#39;JFK to 911&#39;.  I realise that the entire planet does not have a laptop.  We are yet some way from that day.  But Cinemas are everywhere.  I have been told again and again that the movie has completely altered the mental atmosphere amongst the global intelligentsia of Teachers, Lawyers, Doctors, Academics and professionals generally.  If the world&#39;s working class could see equally clearly what is really going on and why, and I believe in this age this is possible because of the universal increase in the level of education, then I am sure this alone would bring about a major change.  If there was a uniformity of opinion, a genuine global consensus that every terrorist act is really a False Flag which tries to maintain a population living in fear - then I think real political change would definitely follow because the weight of such unified public opinion would manifest itself as a universal discontent.  And this would become so obvious it would be impossible for the politicians to ignore.  We will need a cohesive plan later to actually take and hold power genuinely for the people&#39;s sake, but this is the most important first step.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q4. My question is regarding the Jesuits; what role do you believe they play in world affairs beyond simply influencing the curia in Rome?</p>

<p>A.  When I was on the Justin Stellman show I did my best to explain that I hadn&#39;t gone into much detail about the Catholic Church because it would have made my movie around ten hours long and then
no-one would have watched it.  I tried to make a comparison with the problem Robert M Pirsig had in the 1970&#39;s.  Had anyone at that time asked him why western materialism was making so many people feel empty instead of fulfilled; or why modern technology was leading to so much vexation of the spirit,
he would have been able to say  &quot;well, I can tell you, but it will take a week&quot;.  This is why he had to write &#39;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; which, as far as I am aware, is now the most-read
book of all time, even surpassing the Bible.  I now find myself in a similar position.  This is a question which I would love to answer but I won&#39;t be able to until I can make Part 2 of &#39;JFK to 911&#39;.  All I can say here, to all those who have complained about the lack of references regarding the Catholic Church in my movie, is yes, definitely, this is a most important subject and I am very frustrated at present at not
being able to tell the world what I would like to tell the world, on screen, simply for lack of finance.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q5. I&#39;m so excited!!! I&#39;ve watched this documentary, the whole 3 hours, so many times, I love it.
My question is: Do you think Russia poses a threat to the New World Order, or are they another pawn in the grand scheme?</p>

<p>A.  Thanks for the effusion and a great question.  A fair answer at this present time is:  have you been watching Lee Camp on &#39;Redacted&#39; from the RT network?  ( Russian Televison )  Anyone who hasn&#39;t 
I would urge you to do so, whether you&#39;re an American or not, because what you have there is nothing less than the best journalism currently on offer.  Some folks, especially those who consider themselves sophisticates, may find some of it a bit Wacky Races,  but the core of &#39;Redacted&#39; is a team of dedicated professional journalists who really are doing their homework and brilliantly exposing every dirty trick their ruling class are pulling in the run-up to the now utterly farcical Presidential election. And who is funding this veritable orgy of truth?  Why, the Russian government, no less.  They have clearly given Lee Camp carte-blanche to pretty much say whatever he wants.  So can they be Pawns of the West?? It&#39;s a fine question, especially when one considers the research of Professor Anthony Sutton, and what he revealed about the true nature of the Bolshevik revolution.  (  please read this online - it&#39;s not that long )  But rather than speculate as to the true nature of Russian Oligarch Mr Putin, perhaps you would like to help me actually test him out? I am just about to write to Putin  (  anyone can do this! )  to ask
why his RT network have not been replying to my emails?  because my basic position is that if Russia really is all that morally superior to the United States, which is what they would prefer world opinion to believe;  then surely they should be willing to help spread the message in &#39;JFK to 911 Everything Is
A Rich Man&#39;s Trick&#39;  by funding it&#39;s international distribution?  If hundreds if not thousands of people from the western world all wrote to Putin at the same time to demand he assist in this venture by
telling RT to support my work the outcome might get very interesting. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Q6. -Can you make any predictions about any significant world events that could occur within the next 5 years?</p>

<p>-What is your opinion of Bernie Sander&#39;s presidential run?
-What is your opinion on Syria/ISIS?</p>

<p>A.  I think this was covered in Question One, but just to flesh it out a little more I think the next five years will see increasing numbers of phoney terrorist incidents and large scale global catastrophes.
Another Bubonic plague which conveniently wipes out most of Africa and the Orient would not surprise me in the least.  I do not see how any American can have any faith in any politician who would endorse a mass murderer and drug dealer for President, to mention only two of Hillary&#39;s misdemeanours;
so how anyone can see Bernie Sanders as anything other than just another stooge beats me. 
As for Syria I do not see how anyone can trust what the whore media tells us today about anything;
and ISIS like Al Qaida before it is just an invention of Western Propaganda.  I have no doubt that there are plenty of unstable Moslems in the middle east attempting terrorism against Israel.  But those who are perpetrating the alleged terror attacks in Europe are simply disguised agents of MI5 and the CIA.
As I tried to make clear in the Film they are using something which has a basis in reality:  Islamic hatred of Jews, and making it into a Bogeyman which they claim is a threat to the entire West.
None of this is true.  Richie Allen has rightly called this our &#39;False Flag Summer&#39;  because everything
from Paris to Brussels to Nice was a hoax and this is easily verifiable if you check the evidence online.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q7. One of the most surprising things over the past few years is former CIA photo analyst Dino Brugioni coming out and stating that he worked on the Zapruder film over the weekend after JFK was assassinated--and the film was different than what we have seen.  Have you watched The Zapruder Film Mystery?  Any comments on it?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_QIuu6hsAc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_QIuu6hsAc</a></p>

<p>A. I have and I&#39;ve been well aware of the skullduggerry involved with the Zapbruder Film for a very 
long time;  particularly things like the painting out of the damage to the rear of the skull.  Every Painter knows there is no such thing as a totally Black shadow.  On a sunny day every shadow has detail in it.
Hence the forgery was obvious.  This was why I wanted to completely remake the entire Z Film for
my own movie.  I wanted to truthfully re-construct the most abused 10 seconds of human history
there has ever been, in 3D and in high-definition, so as to finally show to the world what any onlooker who was present on that day would really have seen.  If this could have been done then the stopping of the car for the shot at point-blank range would have been obvious - and the significance of the testimony of the many witnesses who were not called by the Warren Commission would be much easier to appreciate: but, we had no budget.  If you know of anyone who has about 50 grand to spare I think it could be done for that much, and it would make an enormously greater impact when it was edited in to my Picture. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Q8. Any new JFK Assassination info since your documentary came out?</p>

<p>A.  The most critical new information to come out since the Film went viral is all the revelations about
the American Business involvement with Nazi Germany. It&#39;s interesting that the CIA&#39;s online Trolls tried so hard to discredit this new research, because many investigators have independently discovered more
and more sins committed by those we already knew about;  like Ford, Chase Manhattan, Brown Brothers and IBM; especially the use of slaves in Factories which were American owned.  And there have also been new disclosures which have emerged about Dow Chemical, GM, MGM, Alcoa and even Woolworths.  This has delighted me as a Historian because it is all crucial evidence of the essentially Fascist nature of the United States.  It will be critical to an understanding of what the 20th century was really all about to Historians in the future;  and none of it might ever have come out if it hadn&#39;t been for  &#39;JFK to 911&#39;.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q9.  I would like to know more about Bill Clinton&#39;s involvement.  And I&#39;d like to know more about 
William Greer. Bill Cooper was really certain it was him who gave the kill shot. Thanks. Great video. 
I tell everyone about it.</p>

<p>A.  Both of the Clinton&#39;s are nothing but Stooges for the Rothschilds, Rockefellers etc  Bill Clinton&#39;s reaction in my movie when he is questioned about drug-running through Mena, Arkansas ought to tell you all you need to know about him.  He is even a rotten liar. ( and he and his wife may possibly be 
mind-controlled exactly like Manchurian candidates:  check out the Youtube video &#39;Bill Clinton 
mind-control&#39;  it will shock you )  William Greer was in on the plot and was bribed to stop the car at the white painted mark on the kerb next to the drain;  and Bill Cooper is a typical disinformation agent and nothing more.  Like all those before him who have made ludicrous claims about things like Jackie being the shooter, or James Files being the lone rifleman  ( how can so many people swallow this when Files is clearly around 60, and would therefore have been aged 10 in 1963? )  his job is simply to overload the public with so much information they don&#39;t know what to believe.  This is why using common sense, 
like being able to count, is so important. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Q10. Just wondering where the interview with CIA stooge Frank Sturgis came from? I&#39;ve searched his name on youtube (etc.) and never found a Full interview or documentary centered on him...</p>

<p>A. That came from the Jack Anderson documentary.  And many think it cost the Director his life.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q11. Have you ever read the book <em>Harvey &amp; Lee</em> which investigates the theory that there were 2 Oswalds?  It can be read, along with quite a few other JFK Assassination books, at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TSBD/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TSBD/</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>A. There were many lookalikes of Oswald.  Several were used on the day of the assassination on the streets of Dallas so that the public would know the face.  They were all part of a Doppelganger
programme funded by MK Ultra during the cold war.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q12. Who in your opinion are the most evil individuals still alive today?</p>

<p>A. GHW Bush, Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg Gotha, Prince Philip and the Pope.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q13. What ideology, religion or particular ambition is it that drives this international cabal on a psychological level, and if more than one, in what order of priority?</p>

<hr/>

<p>A. In order to fully understand this particular issue it would be a good idea for anyone intrigued by this question to watch &#39;The Ruling Class&#39;,  which is free online, and to do their homework on the enlightenment focusing particularly on the work of Immanuel Kant, Voltaire, Isaac Newton, David Hume, John Locke and Dennis Diderot.  Americans should also study the travels of Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson to Europe where they were influenced by the ideas of the enlightenment and incorporated these new concepts of liberty and fraternity and denial of monarchical absolutism into the Declaration of Independence on their return.  But, for those who want it short and sweet....  what one must think about is what kind of atmosphere existed before there was a such thing as policemen or a justice system?  We must never forget that right up until the industrial revolution and the Peelers every man had to pretty much take care of himself.  Toughness was simply the price of survival, so that from
the Etruscans all the way through to Rorke&#39;s Drift the dominant male was always the most psycopathic and frightening figure around.  In an age where every man had to be hard or die the most fearless 
were inevitably the most successful.  Those who were rich when the industrial age dawned had become wealthy through blood-lust.  The Robber Barons who served the Tudor kings saw killing, raping and stealing as a sport they excelled at.  No-one could stop them because they were the strongest.  Hence their appetites for, and addictions to, violence and sex and drug-taking became legendary.  Most professional historians see the tales of the French Sun King rogering dozens of virgins stolen for him 
off the streets of Paris almost every night as being broadly accurate.  These were the kind of men who dominated when the Trains started to chug and the oil began to flow. It really had not been so terribly long since they were beheading their &#39;subjects&#39; on a whim, and through such terror getting them to pay huge fortunes in Taxes. Hence it was this kind of sex-addicted lunatic who had money to invest in the very first new technologies and consumer products.  This was how we got the jus primae noctis  and few people are aware that the mafia continued this tradition even after they settled in America; especially in areas like the Patch in New York which were filled with Italian immigrants, right up to the mid 20th century.  So whilst it is definitely true that the psycopathic Oligarch types could be Jewish gangsters, Irish gangsters, British gangsters or Mafia Gangsters, and that they might at times oppose each other as Consumerism made them into millionaires, it didn&#39;t take them long to see that their blood-lust lifestyles  (  like the English mania for Fox-Hunting )  made them all more similar than they were different to each other.  Catholic or Protestant or Jewish or Socialist the circle of thugs and cheats who knew they were in charge in their respective countries could see they shared much more in common than anything that divided them.  With the world&#39;s population growing into the Billions they knew that to stay at the top they would have to learn new tricks because mere thuggery alone cannot contain the ire of swarming modern populations.  This was why Orwell realised they would have to use fraud as well as force to remain in power.  This is why we now see the Ruling Classes in what often appear to be completely opposed cultures and nations using one another whenever it becomes expedient, as it was when the &#39;West&#39; and &#39;East&#39; gave us the hoax of the Cold War. ( if Orwell were still around he would invite people to recollect where he discussed tacit agreement )  But it would be wrong to say that the Russian and American/British Oligarchs during that period were &#39;united by an ideology&#39;. Such a statement would dignify what is really just a con-game being played out by grubby gangsters who know how to use everybody in the most effective way without scruple. ( If anyone would like more on this please take a look at Justin Stellman&#39;s superb interview of Michael Rivero ).</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q14. Obviously there was a lifetime of research--but how long did it take you to make your documentary once you decided to make it? Did you plan on it being 3 hours 27 minutes--or did it grow and grow?</p>

<p>A. The writing itself took almost a year and several drafts. The Production and editing took seven solid months and all but killed the two men who made it, believe me.  I will never forget the shifts that 
we put in at the coal face and I would like to say hear and now how much I appreciate all those people who have acknowledged the hard work that went into it.   As for the length - what I wanted was to tell people in one fell swoop the entire story of how Kennedy was really assassinated without paying any heed to the needs of modern TV corporations or Film companies or advertisers because it was and still is so obvious that the whole truth about anything always takes second place, in this mercenary age,
to commercial considerations.  And if that isn&#39;t the path to Hell what is??  My attitude was flagrantly
obstinate.  I wanted to say to the whole world, whether anyone listened or not, look, just this once
you&#39;re all going to shut up and sit down and damn well learn something important and forget this
brain-dead 3-minute culture  ( which is why I brought this up with Justin Stellman )  for just one time.
And the funny thing is that I now think this is the main reason why it&#39;s worked.  People have become so accustomed to sound-bite culture that I actually think it helped &#39;JFK to 911&#39;  to stand out as something different.  And although I never at any time planned a specific length once I realised it was so incredibly co-incidentally exactly the same length at Olly Stone&#39;s disinfo epic I didn&#39;t feel I had to apologize for the 3 hours.  What I am most pleased about is those people who have written public comments saying &quot;This man has broken the code&quot;.  It is as if, prior to the movie, most Americans viewed their country and the world as something like a dark room filled with man-traps.  People were stumbling in darkness trying to make sense of it all, and usually preferring not to think about it too much because the journey had become too frightening.  But many people have responded as if &#39;JFK to 911&#39; turned the light on;
and people can not only tell what is happening now, but many now say that in looking back the things that were done to Cassius Clay, Martin Luther King,  the Kent State victims and the Vietnamese  etc actually make sense.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q15. Do you believe in God?</p>

<p>A: Are you kidding???</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q16. What do you think might be on the international central bankers agenda, such as the Bank for International Settlements, IMF and World Bank?</p>

<p>A. I&#39;ve a feeling that some people might expect me to construct an answer full of words like
&quot;macro-economic policy&quot;  and  &quot;exchange rate mechanisms&quot;;  but I think the person who asked this question really wants to know if I think the central Bankers intend to go on and on having us all up the arse for ever more?  And they would be right.  That is all they want.  I hope anyone reading this response will take the trouble to see the excellent documentary &#39;The Money Masters&#39; online.
That story really is a good example of how so many people get rich just as an accident of history;
as was the case with the Rothschilds.  To be fair they were clever with their fortunes once they were made, but this should never distract the public from the fact that NO Bank has ever sat down and even once asked itself  &quot;what can we do next which would really benefit the public rather than the Bank&quot;.
Bankers have always acted selfishly, and that is why today we see a situation in which they are able to use everyone else&#39;s money to make themselves richer and richer without any benefit being accrued to the population as a whole i.e. those who actually create the wealth are never allowed to enjoy it.
Left to their own devices and never interfered with by governments who the Bankers have always owned they have made for themselves a sweet little game which is rigged so that it benefits them at the expense of everyone else all the time, and it goes without saying that as this revolution progresses one of the first topics we will have to deal with is how to reform Banking in a way which puts people first.  I would like to hear ideas.  Somewhere online I heard someone offer an interesting suggestion for controlling governments:  which was to make all politicians wear cameras like police officers have to,
on their shoulders every minute of the day, so that conspiracy would be impossible.  That might work.
And as a way to introduce the reform of Banking into the public forum I would like to see the Western population discussing a return to old-fashioned Banking, wherein there would be a Bank on nearly every street corner.  In fact I think in order to make sure of ridding ourselves of modern degeneracies, like the ability to pay hit-men; there should be a law restricting every Bank to less than 50 customers.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q17. Have you re-thought the 9/11 &quot;No Planes&quot; scenario?  Most of us Truthers see this as disinfo and find it more likely &quot;dummy&quot; planes were used and turned into drones to strike WTC buildings 1 &amp; 2.  The jet which struck the Pentagon is still being debated, but many find it likely a missile was used.</p>

<p>A.  I quite seriously wonder if this is a disinformation question. What on earth could a &#39;dummy&#39; plane possibly be??  A dummy can&#39;t fly, and certainly not at 520 mph over a city.  Most &#39;Truthers&#39;  have watched Simon Shack&#39;s &#39;September Clues&#39;  and the &#39;Pilots For 911 Truth&#39; videos on Youtube and they know from these Films that it is actually a physical impossibility for the shapes we saw on Broadcast TV to be commercial airliners because a Boeing 767 cannot attain that speed at sea-level. Those who cling to the idea that there must have been aircraft involved just because TV said so are rightly being dismissed as &#39;plane-huggers&#39;. The same laws of Physics which were used to prove that the Towers could not have fallen at free-fall speed are the same laws which describe a modern airliner as little more than a flying Beer can composed of super-light Aluminium which could never penetrate thousands of tons of 
steel-reinforced concrete a.k.a the most unyielding substance on earth ( which is why they make building out of it ) </p>

<p>Q18. It&#39;s a damn shame you haven&#39;t been able to collect any money from your great documentary--have you ever considered being asked to be a paid speaker at conventions?  I think your voice would be great for voice over work on other documentaries as well...  Have you ever considered crowd-sourcing for your next movie?  It allows you to ask people for large amounts of money to fund a project and each person promises what they are comfortable with--only if you meet your goal are the funds collected.  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">https://www.kickstarter.com/</a>  <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/">https://www.gofundme.com/</a></p>

<p>A. My friend you have no idea how awkward and uncomfortable I feel, trying to answer this question.
You see, I never ever wanted to make money out of President Kennedy&#39;s death, over which I still grieve to this day.  I am actually glad now that things worked out the way they did, and I have been able to give the world a Film which the world, including your good self, obviously feels is a compelling and crucially important Documentary without charging anyone a penny.  I have proved I am not just another money-grubber.  That is why it is the irony of ironies that, as things now stand, it would probably be for the best if I could somehow obtain an international distribution deal, because if the entire world were to actually pay for the privilege of seeing this movie, and all the people who have written to me from Holland, Germany, Portugal, Turkey, Spain etc assure me they would, I feel their choice would count as a kind of vote, don&#39;t you?  When people actually spend their own money on anything en masse it becomes a statement.  An undeniable indicator that they are listening intently to those who are saying we now live under Fascist rule. A statement which I am sure Jack Kennedy himself would endorse. It is therefore all the more ironic that the list of people I have written to for help and never received a single reply from now includes Sir Richard Branson,   Sir Paul Mcartney,<br/>
George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennnedy, Kevin Costner, Sigourney Weaver,  Kevin Keegan, Roger Waters, David Gilmour,  Peter Gabriel,  Rick Wakeman, Sting, Bono,  Frank Marshall,  Sigrid Rausing and  Richard Reed to name but a few.  I list them here in order to name and shame them all, because it has come as the most depressing disappointment to me that people who I considered heroes when I was a teenager now refuse to stand up and defend the very freedom their own careers depended upon.  I find it quite sickening that just because they were the lucky few who happened to strike it rich during a period of relative freedom that they feel they are entitled to become aloof to the condition of the common people.  For are we not all in the same boat?  The grandchildren of all these illustrious figures will suffer just as much as anyone else from global warming and phoney terrorism.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t they care about their own families??  Can&#39;t they see how reprehensible it is for them to behave in exactly the same contemptuous manner as the ruling class they obviously now identify with?  i.e. the people who are committing child sex abuse?  I have also asked for help with funding and distribution from Screen Yorkshire, the  BFI and Creative England, only to find that the very organizations which are supposed to help the top British Film makers like myself would not talk to me at all.  I have also tried
to interest the Heads of the commercial mainstream media in Britain;  Tom Giles, Head of current affairs at ITV, and Dorothy Byrne, Head of Channel 4, who are perfectly well aware that mine is the most crucially important political documentary in the whole world right now, and yet they will not fund
Part 2 nor help distribute Part 1 to the tune of a single penny.  So let me say this.  I simply cannot bring myself to ask folk who I know have got no money for money.  Because why the hell should they?</p>

<p>When there are all these well-off movie stars and Businessmen and TV corporations who could support
this Film with a couple of million  ( that&#39;s all I need )  and never even miss it?  How does it make any sense that Ebay milionaire Jeff Skoll took on the international terror of the Catholic church by funding the excellent movie &#39;Spotlight&#39; and yet he refuses to have anything to do with &#39;Everything Is A Rich
Man&#39;s Trick&#39;??  PLEASE ask everyone you know to write to these people ( contacting them is easier than you might think, especially ITV and Channel 4 ) and ask them why they no longer care about freedom? and Nazis controlling our lives?  And then once you have done that if you honestly feel it is possible to crowd-fund the second part of my Film then go ahead.  My nature is such that I wouldn&#39;t know where to start;  but if you can raise the budget I will certainly make the Film and get them both distributed world wide.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q19. Certainly seems like the Establishment media can&#39;t publish anything critical of Hillary Clinton, the Queen of Chaos--do you think the election was decided long ago?  I think Hillary will follow along in the warpath which Bush-Bill Clinton-Bush-Obama administrations have defined...</p>

<p>A. You have nailed this one perfectly.  Yes. It&#39;s obvious the Fascist mainstream media is hell-bent on getting this puppet elected so that things will just continue on same as ever with more 911&#39;s,
False Flags,  CIA deceiving of their own people,  spurious news stories.....................</p>

<hr/>

<p>Q20. Ever heard of the Wall Street Bombing of 1920?  Interesting thing is, a Yale History professor, Beverly Gage, wrote a book about it in 2008--yet she couldn&#39;t get the US government (National Archives) to release any more records on the unsolved 80+ year-old crime. </p>

<p>A. I would like to make a Film about this and other terrorist attacks against the Capitalist system around that time, but the establishment you can be sure will fear copycat attacks.</p>

<p>WOULD EVERYONE PLEASE NOTE that just as I was finishing this article I was telephoned by<br/>
Lord Melvyn Bragg, who has not got back to me so far.  I would be VERY GRATEFUL if people could write to him and ask why ITV, who he worked with for decades, now refuse to have anything to do with
a movie which is felt by an international public to be the most important freedom seeking vehicle in the world today?? I have yet to find out whether he is a better man than the miscreants mentioned here, but he certainly has a lot more power ( <a href="mailto:contactholmember@parliament.uk">contactholmember@parliament.uk</a> )  and a shower of messages to him could have an impact.  And just as a final thought:  can you imagine how things would go if the rich people I discussed in Question 18  decided to join this fight on the side of what is right??
Can you imagine what a powerful force they would make?  We would be absolutely assured of victory
and a future free of George Bushes and Hillary Clinton&#39;s and every other kind of psychopath.</p>

<p>So why don&#39;t they join the Truth movement?  Eh?  What are we to think?</p>

<p>With love and peace and much gratitude to all who provided these questions.</p>

<p>&quot;But rather than speculate as to the true nature of Russian Oligarch Mr Putin, perhaps you would like to help me actually test him out? I am just about to write to Putin ( anyone can do this! ) to ask why his RT network have not been replying to my emails? because my basic position is that if Russia really is all that morally superior to the United States, which is what they would prefer world opinion to believe; then surely they should be willing to help spread the message in &#39;JFK to 911 Everything Is A Rich Man&#39;s Trick&#39; by funding it&#39;s international distribution? If hundreds if not thousands of people from the western world all wrote to Putin at the same time to demand he assist in this venture by telling RT to support my work the outcome might get very interesting. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are some great answers, and much of them are the same historical puzzles I&#39;ve been piecing together and sharing in this sub.</p>

<p>You think the <em>Jackie killed JFK</em> theory is informational overload BS, but I&#39;m not so sure about that. It&#39;s a theory I came to naturally while watching the Zapruder film over and over, reading Jackie&#39;s pre and post JFK history, and also reading the Warren Commission as well as the Rockefeller Commission, then drawing a conclusion based on the bigger picture, even while considering the other popular theories (including what has been laid out in your film). I reached that not by being convinced through certain articles and ignoring other evidence, but more so by looking at all the evidence and existing theories and then honing in on what I feel are the most compelling pieces, just like I do for my other research which I&#39;d say we are on the same page about. So for that reason I wouldn&#39;t be too quick to rule this one out, but I understand the Jackie theory totally undermines your film and theory therein. The way Jackie braces herself against JFK just before his melon pops, and her subsequent act on the trunk of the limo, instead of ducking like the other passengers did, are eye brow raisers that I cannot excuse as normal behavior. It is what it is I guess.</p>

<p>Great answers all around though. Lots of recommended reading, which is always welcome here. I was waiting for this post and you sure did deliver.</p>

<p>EDIT: and I just saw you answered my question (#12). Hell yeah man! Thanks and have a good one.</p>

<p>EDIT2: To elaborate just a bit further on the Jackie thing, and maybe this seems like convoluted logic but to me it makes perfect sense, if elements within the CIA were involved as most people believe, or anyone within the government for that matter, then they must have known Jackie would need lots of counseling and careful handling after the assassination, <em>unless</em> she was the manchurian candidate to begin with. She did in fact know Allen Dulles through family ties and worked for the CIA before she met JFK, I mean come on...</p>

<p>EDIT3: this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so why the hell not. Here are some confessions from the secret service agent Clint Hill:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hill writes that it was ‘surreal to see the horror from a different perspective. And they’d play the film over and over, sometimes in slow motion, so I had to relive it over and over. It was excruciating’.</p>

<p>Hill admits that he was suffering from PTSD and turned to drink to help with his problems, something he says he is ‘not proud’ of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just found this, and it has reinforced my thought that the Zapruder film itself is MK Ultra meant to brainwash the public. Why would they make him watch it over and over, resulting in his PTSD? Psychological conditioning and in Hill&#39;s case, psychological torture.</p>

<p>Looking forward to anyone&#39;s thoughts on this.</p>

<p>Show me a short clip or timestamp from the Nix or Muchmore films that clearly shows Jackie&#39;s hand empty during the moment I&#39;m describing. I watched the Muchmore film, it&#39;s shaky as hell, but despite that, her upper arm is covering her hand and JFK&#39;s head in the shot.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what die hard conspiracy theorists think. I march to my own beat. It&#39;s a rare trait. Have a good day though.</p>

<p>Show me more compelling visual evidence than the clip I provided.</p>

<p>That <em>is</em> the solution. It was Oswald. The Dallas PD had this thing solved within a couple hours. </p>

<p>Let me get this straight...you assert a completely nonsensical position, provide absolutely no evidence to support it, and expect <em>me</em> to refute it? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you understand how this works. </p>

<p>That&#39;s OK, <strong>everyone</strong> gets a LOL when you say Jackie did it.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s just her hand.</p>

<p>And yeah, I&#39;m familiar with the waste of space that is Barry Krutsch. He&#39;s a buffoon. Check out the reviews of his book on Amazon, the guy personally pops into every negative review to shit-talk the reviewer. He&#39;s the most pathetic Kennedy assassination truther around, and that&#39;s saying something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I entertained your idea for a sec. does that make me smart? Here&#39;s the deal. if Jackie Onassis killed anyone in that car it would&#39;ve been seen by tens of people right there at the least, and not to mention everyone in the car would have bailed or said something, and people on the street would have obviously reported it. Also, we probably should have seen a flash from the gun she was allegedly toting. Also point blank range would have left a bullet hole somewhere in the car, and the entry wound would look different.</p>

<p>No chance in hell. She was enamored by him, in spite of his sexual affairs, and so were millions of other women. Her being CIA or whatever, lol, marrying the man who would become prez would have been her stepping stone to a much higher position had he never been assassinated. </p>

<p>For fucks sake she had 4 children with the man... one who died shortly after child birth too. Get a grip, there&#39;s no way a woman who&#39;s been through all that would take out her man. You couldn&#39;t pay her anything.</p>

<p>I gather from these answers that its unlikely we will see a nuclear war to thin the heard then.  Biological means will be used to thin the herd.  Not that its any better, but we can maybe rest assured that the USA and Russian will not be lobbing nukes at each other.</p>
