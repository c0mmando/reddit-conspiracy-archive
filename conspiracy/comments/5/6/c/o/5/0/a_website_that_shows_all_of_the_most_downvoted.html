       This time there's only one possible explanation...
Targeted brigade downvoting by shills.

      <p>
       If you organize a downvote brigade, that's against reddit rules and you can get banned. But I suppose that rule doesn't apply when it's being done by the employees of a 
"paying corporate customer".

       We have some time left people, it's not too late. Many are finally beginning to wake up now to the corruption/injustice we've been looking past &amp; brainwashed into believing. I believe this is for a reason, we can either sit back or continue to let it happen. Talk to people, reach out to whoever you can. It starts with family and friends, then they spread a message too. Vote out the corruption, we have one month left. Make posters, fliers, songs, art. Use social media against them. MEME magic works. That's what people in antiwar movements did. For those who see this ongoing propaganda, speak out. Use your voice while you can. I've been shadow banned on various sites, but I've also woke people up. We are MUCH more powerful than them if we come together. Promote peace. Fight their fear agenda.

       Funny that 'Chloe Grace Moretz Pussy' is on there, and it links to a random unrelated youtube video. I can't imagine so many people would downvote that.
      </p>

       My bet is a pay to play downvote ring -- if one doesn't want a topic gaining popularity on reddit, you can hire a botring that downvotes anything with those keywords. Amazing. I need to get in on this.

        Hi Horace,
       </p>
       <p>
        I like your website. But I have a question.  I don't see
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        sub in any of the results whatsoever.  This to me strikes me as odd, given that many feel this sub is among one of the most vote-controlled by astroturfers on reddit.  In fact, we've proved it at least 10 times using various investigative tools including a/b testing, honeypots, entrapment and the reddit api to heuristically determine this as such.  Can you tell me if your web app has specifically omitted the
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        sub from results?  Or has it omitted this sub from inclusion / are you not tracking
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        ? Thanks in advance.  Again, good job.

       <p>
        Hey, I did not deliberately omit the r/conspiracy sub from the results. Although it may be ridden with astroturfers (I don't know enough to comment on that), it's my experience that there has not been any content that has been downvoted into the ground consistently (besides the recent few months of anti-Hillary content).
        <strong>
         <em>
          I believe that the only subs that may be filtered from this site are those that deliberately elect to not be featured on reddit's r/all page (merely due to the way I'm obtaining data).

        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        I was curious where r/conspiracy threads would show up, so I ran a quick script to find some. The first 2 I found on the all time lists are at position 164 and position 372. I have attached some links and screenshots of the posts below if you wish to view them for yourself.

        from
        <a href="/r/all">

        coming to our sub to make fun of us, harass us, which is a very popular activity among people who themselves really don't know their history that well.  Of course it doesnt' help that some of us still post david icke and flat earth stuff, even though they've been debunked many times.

       I think politics is back to its shenanigens again.  Things seemed legit for about a week after the election.

       You guys and girls constantly talk about /rPolitics. I'm pretty sure everyone understands it's corrupt now.

       More people now than ever before in our short history are aware of corruption but so many still are not and one of the reasons is a sub like r politics that just allows primarily msm articles favoring one political candidate. It's not r Hillary, it's politics. Not everyone understands that especially the sheep who graze here during the elections.

       This is nothing new. Reddit as a whole is nothing but a propaganda dispenser/population classification tool at best and a population programming tool at worst.
