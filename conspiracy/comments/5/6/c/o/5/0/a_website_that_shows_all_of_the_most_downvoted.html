Targeted brigade downvoting by shills. </p>

<p>If you organize a downvote brigade, that&#39;s against reddit rules and you can get banned. But I suppose that rule doesn&#39;t apply when it&#39;s being done by the employees of a 
&quot;paying corporate customer&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have some time left people, it&#39;s not too late. Many are finally beginning to wake up now to the corruption/injustice we&#39;ve been looking past &amp; brainwashed into believing. I believe this is for a reason, we can either sit back or continue to let it happen. Talk to people, reach out to whoever you can. It starts with family and friends, then they spread a message too. Vote out the corruption, we have one month left. Make posters, fliers, songs, art. Use social media against them. MEME magic works. That&#39;s what people in antiwar movements did. For those who see this ongoing propaganda, speak out. Use your voice while you can. I&#39;ve been shadow banned on various sites, but I&#39;ve also woke people up. We are MUCH more powerful than them if we come together. Promote peace. Fight their fear agenda.

    <div class="md"><p>Notice how there aren&#39;t many <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posts?  I would think that&#39;s a red flag as we all know that this sub is very controlled.  I asked Horace, the dev,  for an answer to this. Here is what he said:</p>

<p>from me: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi Horace,</p>

<p>I like your website. But I have a question.  I don&#39;t see <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> sub in any of the results whatsoever.  This to me strikes me as odd, given that many feel this sub is among one of the most vote-controlled by astroturfers on reddit.  In fact, we&#39;ve proved it at least 10 times using various investigative tools including a/b testing, honeypots, entrapment and the reddit api to heuristically determine this as such.  Can you tell me if your web app has specifically omitted the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> sub from results?  Or has it omitted this sub from inclusion / are you not tracking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? Thanks in advance.  Again, good job.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>From Horace: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey, I did not deliberately omit the r/conspiracy sub from the results. Although it may be ridden with astroturfers (I don&#39;t know enough to comment on that), it&#39;s my experience that there has not been any content that has been downvoted into the ground consistently (besides the recent few months of anti-Hillary content). <strong><em>I believe that the only subs that may be filtered from this site are those that deliberately elect to not be featured on reddit&#39;s r/all page (merely due to the way I&#39;m obtaining data).</em></strong></p>

<p>I was curious where r/conspiracy threads would show up, so I ran a quick script to find some. The first 2 I found on the all time lists are at position 164 and position 372. I have attached some links and screenshots of the posts below if you wish to view them for yourself. </p>

<p>TLDR: No I haven&#39;t. Cheers, Horace</p>

<hr/>

<p>From me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the very informative update, Horace.  I bet you are right, that the mods have kept <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> on purpose.  They have done this to inhibit people from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> coming to our sub to make fun of us, harass us, which is a very popular activity among people who themselves really don&#39;t know their history that well.  Of course it doesnt&#39; help that some of us still post david icke and flat earth stuff, even though they&#39;ve been debunked many times.</p>

<p>Take care!</p>
