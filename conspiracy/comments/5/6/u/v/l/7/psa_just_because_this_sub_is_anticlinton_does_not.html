       Clinton corruption and the huge cover up is a very significant conspiracy happening in real time and has to be discussed and cataloged. There is no bigger conspiracy happening right now because it is connected to may other conspiracies.

      <p>
       Furthermore, once she is elected and CTR is gone, we will have all this evidence at our finger tips to share with reddit and CTR will not be here to hide it.  That will cause further erosion of confidence people will have in the government and once no one has confidence in the government it becomes illegitimate and will be replaced.

       Yeah, it's blatant, but look what it accomplished. It basically denied all of us a platform to spread news and information. I mean there's
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , but it's not exactly a well regarded source of information outside of the sub, and it's certainly not a frequently visited sub for most redditors.

       Did you see that thread after the debate? The one that got 7k upvotes then was deleted?

       A lot of people are aware of the corruption. my point is that 6million isn't doing shit for them. 4 years? Let alone 8? They'd be better off deleting this entire site then trying to fund that.

       The same way it is now, by investments from the rich and powerful.

       Think about it. Before, you could buy the politician, now you can buy public opinion as well. And if you think CTR isn't influencing people, you need to pay more attention to what people are saying. It is an immensely powerful network.

       I feel CTR is just the start. They've already done an incredible amount of damage to this site by only spending $8,000,000.  Imagine how much online propaganda will ramp up once it has federal funding that isn't tracked by the FEC.

       But you know what, just in case English isn't your first language, a subreddit is basically a community, and communities can do things. Eg New York loves hot dogs. If course, a city can't love hot dogs, but we all know that sentence means that there is a large amount of people in New York that love hot dogs. Things like this are a convenience within the English language.

       Communities can NOT do things, the people who make up that community do things. It's a convenience of the English language but it's the kind of convenience that comes with negatives too.
EG The shills will come and upvote a post and say, look the sub upvoted this post, the sub must be X. The logic (simple as it is) and the syntax make perfect sense, but it was the shills tipping the sub all along. So why doesn't the logic lead us to the truth? Because the premises are wrong. When you cut out the anthropomorphizing you're left with a different sentence, or logic chain-
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people in the sub upvoted X, so therefore those people that upvoted X must be Y.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sentence says much less and more importantly is absent a manufactured consensus so is therefore useless to our astro-turfing handlers.
      </p>

       Also where the fuck do you get off calling my answers non excuses, I could have just ghosted you, much less effort.

       It's a long post is a non excuse because you're complaining about my post, when literally the title of this thread has the same issue and you don't complain about that. There are far fewer words in that title than there are in my post, yet you decide to berate me rather than the op because"is a long post". That's a non excuse.

       And by that logic, I can say everything that is pro Trump or anti Hillary in this subreddit are upvoted by shills too.

       There is some frankly bat shit crazy stuff posted here that gets supported and upvoted without pause.

       So just to clarify, can an American expect to be able to circle a third choice when the election comes?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not from the US and just wondering. If it is so, I think your point should be up voted to the top.

       We actually have lots of political parties in the US. When voters go into the polling place there are usually between 7-10 candidates on any given ballot, all representing a different party.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trouble is, all but the major two have very little support. Most of these other parties get less than 1% of the vote. They are fringe parties and usually we only elect either Republicans or Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       In elections where neither of the two main choices are popular many Americans will suggest voting for a "third party" in order to make a statement that they support neither of the main candidates.(Al Gore vs George W. Bush in 2000 had a lot of third party voting for this very reason). Again, this is typically just to make a statement. It's widely accepted that none of these parties will ever be elected and that is why many people see voting for a third party as "throwing your vote away" and as such most Americans are scared into voting for "the lesser of two evils."
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't just one third party, there are many. We call them "third parties" because they are an alternative to the two major parties...Hope that clears things up a bit.

       To give you an idea of the systemic fraud: the "Commission on Presidential Debates" was commissioned by no government body - it was created by the Democrats and Republicans, working together. Their job is to exclude any third party candidates from consideration - so long as there are only two candidates on the stage, there are only two legitimate choices a voter can make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the advent of the "CPD", Presidential debates were usually sponsored by the League of Women Voters. They bowed out when the demands of the two parties led them to believe that they would be perpetrating a fraud upon the American electorate.

       I believe it's more important to give the regional positions to third parties: Congress, Senate, governor, state senate, etc. Cut the body of the snake off. The head cant survive on its own and regional races are manageable goals.

       you deserve better, but you wont get anything better than clinton this election. fix your political system, voting third party currently does not work. stop switching between realism and emotional thinking during this election to keep yourself busy, focus on laying the groundworks for actual elections within your lifetime. the role of the president is not all that important anyways, providing he does not act recklessly like trump would.

       They dislike this man. He is a liberal, anti-surveillance, anti-war, supports the LGBT community, and is anti-TPP. Everything that democrats should love.

       Alright you two. The divide and conquer strategy has worked to make you fight republican vs. democrat (like there's really a difference between them; rich folks &amp; special interests are pulling the strings).

       Naw, it is just that the criticism of Clinton in this sub is more than just slightly hysteric and far too often results in a comment like "therefore I will vote for Trump".
      </p>
      <p>
       In Greenwalds own words (btw. in a blog where he rightfully mocks Krugman)
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        In March 2016, I wrote a column denouncing the U.S. media for venerating feigned neutrality over its responsibility to sound the alarm about how extremist and menacing Trump’s candidacy really is. 
[...]
He and his rhetoric pose genuine threats, and the U.S. media would be irresponsible if it failed to make that clear.
       </em>

      </p>
      <p>
       The whole problem with this race is that there is, in the end, only the choice between a 3rd party (e.g. Jill Stein) or HRC - because voting for Donald Trump is, in essence, economical and political suicide.

        The Clintons are far more dangerous, because they have built a tangled web of favors, blackmail, and manipulation. They are utterly Machiavellian and will get exactly what they want. They will also do exactly what their billionaire masters want, because they owe them. It scares the shit out of me.

       Same holds true for not only both sides but most of US politics and is a direct consequence of a) the need to collect money for the campaing &amp; b) campaigning costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if I have the "choice" between a POTUS which has a tangled web of favors to pay to different companies/persons which all rely on functionen foreign trade and stable political conditions and a POTUS which has similar favors to pay but these to a group of religious fundamentalists the "choice" ain't that hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the favor concept is deeply rooted in US poltics and nothing new.. United Fruit Company made the US ruin a nation for 40 years...

       In my opinion, I think they are in cahoots. I think the only way Clinton could get elected (besides rigging the primaries, mind you) was to recruit a family friend to run against her.
      </p>
      <p>
       She is so unelectable they needed to recruit someone the MSM could constantly shit on just to have a chance.
      </p>

       Trump's only job is to look like a mad dog and chase votes back to Hillary. Fox News donated to her. The Bushes said they are voting for her. This is NOT a two party race. She was coronated when she stepped down as Secretary of State.

       I really thought the plan was to split the GOP in half by Trump running as an independent, but the dumb fuckers endorsed him. He still could get kicked off the GOP ticket, which would guarantee a victory for Hillary.

       That's it? All it says is that Donald and Bill had a phone conversation. Are you suggesting that Trump is working with or for the Clintons?
      </p>
      <p>
       We already know from leaks that the Clinton campaign wanted to "elevate" Trump because they were confident they could beat him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if Trump and the Clintons were colluding, he wouldn't have called out Hillary for attacking rape victims right to her face in front of millions of people live or shined a spotlight on her corruption. Even if Hillary wins, these things will cause significant damage to the Clinton dynasty and the Democratic party as a whole.

       It doesn't need to.  The reality is that anyone associated with the word 'conspiracy' has negative credibility with the general public.  Criticising Clinton here is actually good PR for her because it's just a bunch of tin foil hat wearing crazies posting bad stuff about her, right?

       I don't think the word "conspiracy" has that much of a bad taste as the JFK assassination conspiracies are very popular.

       I think CTR has become a boogieman for a lot of people online who don't like Hillary. I was called a CTR shill on

       a lot when dumb shit would come up about Bernie or Hillary that were not true or likely false. Frustrating as I have given hundreds of dollars to that campaign and many hours volunteering.

       I guess when you identify as a conspiracy theorist, it's easy and perhaps validating to see patterns when there likely aren't any.

       I think it is on r/politics but not on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at this site which shows the most downvoted posts across all of reddit, they are mostly anti-hillary articles from r/politics:
       <a href="http://www.notreddit.top/">
        http://www.notreddit.top/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the frontpage is almost always anti-trump or pro-hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you sort by Controversial you'll find the wikileaks stuff that makes Hillary look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also had a post on their website mentioning engaging in social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it's definitely a thing imo, but it's also a boogieman for anyone who says anything that doesn't fit the anti-hillary narrative.

       There is (was) a thread on r/politics after the debate that was started because Trump said he would put Clinton In jail. That backfired. A lot of comments were about the censorship in the sub.

       I have to say, if you're in this sub and think that either candidate represents anything but the erosion of your rights, you have nor read enough. The amount of dyschordian laguage that gets used these days is unimaginable. Food is barely digestable, gov't representatives represent money instead of people while real noble purpose has been somehow obfuscated by greed and selfish endeavor. So much bandwagon bullshit.

       It's like a watermelon seed, if you apply pressure from all sides but one, it will shoot out to that open side. We're the only open side left on reddit, and trump is being marginalized, despite the fact that that itself is a narrative pushed by the MSM. Trump is the fall guy, he's there to be scary so clinton wins, and to have a 51/49 victory, so they can so "oh so close, try again in 4 years."
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want Trump to win, but this is a pressure valve that is being released, and it's fallen squarely in the lap of this subreddit, which serves to dilute the message, which in turn further serves those in power.

       The whole thing is ridiculous.

       I think this sub doenst talk about trump much becuase r/politics (who are extremely biased) cover every little anti-trump and pro-hillary story there is.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub wants to document everything, so in the future if people need to research for whatever reason, they get both sides and all the info of what allegations were at the time, etc.

       To be honest, I've just spent so long reading about Mena air strips, and Vince Foster, that I can't fucking believe we seriously have a Clinton facing anything other than serious jail time. Trump's just there to give the illusion of choice as usual.

       It is indeed. Like today, Trump made a claim that Blumenthal said something about Hillary being responsible for Benghazi in an email to podesta. Except that Blumenthal was actually quoting Eichenwald (reporter).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy part: The ONLY place this was reported was the russian propaganda site Sputnik. It was up there for less than 3 hours and then taken down. So either Trump is reading russian propaganda sites and quoting them to bash clinton or russia was feeding trump lines from their campaign that they then send to wikileaks.

       This should be stickied until the end of the election. This sub is not inherently for or against any specific politicians, it has been and always should be, for the pursuit of the truth. CTR represents the exact opposite of that, so naturally posts will take a combative stance against the person CTR is trying to support.

       I personally think both Donald and Hillary are pieces of shit and neither should even hold authority over a Burger King.

       Yeah well as I agree I also will point out Trump isn't a politician. He is a 70 year old billionaire who could be on a yacht right now surrounded by women but instead he's out getting his name dragged through the mud in a presidential race to gain what? I'm sorry but if you think he's doing this to gain something for himself, let me know where you live so i never drink the water there.

       stop being emotional about the election. your election system is fucked, accept it. your vote does not matter anyways, but voting third party IS more of a waste because it is gonna be trump or clinton. trump is insane, so you will have to vote for clinton. choice is an illusion here. again, dont be emotional about it, even if it sucks. just see to it that you get the system fixed at some point. you are switching between being emotional and realism just to keep yourself busy.

       well, two perspectives. a vote does not matter because its a drop in a bucket, but if you care about that drop then voting third party is a waste, not because of bad intentions, but because of the realities of the election and system.

       Sounds like some of my friends - just because I say Clinton is corrupt and a liar, does NOT mean I am supporting Trump. The national selection gave us these two clowns on purpose. If Clinton ran against any other candidate, she would have lost. But Trump made sure Clinton will be in office - it was by design.

       While I do agree that there is a lot of people here who bash on Clinton and hate Trump aswell, ot is not a place where you can freely discuss politics.
If your opinion doesn't match other people's, then you get downvoted to hell and that's not how free discussion works.

       I would like to believe this is true, but how many of our post make it to r/all that isnt anti Clinton?

      <p>
       Heck, how much post right now on the first 50 post of this sub that isnt about Clinton?

       thats pretty extreme considering trump is accused of sexual assault, fraud, slander, xenophobia... how did you get such a low image of clinton? do you think she is a psychopath part of a global conspiracy? if you needed help with something, would you trust trump over clinton?

       Of course this sub attacks Hillary - she's not just a businessman-turned-candidate, she's a career politician who has spent the last 30 years on capitol hill. Now if he wins, afaic he becomes public enemy #1 at the moment he's sworn in - it's the nature of the presidency to have responsibility for the actions of the federal government when you are in charge of it. But until/unless he is he's just some rich casino-owning guy with a bad hairpiece, and is only attackable for his record of human exploitation thereof.

       Meanwhile HRC is fucking murdering people(not even conspiracy here, just Syria/Afghanistan/Iraq etc etc.) on the public dime. Part of me wants him to win just to see if instead of the next Hitler he's the next Robespierre.

       Robespierre had a vision and a concept...Trump lacks both. Robespierre was a lunatic which tried to make the world a better place - Trump is a lunatic which doesn't give a damn about the world.

       Just remember if you use the Clinton campaign's false anti-Trump talking points/propaganda you will be met with resistance. We will not just take the false hood as fact and circle jerk on it like the other subs..  Besides that you are entitled to have whatever perspective you wish.

       i am glad even most republicans recognize it. its not some media conspiracy. yeah the election system is fucked and clinton is not a great candidate and it sucks to not have any real choice... but trump is a fucktard and if you were not buying into his rediculous claims for some reason you would think of him as one too.
