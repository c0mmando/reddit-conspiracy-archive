<p>Anyhow, I think Trump does a good job representing humans.  Also, he did fairly well in the debate.  However, he needs to point out where Clinton&#39;s millions came from (i.e. selling) and what was sold (i.e. America).</p>

<p>If we are to believe that Clinton is a rapist, can we then make the leap the Trump is a child rapist because a 13 year old girl accused him of raping her. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He paid Paula Jones $850,000 in a settlement. You can decide what that says about his guilt. Kathy Shelton was a Hillary victim, not Bill&#39;s. She was <em>12 years old</em> when Hillary absolutely crucified her character on the stand. There are many sources which show Hillary laughing about destroying her while getting her rapist off. (TL;dr she blamed the child for the rape.) I&#39;ll let you google the others yourself &amp; draw your own conclusions. Both Willey &amp; Broaddrick have been very outspoken over the decades, and I find them both consistent and credible about what <strong>both</strong> Clintons did to them. </p>

<p>As for Trump&#39;s Epstein involvement, we&#39;ll see. The Clintons have a long history of blaming others for exactly what they have done themselves. The blackmail machine is a thing. </p>

<p>Why pay her if he didn&#39;t do anything wrong?</p>

<p>Go back and research the cases yourself. Nobody here is gonna spoon feed you big boy.. </p>

<p>Check out the audio tapes from when Hillary laughed about getting a convicted rapist off with only a slap on the wrist. Ruined a 12 yr olds life..</p>

<p>And no you can&#39;t. That Epstein guy is a family friend of the Clintons.. Has donated to their charity.. Bill has flown on his plane numerous times and visited the island where supposedly all this underage sex/rape is going down. Clintons&#39; are behind all of the accusations after Epstien got busted and charged. Now they&#39;re trying to flip him to rat on Donald.. Should be interesting to say the least</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he clearly is.  Its different because I dont think the elites/bankers figured she&#39;d be the focus of a federal investigation and that her ethics would be so in question.</p>

<p>But, any other candidate, any other election, Hillary has been handed the election 15/20 times.  She went up against a &quot;socialist&quot;, which should be a slam dunk for her.  Yet, she nearly lost to Sanders.</p>

<p>With Trump she&#39;s been handed the election so many times.  Any time there is a scandal/ mess up by Trump, she could easily get voters to say, fuck that, and switch over to her.</p>

<p>Yet, because she&#39;s seen as corrupt and a liar and has her own problems, she very nearly could lose to Trump.</p>

<p>Trump is trying to throw the election, but I think at some point, he most likely was shocked, as was she, that no matter what he says or does, people only like Trump more, not less.  And that because Hillary is so corrupt, few people are moving to her camp when he does something wrong.  </p>

<p>As I predicted, a tape exists of him saying the N Word 15 years ago.  </p>

<p>Any other candidate, that would be the nail in the coffin.  And I think the bankers thought it would be.</p>

<p>But honestly, if that tape came out today, I dont think it would make a difference at all for either side.  </p>
