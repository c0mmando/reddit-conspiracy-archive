       Personally I don't know how much that is being leveled at HC is true and that's a problem. We need a central post with known things that she has done illegally, from voter fraud to arms dealing with links to solid proof (video clips, leaked emails, transcripts, etc.). If we can create a solid repository of information we can start petitioning her removal from the race and start her indictment. Protecting suspected corrupt top government officials seems like a good reason to impeach a president and should provide us with enough leverage to get the ball moving.
      </p>
      <p>
       We aren't powerless and we can't be content with just being pushed around and being lied
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       to our faces by either candidate. Our power is in our voice and we need to start organizing and make it clear that this shit is far from ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I hope this gains more traction but I don't want this to just be a fluff post. Some things that we can start doing is start a different thread or do it here where we post links that we can cite later on. Also we'll need a website that we can link to. It doesn't have to be our own because I'm sure there are plenty of anti-corruption or leak websites out there, but we need a place where we can collaborate and present our facts. This is just a start! Post your idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: To the people saying there is little to no point because Hillary is so important or she's too big to fail, that's kind of why we need to fight! Our government is funded on the principal that officials are elected as the voice of the people, meaning they represent and put into action the desires of the general populous by way of voting and writing into senators etc. The problem we have is that the ultra corrupt, such as Hillary, are not passing legislation to support the general civilian, but are 'for sale' and fight to help the highest bidder, businesses and people such as Trump. The Clinton foundation is Hillary and Bills front to accept payment without it being a bribe. This is all fairly obvious though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now philosophically this is fine if you're content with the ultra-rich doing everything in their power to not only retain their status, but also increase it, which would be the definition of greed. Capitalism is a wonderful economic system because of it's system of competition which creates a steady and affordable economy all while encouraging innovation. Business competition has the unintended side affect however of leaving the worker as the lowest common denominator and open for abuse. The US tried the policy of Laissez-faire early on and workers were literally being killed while trying to form unions and strike. Fortunately the government started regulating business more and gave us some benefit of the doubt. Every since then we've been continuously battling with big business for our rights as workers.
       <em>
        Hillary is bad for America because she does not care about the 99%. She cares about her pockets and will whore her influence away to big business and foreign interest.
       </em>
       Government officials are the embodiment of the voice of the people. I think it's time we reminded the corrupt and the big business leaders that we're still people and we aren't ok being extorted and lied to just so they can continue to line their filthy rich pockets.

       People need to start contacting their local news agencies and start asking why these leaks are not being covered. Start putting pressure on the smaller news sources.... We all know the major news outlets aren't going to change

       Local networks are often still owned by the larger corporations. Might be worth trying regardless, but I bet you'd probably get more success educating people by talking one-on-one with people you know.

       My mom got a rapist convicted in my community by going to kinkos and printing a few dozen pamphlets about the guys wrong doings and putting them in the tabloid sections of stores. It took about a week for stories to reach our local news then another couple weeks for the conviction. The news spread quick after that...people buy into printed hype. If this can be done on a national scale, people in different cities and different states willing to dump 20 bucks on print outs, shit could spread quick to those not willing to go outside MSM. Consider making some professional looking flyers for people to get printed and spread?

       My girlfriend and I had this idea just the other day. Grocery lines near the register always have magazines etc, if you could print something that looks like a magazine article and just set it up there...it's cheap and easy and the sheeple will see.

       Even slip some small propaganda into each magazine as well. It would reach quite a few people. We need a new thread started, we need to come up with a title brand(i.e. National inquirer etc) 5-10 of the biggest leaks(for each rendition of the pamphlets if doing more than one), INFORMATIVE descriptions of each, graphics (make it flashy), qr code, bitly link, hash tag, etc. none of this 'Hillary had a seizure' shit. More along the lines of criminal activity. We need definitions of the laws that are broken word for word. And we need a release date which is only to be announced shortly before the printing. We gotta work; and work diligently if we want any sort of reach. Working for another couple hours, then I'm off to the research. I would love to see a thread going to get this started before I get off work. If that does happen, if someone could PM said post to me that would be great. Expose it to other subs as well.

       Yes! Qr code and bitly link, pointing to a central page or database. If we can combine the info, and key here is into a professional looking pamphlet, people WILL pick them up. Gotta make sure they say FREE at the top. The biggest problem I see we are running into is that we can't get outside our own demographic. I highly doubt most redditors care about tabloids, but I know more people than I can count that do, and are outside our demo. This will spread word beyond Reddit, and it can't be sensored unless stores across the US remove them. I have to believe even if a small handful don't, our work won't be in vain.

       agreed. I've been pushing for memes-- or some sort of simplified approach to helping these ignorant drones understand that they're being had. the way people are bred these days, with reality TV and all that garbage, racism and bigotry are much more digestible concepts than understanding the degree of vile corruption going on with Clinton.

       most people are seriously pathetic, its really hard to see close friends and family genuinely going along with the "scary Trump" narrative.

       It's hard! I think a major issue is the group mentality of the nation. Most people suspect she is corrupt but it's not their problem to deal with it, let the police or the other politicians do it. We have to be aware of peoples cognitive biases and do our best to combat them.

       Exactly right. People read headlines these days not articles. We need to counter the propaganda somehow. Most people don't have the attention spans for a video or article. Think bite sized, with impact.

       I partially agree. A major problem though is that we can't come close to the force the gov has at their disposal. If it comes to it that the government refuses our request despite the proof (which would be the end of US democracy) the only thing protecting us is numbers. Police can shut down a college demonstration, but if millions walk on Washington bent on making changes ourselves, which I'm pretty sure our Declaration of Independence mandates, the government either has to comply or they retaliate with violence against the people to retain their power, which will be the end of more than just democracy.

       I'm sure. I don't think our government is willing to go to the extreme to actually openly assault their own citizens, which is hugely in our favor. If we can root out top politicians in the Clintons pockets and elect somebody like Bernie (not necessarily him) we can start making change and exposing more abuse.

       I'd agree, somewhat. It's also about education, self reflection, liberty, and  personal responsibility. It also means community, hard work, and the wanting of persuing your happiness regardless of failure. No one wants to fail now-a-days. They want success in everything, in reality this is not possible nor is it productive.

       We need to be more than just conspiracy theorists. People will respond if we can point to hard evidence that she's broken the law. Hillary's currently relying on the fact that everything is so obscure. Once there is general support, in theory the government have to listen to the people's voice. If they refuse we call for resignation. If they refuse we push them into a corner and make them decide just what form of government the US has

       I agree we need to insist she be prosecuted. The media is glossing everything over and the current administration is not going to do anything since they are all guilty and not prosecuting theirselves. 
I think there is plenty of support for taking her down as evidenced by the cheers heard all over the country when trump said she should be in jail. If everyone took to the streets and demanded her to step down there would be no other choice for her...

       When the news media refuses to look into this...
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI says she's guilty but doesn't suggest prosecution...
      </p>
      <p>
       And the DOJ has no interest in convicting her...
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we have mountains of proof, what is the tipping point we're shooting for?
      </p>

       Most people honestly don't care, have given up on the horror show that is politics, or are too busy to be bothered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've watched this game for decades. They keep pressing us, to see how far they can push, without us actually rebelling or rioting.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point they have their strategy pretty well layed out, and the only solution is to inspire them to push too far, too fast. Otherwise there is no way past the cognitive dissonance to wake people up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The few people I have seen try and create change, have been publicly and undermined or dissappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only real option I see, is push for a third party candidate, and spend the next 2 years on local elections trying to add more to the third parties power base.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even then the common problems will remain, and this is with the hopefull assumption they won't change the laws again as soon as a third party gets close, like they did after the 2000 election.

       I don't suggest any of you do anything or even think about breaking the law.  If you actually have been paying attention and exhibit even a modicum of critical thinking skills, you'll understand that both Obama and Hillary are CIA assets and that if you go against them, you are going against the CIA.  Of course, laws won't protect you because the supreme law of the land has been subverted, since 911, by them, and a state of emergency keeps the lawlessness (for them, the bullies) in check.  In essence, there is no need to whine about martial law, we've been in a martial law state since 9/11 and my evidence is the continuity of government plan and it's obvious implications..which are: those who are a part of the deep state don't go to jail for breaking the law, either because they are obeying the rogue state 'secret law' (which is itself illegal) and the cia is no longer part of the us government or its true the constitution has been subverted.  Both situations are a violation of the driving principle (popular sovereignty) upon which the constitution is based.  But don't take my word for it, research it and come to the same inevitable, disturbing conclusion.  If you need help with this research please consider me a hub to point you to smarter constittuonal lawyers whom I'm repeating.

       I can understand everyones fustration but I think that a localized place were links and data covering Hillarys misdeeds will only come across and be pointed out as what Corect The Record is doing by attacking Hillarys opponents.  If the links were unbaised and could be proved it would be another story.  But most people would think its a way of saturating the market opposing Hillary for Trumps sake defeating the true purpose of the collective materials.

       Start listing out the lies Trump has said just since his campaign started. List out how many people he sued into his accusers into silence or bought them off when that failed to work.

       Look at all the times he doesn't give evidence he's right but just pulls the strong man card.

       I think of Trump and Clinton as two sides of the same coin. They both represent corporate greed, oligarchical power, and lies. I hope people realize that. That said, I knoe many people who are not going to the polls because they are upset by our choices, and don't consider how the congressional vote is arguably more important than the presidential vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, the president is a figurehead who essentially is controlled by the CIA, FBI, NSA, and the military, and I wish more people realized that.
