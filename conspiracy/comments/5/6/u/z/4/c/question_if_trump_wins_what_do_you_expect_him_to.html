<p>Alllie you&#39;re a lost cause. There is plenty of evidence in everything I just stated. If you don&#39;t want to read and see it, that&#39;s on you. Just know, you are being ignorant and on the wrong side of history. I disagree with Sanders ideologically, but I would agree he is a better person than Clinton. Don&#39;t let your bias cloud your judgement merely because you are playing the two party politics, and now gender politics because your guy supports a crook (what does that say about him?). Clinton is far more corrupt than Trump, and you know that.</p>

<p>Psychopath I don&#39;t know about. She strikes me as incredibly corrupt. When information is on the internet you never know for sure what is what. So I think she is more corrupt than the average politician, which is a corrupt business... but the crap about the YouTube video we know.

<p>There are leaked emails that she knew this wasn&#39;t true. And the media has never held her feet to the fire over it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know exactly what broke down in Benghazi that those guy didn&#39;t get help when they needed it. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s her fault or somebody else&#39;s. But lying about why it happened, I&#39;m sure she did that.</p>

<p>More wars, more propaganda, more military industrial complex, more pitting the populace against itself. More government expansion &amp; misguided regulation based on cronyism, more pay to play.

    <div class="md"><p>Girl you gotta realize you live within the main stream. If you get out of the main stream you see the bigger picture. For example Hillary put 10 mill on Assange&#39;s head and wanted to Drone strike him. These people are killing anything that topples their monopoly of the world. Welcome to the new world order right after they collapse our banks again. Oh yeah did I mention they just collapse it whenever they want to gain more control over us? Did I mention that our entire political scheme is just bought off, no one in there is genuine. Anyone who is they just make seem crazy and pay people to follow them everywhere and write hate news on them. Anything goes, the more money you have the more corrupt you are, the more corrupt you are the better you&#39;ll fit into the government. Hillary is queen corruption and will cover anything for anyone. Including killing anyone who wants to reveal it.</p>

<p>You just can&#39;t see what Evil is because you&#39;ve been brainwashed. Don&#39;t come back to these circles expecting a different answer from anyone. Your opinion is a popular opinion, but with real intellectuals they will spit all over your opinion because it&#39;s such a shitty generic opinion that ignores all the facts and believes all the lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When did he promise to have women punished?  I&#39;m not saying he didn&#39;t, I just don&#39;t remember that.</p>

<p>He&#39;s said he&#39;d appoint conservative justices, I just don&#39;t think anybody is going to touch that. If they did, it would revert to the states, so I don&#39;t think you&#39;d ever be more than a couple of hours from an abortion if you wanted one.</p>

<p>Marijuana seems to have reverted to the states, and it&#39;s still federally illegal, so I honestly don&#39;t see why this would be different. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also a man and had myself taken out of the gene pool some time ago. So I&#39;ll admit this is not a &quot;hot button&quot; issue for me.</p>

<p>And if I didn&#39;t say it before, I don&#39;t like Trump, and plan to vote for Gary Johnson, and I really don&#39;t expect Trump to get elected.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t think he&#39;s pro life. It&#39;s actually one of the things that annoys me about him. Not that he isn&#39;t pro life, I&#39;m pro choice (more or less, I don&#39;t like it, but I don&#39;t want it outlawed, also I&#39;m a man and feel like it isn&#39;t really my business). It annoys me that I think he&#39;s lying about it.</p>

<p>Same thing with &quot;the wall&quot;. If he gets elected, I think there&#39;s about a 0% chance of a wall actually getting  built, and I think he knows that.</p>

<p>Your message about the elites against Hillary is laughable.

<p>Lastly this &quot;game of telephone&quot; is irrelevant in the age of the internet, because rather then get out of control with misinformation facts can be checked which is exactly how Hillary has been proven to flip-flop on her policies when it favors a vote. She could claim she never supported the war in Iraq; but the internet would <strong>prove it</strong> differently. You see, you are trying to start this game of telephone, the only problem is the information you are trying to construe is public and easily accessible, and from very left leaning alternative blogs and news sites.</p>

<p>Not sure why you would be intimidated, unless you do not like reality and that you have mental issues.... I could see why that would scare people, facing reality is a bitch... That&#39;s my opinion, but how does that have to do with GOP? Marriage is between a man and a woman. You want a civil partnership? Cool. Don&#39;t call it marriage. Win-win for all parties. The key here is, the government should not be involved. Hitlary is worse than Trump, in this sense...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conservatives for the most part are not against gays, believe it or not. They are against being forced to do things that go against their religious beliefs (I&#39;m not religious, but I understand and know the laws), mainly marriage.

Don&#39;t force people to do things. That&#39;s not polite nor does it solve anything. Leave marriage to the religious people, get gov out, and have a civil partnership (which is what marriage truly is).

Most established politicians support her on both sides of the isle in regaurds to trump, Bush supports Hillary, as does big wallstreet, big pharama, big oil, the saudi regime, the Israelis. You want to cry a lack of support from the elite? What about the obvious collision between the elite media and her? </p>

<p>Lastly this &quot;game of telephone&quot; is irrelevant in the age of the internet, because rather then get out of control with misinformation facts can be checked which is exactly how Hillary has been proven to flip-flop on her policies when it favors a vote. She could claim she never supported the war in Iraq; but the internet would <strong>prove it</strong> differently. You see, you are trying to start this game of telephone, the only problem is the information you are trying to construe is public and easily accessible, and from very left leaning alternative blogs and news sites.</p>
