       Not that user, but why are you bringing her gender/genitals into this? If you think people are not voting for her, because she has a pussy, you are severely misinformed and playing into the gender divide. She's a psychopath, corrupt to the core both morally and ideologically, and has a record of being a terrible human being, especially towards other women...

       Are you not seeing it, because you are covering your eyes and ears? Are you not seeing it, because both you and her have a pussy? Is that why you brought it up, your bias? You wanna see the first female president, so you disregard what that person did, because gender.. You're transparent allllie.

       Alllie you're a lost cause. There is plenty of evidence in everything I just stated. If you don't want to read and see it, that's on you. Just know, you are being ignorant and on the wrong side of history. I disagree with Sanders ideologically, but I would agree he is a better person than Clinton. Don't let your bias cloud your judgement merely because you are playing the two party politics, and now gender politics because your guy supports a crook (what does that say about him?). Clinton is far more corrupt than Trump, and you know that.

       I'm really not, though. It may appear that way with comments/stances I've taken and the common definition today, but really I'm more classically liberal than most "liberals" today. I believe in the smallest form of government, preferably none. I believe in personal freedom and responsibility. I'm more of a classic liberal, whereas liberals today, are Draconian Progressives. I'm on the bottom of the scale, whereas you are on the left right paradigm, both are Draconian and Authoritarian.

       Hillary certainly sold that bill of goods about it being a reaction to a YouTube video when she knew it wasn't true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychopath I don't know about. She strikes me as incredibly corrupt. When information is on the internet you never know for sure what is what. So I think she is more corrupt than the average politician, which is a corrupt business... but the crap about the YouTube video we know. Do you realize the person who made that video was arrested?

       When the attack on the Libyan consulate first happened they said it wasn't a terror attack. They said it was a protest about a YouTube video (I think that portrayed Mohammed) that  got out of hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are leaked emails that she knew this wasn't true. And the media has never held her feet to the fire over it.

       I don't know exactly what broke down in Benghazi that those guy didn't get help when they needed it. I don't know if that's her fault or somebody else's. But lying about why it happened, I'm sure she did that.

       Examples of life quality degradation?
      </p>
      <p>
       More wars, more propaganda, more military industrial complex, more pitting the populace against itself. More government expansion &amp; misguided regulation based on cronyism, more pay to play. More interference in medicine, more profit for medical services, more overshadowing of free market health programs, more interference in natural meds. More drug wars. More quantitative easing, more economic tampering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially more of the same. I'm tired of more of the same. I hold the president &amp; my members of congress responsible for that &amp; I'm damn tired of it. I would like to see a president who says, "we're not participating in this horsedickery anymore."

       See, I see those things as republican too. Certainly Bush and Bush started more wars than Clinton or Obama.

       MORE PROFIT FOR MEDICAL SERVICES!! Like they aren't overpaid already?

       its going to be the worst for minorities honestly. stop and frisk policy nationwide, possible ban on muslims entering the country(not sure if that would stick as it goes against exactly why this country was founded), and thats just a start. Trumps foreign policy would be abysmal, I feel trade relations would go south.

       I wouldn't vote for the guy or any politician because I believe in no government and more of anarcho capitalist/Voluntaryist society. But, we need someone to get us to that point, and he could be the one to do it.

       So, with that being said: Lowering taxes, breaking up health insurance monopolies, kicking out cronies, peace with Russia, ending these endless wars, getting rid of a lot of these unnecessary regulations, securing the border (enforcing the laws on the books), abiding by the constitution in regards to the second amendment, and bringing jobs back to the country based on his economics/regulation/tax plans.

       Sigh, which is why I'm not holding my breathe. Still a little light inside me that retains somewhat of faith, though. Maybe he'll turn on his handlers. I just fear if he did, he'd end up like JFK. Which is what I feared about Ron Paul. He's always had my vote, but I'd worry about what the Deep State would do... We're fucked, either way you shake it...

       Wow. Racist much? Looks to me that the OP is trying to facilitate a conversation based on evidence with reliable sources. A persons feelings and uninformed opinions are not a basis for an argument. One must back up an argument with supporting material and still hold a skeptical stance.

       If Hillary appoints SC justices that keep the US pro-choice it won't affect me directly since I'm old. But I still want her to do it. Maybe you'd like Trump to play Duarte and tell people to attack gays even though you don't know any.

       No, I don't want anyone to attack gays I just asked you to explain the second part of your question man.  I mean, ummm ya know?  Look at it:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Or do that you'll like even though it will not really affect your life?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I know that  you say you're old man, but so what?  I'm kinda almost old but I can still type a question out that usually is legible unless I'm a little smoked up.  I'm just saying man, nothing about the gays, just trying to understand the second question in your post.

       Girl you gotta realize you live within the main stream. If you get out of the main stream you see the bigger picture. For example Hillary put 10 mill on Assange's head and wanted to Drone strike him. These people are killing anything that topples their monopoly of the world. Welcome to the new world order right after they collapse our banks again. Oh yeah did I mention they just collapse it whenever they want to gain more control over us? Did I mention that our entire political scheme is just bought off, no one in there is genuine. Anyone who is they just make seem crazy and pay people to follow them everywhere and write hate news on them. Anything goes, the more money you have the more corrupt you are, the more corrupt you are the better you'll fit into the government. Hillary is queen corruption and will cover anything for anyone. Including killing anyone who wants to reveal it.

       You just can't see what Evil is because you've been brainwashed. Don't come back to these circles expecting a different answer from anyone. Your opinion is a popular opinion, but with real intellectuals they will spit all over your opinion because it's such a shitty generic opinion that ignores all the facts and believes all the lies.

       Yeah I figured it was futile even trying to explain to you what's happening. Enjoy half a brain (You have the left one), enjoy having absolutely no idea what's going on around you, work for that paycheck and make sure you consume as much fluoride as possible to keep that pineal gland closed.

       I'm pretty sure Trump is pro-gay, or at least "gay friendly". He's not a social conservative. Neither am I, so I should like him. But I don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think you have to worry about anybody messing with Roe vs Wade. Every time a conservative gets elected people worry about this, and I understand why. But I don't think he'd try to mess with it. I honestly don't think he's  really pro life.

       When did he promise to have women punished?  I'm not saying he didn't, I just don't remember that.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's said he'd appoint conservative justices, I just don't think anybody is going to touch that. If they did, it would revert to the states, so I don't think you'd ever be more than a couple of hours from an abortion if you wanted one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marijuana seems to have reverted to the states, and it's still federally illegal, so I honestly don't see why this would be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also a man and had myself taken out of the gene pool some time ago. So I'll admit this is not a "hot button" issue for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if I didn't say it before, I don't like Trump, and plan to vote for Gary Johnson, and I really don't expect Trump to get elected.

       Well, he back tracked there, and said he'd punish the doctors, not the women.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't think he's pro life. It's actually one of the things that annoys me about him. Not that he isn't pro life, I'm pro choice (more or less, I don't like it, but I don't want it outlawed, also I'm a man and feel like it isn't really my business). It annoys me that I think he's lying about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing with "the wall". If he gets elected, I think there's about a 0% chance of a wall actually getting  built, and I think he knows that.

       Ugh. r/conspiracy is not a pro-donald sub! You can post that question to r/asktrumpsupporters; though i imagine your post here was more to garner support for Hillary by countering the answers to your questions with Hillary buzzwords and talking points which judging by your comments in this thread alone - proves to be true. Good try, but you're barking up the wrong tree.

       I have no hope of that. I wanted to see what his appeal is. I think it comes down to "Not female and not Hillary." Can't help the one but the second shows the success of republican lies. It reminds me of... Caligula. Turns out most of what we think we know about Caligula were just lies spread by his opponents, the lies lasting longer than the truth. The lies being so much more interesting. He enraged the Roman elite just as Hillary enrages the American elite. So they spread lies.

       How is most of the crimes Hillary commits Republican propagnda if what's being exposed is by an Englishman who has avocated peace in his watchdog project "wikileaks"? As was said by many after the primaries: "It's not who released the information it's what the information pertains". If you are happy living in a bubble where every crime an individual commits is obvious Republican propagnda, then you are set in your ways whether it be true or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your message about the elites against Hillary is laughable. Most established politicians support her on both sides of the isle in regaurds to trump, Bush supports Hillary, as does big wallstreet, big pharama, big oil, the saudi regime, the Israelis. You want to cry a lack of support from the elite? What about the obvious collision between the elite media and her?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly this "game of telephone" is irrelevant in the age of the internet, because rather then get out of control with misinformation facts can be checked which is exactly how Hillary has been proven to flip-flop on her policies when it favors a vote. She could claim she never supported the war in Iraq; but the internet would
       <strong>
        prove it
       </strong>
       differently. You see, you are trying to start this game of telephone, the only problem is the information you are trying to construe is public and easily accessible, and from very left leaning alternative blogs and news sites.

       Well, quite frankly, I think it should be obvious to you why I would be afraid of him and I thought you were just being cheeky. You can very simply google "Donald Trump Sexist Quotes" and find long lists filled with reasons why women might be a bit scared of him. Additionally, you can probably imagine why a lesbian would be intimidated by any member of the GOP without me needing to explain it.

       I wouldn't be afraid. You have the people behind you and congress and other measures to stop anything too crazy from happening.. What could possibly happen? I'm curious on what specifically you're afraid of.. You think he's gonna make it illegal for gay marriage? No.. I get it, he's said some fcked up stuff and Hillary would never!
Except she's made too many bad decisions to be out president and will put us into WW3 with Russia (who Donald would probably get along with enough to finish ISIS and finally get out of the fcking Middle East already.. That's what you should be afraid about.. Nuclear destruction of our planet

       I am scared of the nuclear destruction of our planet more than lots of other things honestly. I'm also against Hillary just as I am against Trump, and any other presidential candidate who ever ran and ever will run. I am especially afraid of a president who condones violence against me and people I love, which I feel is fair and not a case to argue against. I'm equally afraid of Hillary because if she becomes president everyone will just excuse her war mongering because she's a woman. I do not think the men in Congress care much about protecting me.

       You underestimate people I think.. Times have a changed just over the last couple years so much that you can't reverse all of it. We still have good people in the country and around you I'm sure that will protect you from the assholes. If anything.. I think the states' will be able to run themselves and will be easy to find or stay in the place you find comfortable. But yes most of these presidents don't have a clue.. Trump is like this crazy joker in the deck. Hard to say what he'll bring..

       Not sure why you would be intimidated, unless you do not like reality and that you have mental issues.... I could see why that would scare people, facing reality is a bitch... That's my opinion, but how does that have to do with GOP? Marriage is between a man and a woman. You want a civil partnership? Cool. Don't call it marriage. Win-win for all parties. The key here is, the government should not be involved. Hitlary is worse than Trump, in this sense...

       Hey, don't get me wrong; I don't like Hillary either. They both scare me. I'm not a liberal. And I don't know how it can be considered delusional to recognize that the conservative party is often against gay people in general, and not just gay marriage. I think marriage is outdated anyway.

       Conservatives for the most part are not against gays, believe it or not. They are against being forced to do things that go against their religious beliefs (I'm not religious, but I understand and know the laws), mainly marriage. I'm not against gays, and I'd be considered a "conservative". The only reason gov is involved in marriage is because of taxes. Get them out, and win-win for all. Don't force people to do things. That's not polite nor does it solve anything. Leave marriage to the religious people, get gov out, and have a civil partnership (which is what marriage truly is). Trump has never said anything against gays, and his "racist/sexist" comments are either taken out of context, or plainly bullshit. I don't support the dude (or anyone), but I will debate this...

       I'm inclined to disagree with your statement about conservatives being mostly not against gays, and that is just based on my own experiences as a gay person living in a farm town in Connecticut. I'm glad that hasn't been your experience, however and maybe I need to branch out. I agree that we should leave marriage to the religious people and get the gov't out, although marriage is the least of my concerns. I believe that Trump is racist, sexist, and homophobic, but I suppose that is just personal opinion based on what you believe is right/wrong.

       I understand him scaring you (Hillary scares me, they both scare me, but Hillary a bit more). I honestly think he's probably "gay friendly". Of course who knows what audio is going to surface next, the man simply cannot shut his mouth. But he's not a "Christian conservative".

       Well, he back tracked there, and said he'd punish the doctors, not the women.

       I really don't think he's pro life. It's actually one of the things that annoys me about him. Not that he isn't pro life, I'm pro choice (more or less, I don't like it, but I don't want it outlawed, also I'm a man and feel like it isn't really my business). It annoys me that I think he's lying about it.

       Same thing with "the wall". If he gets elected, I think there's about a 0% chance of a wall actually getting  built, and I think he knows that.

       How is most of the crimes Hillary commits Republican propagnda if what's being exposed is by an Englishman who has avocated peace in his watchdog project "wikileaks"? As was said by many after the primaries: "It's not who released the information it's what the information pertains". If you are happy living in a bubble where every crime an individual commits is obvious Republican propagnda, then you are set in your ways whether it be true or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your message about the elites against Hillary is laughable. Most established politicians support her on both sides of the isle in regaurds to trump, Bush supports Hillary, as does big wallstreet, big pharama, big oil, the saudi regime, the Israelis. You want to cry a lack of support from the elite? What about the obvious collision between the elite media and her?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly this "game of telephone" is irrelevant in the age of the internet, because rather then get out of control with misinformation facts can be checked which is exactly how Hillary has been proven to flip-flop on her policies when it favors a vote. She could claim she never supported the war in Iraq; but the internet would
       <strong>
        prove it
       </strong>
       differently. You see, you are trying to start this game of telephone, the only problem is the information you are trying to construe is public and easily accessible, and from very left leaning alternative blogs and news sites.
