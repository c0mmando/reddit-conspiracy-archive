    <div class="md"><p>Why do people post long rants about why they are leaving a sub reddit and then post that long rant to the sub reddit?  Is this supposed to be meaningful to anyone other than OP?</p>

<p>Is this an example of rage quitting on Reddit?</p>

<p>I doubt OPs post changes anyone&#39;s mind about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but it sure does make OP look frail/needy/emotionally immature.</p>

<p>Edit: This post is similar to a top post on the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> about quitting <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.  Im suspicious of OP.  Could OP be a CTR shill trying to make <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> look bad and encourage other people to leave this sub since its one of the few places on Reddit where any real information about the criminal Clinton can be found?</p>

<p>What do you say OP?  Are you paid by CTR?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t exactly opposed to what you were saying until you started with the personal insults and accused him of being part of CTR.  Doing this only seems to validate his claim, as he merely voiced his dissatisfaction with the recent content of this sub and your response was to resort to childish namecalling (frail/needy/emotionally immature) and then suggest he had a dark ulterior motive for posting.</p>

<p>If you disagree with him, fine, but personal attacks and unfounded accusations of being a shill working for CTR simply because he doesn&#39;t agree with your views is only proving his point that this is no longer a place where constructive discussions can be had without being attacked for your perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand where you are coming from, there are indeed many shills, but the moment we start allowing suspicion to get the better of us and label anyone who&#39;s opinion differs from ours as suspicious is the moment this sub loses it&#39;s ability to have the type of open, honest conversations you won&#39;t find elsewhere. The type of conversations that make this place unique. If we become as close-minded of other peoples perspectives as r/politics then we are really no better than they are anymore..</p>

<p>It is a serious problem though, weeding out the shills from those who genuinely believe what they say.  For that, I don&#39;t have an answer, though I wish I did..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither the numbers nor the political science support this. It&#39;s clear he won&#39;t win. I will commit to eating an actual handful of cowshit if he does. </p>

<p>Trump is only here to make people feel like Hillary&#39;s inevitable victory was somewhat hard fought. You tell a bunch of pissed off rednecks that they&#39;re fighting the good fight as long as they&#39;re fighting for the rich, and hey- presto! You&#39;ve got them fighting their own interests, and supporting the mega-rich of this world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is directly copying the posts about people unsubscribing from r/politics. OP isn&#39;t even active on this sub save to comment about the debate. OP might be joking? I sure hope so.</p>

<p>What OP and other whiners don&#39;t understand is that this is an open conspiracy forum. Which candidate has the greatest level of conspiracy surrounding them? Hillary Clinton, by far. BY MASSIVE OCEANS FAR. We&#39;ve got Bill and his sexcapades with convicted pedophiles, Hillary openly deleting emails and threatening war with Iran, falling down on camera due to a magical sickness...I can go on on, but the fact that these whiners can&#39;t see the forest through the trees is frustrating. Trump and Clinton are both corrupt asshats, but one is far more easier to attack and unearth juicy examples of international-level corruption. If OP wants to unearth juicy details on Trump&#39;s corruption, he/she should do so and stop playing the victim card.</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t. Everyone has the right to an opinion here and many are not convinced. Where are your sources?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;also doesn&#39;t the term &quot;whiner&quot; come straight out of the Trump campaign playbook? funny to see people so convinced they&#39;re &quot;thinking&quot;, when they&#39;re just parroting what the powerful say.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t have a playbook, but no, the word &quot;whine&quot; comes from Old English and it&#39;s not a new bandwagon insult such as &#39;cuck&#39; that you seem to enjoy using elsewhere. Good job at &quot;thinking for yourself&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You Americans are so funny. You think gun-ownership=free-thinking. You need to actually do shit with them, you retards.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do, do &quot;shit&quot; with them. We target shoot, protect our families and belongings, hunt, brag about them in front of UK kids to piss them off, etc. Seriously though, what are you wildly implying here? That we should stage an armed revolution? That&#39;s what stupid people that don&#39;t own guns think. Owning firearms is a responsibility that many of us take seriously. Brandishing one in public for nearly any reason is jail time and you lose that right FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. Before you naively claim that all Americans are stupid, consider yourself stupid for inciting and promoting violence without justification when you obviously have never owned a gun. Shooting people on the street doesn&#39;t solve our problems in Washington, retard.</p>

Find the one that fits you because they are all running with a narrative right now. I dislike Clinton because I think she is nefarious in her intentions. I think Trump is just...a poor choice and very unqualified. So I really don&#39;t have much to say about him. But I have a lot of anger towards her.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and she&#39;s going to get elected fro basically all these reasons. DO you think people who control all the things you mentioned would ever allow a fair election? Once you&#39;ve invested a certain amount in subverting the system, the most rational thing to do is to ensure the democratic process is controlled. This was achieved decades ago. What&#39;s Trump going to do about it.</p>

<p>Armed insurrection, it&#39;s been a long time coming. If Americans had any critical thinking capacities there&#39;d be Republicans, Democrats and bankers all hanging from ropes right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sooo.. you&#39;re saying just give in?? I think not. that is literally what they want. redpilling as many people as possible is the goal. that&#39;s exactly why we&#39;re constantly bogged down with disinformation and bullshit Hollywood reality TV shows, ignorance is bliss for the participant and the elite, alike. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m saying armed insurrection, guerrilla warfare, civil disobediance, extensive covert networks, terrorism. </p>

<p>the electoral process is owned and operated by international capitalist elites. people in SF knew this turn of the century when they rose up and took back their city. Indigenous people know this now. that&#39;s why they call them &quot;warrior societies&quot;. look it up, real resistance is happening in your country. </p>
