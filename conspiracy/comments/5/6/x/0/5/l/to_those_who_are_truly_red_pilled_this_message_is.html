       For the few here that might have achieved this then this message is for you: A major world event is coming and you can't avoid it. In your heart it is written what choice you must make, you know it. But this event will come as a knee dropping shock even to the most seasoned free thinkers. This reality shaking event is designed as to debilitate the masses with out-of-nowhere fear and panic as to hastily herd them into the great trap. Be of good courage and choose righteousness, do not fear. You will know inside when the time comes the choice you must make, even though the world around you screams its wrong. Do not trust your eyes they will deceive you. If you possess the massive courage and sacrifice required to make the right choice in such an unforeseen perilous moment, then by the affirmation of your actions your spirit is crowned indeed worthy of ascension. Your lessons here will then be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not much time but look around daily for the signals, its happening now. In the coming days assess the world around you that is constantly bombarding you with "how you should believe, how you should choose." faith will be needed more as those who oppose the world view will be crucified harsher. A person whose name has been in nearly every person's tongue and a constant target of the enemy is trying to tell you that the fallen ones are lying to you, he has already exposed them to you. Those who understand what I have just said you know truly that the enemy is distinguishable. From this day forward to not let them coax you no matter what, remember that. This isn't about the election or the future of America, because that isn't coming. The POWER/RULERS in this particle sandbox are part of an illusion put in place to seem undefeatable but overcome only by the chosen few who ultimately choose themselves worthy.

       There is a man named Rick Renner, he lives in Russia and has been studying Greek for 30 years. He says the "Last days" actually started at the "Day of Pentecost" Which is why people have been saying we are living in the last days for the last 2000 years. And this is what he interprets this one passage to mean after going through all the different meanings of the greek words used and the way they were compounded together. It really gives a much better insight than any english bible translation ever could. Makes me wonder what else the bible says that we don't know about.....And mind you, this passage is only one areas of the N.T. talking about the last days. Jesus also talks about them being full of "wars and rumors of wars" Nature and animals dying ect... And that these are only the beginning of birth pains.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Renner started giving this expounded version back in the 90's way before our obsession with violent video games and movies, social media, cell phones, the spread of "anything goes" crude and vulgar language and comedy like we have now today. (Sam Kinison is the first absolutely vulgar comic I know of from the early 90's) the massive spread of Pornography, the LGBTQI movement. ect...
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the greek words actually translates into the "I AM" Generation or what we now call the "ME" generation. A term that was coined in the 70's was actually coined by the Holy Spirit 2000 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Timothy 3 Greek expounded
      </p>
      <p>
       The Holy Spirits prophecy warning speaking through the Apostle Paul,
      </p>
      <p>
       "You emphatically must know what I am about to tell you! In the very part of the last days - at the very end of the age and at the very last of the last days, - periods of time will come that are hurtful, harmful, dangerous, unpredictable, uncomfortable, and high-risk. People will feel encumbered by it, like you are standing in the middle of it with prison bars around you and there is no way to escape it. Mankind at large will have misdirected love from godly love to being self-consumed, self-absorbed, self-focused and in love with themselves more than anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of this self-love, they will hoard money for themselves while spending very little to help others. These boasters are so committed to their own self-promotion and agenda that they are willing to exaggerate, overstate the facts, stretch the truth, embellish a story, and even lie if it will get them the position, advantage, or goal they desire. They will be arrogant, haughty, impudent, snooty, and insolent. They will never be satisfied and will never have enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       They disdain, mock, slander, and speak ill of anyone that stands in the way of their plans. Everything will be off the table, anything goes. They will think they have a right to everything and in this environment, parents will no longer be able to persuade, control, lead or exercise authority over their children. Although they were once thankful and appreciative, people will become void of gratitude and generally unappreciative of everything in the last time. As a result, impurity will seep into society and cause it to become unholy -- impure, ill-mannered, unclean, indecent, coarse, vulgar, offensive, crude, lewd and rude. Behaving and carrying on in a way that God would never sanction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love and commitment for family will degenerate; divorce will become epidemic with irreconcilable differences being the major cause for separation; and the court system will be overwhelmed as people go overboard in their suing others and in being sued. People will turn savage, vicious, uncivilized, violent, ferocious, and inhuman. A society where law is not primarily intended to protect the rights of good people but rather is used instead to protect and defend the rights of offenders. People will be preoccupied with and known for their obsession with violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will be lovers of pleasures and creature comforts more than lovers of God. Romantic with themselves, kissing themselves, showing deep profound affection for themselves, have a deep profound love for philosophy and wisdom while wanting to do everything they can to remove Truth (God laws) from their minds. Their doctrine will be that pleasure, comforts and happiness is the highest good; addiction to and obsession for pleasure as a way of life."
      </p>
      <p>
       Renner said some of the Greek words used in this one passage were so rare that they are not used anywhere else in the New Testament."

       World War 3 is already happening and has been for some time. Maybe op is suggesting that rather than fighting it across the middle east to devastate their countries that the fighting will be brought here to the States? I dunno, op is being mighty ambiguous for no fucking good reason, so it's difficult to say what they're trying to get at.

       World War III has just started with the American government creating CGI planes to fool the populace into fighting the middle east in 9/11/2001. And it's just starting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concluding battle will be a blitz attack by Russia and China against USA, Europe, Japan and Korea and will result in the end of the western world and the descent into communist globalism as the only ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       The battle is not a "world war" but more like Nazi Germany destroying Poland and France and will end up with 30 million americans purged. If you want to know exactly what happens at that time, go watch "The checkist".

       i already described how the next and final war should be fought instead of continuing to devastate countries and think that all will be over. The only thing that will be over if you let them fight their war is your freedom and your identity as a soveregin man.

       there were no planes invloved in 9/11. they were cgi images only shown in the news broadcast on day one and repeated and refined over the next days. but in retrospect looking back at the footage with an open mind., it's easy to tell they aren't real planes.

       cgi images on every network that was carrying it live as the 2nd plane crashed. now just how did they manage to do that?

       i am saying that with the technology available in 2001 there is no way to insert CGI planes in every video feed across every broadcast network.  your claim is just a distraction from real dialog that tries to get to the true story of what happened

       you gotta look into that yourself. you need excersize youre due diligence. if you keep demanding answer with no thinking youll keep getting lied to. for example. you say every camera across every broadcast, do you even know how many or how few official views there were of it happening?

       they hear what sounds like an airplane. appears to be an airplane. or they sure it was an airplane. but all the videos don't match. so why fake a plane? why fake the way it flies into the building? why cgi a plane? why fake videos ?

       none of the seven live shots

       CGI.  that claim has been debunked over, and over, and over again.  I can't understand how people can still be serious about it.  It's easily the flimsiest of 9/11 conspiracies...even laughable to most conspiracists.

       haha I take it you have very little life experience.  Tens of thousands of people witnessing the same event at the same time =/= couple hundred people over the past few decades thinking they saw bigfoot.

       I just don't see how they could project CGI images into the sky in real time so that the hundreds or thousands of people who saw the planes hit the towers in real life could see it. I just don't understand why they would go through the trouble of faking it, it would make no difference to the conspiracy or plan.

       What facts? You may as well be saying unicorns exist because of the facts. There is no proof or even eyewitness reports that there were no planes. There is no motive for anyone faking the plane crashes. You can't just use 'because of the facts' as an argument and expect it to hold any weight.

       911 is a controlled demolition and the planes are simply fake and photoshopped. See the "melting plane" or "Wing behind building" stuff. The screams are fake too because people do not know what is going on as soon as a building collapses.

       No, I'm saying, they could still crash the planes and also blame the muslims. They were already killing tons of people. Why would they go through the trouble of creating cgi planes and adding another layer of lies to cover up when they could just actually crash planes into the towers? It makes no sense.

       on the morning of September 11, four enormous, fuel-laden, lumbering jumbo jets were hijacked by 19 Arab men with box-cutters and zero in-air flight experience. These slow, unmaneuverable planes were then flown for 1 hour and 45 minutes through the most restricted airspace in the world without eliciting a single military intercept. The most sophisticated military in the world, able to strike dime-sized targets from hundreds of miles away with laser-guided missiles, precision radar equipment, and state of the art aircraft capable of flying well over 1,300 mph, could not locate, engage, nor intercept four wandering jumbo jets. A military that has a budget larger than the combined military assets of every other country in the world could not scramble, intercept and engage any of the radically wayward planes. Even Flight 77, which was allowed to fly unimpeded and crash into the Pentagon one full hour after two jets had been flown into the Twin Towers in NYC, failed to elicit the response and intercept from any military jets. Nor, indeed, did flight 93. A plane that crashed in a Pennsylvania field 1 hour and 45 minutes after the first plane was confirmed hijacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       This official narrative leaves the public with one of two conclusions. Either the U.S. military is a wholly inept force incapable of defending the country from even the most rudimentarily hostile elements, rendering it the greatest illusion and farce the world has ever seen. Or on the morning of September 11, forces within its own ranks purposely blocked, hamstrung, and prevented the military apparatus from carrying out its most basic defensive responsibilities. In light of what we know the military can and has done in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc., in light of the plan they surely have in place to defend the skies from a potential massive enemy air-attack with striking power infinitely more powerful than that of four unarmed civilian jumbo jets, the first hypothesis is out. Which leaves behind the only logical scenario. That rogue elements from within the military and government leadership itself either stood down the military apparatus to let the events of September 11 occur on purpose. Or the same rogue elements planned, facilitated, and helped carry out the attacks themselves. Either one would be high treason and mass murder. And there is overwhelming evidence to back up both.
      </p>
      <p>
       Defenders of the 'official story' blame confusion and chaos as reason for the lack of proper military response on the morning of 9/11. They spin stories of crowded radar screens, FAA confusion and lack of communication, NORAD mix-ups and lack of appropriate response protocol, uncertainty in regards to rules of engagement and chain of command, phantom flights, war games, dispersed military and Pentagon commanders, etc. etc. All of which is nonsense. FAA flight controllers are highly trained and capable professionals, accustomed to and comfortable with incredibly crowded radar screens. Confusion in times of war and crisis is expected and planned for. Strict rules of engagement and combat protocol are written, designed, and followed with unambiguous clarity specifically because of the inevitable chaos that ensues at the onset of an attack. Contrary to the 'official story', confusion and chaos did not create the inept military response. Virtually every step of the standard military protocol in response to cases of hijack and/or attack were ignored and violated on the morning of September 11. This comprehensive violation of standard operating procedures is what created the inept military response. Not chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       For an hour-long interview with Robin Hordon, an FAA air-traffic controller and aviation pilot from 'Boston Center' trying to blow the whistle and detail what actually happened regarding the 9/11 crimes and cover-up, click here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every commercial and civilian plane that takes to the air in the U.S. has to fill and file a specific flight plan. Along this flight plan, there are required 'fix points' that the plane has to hit along the way in order to keep the skies safe and clear. When a plane misses one of these 'fixes', air traffic controllers are alerted, and they attempt to make contact with the pilot. If the pilot fails to respond appropriately, the military is contacted, and a fighter jet is usually scrambled to investigate. The military and NORAD are directly linked into the sophisticated radar and air traffic control systems of the FAA. And even a private pilot in a small off-course plane 'will likely find two F-18s on their tail within 10 or so minutes' of unapproved movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Popular Mechanics and other defenders of the 'official story' have claimed that Payne Stewart's wayward Cessna is the only plane in the last decade to have elicited a military intercept in the U.S. However, not only does this directly contradict numerous other media and government reports citing hundreds of other such intercept incidents, NORAD'S own spokesman, Marine Corps Major Mike Snyder told the Boston Globe on September 15, 2001 that 'its fighters routinely intercept aircraft.' Moreover, common sense would dictate that the most powerful nation in the history of the world, with the greatest military capacity and sophistication in the history of the world, would have ready squadrons of military jets prepared and armed to take to the air within minutes to defend the skies from attacks of any sort. And from any direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, on the morning of September 11, the FAA, NORAD, and the military were not dealing with simple wayward Cessnas carrying a charismatic golf pro. They were dealing with four separate, simultaneous, confirmed hijackings of enormous civilian airliners - all of which had illegally turned off their transponders, cut off all communication with air traffic controllers, and begun meandering suspiciously over the most heavily populated civilian corridor in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, the FAA had confirmed by 8:14 a.m. that the first plane had been hijacked. Immediate military action should have been initiated. But the official history of what transpires after that is a bizarre and varied matrix of conflicting reports, narratives, explanations, finger-pointings, and excuses. Standard operating procedures in effect on that morning would have dictated that air traffic controllers immediately contact superiors both within the FAA and the military to report the hijacking incident. No logical reason exists to doubt that these procedures were followed. However, it is impossible to confirm the order of events as all involved controllers with direct knowledge of the timeline of events have since been depositioned and silenced with an unexplained, illogical official gag order. Source here, and here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more alarming, on May 7 2004, the New York Times reported, "At least six air traffic controllers who dealt with two of the hijacked airliners on Sept. 11, 2001, made a tape recording that day describing the events, but the tape was destroyed by a supervisor without anyone making a transcript or even listening to it, the Transportation Department said today...The taping began before noon on Sept. 11 at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center, in Ronkonkoma, on Long Island, but it was later destroyed by an F.A.A. quality-assurance manager, who crushed the cassette in his hand, cut the tape into little pieces and dropped them in different trash cans around the building, according to a report made public today by the inspector general of the Transportation Department."
      </p>
      <p>
       What is it that controllers knew and/or described and/or suspected about 9/11 that government officials do not want leaked to the public? Again, former Boston Center air traffic controller Robin Hordon, in an interview on the Randi Rhodes show in December of 2006, provides an answer. Hordon, a veteran controller with many friends and colleagues on duty that morning, said, "On September 11th I'm one of the few people who really within quite a few hours of the whole event taking place just simply knew that it was an inside job…normal protocol is to get fighter jet aircraft up (to) assist." Hordon continued that "from personal experience he knew the system was always ready to immediately scramble intercepting fighters and that any reversal of that procedure would have been unprecedented and abnormal…'I know people who work there who confirmed to me that the FAA was not asleep and the controllers could do the job, they followed their own protocols.'…Hordon said that the only way the airliners could have avoided being intercepted was if a massive electrical and communications failure had occurred which it didn't on that day, adding that there was 'no way' the hijacked airliners could have reached their targets otherwise."

       Holy shit, I am not a shill just because I don't agree with your opinion on how things happened. All I am saying is that maybe they didn't scramble the jets because they didn't want to kill the passengers, or maybe they didn't scramble the jets because they were in on the conspiracy. Either way, it makes no sense whatsoever that they would fake the airplanes crashing into the towers and go through all of that trouble when it would be so much simpler and more devastating to just actually crash planes into the towers.

       So they risked exposing their lie by adding another aspect to have to cover up, just to have an example of how unintelligent the regular populace was? Why would you add another complication to this already complicated plot? Faking the plane crashes would bring them no benefit, just added risk. There is no actual empirical or even anecdotal evidence for them being faked, and there is no motive. It also does not change the possibility for a conspiracy, and I'm not arguing that, I'm just saying faking the planes does nothing to benefit the conspiracy theory or those who executed the conspiracy.

What will they choose if the choice was between informed people mysteriously dying and disappearing or themselves admitting they live a lie.

       It's pretty clear that something is about to happen between the US/Turkey/Saudi Arabia/Israel  and Russia/Syria/Philippines?/China?. Clinton is pushing for a no fly zone over Syria because she wants an air war with Russia. Obama bombed Syrian soldiers during a cease fire, and Russian state media is preparing its citizens for nuclear war. This is real life, can you believe it? I can agree that the language used in the post is pretty pretentious though.

       So they risked exposing their lie by adding another aspect to have to cover up, just to have an example of how unintelligent the regular populace was? Why would you add another complication to this already complicated plot? Faking the plane crashes would bring them no benefit, just added risk. There is no actual empirical or even anecdotal evidence for them being faked, and there is no motive. It also does not change the possibility for a conspiracy, and I'm not arguing that, I'm just saying faking the planes does nothing to benefit the conspiracy theory or those who executed the conspiracy.
