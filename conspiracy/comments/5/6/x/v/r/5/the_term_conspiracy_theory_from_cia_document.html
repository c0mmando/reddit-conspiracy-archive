    <div class="md"><p>Of course. In fact SJW&#39;s are a little minority of people. Almost all feminists are good people with a real cause. Doing everything they can to achieve equality. We really need feminism in latin, african, arab and east europe countries. Feminists in my country know shit about the progressive stack, white privilege, islamophobia, culture appropriation, 100 genders, etc. Same with blacks. In my country theres no such thing as whites, blacks, etc. We are all the same. Regressive people are SJW&#39;s and BlacksLivesMatter idiots. Not feminists and blacks.</p>

<p>I also agree 100%. I live between Iran and Australia, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s of interest to you but I&#39;ve had several Iranian men (and women) comment to me that they thought sexism was only a problem in their part of the world, but after moving to Aus think that it&#39;s also an issue there. In western countries the vast majority (almost universally 90%+) of murders, rapes, child sex abuse etc is still perpetrated by men, the vast majority of elected politicians and CEOs, people on the Board of Directors of influential companies are still men, despite men and women being equal under the law. Whether or not we accept that as the &quot;natural order&quot; of things, is there no justification in your mind for some people to not be satisfied with that, to want to talk about it and maybe see a change?</p>

<p>You&#39;re claiming these feminists are doing all they can, yet you don&#39;t hear their message all the time, whereas meanwhile you see this supposed subset of feminism all the time. </p>

<p>Reddit is the front page of the internet and these are supposedly important topics globally since they are here yet all I see are the common username callouts, pun trains, circle jerking, and shoulder slapping you expect when playing an mmo or shooting the shit with your friends in the garage. No respect or relevance to the topic necessary!</p>

<p>The only reason the Hill campaign allows negative articles about Hill to be posted ONLY here, is to associate anything that casts Hill in a negative light, be associated with the negative condentation of a conspiracy. </p>

<p>So we have r/politics being flooded with pro Hill propeganda (some of which may be true) , and r/conspiracy being flooded with Hill scandals, negative articles. </p>

<p>It sucks, but the only place were being allowed to speak or minds freely and share interesting things about a shitty, undeserving candidate, is a place that automatically paints it into a negative light, and descredits any possible conversations regarding such.</p>

<p>That&#39;s true. But it&#39;s also possible to reverse this label by finding some conspiracy element in your opponent’s thinking, and then using the ‘conspiracy theorist’ label against them.</p>

<p>For example, when arguing with the Global Warming zealots, they often bring out the Evil Oil Money that supposedly finances the skeptics. So I’ll accuse them of being Conspiracy Theorists, which typically gets them quite mad.</p>

<p>Why these people would do this is a separate question from whether they do it or not.</p>

<p>I’m not really an expert on how the reptilian thinking works, so I don’t want to speculate. But the fact remains that, for any climate alarmist, the funding from various sources is 100 times greater than for a skeptic. This is a conservative estimate.</p>

<p>You can justify literally anything you want this way.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve decided that global warming isn&#39;t happening, and therefore any study - even if it&#39;s legitimate - that claims global warming is real is therefore &quot;alarmist&quot;.  If global warming is real, then studies that show it&#39;s actually happening should vastly outnumber studies that show it isn&#39;t happening.  To actually prove your point you need to trace the money back to companies or individuals and then show that they are behind all the research that points to global warming being real.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;ve <em>concluded</em> it&#39;s not happening based on data. That&#39;s what science is all about. The satellite record clearly demonstrates that there&#39;s been a warming pause for the last 19 years. The ground station data has been rigged,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What they mean is climate-change denier.  Considering the global economy runs on fossil fuels there&#39;s no question that there are enormous financial incentives to deny climate-change is occurring or that fossil fuels are driving it - particularly in the countries that have the largest economies.  If human-caused climate change is actually real, we would expect powerful industries to put money into the media and politicians to do damage control and create doubt.  In order to keep the status quo on environmental regulations as long as possible to maximize their profits while they can.  I think that this conclusion is undeniable whether or not you believe in the science.</p>

<p>The claims that climate change itself is a conspiracy have to come up with enough of an economic incentive to fund climate scientists around the world to agree on the science - as well as media and politicians.  The amount of money necessary would obviously have to be huge in order to counter the money from the largest industries in the world who, in this hypothetical scenario, would legitimately want to fight the misinformation to protect their financial interests.  I haven&#39;t heard anything close to a convincing argument in this regard.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there is no dispute whatsoever that carbon dioxide captures heat.  You can do <a href="https://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2015/back-of-the-envelope-attribution/">back-of-the-envelope calculations</a> and see how much CO2 has been released each year since we began using fossil fuels.  And you can do back-of-the-envelope calculations to see how much heat that extra CO2 should have retained each year.  Then you can do back-of-the-envelope calculations to estimate what the current temperature should be - given the average starting temperature of the year we began burning fossil fuels.  People have done so and the calculations are surprisingly accurate in their prediction of current temperatures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment was out in public for anybody to respond to. If you seriously think that&#39;s grounds for theorizing that I&#39;m Onkel_Adolf(Didn&#39;t even realize that was his name, thought you were making a joke off my username) then go ahead and theorize.</p>

<p>Drumpf is a slur against Trump started by Jon Oliver, because Trump called John Stewart by his given name, by digging in his family tree and exclaiming &quot;His ancestors had a different name! This is an excellent retort to him commenting on my buddy hiding his heritage! I&#39;m so clever!&quot;</p>

<p>This document seems to confirm what many have said over the years, but it&#39;s also time we get some real proof of it&#39;s existence, not just an internet article.</p>

<p>I will continue to search, and thus update this comment if anything is found, even better, post it of course, but for the time being, please help me find the original document from a credible source..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, thanks, but it&#39;s not quite what I am looking for. These are words written digitally - what I need, is a proper scan, that&#39;s why I was disappointed by not finding it on CIA&#39;s servers, though I doubt not it is either removed from the archives, or has been moved.</p>

<p>I uploaded a tiny image from the PDF I referred to, but this is too small to pass around - I need something bigger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would people with money invested in the oil industry fund a propaganda campaign that, if successful, would severely limit the use of fossil fuels?  Not only would it stunt the oil/gas industry, it would slow down global economic growth - affecting all industries around the world.  The people in charge seem to want growth at all costs.  Not restrained growth while limiting environmental impacts.  It doesn&#39;t make any sense to me - they don&#39;t profit anything from this &quot;propaganda&quot;.  If you believe that it&#39;s in order to scare people, there are plenty of other ways to do so without affecting their bottom line. </p>
