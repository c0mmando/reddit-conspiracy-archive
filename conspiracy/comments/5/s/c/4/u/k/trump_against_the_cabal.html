<p>If Trump had any intention of getting rid of the &quot;cabal&quot; he would go after the Military Industrial Complex, which is something he is unwilling to do considering he believes Obama didn&#39;t spend enough on your military budget, which is just corporate welfare for the Business Class. But time will tell, but Trump learned from Roy Cohn,  there is no fucking way he will challenge that system, he is going to embrace it.</p>

<p>Yeah, check out the Catholic Dinner him and Hilary attended. Also, yes, I do... Check out the theory of Tri-Sovereign States. </p>

<p>TL;DR. Rome never fell but diversified into three Sovereign territories (The Vatican - Religion, The City of London - Banking, and The District of Columbia - Military). </p>

<p>Most (if not all) ranking MIC brass and Intelligence (CIA,NSA, etc etc) are Jesuits or Jesuit trained. I get a lot of heat, even here, for proposing the theory, but it&#39;s becoming more widely understood...</p>

<li>Holy shit, stop listening to the media.</li>

<p>Reminder:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump has done more in half a year to publicly smear the media than anyone else has managed in decades. The media centers–the news aggregators like Fox and MSNBC–are the primary means of controlling the population. If Trump was controlled opposition, he wouldn’t be taking a massive steaming dump on the Jew’s best and primary means of getting what they want in America. The news networks know nobody watches them anymore and the Democrats and Republicans know that nobody wants to vote for either of them anymore. But they need the people to believe otherwise, because that’s how the Emperor’s New Clothes charade is maintained. People who question or attack the parties and the media machine that promotes them are by definition eroding the Zionist control over America. Trump isn’t controlled opposition. Old videos of him show him holding the same general opinions and political leanings that he does now, and he is directly attacking the things that allow Jewish elites to maintain a stranglehold on Washington.</p>

<p>Recall Tolkien’s works. “I think a servant of the Enemy would look fairer and feel fouler.”</p>

<p>If Trump was controlled opposition, he would superficially appear to be a bad goy, but his policies would all serve Jewish and Israeli interests. The exact opposite of this is true. He superficially appears to be a good goy, but all of his policies are bad for Jews and Israel–or at least, bad for the Jews and Israeli interests who wish to directly control and influence us. He’s not controlled opposition. He’s a Jew-wise bull in a china shop. The worst possible enemy of the establishment. He threatens to break the monopoly of both sides of the aisle. That’s why both parties are attacking him, just like both sides attack the Tea Party because it threatened to wake up the 60% of the US population that doesn’t vote, the vast majority of which are conservatives. Even worse, his mere presence and standing up to the monolithic machine has caused some of the Neocons to start uncucking themselves.</p>

<p>Huckabee has spent the last three decades hiding his power level because he knew it was the only way to get anything done, and now he’s coming out swinging on Trump’s side. We saw something absolutely unprecedented during the GOP debate. We saw the entire Republican lineup shitting on the moderators and their bullshit agenda. Trump has now even called out, on television, the fact that news stations play loops of footage of events and call it “live”. Not only did they immediately stop doing this once he said it, he even got the anchors to agree with him. That has literally never happened before. And who started the fire? Trump did. Does that sound like a good goy to you? If the GOP wants to snub Trump, they’re going to have an internal struggle to manage it–between the people who had given up hope and become part of the machine and those who were willing accomplices. And if they do snub him for someone like Bush or Rubio, they’re going to risk not only a political schism that would split the conservative base between the progressives and the traditionalists, but  also further risk an Independent winning the Presidency, which is the one thing that would spell certain doom for both parties. Because once the people realize an Independent can actually win again, the Emperor’s New Clothes charade is over, the false dichotomy is broken, and the genie can’t ever be put back into the bottle.</p>
