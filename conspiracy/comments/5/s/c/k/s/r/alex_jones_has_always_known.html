    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Which is why many people have a prejudice against him. I stopped watching him for years after I was ridiculed in college for saying people should watch him. Years later I hear Obama and Hillary attacking him and saying Trump listens to him. Feels good now. Every now and then I think back to that embarrassing day where I told my class publicly that there is corruption and weird stuff going on in our government. That day where I was laughed at and &quot;put in my place&quot; to try to fit in with mainstream ideas. There is no feeling like knowing millions of Americans are finally starting to wake up. That millions of global citizens are starting to wake up. </p>
