    <div class="md"><p>Spread your lies as you call people fags? Real smart! Nice how you talk about people who have rights in America our LGBTQ and also someone just because they might be a Trump supporter! Spew your political crap somewhere else. There are many right and left who are woke to the sickness in our government! We want to protect these children and it goes beyond political lines when it comes to coming together for the children. Go watch the George Webb series on YouTube and then come back and play with the woke. </p>

The Pharaoh ordered all the Hebrew first born to be killed, and it was his first born that was killed. I&#39;m creeping death. I wish those shills would creep faster and we could have this place back sooner, but lies die hard. Its easy to convince someone of a lie but infinitely harder to convince them they have been lied to. The term conspiracy theorist is even losing its contrived meaning thankfully. Its not looked at anymore as crazy, and turning into someone just being insightful. This makes me feel warm inside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or they are fake shill accounts by people wanting to drive the shill narrative further</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t (m)any shills, but I often get the feeling that such obvious shill accounts popping up in threads aren&#39;t actually all that genuine in trying to take over a conversation, making a lot of suspicious/poor points in the progress. And because it&#39;s basically always new accounts it&#39;s really easy to do, so why wouldn&#39;t people do it?</p>

<p>Or maybe I just don&#39;t want to believe that so many paid employees are doing such an awful job, generating the polar opposite reaction from people they are paid to create</p>

<p>Being a buddy and being a lawyer are 2 very different things.</p>

<p>Yep, and they were great friends, Donald Trump even spoke on his behalf at his disbarrment hearing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before the appellate division made its ruling in 1986, a host of prominent people testified to Cohn’s good character. Among them was Trump, who had resumed his visits to Cohn and that spring had invited him to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.</p>

<p>“I actually got a kick out of him,” Trump told The Washington Post recently. “Some people didn’t like him, and some people were offended by him. I mean, they would literally leave a dinner. I had one evening where three or four people got up from a table and left the table because they couldn’t stand the mention of his name.” </p>

<p>“I’d go there a lot [Studio 54] with dates and with friends, and with lots of people,” Trump said in an interview. “Roy would always make it very comfortable.”</p>

<p>Cohn represented some of the mafia figures who had sway over Trump projects. S&amp;A Concrete, which supplied building material for the Trump Plaza on Manhattan’s East Side, was owned in part by Salerno, the Genovese family mobster and Cohn client, court records show.</p>

<p>Cohn tapped into the Reagan administration network on Trump’s behalf a short time later, according to a New York Times account. At Trump’s request, Cohn lobbied Edwin Meese III, a senior White House aide, to secure an appointment for Trump’s sister Maryanne Barry, an experienced federal prosecutor in New Jersey, to the U.S. District Court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Powerful people get away with much more than the average Joe. Insulting a billionaire TV star (and let&#39;s face it, shooting down sexual advances is taken as an insult, especially by men like Trump) is not easy to do, someone like Trump could ruin your life, especially if you work somewhere Trump has a lot of influence</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think so</p>

<p>I basically made two points: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shooting down sexual advances from powerful men is seen as an insult </p></li>
<li><p>Powerful men can potentially ruin your life if you insult them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What exactly do you disagree with here? Why do you think it&#39;s stretching it? To me it all seems rather obvious, it basically simply boils down to many people knowing not to piss off powerful people. </p>

<p>Case in point (one of many abuses from the establishment): Mika Brezezinski, the daughter of the powerful Zbigniew Brzezinski, was not even immune to the one of the most influential power players, Hillary, attempting to get her fired for DARING to voice something about dear leader Hillary that was less than flattering.

<p>I wouldn&#39;t have been super surprised if his drug use came out in the election, and I guess I wouldn&#39;t be shocked if it came out now. That said, it seems compelling to me that there&#39;s no accusation of drug use, even as women come forward to accuse him of groping, rape etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, he could have caught wind of an ongoing investigation in 2012 and have tweeted that to cover himself well enough in advance. </p>

<p>But I think along with that tweet there are a few too many things suggesting otherwise.</p>

<p>Like he appointed Jeff Sessions who can be seen here pushing Joe Biden&#39;s hand away and then quickly getting the little girl far away from Biden: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoLHn577xIE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=21m25s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoLHn577xIE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=21m25s</a></p>

<p>There are plenty of creepy Biden CSPAN videos, some with audible audio of him whispering into little girls&#39; ears but otherwise all creepy and full of inappropriate contact if you&#39;re not convinced that guy is a pedo.</p>

<p>Without using the word &quot;racist&quot;, why isn&#39;t Sessions sworn in yet? If FBIAnon told any truth, Sessions was briefed on the investigations weeks ago, to be ready to hit the ground running when he is appointed. </p>

<p>Trump telling Chaffetz to investigate &quot;whatever he wants.&quot; I think he wouldn&#39;t have said that if Trump could be incriminated should Chaffetz decide to look into it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm4-YyPo1Xk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm4-YyPo1Xk</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that everyone he hired has seen/been a part of the entire process of the globalist agenda, and each brings their own plethora of insider information. For example, Rex Tillerson is a major oil guy. When soros, Carlos Slim, and the CF go to topple a country, one of the main goals is to run an oil pipeline right through it. To be a major player in business (billionaire level), there is a certain amount of insider information needed. No one just randomly breaks into the upper echelon. If Trump just hired a bunch of community organizers for his board, he would not have the FBI/CIA level Intel that he needs to topple the regime.</p>

We&#39;re talking about men who have spent their entire lives, building business empires, being involved in politics left and right, dealing with regulation, making deals, making extremely difficult decisions, creating products, innovating, judging market trends... and these people aren&#39;t qualified to do a job that a community organizer had for 8 years? And then you have people like Bernie with absolutely no business or economic sense, who apparently are going to be the savior of the nation. It&#39;s truly laughable.

    <div class="md"><p>I completely understand what you&#39;re saying, but I guess that my point is that these people have a ton of political experience. In order to properly run a major business, you have to constantly rub elbows with politicians. You go to all of the events, you hire lobbyists to pass laws, you buy out judges and congressmen.. I mean, it&#39;s all very intertwined and related. So whether or not trump was running Trump Towers/golf courses or sitting in congress voting on bills 75 days out of the year, the experience is quite similar if not better. Without being inundated by party politics he has been able to brand his own form of politics and beliefs. Definitely a benefit for not being brought up in the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I joined last feb for Bernie, got my old account banned for posting links about how Hillary was stealing the primaries in California and New York. Mods banned me from r/politics and r/s4p, I was so confused. I thought wow I thought these people were with me, until I took a little ride to this sub and realized what the fuck was happening. As a new person to this sub I suggest so many of my friends to look here, the truth hurts at first but I feel relieved to not be a crazy person. </p>

<p>The department of Defense regularly engages in shilling. The problem is, they were shilling in the US before authorized by statute. And they have been shilling against Trump on multiple websites, which is outright treason.</p>

<p>Of the course of the last 8 months or so, law enforcement requested IP addresses of obvious shills under suspicion of violating campaign finance laws or treason against the United States, and they came back to Eglin Air Force Base. Several of these accounts were posting on reddit.</p>

<p>The brass was informed, and they&#39;re going to nail these guys to the fucking wall as part of Trump&#39;s &quot;Drain the Swamp&quot; strategy. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if the officers hang, and possibly the enlisted that were shilling directly against Trump. </p>

<p>These dumfucks at Eglin were shilling against a president that has the support of probably 90% of the general staff of the armed forces of the United States.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not going through everything they have every said to find a falsehood.  I am not saying that media in general is flawless or 100% factual.  Wikileaks can lie by omission. For example they have information that 100 people are pedophiles or whatever,  they can choose to publish information on the 10 people they don&#39;t like or agree with to further their own agenda.  While not factually wrong in any sense, it is amoral and wrong all the same.   I work in statistics and I see it all the time.  Certain people look at data and make conclusions that are indeed factual but frame questions or answers in such a way to get the answers they want.  This is both factual and dishonest.  If you rely on wikileaks and its ilk as your sole source of info you are being lied too just as much.</p>

<p>Wikileaks on the other end, it&#39;s impossible to know because we don&#39;t know what they have. It was already confirmed that they had nothing about the RNC that wasn&#39;t already known. I really don&#39;t buy into the whole &quot;Wikileaks is Russian propaganda&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, assuming their are paid shills here--which is highly, highly debatable--why would they care about anything you say? Why would they get angry?

<p>I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t (m)any shills, but I often get the feeling that such obvious shill accounts popping up in threads aren&#39;t actually all that genuine in trying to take over a conversation, making a lot of suspicious/poor points in the progress. And because it&#39;s basically always new accounts it&#39;s really easy to do, so why wouldn&#39;t people do it?</p>
