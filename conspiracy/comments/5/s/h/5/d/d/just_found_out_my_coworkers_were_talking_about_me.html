<p>That depends entirely on how you classify them as mass shootings or not. I&#39;ve seen analysis by which whites are underrepresented (around 50%) or overrepresented (around 80%), depending on the definition of mass shooter and on how long a time period is surveyed.</p>

<p>Pretty much all analyses point to them being 95-98% male, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depending on how you heard this information you  have a few options.</p>

<p>1- ignore them knowing they are not your friends and leave it at that</p>

<p>2- maybe approach one or all of them with sincerity and let them know you heard this and it hurt your feelings. Many times these things can be quickly resolved and ultimately you can form a better relationship because of it. Have a sense of humor about yourself and the situation and you will be amazed how easily this can be accomplished.</p>

<p>3- talk to HR. Even if it is just for your peace of mind. Get it on record and maybe they can handle this in a group meeting reviewing rules of conduct in the office. There are many ways to accomplish this without singling out the offenders.</p>

<p>4- prove them right. Lock &amp; load! </p>

<p>I&#39;m kidding about option 4. Please don&#39;t do that.</p>

<p>You seem like you are a young professional so i would like to give you some advice. A lot of people in this world are jerks. They talk shit. They start rumors. They sabotage your hard work. They exist everywhere so there really is no avoiding them. </p>

<p>Keep your head down and do your work to the best of your abilities. Make friends when you can and always treat other with respect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this, and think you should do all of the above, minus 4 of course haha. It covers every angle. Most importantly though, is number 2. You have to be assertive, and stand up for yourself and use tact while doing so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s more so about the general stereotype that white males are going to go on shooting sprees.&quot; It sounds like maybe you&#39;re placing too much thought into loose office talk. I mean, if they sincerely believe that you are going to carry out a mass shooting at the office, they would probably tell someone (law enforcement, human resources, management, etc.)</p>

<p>&quot;The mainstream media has now personally effected my life because of the toxic bullshit they spew, and the masses ignorant blind belief in them.&quot; Preach it! Now you know how I&#39;ve felt for the last three years! And I&#39;m not a Donald Trump supporter! </p>

<p>&quot;Im just saying the way our culture is shifting could be a conspiracy, in the way that MSMs agenda is showing itself in the docile public now.&quot; One night in August 2014, as news of Ferguson and police brutality was still fresh in people&#39;s minds, I had a brief run in with a county sheriff&#39;s deputy after I&#39;d apparently been suspected of breaking into a closed gas station that was right down the street from me. Once it was obvious to the law enforcement person that I was simply out for a walk that night, and that I wasn&#39;t breaking into the gas station, I told them &quot;am I being detained, or am I free to go?&quot; The officer then asked me if I was saying that because I had any warrants. I then replied to them &quot;no! I simply don&#39;t want to waste your time!&quot; I then walked on home, while the officer drove away into the night. </p>

<p>Completely innocent, seemingly non-controversial, Constitutional encounter with local law enforcement personnel, right?? </p>

<p>When I shared what I imagined would be an innocent story of &quot;so this happened to me last night&quot; story with family, the next day, my father, a bit of a Fox News addict at the time, went into something of a psychotic tirade after I told him the part about how I told the officer &quot;am I free to go!&quot; My own father, at the time, was convinced that his own son was some sort of crazed cop killer, because to the people on Fox News he listened to, anyone who dared exercise their Constitutional rights when encountering law enforcement was someone who was out to kill cops..... all because I asked a sheriff&#39;s deputy &quot;am I free to go!!!&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell that to <a href="/u/deathcabforben">/u/deathcabforben</a> lol yeah I just overheard it today and decided to post it here as an example of TPTB&#39;s social effect on our lives. They pushed this narrative, now people think I&#39;m going to go on a shooting spree simply cause I&#39;m a young white male. But yeah I&#39;m just gonna forget about it. I get that they&#39;re just joking around, and they joke around about other stereotypes, asian, blacks etc.. But I go silent when they say that stuff because Im the only white person at work. It&#39;s like when a black person says nigga it&#39;s fine, but when a white guy says it they could be fired for it.</p>

<p>On a serious note, don&#39;t listen to what people say behind your back. They are usually doing it out of jealousy or personal insecurities. I&#39;ve long stopped caring what people say behind my back and now I joke about myself with them.
