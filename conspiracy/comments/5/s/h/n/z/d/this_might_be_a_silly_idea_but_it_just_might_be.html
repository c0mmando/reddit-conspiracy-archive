<p>I believe humans are much more powerful than we think. I truly do think we have some kind of divine spark within us all. What if we can literally change the world with our thoughts alone? Who knows how much power intent has?</p>

<p>Now this is going to sound silly, but what if we could choose a time where every user <strong>vividly</strong> imagines Pizzagate getting exposed. I mean pure intent, pure thought, pure imagination. All at the same time, zeroing in on a single thought. As I said, who knows how this world works? Not me, but the elites probably do, which is perhaps why some believe that 9/11 was a ritual of sorts. I truly believe the power of intent may be extremely powerful.</p>

<p>Anyone down?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This &#39;perception shapes reality&#39; concept is being perverted and misunderstood, I think.  The world isn&#39;t magic - you can&#39;t just think it and it will change; you have to take action.</p>

<p>The meaning of the concept is that things can&#39;t change until enough people realize that things don&#39;t have to be the way that they are.  There are ideas for technology, like orbital ring space elevators, that would totally change the world for the better and the technology is achievable right now.  The problem?  Not enough people are screaming for it.</p>

<p>If there was technology available that would eliminate the need for taxes and all the conflicts we engage in over oil, would you protest for it?  Would you revolt against your  regime for it and encourage others to do the same?  </p>

<p>The tech is already possible.  When you consider the possibilities, pizzagate is just another problem in one major deception that you consider and accept to be your reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s already happening. Conspiracy is a pool for this right now. Consciously we dip into that energy and it&#39;s in our perception. It&#39;s running it&#39;s course.</p>

<p>If you personally, or any one else wants to amplify a thought, use crystals. Amethyst, specifically. It&#39;s has the quality to amplify and direct energy. This is all on my sub r/Shift_Army If anyone is interested in knowledge of consciousness and would like to discuss more about how perception works, How mental energy can be focused.</p>

<p>But again, collectively more and more the awareness of pizza gate builds intensity. Already it&#39;s affecting the nation. Everyone of us ripples thoughts outward, it effects,Butterfly effect, a drop in the ocean.  If you really want to know not only does the thought ripple into the world and conscious minds of others, it also ripples through time. All the past stuff about pedophiles in power start to come to light.</p>

<p>But the thing is, it&#39;s done in increments. We would overwhelm ourselves if it all happened at once.  But yes it&#39;s running it&#39;s course ,gaining awareness. It&#39;s working. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It already is, my friend. The first couple of months of pizzagate I was having my doubts, but as more and more info came out I made up my mind that it was real. Now a lot of people know its real. I dont even bother with people who are deniers.So, the question about mass arrests? I had my doubts about those for a long time also, but after the Joe Rogan Alex Jones podcast and  the subsequent &quot;change&quot; in the environment; DHS Human traficking film with pizzaplace, the FBI Vaults, the Wiener case, the 31 kids rescued yesterday in Haiti, its coming down. Im strong in my faith that justice will be served, dont you doubt it for a second that it will be. Our thoughts have those powers and I believe we are seeing the frutitions of that these days. What an epic time to be alive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The power of joint investigations and common sense will be what exposes it — if it&#39;s true. If the system won&#39;t do it then the people will, the seed has been planted. The trick is to sift through the bullshit (of the conspiracy nuts) and misdirection (by the establishment).</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what you believe, what matters is why you believe it. There is no evidence that we are anything more than animals on this planet, albeit intelligent, self aware animals. You are free to believe what you want, but just remember truth is not a prerequisite for belief, so beliefs are never a great indicator of anything other than potentially interesting discussions. Without evidence that is all they will ever be.</p>
