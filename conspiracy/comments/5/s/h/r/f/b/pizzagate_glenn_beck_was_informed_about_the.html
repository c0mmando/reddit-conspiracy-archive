<p>So the timing, location, and number of kids were right. He tweeted about it before it happened. Why?</p>

<p>Was he warning his friends? Was he bragging? Will he participate in taking down the pedophiles?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would adsume he&#39;s looking for a home.  He is notorious for this kind if stuff. An example off the top of ny head, he was a Ron Paul supporter at one time, then came out and basically said if you support Paul, you&#39;re a domestic terrorist.  Totally alienated his base and slowly disappeared.   More recently he went back to the right wing main stream, but then he bashes Trump an once again insulted his base.  I&#39;ve been wondering if he was going try and pull an Alex Jones (during the Bush years) and try to get the conspiracy world to listen... Unfortunately a lot of the Ron Paul supporters back then were part of the conspiracy world.  That&#39;s been my take on him, the fact he had inside info is suspicious, and that&#39;s mainly because who would tell Beck anything at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he has been chosen, by the major players involved, to be a dealer of red herrings. </p>

<p>A questionable background of his own, he&#39;s obviously in the loop. He&#39;s got a secret source in the know involved in the trafficking. You might ask whether the source is on the authorities &quot;side&quot;,  or the pedophile traffickers &quot;side&quot;. I remind you that there is likely a lot of overlap between those &quot;sides&quot;.</p>

<p>True LEOs about to bust that case would never be happy with someone leaking a massive record-breaking bust. Beck will have done it with no consequence. Why will LEO not pursue it? Because there was a massive heads up given. All of the high level, high power participants were allowed to withdraw from and cut ties with the group found guilty. For those &#39;in the know&#39;, this thing was expected. LEO knows that many people know, therefore beck can leak it with no hesitation. They all knew that everyone already knew. </p>

<p>After establishing that Beck has some level of involvement or source of insider information, it is easy to plot his course for the future. </p>

<p>He is inside. He will be a mouthpiece for the establishment. The people arrested today were limited hangout. Possible that some aren&#39;t even involved, just patsies with enough information to be indicated on an open / closed case. </p>

<p>Beck will continue the crusade as the mainstream guy who follows all of the sex trafficking stuff. But he is a plant. A false facade, a smokescreen, a limited hangout. He will NOT be truly pursuing any investigation. He is the red herring PR guy for high level offenders of pg. </p>

<p>Project Underground Railroad is a Mormon group of former Navy Seals that operates stings on sex traffickers. </p>

<p>However, George Webb believes they are suspect (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMZ4mZ4KA7w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMZ4mZ4KA7w</a>). Start at 12 minutes.

    <div class="md"><p>So how do your above-average logic and reasoning skills explain Alefantis&#39; Instagram post, the restaurant frescoes, or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIro">overt mention</a> of sex with children during artistic performances at his restaurant?</p>

<p>And if Alefantis is indeed innocent, do you deny the possibility there&#39;s a larger child abuse problem in DC, as <a href="https://archive.is/B1cpw">we suspect there is one in Hollywood</a>, and that the Podesta dumps may reflect that phenomenon?</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/MrsGu#selection-2025.17-2025.25">This was the top post</a> on r/pizzagate when it got banned. Note the OP isn&#39;t about presuming anyone&#39;s guilt, but rather arguing for the legitimacy of the investigation. Do you disagree with this?</p>

<p>Lastly, how do you <a href="https://archive.is/o/MrsGu/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736">personally interpret this email</a>? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes no sense to announce one&#39;s criminality and expect to remain unpunished, even if one did not expect the authorities to react, why call attention to oneself in such a way and make oneself the target of vigilante justice? No, clearly Alefantis understood he was doing nothing illegal but did not foresee (how could he) that his innocent antics would be used to manipulate and arouse brainwashed unsophisticates.  </p>

<p>As for this statement, the tone strikes me as uber-yuppy (pardon the pun). You&#39;ll notice the children all appear to be siblings with an Italian surname (Podesta, of course, is himself of Italian descent), the tonal and literal information combine to give a picture of bourgeois Italian-Americans discussing their friends&#39; children with pride and appreciation, as though the children were endearingly smaller yet already highly mentally mature versions of their own adult bourgeois selves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats some superior level logic skills there bro, do you have children? have you been around italian children? have you been around their parents as they talk about their children?<br/>
your line of reasoning is retarded, regardless if alefiantis is guilty of these things or not, <strong>that</strong> specific logical progression is absolutely disjointed.  </p>

<p>nobody talks about their child as entertainment for an adult, its usually the other way around, the child is entertained by the adult.   </p>

<p>thats just one break in your superior logic skills</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay mr logic, now stepping around the argument with quotes from random sources.  </p>

<p>but i will bite.<br/>
given all the data, and all evidence (jimmy saville, queen having a child sex warrant, norway pizzagate, feb1st arrests, anthony weiner having charges weighed etc...) i think its more nonsensical to believe this shit isnt happening and that the pizza store was nothing special<br/>
i really dont have a horse in the race other than not wanting children to be abused by a systemic conspiracy  </p>

<p>at best, the pizza place had questionable judgement on its advertised &quot;all ages&quot; shows, and at best the politicians would have to be retarded to not notice the weird shit, or care.<br/>
at worst. well, they are raping and killing little kids jimmy saville style  </p>

<p>might as well assume the negative to prove it positive; but in this case, people who are organizing and researching are getting shut down.<br/>
whats the next sensible step?  </p>

but to say you know all about the age/sex laws is probably disingenuous, i was just being honest. youre using that as some sort of pedestal to stand on to act superior without addressing the actual argument.<br/>
pedophile is someone who is sexually attracted to humans under the legal age of consent. that is what i was saying.  </p>

<p>so in the USA apparently after doing some google fu, its 16 as the lowest age in the states  </p>

in some states that could be a 16 or 17 year old</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So how do your above-average logic and reasoning skills explain Alefantis&#39; Instagram post, the restaurant frescoes, or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIro">overt mention</a> of sex with children during artistic performances at his restaurant?</p>

<p>And if Alefantis is indeed innocent, do you deny the possibility there&#39;s a larger child abuse problem in DC, as <a href="https://archive.is/B1cpw">we suspect there is one in Hollywood</a>, and that the Podesta dumps may reflect that phenomenon?</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/MrsGu#selection-2025.17-2025.25">This was the top post</a> on r/pizzagate when it got banned. Note the OP isn&#39;t about presuming anyone&#39;s guilt, but rather arguing for the legitimacy of the investigation. Do you disagree with this?</p>

<p>Lastly, how do you <a href="https://archive.is/o/MrsGu/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736">personally interpret this email</a>? </p>

<p>We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.</p>

<p>Thank you for kindly taking the time for this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so all those politicians that are and were caught fucking children, they are just an anomaly ? surely you didnt take those people into consideration when you made that statement  </p>

<p>again, solid superior logic right there.<br/>
because you talk about children as entertainment for adults, you are therefore rich and privileged?<br/>
dude just stop hahahahahah</p>
