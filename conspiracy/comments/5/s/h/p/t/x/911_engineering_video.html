        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was a mechanical engineering major the year the towers fell.  A short time later, they called us into a room and played a high quality video explaining all the engineering behind why the towers fell.  The math behind the fire insulation being burnt off and the temperatures and forces.  Everything made perfect sense.  There was even an interview with the head engineer behind the building.  He cried as he explained that he could have built the building to withstand that size of plane crash, but they didn&#39;t see any reason why a plane that size would fly that low, so they just made the building strong enough to withstand a smaller plane.</p>

<p>For years I laughed at conspiracy idiots because I was a smart engineer and I knew all the math and could explain every argument.  That doc &quot;loose change&quot; was a total joke and all their assumptions were totally off...</p>

<p>But then I thought... how did they put that high quality video together so fast?  It was so soon after the towers fell.  And why were engineering students forced to watch it?  And I never went and checked the numbers, I just took what they told me for granted.  </p>

<p>Did anyone else watch that video?  Do they still show it to engineering students?</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Skilling">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Skilling</a>
&quot;John Skilling (October 8, 1921 in Los Angeles, California – March 5, 1998 in Seattle, Washington) was a civil engineer and architect, best known for being the chief structural engineer of the World Trade Center&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Skilling">https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Skilling</a>
&quot;John Skilling, American structural and civil engineer whose firm, Skilling Ward Magnusson Barkshire, designed over 1,000 buildings in 36 states and 27 countries; among his best-known work was the 110-story twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City (b. Oct. 8, 1921, Los Angeles, Calif.--d. March 5, 1998, Seattle, Wash.).&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html</a>
&quot;John Skilling was the head structural engineer for the World Trade Center. In a 1993 interview, Skilling stated that the Towers were designed to withstand the impact and fires resulting from the collision of a large jetliner such as Boeing 707 or Douglas DC-8.&quot;</p>

<p>Robertson WAS NOT the lead engineer on it. That is bullshit that is put out to give the BS that he talks credence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>John Skilling was the lead engineer on the twin towers. Leslie Robertson worked on the project, sure. But John Skilling was the guy that designed and built them, not Robertson. 
This is a very sly piece of manipulation by the establishment to tout Robertson as &quot;the man who designed the towers&quot;. He designed the viscoelastic dampers and suchlike, and was involved, but the fact remains that Skilling was the lead structural engineer on the project. This manipulation is there so that for example, Robertson can make out as if the towers were tested for impact of a 707 but not for the resultant fire that would inevitably follow. 
If you look at that particular claim, it was made by Skilling, who also mentioned the fires that would ensue, and that they would not affect the towers enough to bother them at all. When you listen to Robertson, he claims that there was no account taken of the fires that would follow a jetliner hit, which is just nonsense.
It is a very crafty and sly piece of disinformation that Robertson was the &quot;lead engineer&quot; or &quot;the man who designed the towers&quot;. It allows the real claim and analysis that was made by Skilling, to be set aside and for Robertson to almost accept responsibility for the failure of the towers on behalf of the designers.
I often wonder how Skilling&#39;s family must feel when they hear Robertson falsely take the credit for the design, and at the same time infer that the design was responsible for the failure. 
It is a very subtle, and very telling piece of manipulation.
&quot;City in the Sky&quot; is an incredible read, you would enjoy it immensely, I am sure. 
&quot;Twin Towers: The Life of New York City&#39;s World Trade Center&quot; by Gillespie is also out there somewhere for free I am sure.
Very telling that you will only ever find references to RObertson being the man who designed these towers post 911, yet everywhere pre 911, Skilling is rightly said to be the designer. 
Hope that helps - (personal bugbear of mine)  </p>

<p>Okay, I get it now. John Skilling was the lead engineer on the twin towers. They just called it Robertson because he was around to blame it on the fires and give teary-eyed interviews and presentations, such as the one OP saw, possibly. </p>

<p>I know, I know. It has the telegram Richard Roth wrote to Lawrence Wien :) But I just got &quot;Building - The Fight Against Gravity&quot; by Mario Salvadori in the mail, a beautiful copy withdrawn from the Atlantic County Library, Pleasantville Branch. Why that, you ask? Because he also wrote &quot;Why Buildings stand up&quot;, and, together with Matthys Levy, &quot;Why Buildings Fall Down&quot;, then he died, then the Twins fell, and then Levy squeezed in another chapter about the Twins in a 2002 re-edition and said jet fuel can melt steel beams. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The video had mathematical explanations for everything including why it fell straight down.  It all made perfect sense if the math was right.  The thing we as students never thought to double check was the parameters they gave us.  For instance the melting point of the beams was given.  The burning temp of the fire retardant foam, the weight of the buildings above the floor on fire.  The force a single floor could withstand, etc.  it all worked out with the numbers they gave us and made total sense that the building would fall exactly as it did</p>

<p>If the towers were destroyed by other means than the jet impacts, then you&#39;re in a unique position to expose the most treacherous crime in American history but are failing to do so, and thus become complicit.</p>

<p>If the plane impacts were the cause of the total destruction of both towers, and the indirect cause of the destruction of WTC7, then you&#39;ve abandoned your responsibility to protect the public who use your buildings. Three of the most spectacular and deadly engineering disasters in history, all on the same day, and you, the professionals, think it&#39;s OK that the investigations into these events couldn&#39;t even muster a statistically significant sample of physical evidence or describe what actually even happened to the towers? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. When you mention that they were built with jet impacts in mind, people say, &quot;well, the Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable!&quot;</p>

<p>But the Titanic <em>sank</em>. That is a perfectly normal and predictable thing for a damaged ship to do. Meanwhile, blowing to smithereens all of a sudden is not something that damaged, burning buildings tend to do.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people get hung up on the question of whether or not it&#39;s possible for a jet to knock down one of the Twin Towers...without actually <em>looking</em> at what actually <em>happened</em>!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, actually it is that easy, it is something that you can look at the video and easily tell what&#39;s going on. The buildings literally blew up. The steel structure was completely cut into pieces while the concrete and people and office furniture fell over the city like volcanic ash. </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to compliment engineers. I love you people. That&#39;s why I can&#39;t believe you built buildings so shitty where tens of thousands of people came to work for decades thinking the buildings were safe, but then when push came to shove, they got cremated alive.</p>

<p>Look at it this way. Think about using a sledgehammer to smash a big block of concrete into small pieces. Then smash those small pieces into fine dust. That would take a lot of energy, right? Wouldn&#39;t it tire you out? </p>

<p>Now look at the video and watch the building turn into steel sections and clouds of fine powder. The clouds indicate that lots of energy is being released really fast. (Even Governor Pataki said that all the concrete was pulverized).</p>

<p>Remember that the total energy in the system is constant. Many people try to say that the top section - the lightest and least dense part of the building - had sufficient potential energy to crush and destroy the bigger, heavier section of the building.</p>

<p>But even the official report acknowledges that the building came down &quot;essentially in free fall&quot;, which means that pretty much all of its potential energy would be converted to kinetic energy even if it were just falling through the air. There is little to none left to move a 90-story building out of the way, let alone crush it into powder.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s clear just from the video that a huge amount of energy is missing from the equation. Explosives of some kind can easily fill the gap. Not only that, explosives theory predicts the total destruction and is consistent with all the observations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there is no predictive, consistent, evidence-based theory of how the towers could have been destroyed without the addition of an energy source like explosives. NIST spent years and millions of dollars trying to come up with one, and failed. In fact, they didn&#39;t even try to explain how the towers were completely destroyed and admitted they couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Since it&#39;s obviously true that explosives can destroy buildings and can account for the energy release observed during the destruction, and that the theory is consistent with all the evidence, there&#39;s absolutely no scientific or logical reason to prefer the alternative incoherent non-theory.</p>

<p>And if you really insist that the Twin Towers were engineered so shitty that they violently blew up into clouds of dust instead of surviving a plane crash like they were supposed to, and no engineer noticed or spoke up about this extraordinarily lethal vulnerability for thirty years, then I have no reason to trust the credibility of an engineer&#39;s opinion in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How did they fall? Where did the energy come from to completely dismember the steel structure and pulverize the concrete, office contents and people? What &quot;makes sense&quot; is totally irrelevant. I know for a fact that you have no precedent, experiment or physical evidence.</p>

<p>From an engineering perspective, skyscrapers don&#39;t just collapse unless they have explosives in them. Skyscrapers have caught on fire hundreds of thousands of times, been hit by planes, bombed, hit by artillery shells, etc. And yet, a normal skyscraper collapse is still a controlled demolition.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s your theory, and what are the good scientific reasons to accept it? How can it collapse at free fall and simultaneously totally dismember the steel structure and pulverize all the concrete and everything inside? Where does the energy come from? </p>

<p>Thousands of people were murdered. Your theory also has to explain why their bodies were destroyed and how bone fragments from firefighters found on the roof of the next skyscraper. Again, explosives explains all this very easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, if it&#39;s so easy to see, how do you explain the thousands of engineers who&#39;ve seen the video and it doesn&#39;t look questionable to them?  Like I said, I&#39;m open to the idea of an inside job.  But to my eye, I don&#39;t see any red flags purely from the video.  The force of the few floors above look to be enough to cause that type of damage.  Again, it&#39;s possible for the math to check out and explain exactly how it fell as it did.  But, it&#39;s also possible that the info given out was a lie.  The blue prints, the specific steal they said they used, etc.  if I were taking on the task of proving it was explosives, I&#39;d want to disprove mathematically that it fell how it did.  But I&#39;d have to actually go research all the facts that were presented to us in school.  There are a crazy amount of variables.</p>

<p>There are thousands of architects and engineers who have put their career on the line, this being <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/gallery/evidence.html">Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth, (AE911Truth)</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 9/11, however, independent researchers around the world have assembled a large body of evidence that overwhelmingly refutes the notion that airplane impacts and fires caused the destruction of the Twin Towers and WTC 7. This body of evidence, most of which FEMA and NIST omitted from their reports, instead supports the troubling conclusion that all three skyscrapers were destroyed in a process known as “controlled demolition,” where explosives and/or other devices are used to bring down a building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whereas there isn&#39;t a single credentialed building professional that has taken up the 9/11 Debate Challenge — an opportunity to publicly endorse the National Construction Safety Team Act Report 1A (NCSTAR 1A), titled Final Report on the Collapse of the World Trade Center Building 7 (WTC 7) and published in November 2008 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), with a thousands dollars to be given to a charity of there choosing, bit odd no?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But to my eye, I don&#39;t see any red flags purely from the video...Again, it&#39;s possible for the math to check out and explain exactly how it fell as it did</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leaving WTC1&amp;2 aside for a moment, even though Newton&#39;s Third Law tells us that when objects interact they exert equal and opposite forces between them and there is no math available to explain the complete destruction of these building outside of controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Have you seen the  demolition of WTC7? (click for a compilation)](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxl06jxfgRk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxl06jxfgRk</a>) not only does this building look like every other building in history that has completely collapsed via the mechanism of controlled demolition, this building went into literal freefall, think about that.</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles, you either agree with this basic concept or disbelieve science., they want us to believe that dropping a brick from WTC7&#39;s roof and the complete collapse all the way to the ground, both would hit the floor at the same time.</p>

<p>That is absurd.</p>
