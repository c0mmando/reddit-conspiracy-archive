        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What the fuck happened earlier?!</p>

<p>There was a post stating that hillary clinton was being arrested as she was fleeing the country for pedophilia and it got shot straight to the top and even made it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>!  nevermind the fact that it was barely sourced, and the sources it did use were possibly the flimsiest i have ever seen.</p>

<p>we need to face some facts here regarding pizzagate:</p>

<p>1)its gotten out of hand.  its everywhere.  and worst of all, its not even true.  all you have are a bunch of creepy images and other subjective nonsense.  no bodies.  no families coming forward and pointing fingers.  no victims saying &quot;yeah you guys are totally right.&quot;  nothing.  </p>

<p>2) we need to face the very really possibility that this whole pizzagate debacle is, in fact, manipulation of western sub culture by a state actor, quite possibly russia.  i know for many of you this will be a hard pill to swallow, but its worth taking a look at.</p>

<p>3) the majority of this sub think pizzagate is false and its the overflow from the_donald that keep posting about it and upvoting posts about it.  this many not be 100%, but it is for sure a majority.  </p>

<p>my friends, we have been hoodwinked.  we were led down a false path by a state actor and many of us found ourselves believing the lies.  now its hard to turn back, but the truth is the very same type of powers we oppose played our little communities like a fiddle.  </p>

<p>we need to turn back and reclaim our identity.   stop with the partisan bullshit.  yes there are pedophiles all over the world, but you dont have to be a democrat to be one.  and every time you post some ignorant bullshit about pizzagate, youre doing the propaganda machines work for it.</p>

<p>we should inspect, with a critical eye, those who push the very partisan pizzagate narrative.  these people are our enemies.  many of them are regular people who have forgotten who they are.  these poor souls are begging for the right information to being them back to reality.  as for the rest of the pizzagate camp, they are mostly propaganda peddlers.</p>

<p>it seems ironic to me that the same people who scream about some poster being CTR or call everyone and their mother a shill, somehow have never bothered to stop and think that just maybe ITS NOT JUST DEMOCRATS THAT USE PAID SHILLS!  in fact, its not just america that uses shills.  we all know that russia is hard at work manipulating media all over the world.  but for some reason, nobody thinks it happens here, but pizzagate is a great example of how it does.</p>

<p>tl&#39;dr: weve all been tricked by russia or somone and pizzagate is how they did it, so cut the pizzagate shit out.</p>

<p>SPEZ: ok, i dont know what is happening now or how it relates to this post, but now this sub is being bombarded with stories about how X number of pedophiles are being arrested here and there.  as i said, i dont know how this relates but it seems like it should.  it might not, but i doubt this is just a coincidence.  something fishy is going on here.  what is this subs sudden fascination with pedos!?  it was NEVER this way before.  NEVER!   </p>

<p>bullshittery is afoot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea he&#39;s right guys. Pedophelia is for white trailer park pirates only. There probably isn&#39;t a worldwide elite child trafficking ring (since you&#39;d have to be that rich to partake in it anyways). They just love naked child art and joking about it blatantly on social media. The kid sized coffins and stuff is just for decoration. And really, CPP pizza is just so fucking good the guy is literally untouchable on probably on everyone&#39;s speed dial. So much so that major news networks bring him on just to soft ball him questions. /s </p>

More established progressives wine and dine next door at Alefantis-owned Buck&#39;s Fishing Camping. Alefantis is also the board president of Transformer, the contemporary art gallery that shamed the Smithsonian for removing an installation offensive to right-wingers. When it comes to D.C. radical chic, Alefantis is unsurpassed. If you don&#39;t know him, you aren&#39;t wearing your scarf right.&quot;  much scary </p>

<p>you know, i had really hoped to avoid that.  like, yeah i want the truth in all matters.  especially this one.  but i was afraid i would go too far down the rabbit hole and like.....either find out something very unpleasant and not be able to recover or......like....find out something im not meant to know and me or my family end up paying for it.  that would destroy me, so im actively trying not to do that if possible.</p>

<p>I agree, with the posts yesterday, using &quot;the globe&quot; as a credible source is very weak, but you can&#39;t deny the recent increase of arrests involving trafficking rings lately. Maybe it seems like a increase because everyone is focused on it? </p>

<p>well, the strength and scope of the pizzagate phenomenon leads me to believe that a state actor is involved, yes.  im not saying that russia or whoever started this whole thing from beginning to end.  i believe it is more likely that they saw an opportunity at the right time and capitalized on it masterfully.  </p>

<p>look at what is happening across the globe!   globalists are being pushed out, which normally is good.  but they are being replaced by nationalists.  trump, duerte, the national front in france just to name a few.  and then we have brexit, possible calexit, middle eastern migrants causing problems for the EU.  </p>

<p>youre here and replying to me, so i know youre aware of conspiracies.  is it so hard to believe that we are in the middle of another conspiracy but its the opposite end of the spectrum that we are used to?  some nationalism is good, but too much causes what amounts to tribal conflict on a world scale.  that is what we are going to see if this shit keeps up.  pizzagate is a small part of all of this.  destabilization is the name of the game here.  pizzagate was a small cog in the giant machine that got america to turn its back on its (admittedly shitty)globalist leaders and instead embrace hardline nationalism.  </p>

<p>and for the record, its not that whoever is behind all this is engineering this all from scratch.  they just fanned the flames.  people were already pissed off as it was, all it took was some fake news, money in the right places and exceptionally weak leaders.  for gods sakes, calexit already has what amounts to an embassy and ITS IN FUCKING RUSSIA OF ALL PLACES!</p>

<p>truthfully, i dont know for sure that it IS russia, but they do stand to gain a lot from all this.  in my mind, its probably not just russia, but several state actors doing to us and the rest of the world what the CIA has been doing to them all these decades.</p>

<p>it&#39;s established fact that pedophile rings exist and are more pervasive than the general public is comfortable facing. what better way to justify not facing it than throwing in a misinfo campaign that makes sense to the initiated (those who know about the rings) and that seems like a nutjob magnet to the uninitiated (those who would rather not know). people who <em>are</em> interested in the truth hyperfocusing on D.C. and pizza shops and pasta and whatever tf is precisely what is hiding the majority of perpetrators, in plain sight. </p>

<p>correct.  its no secret large human trafficking rings exist, many of them including children.  but a pizza place in DC is not the nexus of it all and its not all about devil worship, it has more to do with money and people just being sick in their souls.</p>

<p>[<em>Pizzagate is</em>] manipulation of Western subculture by a state actor, possibly Russia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another elephant in the room:  jumping to conclusions without <em>listing all the options</em>.  Pizzagaters do this.  Anti-Pizzagaters do this.</p>

<p>Here are a list of <em>overlooked options</em> besides <em>&quot;Pizzagate is real&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;Pizzagate is fake&quot;</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pizzagate is a set-up by domestic assets within intelligence agencies purely as an anti-Clinton operation.  Podesta could be a real pedophile but a weak &amp; blackmailed one, or a pedophile plant in a long game.  Pizzagaters for some reason don&#39;t believe that total panopticon surveillance is a fact, that Binney was telling the truth, that NSA and FBI already had all Podesta&#39;s &amp; HRC&#39;s e-mails.</p></li>
<li><p>Pizzagate is a set-up by domestic assets within intelligence agencies NOT purely as an anti-Clinton operation, but as an anti-factional operation that the Clintons (or only one of them since they may not both be spooks) are only a small part of.</p></li>
<li><p>Pizzagate is a real front for human trafficking but is a minor league threat to major league players.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/37b2p7/in_1865_there_was_no_verification_that_freed/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=user&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=frontpage">*As I wrote in 2015 on Reddit, when Reddit did not give any fuck about pedophiles,</a> human trafficking is analog (or anachronistic) when you can just breed your own children.</p></li>
<li><p>Pizzagate is a set-up to <em>control</em> and not fully expose certain players or insiders, which may include Trump as well as Clinton(s).  This set-up could be domestic or foreign state-sponsored (Israel, Russia) or what Peter Dale Scott calls an international &quot;metagroup&quot; within intelligence agencies <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=safari_club_1">like the Safari Club</a> or the &quot;Underground Reich&quot;.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg of overlooked possibilities.</p>

<p>Franklin Scandal victims claim that the epicenter of the U.S. political pedophile ring is based at Fort Offutt.  And that it&#39;s international, i.e. NATO.</p>

<p>Yet Pizzagaters don&#39;t give a fuck.  They insist that the epicenter is a local pizza shop.</p>

<p>The implications of NATO running the REAL political pedo-ring would affect OP&#39;s &quot;Russia Did It&quot; theory.</p>

<p>But whether the real story is NATO pedos-vs.-FSB pedos, or FSB pedos infiltrating NATO pedos or vice-versa, with the already-acknowledged existence of Safari Clubs (or Underground Reich) somewhere in the midst, Pizzagaters are not able to admit ambiguity or alternative possibilities.</p>

<p>Even worse are the knee-jerk Clinton-haters who are only interested in Pizzagate as a vehicle to exorcize their own private demons.  These are the enablers of spooks posing as Clinton-haters to use Pizzagate as an engine of manipulation, not merely of the masses, but of the current White House or Kremlin.  Especially if Pizzagate is a set-up that is meant to look fake (which it does) but will later break as a <em>deus ex machina</em> with actual victims, which are easy enough for intel agencies to manufacture, which answers the conspicuous question:  Why haven&#39;t spooks manufactured victims yet to fully exploit this opportunity?</p>

<p>exactly.  one of my biggest problems.  where are the victims?  their families?  their remains?  but no pizzagater want to address this or bring it up.</p>

<p>and ill admit that the picture i have painted is a bit one sided.  the thought that communities like this one created material that we were then tricked with is disturbing and seems like it would be a lofty goal for anyone to achieve the way it has effected our subculture.  </p>

<p>however, ill freely admit it is possible that some element in our own govt, possibly even a rogue element, has concocted all of this.  why?  i dont know.  im just admitting its possible.  but my question is, if that is the case, what is the end game?  or was there an end game and it was cut off?  were the parties responsible for pizzagate defeated somehow?  where was all this supposed to go if that is the case?</p>

<p>at any rate, i do not believe pizzagate is what it seems, but i DO believe it has had the intended effect which is dividing, distracting and destroying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even consider myself a real Pizzagater, but that&#39;s just it, a real Pizzagater does NOT believe a pizza place in DC is the epicenter. And for you to think that&#39;s the actual meat of the conspiracy tells me you&#39;ve been slopping up that MSM spin. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s 100% true, but it&#39;s the media that is claiming that the conspiracy theory is solely that Clinton is running a pedo ring out of a DC pizza shop. Of course that&#39;s absurd, and that manipulation, while leaving out context, is by design. It makes it easy for people unaware of the theory to outright dismiss it, and it makes people that are compelled to investigate it look crazy. But anyone who has done any real digging into the information and circumstances is claiming that if it is real, it&#39;s happening on a larger scale and with many officials involved. That is also not unheard of since there are plenty of pedophilia related investigations in governments from around the world. There have even been busts in the Pentagon. Let&#39;s not forget to mention the Vatican. </p>

<p>Basically, you fundamentally misunderstand the claims Pizzagaters are making if you think that&#39;s what it&#39;s about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re outright denying that the $4+ billion a year global sex trafficking industry couldn&#39;t possibly have have any state involvement whatsoever and any suspicion of the sort should be discouraged and ridiculed?</p>

<p>I get it, the angle of Pizzagate is gullible and simplistic. Focusing on some fucky pizza shop is not going to address any possible issue and it keeps it from the core issue being taken seriously: human sex trafficking on a mass scale. </p>

<p>The pizzagate obsession of a specific pizza shop and the small crowd surrounding it should be scrapped and the whole issue needs to be reexamined from the ground up focusing on big picture corruption in governments and positions of power that are linked to this industry. </p>

<p>Even if pizzagate has some validity to it, at best it&#39;s a small loose thread in a much larger tapestry. I think it more likely that PG has been used as a psyop/propaganda campaign to make it all already be perceived as silly when and if anything damning about sex trafficking does come to light. </p>

<p>I know there are too many variables to settle on a set position in regards to the reality of what may or may not be happening. What I think is most important though is that we accept that there is a tier of civilization/society far above and beyond our perception of how the world works and &quot;normal&quot; people behave. Once you come to understand that and then start to see the interconnectivity between events and agendas throughout history and today, it&#39;s more than plausible to see how easy and probable the management of the global sex trafficking industry is for those at the top that wish to dip into that market and position of power. </p>

<p>Podesta, Alefantis, etc., if involved, would be small fish at best. Surely no one actually believes that these people are at the center of child abuse and trafficking when it can be traced to much bigger players and has been in practice for millennia. If this vile shit is happening, it&#39;s much bigger than some pasta enthusiast being a creepy fucker or some gay pizza shop owner cozying up with a bunch of rich politicians. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disbelieve or believe PG because I think it&#39;s moot at this point. It caught a bunch of people&#39;s attention but now they&#39;re all salivating over that bullshit while missing the larger implications. But I refuse to pretend that just because much of PG has spiraled into baseless connections and assumptions that there isn&#39;t actually a serious case of state involvement in child/adult sex trafficking. </p>

<p>Step out the bubble dude. There&#39;s no psyop campaign. Looked at from the outside it&#39;s easy to see the whole pizzagate thing form like some steroided up conspiracy theory.  It&#39;s silly all by itself.  Frankly, outside the usual website suspects it&#39;s totally irrelevant, and it&#39;s never used as &quot;propaganda&quot; to dismiss genuine sex trafficking. That&#39;s just a fantasy PG&#39;ers have made up so they can fantasise about being plucky rebels fighting the man. </p>

<p>Show me a story where PG is used to dismiss a genuine case.</p>

<p>Child abuse and sex traffiking happens.  People abuse positions of power.  Some powerful people are pedos.  There is no evidence of some giant world wide web of elite pedos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bruh, chill out with the hostility. No need for the passive aggression. Is it really so difficult to have a respectful conversation even when you disagree? </p>

<p>First, I was asking you that question to determine the context of your stance. I can see why you would want to interpret it as an attack on you to make yourself feel better. But since we&#39;ve determined you weren&#39;t denying that, then you do agree that there is state involvement in sex trafficking. </p>

<p>Second, I am not nor was I ever a pizzagater. I certainly followed it but simply observed it as it happened and watched to see what became of it. I need not distance myself from anything. I also am not saying that people are denying large  scale sex trafficking, but again I can see how you would think that to make yourself feel better. What I was trying to get at is that since large scale human trafficking is a known thing, and by your own admission people abuse power and some powerful people are pedos, it&#39;s not implausible to entertain the idea that powerful people with influence, whether for monetary gain or deviant pleasure gain, would get involved with this industry. I think what you&#39;re doing is making the false assumption that someone who&#39;s entire life has been power and money would still have the same morality and worldview as you. Once upon a time serfs shoveled shit while there were people living in golden palaces and living such detached lives from the majority of humans that they  viewed others outside their bubble as subhuman. Regardless, what I was pointing out is that if this issue is being given attention and people are bent on investigating, it should be viewed through the frame of it as a more widespread problem. Maybe you don&#39;t believe the rabbit hole goes as deep as some, and maybe that&#39;s where our failure to find common ground is stemming from, but I don&#39;t think that any market or opportunity for profit or control would be left untapped by the upper eschelon. There are deep rooted pockets of dynastic power with unimaginable wealth that would seem much benefit in being involved in sex trafficking. It opens the door for blackmail, influence, and money. How you can study history and then give those that subversively wield power today the benefit of the doubt is beyond me. If you believe in any level of deep state or ancient control systems, it only follows that they would be involved in such matters. If you do not believe that then that&#39;s our impasse and we are never going to agree. </p>

<p>Third, while I think it&#39;s gotten foolish by this point, the online explosion of investigation and suspicion started with good intentions and I don&#39;t fault those that simply jumped at the opportunity to stop corruption or expose members of a corrupt system. While much of it devolved to gigantic leaps in logic and reason, people that care about this would rather be wrong about it anyway. Anyone who&#39;s passionate about this probably has little concern in looking like a fool. People call you a fool for thinking 9/11 wasn&#39;t the official story but this wouldn&#39;t be much of a conspiracy sub if people were afraid to be perceived as fools by those who don&#39;t believe.</p>

<p>Fourth, I did not claim pizzagate is a psyop. But I can see why you would want to think that to make yourself feel better. I was stating that in the context of pizzagate it&#39;s more likely to be a psyop than wholly true You also seemed to misunderstand my point. I did not say that pizzagate is currently being used as propaganda to currently dismiss sex trafficking. But again, I can see how you&#39;d think that to make yourself feel better. I&#39;m just entertaining the idea that if the media were spin it to smear the claims of high level sex trafficking, if any major exposure occurred did actually occur then it could be compared to baseless like pizzagate and written off as just as silly. I&#39;m not saying that PG is used or would be used to dismiss individual cases. Interestingly enough you can entertain an idea without accepting it. I&#39;m not in a bubble. But we are on a conspiracy sub that frequently talks of psyops and propaganda. For you to act as if you have special knowledge that under no circumstances PG could be spun or guided to achieve a certain agenda is a bit disingenuous. In fact, anyone that claims any definitive stance on such a questionable and disputed issue, whether pizzagaters or anti pizzagaters, should have their judgement called into question. I openly admit that all I believe is due to my personal research and study, but at the end of the day it&#39;s just my opinion and analysis. This is no different for you. PG may be 100% bullshit, may be partial truths, may be legit, but to go out of your way to ridicule and say with certainty that your skills of perception and understanding are far greater than others is a huge red flag. I mean your rebuttal equates to, &quot;I think it&#39;s stupid so you&#39;re all dumb.&quot; And you&#39;ll never convince anyone to look outside their own confirmation bias by insulting them. </p>

<p>There&#39;s fucky shit on planet earth and no ordinary person can be certain of matters regarding conspiracy theories...ya know, cause they&#39;re theories and are meant to be discussed and viewed as such. Pizzagate started going off the rails once the idea that they could be vigilantes entered their minds. They started doing more than just making connections for their own interest and discussion and started witch hunting without going through the proper channels. Now that the whole thing is smeared by their overreaction, no proper channel will even take it seriously. </p>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;m less insinuating some grand elite pedo ring and more trying to express that it&#39;s a club at the top that protects its own. Those people don&#39;t roll over on each other. So it doesn&#39;t take them all to be involved for it to still be a problem. If you entertain many of the other theories discussed in this sub, the thought that shit isn&#39;t what it seems isn&#39;t an unusual conclusion. So let&#39;s say even only 10 out the top 100 wealthy and powerful people is a pedophile or something, with their billions of dollars and influential sway, their interest in funding that type of operation could have seriously far reaching effects. You admit power corrupts and some powerful people are pedos, and at that level of wealth and influence, that&#39;s really all it would take to facilitate world wide sex trafficking. However, if you draw the line at the mainstream conspiracy theories, I&#39;m sure all I&#39;m saying is ridiculous to you. Secret societies exist, many having been involved in pedophilia and sex trafficking for centuries and even millennia. What makes you think they were all eradicated and no longer conspired behind the scenes as we moved into the modern age? </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t give any credence to that kind of stuff then you might as well not even reply because we are on two totally different wavelengths and will reach no agreement. </p>

<p>And please, I&#39;m asking if you do reply, don&#39;t get all heated and hostile. Just talk to another human being with some sincerity. You can still make your point and be convincing, arguably more so, by keeping it chill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pizza angle should definitely be dropped from the discussion. It may be a small piece of the puzzle, but the scope of things has expanded far greater than any specific establishment or person. I&#39;ve seen enough weird connections in all of this Pedogate (cause fuck pizzagte) shit and read enough history to know that there has always been pedophilia and abuse in the upper echelons of power. In most cases it is probably an issue of the money that can be made from it, but surely there are disturbed and vile people that get involved. Many of histories greatest known leaders and people that wielded power were sexually deviant and some cruel. This is not a new behavior for those that let the acquisition of power and influence consume them.</p>

<p>There are unimaginable power structures and amounts of money that shift behind the scenes all while we the people spin the hamster wheel. And to think that we just civilized those behaviors and power structures out over the past few centuries is naive and irresponsible. True elite dynastic wealth is something neither you or I could even imagine. It&#39;s a whole different society and social structure once you get high enough up the power spectrum. </p>

<p>So I think while the suspicions of child trafficking and pedophilia that first arose from the Podesta emails may have spiraled into too much focus on minutiae, I think it highly plausible that the fringes of the global child trafficking industry, and how it&#39;s pervaded governments and positions of power from around the world, started to show once people began digging into the connections between the Clinton Foundation and other big players. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, that isn&#39;t often communicated as the main concern when discussing &quot;Pizzagate&quot;. The discussion needs to be broadened from being too focused on and bent out of shape over Alefantis and pasta and move into the realm of trying to connect the dots on a much more macro scale. Child trafficking is a huge industry and it exists in the slums and palaces. When you&#39;re at the top and you have power you hang out with others at the top and with power. So I&#39;m willing to bet that where there is money to be made or a market to tap into, they could easily network their systems of power to benefit themselves. </p>

<p>This is why writing off &quot;Pizzagate&quot; as a whole is a bad call. Maybe the the people who&#39;ve dug in and uncovered things went too far and hyperfocused on details that really only hurt their case (i.e. Comet Ping Pong), but I firmly believe there is widespread and pervasive child trafficking among the elite of the world that some may partake of but many are just involved for the billions to be made. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me the timing of PG is a real give away. The heat and attention that was directed at the CF only lasted a week or two before PG and then nothing about CF since. That is pretty strange considering the ramifications of the corruption within the CF. Like all good lies, there may be some truths about PG but the real story is the CF in my opinion. TPTB probably thought, &quot;lets throw some perverts at them and let them be sacrificed to buy us some time and space and throw a few lies and half truths to confuse them&quot;. </p>
