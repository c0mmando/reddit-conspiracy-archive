        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just had an &quot;aha&quot; moment.</p>

<p>As a teacher, I spend a lot of time researching everything I can to be the best teacher I can be, and that means I spend a lot of time on teaching related subreddits. I often stumble across posts on Reddit about how teachers must constantly try to instill values in their students that they just do not come to the classroom with...</p>

<p>You may say that is not our job in the first place, and you&#39;re right, it shouldn&#39;t be! A lot of our effort is spent teaching basic values and skills that most of us can agree are &#39;right&#39;. I&#39;m not necessarily going to try to get into a moral debate because I know morals can very slightly from region to region, culture to culture, etc. However,  most of us can agree that kindness, respect, and care are basic traits most of us should possess (as well as many others).</p>

<p>This does not seem to be done at home any longer. Teachers now (and this has been going on for a while) have been responsible for making up for these at-home deficits. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong. I get that when you&#39;re a teacher, you will always have to do this to an extent, even in an ideal society.</p>

<p>However, this eats up a lot of teachers&#39; time, and a lot of this wasted time eats at our students&#39; actual time for learning.</p>

<p>I argue with people all the time on Reddit on the dangers of our &quot;Do whatever you want as long as you&#39;re happy&quot; society (do what thou wilt). When selfishness, as well as  some strange emphasis on happiness as the ultimate indication of life success,  are the only sort of morality and ethics we are teaching in society, you better believe our students are growing up messed up. I like to call this &quot;Oprah Morality&quot;:</p>

<p>Definition: the belief that the only thing that matters in life is one&#39;s individual happiness and that this happiness matters more than anything, even at the expense of others or society.</p>

<p>This happiness is often achieved through selfishness, materialism, and narcissistic principles, none of which serve to benefit society as a whole.</p>

<p>&quot;Oprah morality&quot; feels good and looks good at times, but it is extremely destructive.</p>

<p>I grew up watching Oprah, and it all looked and felt so good. Now that I look back, I have a lot of qualms about what she was teaching her vulnerable viewers.</p>

<p>Of course this conspiracy can go in a lot of directions, but I think it really starts with the breakdown of the family. Parents either do not have time or do not know how to instill basic morals and values into their children. Parents need to spend time at home teaching their children a basic value system. It does NOT have to be religious. The values one instills in children as they grow up are what they will value and teach their children when they are older.</p>

<p>This an article about the decrease in empathy in our society, and there are many like it with a quick Google search:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/born-love/201005/shocker-empathy-dropped-40-in-college-students-2000">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/born-love/201005/shocker-empathy-dropped-40-in-college-students-2000</a></p>

<p>The conspiracy here is really, and I know this gets said a lot, &quot;cultural marxism&quot; - if you can think of a better term, please comment!</p>

<p>The other conspiracy is that there is a breakdown of the family unit, so that the school and state (government) are really responsible for raising children, and that way, they are completely responsible for indoctrination of our future children. By the way, I have no doubt that public education will be gone within twenty years.</p>

<p>I thought this was a relevant quote from Brave New World:</p>

<p>&quot;You’ve got to choose between happiness and what people used to call high art. We’ve sacrificed the high art.&quot; Art is one of those things people must do without in this brave new world. Without pain and suffering, art is not an issue.&quot;</p>

<p>Have we chosen &quot;happiness&quot; over anything of meaning?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really nice post man. Ya know I had a teacher in 8th grade try to slip the Bible in as proper literature for the curriculum. I politely told her that isn&#39;t appropriate. She insisted and I walked straight out to the principle and I never heard it mentioned again.</p>

<p>She was a great bad example of a teacher. However, I was a latchkey kid, and if not for several excellent teachers like you, I don&#39;t think I would have stood a chance at becoming a decent human being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! I still think religion and state should be separated, even though I am spiritual and religious (spiritual)myself.</p>

<p>If we are to implement any sort of religious texts in school, it should be done so at an appropriate grade level for an appropriate maturity.</p>

<p>Indoctrination by a public institution is not right. With that being said, I feel there&#39;s nothing wrong with a parent raising their children with religious principles. The point is, forced principles is not what works.</p>

<p>We must model what we value. I have no need to tell my students what I believe. I show them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A basic understanding of the Bible is crucial to understand any of our classic literature from Shakespeare to Dickenson.  We do our children a disservice not teaching those stories. Every day on TV or movies or a book I a reading there is an allusion to a Bible story.  Most recently I&#39;ve seen a lot of David and Goliath.</p>

<p>This along with Greek Mythology is absolutely necessary for understanding the English classics.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! I notice those same traits in the kids in my little sister&#39;s class. These are some of the most uppity children I&#39;ve ever seen. They all think they&#39;re better than each other, they don&#39;t care what happens to their peers as long as all the attention is on them, and the materialistic mindset these kids have is ridiculous. It feels like every week my sister comes home and tells me, so and so got the new gaming console or the new iPhone. They get judgmental too if you don&#39;t have the newest version of a gadget like they do. I don&#39;t want to imagine a generation full of people like that and I sure as hell don&#39;t want to imagine them raising <em>their</em> kids like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. It creates this thought that everything should just be perfect happiness and if it&#39;s not, it&#39;s wrong. </p>

<p>While I believe we should all strive for happiness, this mentality can cause a &quot;walk away&quot; train of thought. It doesn&#39;t recognize that sometimes getting to the happiness you have to wade through the shit to get there. Stick it out, fight to make it work &amp; understand life is not perfect. 
Yes, I think it creates a materialistic quest for happiness, things provide instant gratification, not true happiness. Real, true happiness is something you have to work to achieve. Weather is in a relationship or internal work, it doesn&#39;t come easy. Life is full of things that aren&#39;t happy. We have to experience these things to develop proper coping skills to get through them. To not let them break us into a million little pieces, but to get up and try again. </p>

<p>I bow to you, teacher! You guys do the work so many cannot or will not do. The burden of our youth often times gets placed on your shoulders. Thank you for all you do for these young souls. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always wanted to be a teacher, since I was old enough to know what one was. Kinder or second grade. lately, I&#39;ve realized the reason I wanted to be one was because they are in control of the information they give us, and I wanted to know what <em>they</em> know. yes, I was a five year old conspiracy theorist, I blame my native blood.</p>

<p>anyway. if I became a schoolteacher now I feel that I would not agree with what I would be teaching and it would cause me a great amount of strife.</p>

<p>so I became a yoga teacher instead ;)</p>

<p>I also have the feeling that formal education will be gone soon... impending doom of the apocalypse may be the reason I feel that way; may I ask why you feel that way?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for writing that out. I always wanted to be a teacher too. I used to make models of classrooms when I was 6 years old. I&#39;m not sure what I liked...the leadership? Helping others?</p>

<p>The reason I I advise against it now is because it&#39;s not what people think it is. It is extremely hard to get a good job, and the jobs that are left are in really really challenging schools. This is because good teachers don&#39;t leave good schools. The rest are chaotic.</p>

<p>They could not teach me in college the reality of teaching. They completely lied to me in the sense that they provided me an idealistic version of something that is far from ideal.</p>

<p>However I think I&#39;m a good teacher and I really enjoy teaching, though every day I am emotionally drained.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you&#39;re a teacher you should look into the term &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; because Cultural Marxism was The Frankfurt School&#39;s investigations into the ways capitalism can manipulate us by the creation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">&quot;Culture Industry&quot;</a>... it&#39;s not some collectivist conspiracy; it&#39;s the investigation of culturally hegemonic capitalism.</p>

<p>Interesting that you chose that Brave New World quote; as high art is exactly what Adorno was on about saving FROM <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">&quot;The Culture Industry&quot;</a> (as you can read in the first paragraph of that link)</p>

<p>Cultural Marxism is the investigation of these things, it&#39;s not the things of themselves. When the alt-right complain about &quot;mainstream media&quot; they&#39;re actually BEING Cultural Marxists (because the mainstream media is a product of Capitalism). When you made this post; that was an act of Cultural Marxism.</p>

<p>So yeah; William S. Lind and the other conservatives <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MEtnuOy-_s">who abuse this term</a> have it all mixed up and ass backwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the abuse of the term, so I do appreciate your comment. I am simplifying a bit too much, and I feel that the term is used as an &quot;easy out&quot; in an argument.</p>

<p>With that being said, though, I think it&#39;s come to take on a different meaning than what was originally intended, and I&#39;m using that for my post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your usage, or rather aid in co-opting the term &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; plays into an anti-thought paranoia (eg, marxism is a prohibited thought crime). Which helps both perpetuate the stigma on considering alternative ways society could be, but the term also helps cover up for a certain (current) strain of neo-fascism that is essentially anti-freedom, anti-choice and disinterested in learning the subtleties of human history and human dialogue. </p>

<p>This fascistic strain of though is anti-freedom in that it rallys against trans, gay, and other ways of existing (gays, jews, communists and subversives, to use Hitler&#39;s classic categories); viewing them not as simple freedom-based choices citizens have a right to, but instead it casts them as &quot;degenerative&quot; via rhetoric (by use of phrases like <em>&quot;the break down of the family&quot;</em>).</p>

<p>So in a sense I think much of your post is scapegoating and against freedom, seeking to blame one side of politics for a myriad of greater political, cultural, social and personal complexities you couldn&#39;t be bothered articulating.</p>

<p>Oprah didn&#39;t cause there to be fast food joints jockeying for position on each street corner (that&#39;s capitalism)... Oprah didn&#39;t fund a music industry which spent a decade encouraging a false view of black cultural life (again capitalism)... Oprah didn&#39;t force your browser to advertise a million quick fixes for life or create a bunch of websites and apps capable of delivering easy consumption directly to your door.... and nor did Marxism (in any variety).</p>

<p>So I think your claims are dubious, and your hypothesis is unsubstantial. But hey, it&#39;s <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>; so they belong here.</p>

<p>Personally I think that the <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-industry.htm">Cultural Marxists were right.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The enjoyment of the violence suffered by the movie character turns into violence against the spectator, and distraction into exertion. Nothing that the experts have devised as a stimulant must escape the weary eye; no stupidity is allowed in the face of all the trickery; one has to follow everything and even display the smart responses shown and recommended in the film. This raises the question whether the culture industry fulfils the function of diverting minds which it boasts about so loudly. If most of the radio stations and movie theatres were closed down, the consumers would probably not lose so very much. To walk from the street into the movie theatre is no longer to enter a world of dream; as soon as the very existence of these institutions no longer made it obligatory to use them, there would be no great urge to do so. Such closures would not be reactionary machine wrecking. The disappointment would be felt not so much by the enthusiasts as by the slow-witted, who are the ones who suffer for everything anyhow. In spite of the films which are intended to complete her integration, the housewife finds in the darkness of the movie theatre a place of refuge where she can sit for a few hours with nobody watching, just as she used to look out of the window when there were still homes and rest in the evening. The unemployed in the great cities find coolness in summer and warmth in winter in these temperature-controlled locations. Otherwise, despite its size, this bloated pleasure apparatus adds no dignity to man’s lives. The idea of “fully exploiting” available technical resources and the facilities for aesthetic mass consumption is part of the economic system which refuses to exploit resources to abolish hunger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine that; dignity; it&#39;s almost as if The Cultural Marxists had solid, yet humanistic values. Anyways, I&#39;ll let you get back to your right wing rhetoric; which today is a culture industry of it&#39;s own (as is left wing rhetoric, but that&#39;s the problem isn&#39;t it? And it&#39;s not called &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; it&#39;s the &quot;Culture Industry&quot; which gives everyone these false thoughts and false desires about their expression).</p>

<p>Of course this conspiracy can go in a lot of directions, but I think it really starts with the breakdown of the family. Parents either do not have time or do not know how to instill basic morals and values into their children. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again; Parents not having time due to long work hours is not the domain of Marxism. Marxism has traditionally been aligned with unionism and shorter work hours. So I agree that the question is one of values. I just don&#39;t think that the Marxists are to blame as you state here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conspiracy here is really, and I know this gets said a lot, &quot;cultural marxism&quot; - if you can think of a better term, please comment!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Capitalism and ideological discord go hand in hand. One side blames the other whilst we all labour under the idea that we&#39;re &quot;politically free&quot; because we choose which side of the discord to adopt (yet are being played both sides).</p>

<p>So call me a Cultural Marxist if you want to, but I don&#39;t believe there is a conspiracy to have the state take over parenting. There is however an unregulated free market; which puts money over values (or worse; views them as the exact same thing; the richest being seen as automatically more moral).</p>

<p>Capitalism pushes whatever narrative will get it the most money. As always; hence the growing crop of &quot;politically incorrect&quot; micro celebrities such as Milo Yiannopoulos, Breitbart, Gavin McInnes, and Steve Bannon... hell, now there is dear leader who decides that all criticism is fake-news.</p>

<p>But this doesn&#39;t make for an improved desiccation of the problem. It just falsifies the problem so we can swing the other way for a bit. The problem doesn&#39;t go away; it&#39;s just either stabilised, or destabilised... and if everyone thinks &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; is to blame (when in fact The Frankfurt School were concerned with the exact same things you are); then the problem will be de-stabalized, as the analysis is incorrect (or incorrectly articulated).</p>

<p>We already do that with left vs right. Where as neither are actually systemic change.</p>

<p>Gonna go with Occam&#39;s razor on this one.</p>

<p>Just as it&#39;s more likely that feminists are doing it for their own reasons, gay rights proponents are simply in support of gay rights, and civil rights people are also doing it for personal reasons to do with justice - I&#39;m also inclined to believe that Marxists really do believe there are injustices and imballances within capitalism that need to be addressed.</p>

<p>There are conspiracies of power; power does after all seek to consolidate more power; I just don&#39;t think that capitalists are the funding Marxism.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;m a social democrat; that is to say; I believe one role of government should be to keep society fair, human dignity strong, and the wealth gap limited... and I&#39;m not recieving any funding to believe these things.</p>

<p>It&#39;s better to take people at their word; as then you can atleast have an open discussion of values.</p>

<p>how else do you think they indstrialised so quickly? </p>

<p>Because whilst fascism is detrimental to rights and freedom in general; it is also increadibly effcient and somewhat effective; as is the state collecting all a nations resources and then allocating them tactically. </p>

<p>This is probably a terribly awkward comparason to make; but it&#39;s a bit like how evolution is chaotic, and might take thousands and thousands of years to come up with something that genetic engineer could (glow in the dark mice for instance). But a highly qualified genetics department with good quality equiptment could do it in a matter of years.</p>

<p>Likewise, free market capitalism is chaotic. Serving the purposes of the market rather than of the nation&#39;s industrialization.</p>

<p>Historically speaking capitalist countries have boycotted and tried to starve communist economies, leaving only hybridized systems like China to survive.</p>

<p>I kind of suspect that the attribution of the &quot;useful idiots&quot; line to Lenin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot#Attribution">is probably false.</a> I suspect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot#Useful_innocents">Von Mises popularized the idea that it was Lenin&#39;s term.</a>... I doubt this as many quotes and statements get falsely attributed to lenin and other communist leaders, such as the idea that he denounced communism and praised capitalism on his death bed (which is not true).</p>

<p>The right wing have also falsified several quotes from The Frankfurt School to bolster the &quot;Cultural marxism&quot; explaination:   </p>

<p>IDK if this is the whole book but it&#39;s well referenced. </p>

<p>I suggest you look into mystery schools/religions, secret societies and their codes of ethics/rules and their parallels ,and differences, with the communist manifesto. For example the Templars swore to  &quot;live without money&quot;.. but they also swore &quot;to be served first and given the best food&quot; and &quot;to govern oneself&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree to some degree, the role is also occasionally performed by private companies and other institutions (such as boarding schools, military schools and foster homes)... and there are lots of issues around that.  </p>

<p>A big issue for me is how little parents get and want a choice, and how little teachers and careers get paid for the emotional labour they&#39;re doing.  </p>

<p>But I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s the state intentionally taking over parenting; I think it&#39;s the product of the Victorian era of schooling which has simply spilled over and evolved.  </p>

<p>So much of what society does isn&#39;t done for good reason, but merely because &quot;it&#39;s how it&#39;s done!&quot; - it&#39;s very important that society breaks out of that mindset to realize new possibilities.  </p>

<p>Just because it&#39;s how one generation has done something, or gone through something, doesn&#39;t it&#39;s best or other generations should have to.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this cultural Marxism rhetoric about destruction of the family,etc, really has nothing to do with the Frankfurt School. It all seems to come from a few lines of The Communist Manifesto from the 1840&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abolition [Aufhebung] of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists.</p>

<p>On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based? On capital, on private gain. In its completely developed form, this family exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.</p>

<p>The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital.</p>

<p>Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents? To this crime we plead guilty.</p>

<p>But, you say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when we replace home education by social.</p>

<p>And your education! Is not that also social, and determined by the social conditions under which you educate, by the intervention direct or indirect, of society, by means of schools, &amp;c.? The Communists have not invented the intervention of society in education; they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class.</p>

<p>The bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about the hallowed co-relation of parents and child, becomes all the more disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all the family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labour.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two things to keep in mind here. The word Aufhebung has a technical meaning in Hegel, from which Marx is coming from. It is usually translated as sublation. Something like cancelling and preserving at the same time. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufheben">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufheben</a></p>

<p>The second point is that the changing of family relations that resulted do to capitalism is lamented in the text above.  </p>

<p>The rhetoric really is just knee jerk anti-communism.  </p>

<p>Adam Curtis did a good documentary that explores how people changed the way that they think about themselves called Century of the Self. I think it will offer you some insights in understanding what is generating this ethical wasteland. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Frankfurt School (specifically Marcuse) DID write about family in the 1936 &quot;Studien über Autorität und Familie&quot; or when run through google translate &quot;Studies on Authority and Family&quot;... and I suspect it&#39;s never been translated to English (as many Frankfurt School works haven&#39;t) so to call it an influence on modern politics is way over the top.</p>

<p>Wilhelm Reich also wrote a bit about the family in &quot;The Mass Psychology of Fascism&quot;; but he was a bit nuts, and I wouldn&#39;t really say he&#39;s a member of The Frankfurt School (Eric Fromm who was somewhat inspired by Reich was, but I wouldn&#39;t say Reich was FS).</p>

<p>In researching this I did find a more apt term than &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freudo-Marxism">&quot;Freudo Marxism&quot;</a>; but it again is in no way connected to Feminism, LGTBQ, Black rights or Identity Politics (which came from the Black Lesbian Feminist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics#History">Barbara Smith</a>)...</p>

<p>Personally speaking I don&#39;t see it as &quot;cultural Marxism&quot; (which is a loaded term) but rather the solidification of rewarding sociopathic behavior in society. Put yourself and your desires first, <em>by any means necessary and at any cost.</em> It&#39;s everyone trying to get their 15 minutes of fame by selling image rather than self. </p>

<p>Integrity is frowned upon, or at least not rewarded. Kindness is now seen as a weakness. Passions are still seen as worth pursuing, but only if they can make you rich, famous, or play into whatever pop-culture idea is seen as the next big thing. Anything else is next to worthless in the eyes of mainstream society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, ok. A lot of my students believe in conspiracies. Also, I definitely believe in the breakdown of the family unit.</p>

<p>Honestly, are we going to argue about the fact that there are more single parents now more than ever? More abandoned children? More orphans?</p>

<p>That&#39;s good?</p>

<p>And I&#39;m all for free speech and free thought. I don&#39;t bring my political views (or really any of my personal views) into teaching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very thoughtful and frankly scary to think that so much time is being spent teaching kids the basics of respect.</p>

<p>This is something I have thought about recently with the reactionary moral showboating you see on social media. Everyone is so ready to condemn before they even have the facts before them and it seems like today&#39;s outrage fad often contradicts the one from the day before.</p>

<p>I think the issue is kids aren&#39;t given criterion alongside the moral values they are asked to parrot and then your get these bizarre conclusions. They are taught values rather than virtues and thus can only judges actions by their consequences. </p>

<p>This is something I have thought about for awhile, and in my research I stumbled across something that might illustrate your argument:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The teacher is expressly told to not judge the children&#39;s selection of what they value most. They are told to simply encourage the classroom discussion about what the children select as their &#39;values&#39;. So someone could put at the top of his or her list of &quot;values&quot; &#39;physical attractiveness&#39; saying, in effect, &quot;this is the most important thing in my life, that&#39;s the top of my values system&quot;, and what is the teacher expressly told? The teacher is directed &quot;Don&#39;t impose your values on the students&#39; values&quot;. What good does this do for a person, what good does it do for society? It assumes that each person is the origin of &quot;values selection&quot; because there is no &quot;truth&quot; they can or should be taught. Yet, in many, many areas of the curriculum and actual teaching of students and in the discourse of society (as represented in speeches by leaders, newspaper articles etc.) we are interested in &quot;truths that are out there.&quot; <a href="http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/values-and-virtues-a-modern-confusion.html">Source</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dad&#39;s girlfriend has been a teacher for 30+ years.  She echos the same sentiment that you do.  She tells me that teaching isn&#39;t as fun as it used to be.  She feels that there is too much standardized testing now.  When you hear a public school teacher say that she and many of her peers put their children through private schools, that should raise a red flag that something is wrong.</p>

<p>Here are a few points aside from the things you mentioned concerning the diminishing moral and ethical values in my opinion:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are more compelling entertainment distractions than there have ever been.  This impacts the kids and the adults.  This probably also impacts their attention span for learning as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Diminshed energy for both the parents and children due to decreased exercise.  I would imagine overall health has declined as well with the rise of obesity, at least in the United States.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You already stated the main reasons and did it far better than I would.  :)</p>

<p>I am shocked that you said that you expected public school to be gone in 20 years.</p>

<p>As for what can be done about it, perhaps it would be a consideration to have some sort of ethics class where the kids consider what a good solution would be to a problem involving more than just themselves.  Not that TPTB would have any of that.  :P</p>

<p>I think what you are doing to help them is inspiring and it goes a long way to helping out the kids.  I think everyone here is thankful for the work you do.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is good? What is bad? Absolutes are as just as potentially dangerous as relativism. Things that have been done in the name of &quot;greater good&quot; across the world aren&#39;t necessarily moral/ethical nor pretty. Most dictators were convinced they were doing &quot;good&quot;, people have mostly killed each other in the name of &quot;God&quot; and the Absolute &quot;good&quot; the male cloud sky represents. </p>

<p>Some people have become addicted and the addiction itself to anything outside of themselves because after decades of various &quot;educational&quot; programs, indoctrination of what is &quot;good&quot; and what is &quot;bad&quot; whether at home, school, or in the temple/church/mosque or party meeting and various contexts of the mentioned accepted beliefs of each box in order to be liked/loved/belong/accepted they figured out that being &quot;cared&quot; about only when you nod and parrot what people want to hear isn&#39;t actually care so I am not shocked that we have more psychopaths and sociopaths and &quot;less empathy&quot; or simply people drained of the hypocrisy and disillusioned by the &quot;We Care Oh So Much As Long As You Do/Say/Think/Feel XYZ&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all baloney, and to be honest, the truly priceless and most important education and inner individualized empathy towards the self and others must come from within each individual through experiencing actual life and not from what shows, schools, mommies and daddies say/do/think/feel from their own limited individual perspectives and their own potential agendas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey girl. :) we&#39;re almost always on the same page, so I don&#39;t disagree with your idea on the whole, but I think maybe you&#39;re mischaracterizing the problem a little, or at least misstating it.</p>

<p>to a very limited extent, with the whole &quot;in loco parentis&quot; type philosophy, teachers have a role in helping children structure some kind of moral framework or sense of morality generally. I think this has to be carefully measured, because it is far too easy for the state to encroach upon self-realization and individuality. ultimately it is the parental responsibility, and the parents should be the ones to decide the direction of a child&#39;s moral foundation, but given the circumstances of modern society, if public or private education is involved (anything not done at home, that is), then there is obviously some crossover between parental responsibility and teacher responsibility, as limited as it ought to be, if not just out of necessity by virtue of the teacher being a heavily influential figure in the child&#39;s life and development.</p>

<p>with that said, I don&#39;t think that your description of how extensive this &quot;ought&quot; to be is unreasonable: the values of kindness, respect, and care are certainly agreeable enough. where I find myself feeling uncomfortable with your characterization is in regard to the supposed selfishness/happiness dichotomy. that&#39;s certainly a false dichotomy if it were intended as one. assuming that it weren&#39;t, though, I&#39;m still uneasy merely with the wording of it. I don&#39;t think selfishness is an inherently undesirable trait; this rings somewhat of the rhetoric of anti-capitalist sentiment, maybe even socialist or communist. selfishness is a good thing, but it&#39;s not the only thing, and has to be taken into context. of course charity and goodwill for your peers is also good. and selfishness is only virtuous insofar as it does not involve the debasement or devaluation of others, or the harm of others. I think that the evil word you may be looking for is hedonism. selfishness is not necessarily the same thing. it is a matter of both degree and quality.</p>

<p>similarly, egalitarianism is unideal, especially if felt or done simply for its own sake. but again I think this is merely a descriptive issue. I don&#39;t think you were intending anything different from what I&#39;m suggesting to be right.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe it is the role of the individual to somehow benefit society as a rule--certainly not to his own detriment. but in the event something may be beneficial to society that also has benefit for the self, then this is good.</p>
