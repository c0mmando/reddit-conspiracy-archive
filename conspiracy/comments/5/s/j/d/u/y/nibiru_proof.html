       I've been looking for any evidence of Nibiru/Planet X in my local area and haven't had any luck so far, though I have noticed an exponential increase in chemtrails over the last year or so. I live on the West Coast of Florida and have seen videos of two suns in the sky and a ton of UFO videos but haven't had any experiences myself other than watching a peculiar orange orb fly around irradically and then disappear, but that's another story. Some of the videos and pictures look legit while others are clearly fake. Does anybody have any pictures or videos they've personally taken? If so, any advice on how to view it would be greatly appreciated. Or do you think the whole idea of Nibiru is bogus?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had a foreboding feeling that something massive is coming for about two years now and I can't shake it. Maybe it's Nibiru, maybe it's a collective awakening of the masses, or maybe I'm being paranoid.

       These are arguments of authority fallacies, convincing arguments aren't evidence. Convincing arguments are what lead to funding for actual data gathering, formatted into testable frameworks and then other scientists use that to make their own tests and further confirm the evidence.

       Everything you said is a straw man or red herring fallacy. Doesn't matter about any other object for this argument, the fact is to believe in nibiru there needs to be evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the Oort Cloud isn't part of a "story" concocted without evidence that purports to bring destruction to earth. If it exists fine, if it doesn't nothing changes. See the difference? One claims there's a global conspiracy to hide a whole plant that will bring untold destruction, the other claims there's some ice some where that doesn't affect me.

       It seems like the one with the fallacious logic here is you. You continue to ignore the scientific evidence that astronomers have found a large object moving through the outer solar system on an elliptical orbit that is bringing it closer and closer to us. I'm not saying it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       Nibiru, I am not saying there is any kind of conspiracy, I am saying that shutting off one's mind to new and fantastical ideas does a disservice to science. I am saying that it's interesting that we're beginning to see evidence of something that for years people like you said was impossible for a variety of reasons. Even now, as we have evidence that there is
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       out there, some people continue to deny that, despite what astronomers say, there is anything there at all. So who is the one doing a disservice to science? The one with the open mind to the evidence that there is very likely a large object approaching the inner solar system that is large enough to impact gravitational fields of the outer planets, or the one planting their feet firmly to the ground and denying that there's anything going on here at all.
      </p>

       "Science is much more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking. This is central to its success. Science invites us to let the facts in, even when they don’t conform to our preconceptions. It counsels us to carry alternative hypotheses in our heads and see which ones best match the facts. It urges on us a fine balance
       <em>
        between
       </em>
       no-holds-barred openness to new ideas, however heretical,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the most rigorous skeptical scrutiny of everything — new ideas and established wisdom. We need wide appreciation of this kind of thinking. It works. It’s an essential tool for a democracy in an age of change. Our task is not just to train more scientists but also to deepen public understanding of science." - Carl Sagan

       I didn't make a fallacious argument, and there has been suspicion of a large object outside of our known planetary knowledge for awhile. It's not a big deal on its own but labeling it nibiru brings with it a ton of baggage. If we aren't talking about nibiru then it wouldn't belong in this sub anyway because the only reason people here talk about it is because they believe it's being hidden and doom and gloom is coming.

       You won't see Nibiru. I've read somewhere, though I can't recall where, that its orbit makes it hard to see as it approaches because it's either positioned behind or near the Sun. I'm not sure how true that is. I would think it would be hard to see anything out past Pluto.
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly believe something is coming our way. We know there's
       <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/10/new-dwarf-planet-points-planet-nine">
        something
       </a>
       headed our way. I think this is why we're seeing all of these meteor strikes in the last few years. It and whatever orbits it collided with material in the outer solar system and sent debris hurtling ahead of it. I can only speculate if world leaders know this is going on. I mean, it's all really speculation.

       Ever since I was a kid I've always thought that there are planets out past Pluto. I think your hypothesis about the icy planet in the article is very plausible. There has to some reason for the increased earthquakes, volcano eruptions and meteor strikes. It makes sense in my head at least.

       I mean we're learning new things about space every day and even things that negate the laws of physics. We've only begun to explore the vast frontier of space. And I agree with you, I think the world leaders know a lot more than they admit.

       I will say that I think we're at the dawn of a new age. Not in the sense that, "Oh, of course, it's the 21st century." I mean that technological revolution, specifically the revolution of the Internet, is a destabilizing force to the status quo. I think of this as a moment like the creation of the printing press and how that was a destabilizing force because it allowed information to become more accessible to the masses. Or consider the creation of the telegraph, or the telephone, or the television. We can think of each of those moments as a counter proposition to the proposition represented by the status quo that acts as a kind of destabilizing force to reality. While simultaneously expanding the world, allowing us to reach out, each of those moments also brought the world closer together, making it smaller... Anyway, I digress. The point is, the Internet has changed the world, far more than anyone ever realized it would. I think by the late 90s, early 2000s, people just assumed the Internet would be for shopping and chat rooms and porn. But then social made came about allowing instantaneous communication like never before, where every moment of our lives is shared, where meme culture has erupted spreading ideas at an almost inconceivable rate. Information has gone viral, in the literal sense.

       spreads like an infection. The problem is people create reality bubbles that tell them what they want to hear, what they want to believe. And if you can control that, you can control reality. For as Orwell said, "Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else."

       Its not that natural disasters are happening more than usual. Its that over our history we flock to areas prone to disaster. Note how some of the most populated cities in the world are coastal cities and/or are on fault lines, near volcanos etc. There has always been tsunamis and earthquakes and hurricanes.

       You won't see Nibiru. I've read somewhere, though I can't recall where, that its orbit makes it hard to see as it approaches because it's either positioned behind or near the Sun. I'm not sure how true that is. I would think it would be hard to see anything out past Pluto.

       headed our way. I think this is why we're seeing all of these meteor strikes in the last few years. It and whatever orbits it collided with material in the outer solar system and sent debris hurtling ahead of it. I can only speculate if world leaders know this is going on. I mean, it's all really speculation.

       I haven't thought about it that way. If that's true then it's possible it may not be in our dimension. I definitely believe there are multiple dimensions and maybe it did cause catastrophic events in the past when they couldnt provide physical evidence. Who knows? I can't even fathom what CERN knows and is hiding from us.

       Growing up as a kid, I always made it a point to look in to UFO shows/videos.   Now that we have the internet and drones, I've pretty much given up on them.    It's far to easy to fake a video using a drone these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll still occasionally check them out, but it's with a high degree of skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Nibiru, what's the point in being worried about it?  If there really is this giant hurtling towards us, what can we do about it?   I think it's a fascinating possibility, but if it is going to happen, there's fuck all that can be done about it.

       It seems like the one with the fallacious logic here is you. You continue to ignore the scientific evidence that astronomers have found a large object moving through the outer solar system on an elliptical orbit that is bringing it closer and closer to us. I'm not saying it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       Nibiru, I am not saying there is any kind of conspiracy, I am saying that shutting off one's mind to new and fantastical ideas does a disservice to science. I am saying that it's interesting that we're beginning to see evidence of something that for years people like you said was impossible for a variety of reasons. Even now, as we have evidence that there is
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       out there, some people continue to deny that, despite what astronomers say, there is anything there at all. So who is the one doing a disservice to science? The one with the open mind to the evidence that there is very likely a large object approaching the inner solar system that is large enough to impact gravitational fields of the outer planets, or the one planting their feet firmly to the ground and denying that there's anything going on here at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Science is much more than a body of knowledge. It is a way of thinking. This is central to its success. Science invites us to let the facts in, even when they don’t conform to our preconceptions. It counsels us to carry alternative hypotheses in our heads and see which ones best match the facts. It urges on us a fine balance
       <em>
        between
       </em>
       no-holds-barred openness to new ideas, however heretical,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the most rigorous skeptical scrutiny of everything — new ideas and established wisdom. We need wide appreciation of this kind of thinking. It works. It’s an essential tool for a democracy in an age of change. Our task is not just to train more scientists but also to deepen public understanding of science." - Carl Sagan
