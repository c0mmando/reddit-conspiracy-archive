        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">116</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-02-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/andywarhaul.html">andywarhaul</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The cryptic tweets have been on my mind all day and I&#39;ve done more research into what the engine really is and what makes it special. </p>

<p>The F-22 is the plane it powers, it uses two of these bad boys. Pumping out 35,000 lbs of thrust each. Powerful engines. But the F-22 is a stealth fighter and it needs to make the least amount of noise possible. The F119 (engine) helps it do just that. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_F119">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_F119</a></p>

<p>So basically afterburners make a lot of noise, this engine allows the plane to enter <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercruise">supercruise</a> which is cruising at or above the speed of sound, without using afterburners therefore making it more quiet. So it adds greatly to the stealth properties of the plane. </p>

<p>There are only a couple engines that can do this and they are listed in the super cruise link. Besides those listed I believe the Russia PAK FA engine (in development with India Who are using GEs F414 which is also going in new F/A18s) is one of the only other engines. What you&#39;ll notice is that the Chinese don&#39;t have an engine that can enter supercrusie without afterburners. </p>

<p>Their new upcoming fighter jet is the J-20. Less than 10 prototypes have been built and are currently using prototype engines. </p>

<p>This is worth a read on their situation: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN0V7083">https://www.google.ca/amp/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN0V7083</a></p>

<p>A lot of speculation that the J-20 is a F-22 rip off </p>

<p><a href="https://fightersweep.com/6230/analysis-chengdu-j-20-the-chinese-raptor/">https://fightersweep.com/6230/analysis-chengdu-j-20-the-chinese-raptor/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://defensetech.org/2015/09/29/lawmaker-chinese-j-31-j-20-mirror-american-f-35-f-22/?mobile=1">https://defensetech.org/2015/09/29/lawmaker-chinese-j-31-j-20-mirror-american-f-35-f-22/?mobile=1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3893126/amp/Chinese-J-20-stealth-jet-based-military-plans-stolen-hackers-makes-public-debut.html">https://www.google.ca/amp/www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3893126/amp/Chinese-J-20-stealth-jet-based-military-plans-stolen-hackers-makes-public-debut.html</a></p>

<p>They talk about China hacking the US there</p>

<p>Also important to note a couple other things. Clintons first trip abroad as Sec of State was to Asia. The last stop was in China. This is February &#39;09. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/10/hillary-clinton-china-opinions-columnists_0211_gordon_chang.html">http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/10/hillary-clinton-china-opinions-columnists_0211_gordon_chang.html</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s shortly after this time that the J-20 started going into production. </p>

<p>My guess here is that Wikileaks has evidence of the F119 plans or secrets whatever being sold to the Chinese. Supercruise is vital to 5th generation fighters so to suggest china would build a 5th hen stealth plane <em>with</em> afterburners is ridiculous. They need the afterburner free supercruise </p>

<p>Edit: fucked up a link, clarification on F414</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WikiLeaks doesn&#39;t really play the &#39;give us this or we will release that&#39; game, if they have something worth releasing it they&#39;ve proven to release it in a timely manner once they can verify authenticity and redact names of people directly effected regardless of what someone else has. I do believe they are warning something is coming out, but it isn&#39;t their style to make threats. It especially isn&#39;t their style to hold back info if someone else comes through to release other info. Truly though I suppose with the lack of info and such grave tweets anything could be happening lol, just my thoughts based on WikiLeaks previous track record.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought it was a tongue in cheek &quot;jet fuel melts steel beams&quot; reference and all 3 were referring to 911 stuff.</p>

<p>But this is a brilliant idea. Word on the street is the Chinese are the group most angry with Clinton. And I&#39;ve heard other stories of China&#39;s struggles to build a decent jet engine.</p>

<p>So we got:</p>

<p>Seed Bank = life insurance (weiner laptop)</p>

<p>Friendly Fire = 911 inside job</p>

<p>Jet Engine = Clinton selling top secret jet engine designs to China</p>

<p>Holy shit. I want Assange to be safe...but this will be just out of control if released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FBI would never relase anything related to an ongoing investigation... and there have gotta be more investigations pending into Huma and HRC... so the release of 07 would have no informational benefit to it other than to act as a signal flare between the white knights in the US IC and Assange... maybe the government even agreed to let JA release 9/11 files when the time is right, knowing that he has the street cred to make it not seem like &quot;fake news&quot; if it came from another outlet... if the public is to be made aware of the truth Wikileaks would prolly be the best route to disseminate that information to the general public. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.

</blockquote>

<p>In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.</p>

<p>To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now.</p>

<p>This quote from Comey makes me want to see what their conclusions were, because it tells me that they caught her red handed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... she has been caught redhanded on the classified stuff since at least HRC 05 so there aren&#39;t really any new revelations to be had on 07. It is more symbolic that informational... I give ya props for quoting Comey&#39;s July 5th letter though... he pretty much lays it all out that she is guilty as hell, but the DOJ won&#39;t bring up charges. This mishandling is the busted tail light on her car full of dead hookers and cocaine... no reasonable prosecutor would bother with the chump change charges. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone paying attention knows she&#39;s guilty, but It&#39;s mighty helpful if we can point to a report and say &quot;look the only reason she wasn&#39;t charged was because she&#39;s Hillary Clinton&quot;. I get that it&#39;s mostly symbolic <em>if</em> you&#39;re paying attention. I think it&#39;s much more tangible if you&#39;re in the mainstream. That said it doesn&#39;t really make a difference, it&#39;s all dependant on what happens. </p>

<p>As for the letter, he does lay it all out. The language he uses is great </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comey is a lawyer and a wordsmith... he&#39;s been tip toeing around all the issues because he can&#39;t comment on an ongoing investigation... I can only hope that one day everyone sees him as the hero he really is... His FBI have doings some serious investigating... once the DOJ is squeaky clean everything is gonna come to light... </p>

<p>But yer right about the paying attention stuff... I pay very close attention to the the FBI and Comey so this is all so obvious to me... but most people don&#39;t read 100,000 pages of redacted documents for fun. </p>

<p>I really love the wiggle room comfrey left for imaginative speculation. </p>

<p>Context of a person&#39;s actions - the act of covering up wasn&#39;t as bad as what all was being covered up </p>

<p>How similar situations have been handled in the past -  what happens when you square up to brawl the Clintons? Ask Monica Peterson. No reasonable prosecutor... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part 7 would likely include a write up and summary of the investigation and suspected criminal sctivity. The investigator would say, &quot;during the course of our investigation... we found evidence suggesting HRC, Huma, etc... deleted emails... etc.&quot;</p>

<p>She straight face lied to a congressional inquiry, intentionally and maliciously deleted relevant emails, and obstructed an ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>Without even addressing issues with the DNC and manipulating votes to assure her nomination (wire/fraud).</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s pretty juicy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beautiful work here.  It may not be glamourous but it definitely has good logic behind this theory. </p>

<p>Remember Clinton and her private server was speculated by many to be used to sell state secrets abroad.  Which would directly go back as to why she deleted those 33k emails.</p>

<p>She needs to be tried for treason.  No ifs, ands, or buts, if even half of this is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you may be onto something but it doesn&#39;t involve the clintons. I believe this is a military trade secret and that assange is threatening to release proof of it if the 7th FBI file on clinton is not released. Same goes with the Nazi gold picture. Hes threatening to release info associating somebody serious with nazi ties. Assange is smart as fuck. I believe he started the whole #ProofofLife thing because he feared for his life after Trump won and knew we would be paranoid enough to always keep an eye out for anything suspicious. I think the police raid on the embassy was hinderrd in some way and he began to hide until trump was in power. Thats why he never stepped to the window to show us. Could have been shot by a special ops sniper sent by Obama.</p>

That is the most important part of the photo since it was related to the question &quot;When&quot; Could be for a future date, or passed date. <a href="http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/april9th.html">http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/april9th.html</a></p>

<p>The next theory is way out there. Operation Highjump in Antarctica, reference to the Germans V-7 project which correlates to jet propulsion hence the photo, and a possible future date which may be relevant to the &quot;when&quot;.</p>
