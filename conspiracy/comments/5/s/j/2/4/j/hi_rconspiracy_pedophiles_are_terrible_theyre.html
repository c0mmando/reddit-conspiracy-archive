<p>But it&#39;s funny how a legitimate conspiracy gets presented to us, with pretty damning evidence, that is actively being suppressed by American leaders... yet somehow many people are convinced that the conspiracy is that it&#39;s not a conspiracy.

<p>Trump has criticized EVERYBODY in the world in one way or another... but not Russia. </p>

<p>The Trump campaign has made it a key focal point to disrupt power structures in Europe that limit Russia and specifically grant Russia greater power.</p>

<p>Why the fuck is he so obsessed about removing Russian sanctions? Why won&#39;t he dare criticize Putin? </p>

<p>Why has our new Secretary of State been awarded the highest Russian civilian honor?</p>

<p>The dossier. The leaks.</p>

<p>Goddamn man if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it&#39;s a fucking duck. There has never been more solid evidence indicating ties to Russia. Maybe you&#39;re okay with that... but don&#39;t tell me he&#39;s not obviously working in the best interest of Russia for some unknown reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Far more evidence exists than goddamn pizza gate. Trump has been the most pro-Russia president in existence. </p>

<p>What evidence exists for Pizza gate? Literally the words &quot;cheese pizza&quot; and some davinci code symbol associations are the closest thing to hard evidence you got. This is insane. How can you believe pizza gate but ignore Trump&#39;s Russian ties. Maybe they&#39;re both true. Fine. But it&#39;s absolutely objectively untrue that there is more evidence for pizza gate than there is for The Donald&#39;s links to Russia.</p>

<p>Why is he so damn friendly to Putin? Why do multiple people in his campaign have ties to Russia? Why is he so quick to lift Russian sanctions? Why does his sec. of state have extensive business and political ties to Russia? None of this is hard evidence. But it is FAR harder than any evidence that may or may not exist for pizzagate. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just asking for similar burden&#39;s of proof in our various conspiracies. Doesn&#39;t make sense for you to dismiss this one but not the other.</p>

<p>Forcing a good relationship with Russia, to a far greater degree than any other president ever, for no discernible reason.

<p>It&#39;s so ironic that the conspiritards (no offense) who are supposed to be the most aware of corruption and lies by those in power, believe this guy so much.</p>

<p>I am saying he is <strong>forcing</strong> a good relationship with Russia, which only benefits Russia btw because all the things he says towards Putin are favorable. Right? He decries Merkel, he decries Mexico, he decries Australia even... but he has nothing bad to say about Putin? &#39;Cause our relationship with Russia is more important than our relationship with every single one of our strongest allies? It&#39;s insane man how do you not see this? Also desire to maintain his many many many many many many business interest worldwide should indicate to you that this man is intent on manipulating the presidency to enrich himself. That should at least tell you he&#39;s corrupt in general. The comments and actions toward Russia are so unilaterally positive that there has to be some other fucking reason for them.

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s not a Voltaire quote, it&#39;s still true.  </p>

<p>I know that not all Jews control the world and that not everyone that controls the world is Jewish, but there&#39;s definitely a trend.  The world is filled with harmless Arabs, intelligent blacks, clean desis and poor Jews but that&#39;s not a reason to ignore statistics.  Most crimes are committed by men, that doesn&#39;t mean I want to gas all men.  Sorry for not using perfectly precise language, but I think you know what my point is.  I&#39;ll try to make my future pro-pedophilia arguments on boards for conspiracy theorists more politically correct.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro, you are literally a jew hater quoting a neo-nazi. And you want to make some joke about not being PC enough. It&#39;s not the lack of political correctness that makes you full of shit, it&#39;s the fact that you&#39;re full of shit that makes you full of shit. Feel free to comment with &quot;triggered&quot; or whatever it is you do. You&#39;re literally a neo-nazi. You aren&#39;t using logic, you are using misinfo and bullshit to win an argument about how the jews are really oppressing the nazis. This kind of argument doesnt work on anyone who isn&#39;t a freaking nazi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, to those of us who have been researching this for longer than a couple months, to see something so evil finally get some public discourse is a total breath of fresh air. Awareness is a vital step to a solution. I welcome all discussion about it.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen all the arguments... that &quot;___ is more important&quot;, that &quot;pizzagate is BS&quot;, that it&#39;s true but being used as a distraction... Guess what? Doesn&#39;t matter.

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying. But when there&#39;s a sickness in the system, and you don&#39;t know how widespread the sickness is, sometimes it&#39;s better to attack the symptoms first. </p>

<p>Removing pedophilia won&#39;t stop the oppression and corruption, but (if recent accusations prove to be correct), it would wipe out a lot of the currently corrupt individuals.</p>

<p>I also think of it this way; of all the horrendous crimes and murders carried out by Al Capone, he was finally put in prison for tax evasion.</p>

<p>Of all the horrendous crimes and murders carried out by the &quot;sources&quot; of the oppression and corruption, if we can put them away for child trafficking/pedophilia, we should.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You genuinely think he became President for altruistic reasons. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so ironic that the conspiritards (no offense) who are supposed to be the most aware of corruption and lies by those in power, believe this guy so much.</p>

<p>I am saying he is <strong>forcing</strong> a good relationship with Russia, which only benefits Russia btw because all the things he says towards Putin are favorable. Right? He decries Merkel, he decries Mexico, he decries Australia even... but he has nothing bad to say about Putin? &#39;Cause our relationship with Russia is more important than our relationship with every single one of our strongest allies? It&#39;s insane man how do you not see this? Also desire to maintain his many many many many many many business interest worldwide should indicate to you that this man is intent on manipulating the presidency to enrich himself. That should at least tell you he&#39;s corrupt in general. The comments and actions toward Russia are so unilaterally positive that there has to be some other fucking reason for them. It just doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>
