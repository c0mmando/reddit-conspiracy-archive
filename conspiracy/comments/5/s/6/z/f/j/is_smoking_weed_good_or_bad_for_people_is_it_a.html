    <div class="md"><p>You mean in the sense of public poisining via led or fluoride. Your question seems to be &quot;what if weed makes people dumb too?&quot;.</p>

<p>I think the best answers you got here were: it depends on your usage, but largely too on whether or not you tend to be an idiot anyways, regardless of what you take in.</p>

<p>Many of the smartest people on the planet admit to using weed. Casually, as far as we know, but passionately still. Carl Sagan, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Morgan Freeman and I believe Richard Feinmann if I recall correctly are just some of them. This and the many, many functional and successful stoners make it unlikely that anything about cannabis inherently leads to a lasting reduction of cognitive abilities.</p>

<p>There is some indication that memory can be impaired to some degree with prolonged use of weed, but the extent of the effect are rarely problematic and vary quite a bit.</p>

<p>Another negative sideeffect is a reduction of dream-lucidity. Many stoners will describe insanely vivid dreams about a week after quitting pot, making them realise they hadn&#39;t really remembered their dreams at all while smoking regularly. This happened to me too.</p>

<p>In general, there are far greater sources of and reasons for a diminishing public intelligence, ranging from flawed educational concepts, over nutrition, air and water pollution and with television topping the list.</p>

<p>Personally, weed helps me keep a level head while reducing my chronic back pain and neuropathic pain significantly, with the added bonus of making me laugh more, smile more, converse more openly, eat with more pleasure, walk with lighter feet, sleep tighter, and enjoy books, movies and music more deeply. </p>

<p>I think your concern over weed is largely unfounded. The idea that it will singlehandedly usher in an age of world peace if only everybody smoked a bit of weed from time to time is cute and all, but equally naive. To my mind it&#39;s a clear force for good, provided it is not abused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About intelligent people smoking weed - that could be because it was promoted in the counter culture. A by product of the psy-op.</p>

<p>But the diminishing of the public intelligence you mention could be multi-pronged though. A over-all aversion to intellectualism that pot is just part of. Or even a kind of pseudo intellectualism.</p>
</div>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-6" data-depth="6" data-id="ddd1228">

    <div class="md"><p>I think the connection to the substance itself is really untenable in all those cases, though. Weed as part of a manufactured counter-culture is certainly a valid point to discuss, but I don&#39;t see any reason to think dumbing down hippies was part of the agenda, when </p>

<ol>
<li>it isn&#39;t a proven fact that cannabis makes people stupid, just to reiterate that point strongly. It was so proclaimed in 20th-century propaganda but has no basis in fact. And</li>
<li>the much more obvious and supported agenda was to criminalize a habit that almost all likely groups of dissidents share, introduce that habit into a manufactured counter-culture within your privileged class and lock them up at will if they become problematic for an ancient and by and large harmless habit of cannabis consumption.</li>
</ol>

<p>The diminishing of the public intelligence is undoubtedly multi-pronged and anti-intellectualism, as well as pseudo-intellectualism, are troubling trends, but I see no reason to consider them causally connected to pot in any way, other than stereotypes and remnants of outdated propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just mean pot was part of an over-all push towards escapism - an entertainment culture. Anti responsibility may be the biggest agenda. And the idea that it could be used as some enlightening force could be disinfo. Or that could be reality and the disinfo was that it made you dumb or psychotic etc. I can&#39;t tell either way. An awakening seems to be happening.. did pot help that in any way or did it hinder it?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="comment mb-3 ml-8" data-depth="8" data-id="ddd30ga">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">n/a</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/haveyouseenmymarble.html">haveyouseenmymarble</a> 2017-02-05</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Pot can certainly be a vehicle for escapism, especially when combined with video games or binge watching TV series, but I won&#39;t go as far as to claim these are bad trends or that they have been fostered by TPTB in order to make us complicit or stupid or both.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re overlooking the middle ground answers here. Pot itself makes you neither enlightened nor dumb, so there is no reason to assume an agenda to use pot to achieve either of these goals. One thing it can achieve is a breakdown of old, ingrained thought patterns. Psychedelics will do this in a much more pronounced fashion, but weed generally has a comparable effect. What you do with this mental change will largely determine how you progress. Most people will be no different after sobering up, but others will find themselves ready for new and fresh insights. If you lack critical thinking skills, you may be led astray by your own false assumptions regardless, but for many it&#39;s a tool to invite fresh ideas and new perspectives into their minds.</p>

<p>Again, you raise valid points about the effects of cannabis, but seem to fail to appreciate the nuance therein. Its effects aren&#39;t as clearly defined as either helping your spiritual ascension or aiding your downfall into laziness and depression. These options are always open to anyone under any circumstances and to link them so closely to weed strikes me as nonsensical, as weed is simply not the cause of these changes. A catalyst that can take you both ways, perhaps, but not the unequivocal cause of enlightenment or its opposite. There is no reason to think either of these effects have a causal link to weed whatsoever.</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, have you tried weed before?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like most people said here, it&#39;ll be different for everyone. Personally, I think if you&#39;re already open to more abstract thought, weed can be eye opening. Obviously LSD and Psilocybin and DMT are more mind opening and intense, but I think weed <em>can</em> have similar effects. At the least, weed can make people think more in terms of the big picture and be less self oriented, I think. Alcohol is the perfect drug to make everyone fucking stupid, so I think the fact that weed is still schedule 1, suggests that weed is potentially mind opening, AND has hundreds of economic and medical purposes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they <em>can&#39;t</em> control the weed industry like all others.</p>

<p>Growing your own weed is ridiculously easy compared to growing enough of your own cotton to make your own clothes; synthesizing artificial marijuana alternatives such as opiates for pain, ambien for insomnia, etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>Even if you weren&#39;t going to grow your own weed, enough people <em>would</em> that there would be no way to monopolize it. It&#39;s easy enough to monopolize pharmaceuticals because they can patent formulas and you also need a lab to create them. </p>

<p>But any of your neighbors could supply you with weed for pain relief.  Also weed <em>is</em> addictive. But it&#39;s not as addictive as say, xanax, and the specific chemical in weed that would compare to xanax would probably be CBD. I know someone who gets migraines and only when they&#39;re really bad, he&#39;ll use CBD- doesn&#39;t smoke. Also doesn&#39;t get addicted at all. If he was law abiding, he wouldn&#39;t use CBD (since it&#39;s now illegal) and he&#39;d have to get xanax. And then he&#39;d most likely end up addicted. So instead of only paying for CBD when he needs it, he&#39;d have to either buy xanax from a pharmacy, or from someone who has a prescription. Either way, the manufacturers of xanax still profit.</p>

<p>Finally to combine all these different explanations; weed is multipurpose. It&#39;s not a miracle cure to life&#39;s ills. But it&#39;s sufficient and serves multiple purposes, especially if you include hemp.</p>

<p>If you have to be prescribed a drug for your insomnia, a drug for your migraines, a drug to alleviate the side effects caused by the first two drugs you&#39;re prescribed, and another to help, idk, regenerate important bacteria... that&#39;s going to cost a lot more (and generate a lot more money) then if you just use weed that will solve insomnia and your migraines at the same time, and not cause especially harmful side effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weed in excess kills ambition. But its possible to smoke weed to an extent and still be productive- YMMV. Just like with alcohol. Or actually, just about any drug. Maybe not kratom.</p>

<p>But you&#39;d be amazed how creative one can get with the right dosage of methamphetamine. </p>

<p>And yes, privatized prisons bank on the drug war to keep them making money (pun intended.)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the cause would be unless they&#39;re simply looking for a new thing to tax. I&#39;m all for paying a bit for weed since a little goes a long way for me, so I&#39;m unfazed.</p>

<p>But what about something else? Will weed become adulterated by the government? Is it actually not safe for some reason that&#39;s being held from us?</p>

<p>Whatever it is, I&#39;m gonna keep smoking it. Fight the power or whatever.</p>
