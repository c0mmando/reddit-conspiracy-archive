       By this I mean, whos interest does it serve to have the whole world believe sea levels are rising and we'll be living in an oven in 50 years and what not. And who has the means to pay scientists to lie on such a grand scale? Why would such a hoax exist in the first place?

       US spends a little over $20 BILLION a year on federal climate change initiatives alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not counting state spending, private sector spending, non-profit spending, and international spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an unbelievable amount of money at stake on this issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all it takes to justify it is to publish a report saying that "oops, all of our temperature measurements from multiple sources for human history were wrong, the globe is actually heating up fast!"

       The enormous scale of fossil investment. The fossil fuel industry is huge. There are 1,469 oil and gas firms listed on stock exchanges around the world, worth a combined $4.65 trillion. ExxonMobil – worth $425 billion – is the second largest company in the world after Apple.
      </p>
      <p>
       20 billion a year would be chump change to the fossil fuel industries, Why would the gov fuck over such huge companies either?

       Bizarre that you would consider $20 billion a year from federal funding alone to be an insufficient motive to change some numbers in a spreadsheet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if it helps, consider that Exxon's NET INCOME in 2015 was $22 billion, about the same as federal climate change spending.

       The government makes more on fossil fuels than fossil fuel companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, your question becomes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why would the gov fuck over themselves?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And the answer is simple: they won't. Such a proposal isn't even on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Canadian liberal suggested taxing fossil fuels to the point that consumption would be reduced by half. She was forced to drop-out of the race and liberals disavowed her.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are imagining that it is "fucking over huge companies" when in fact, those huge companies publicly declare they are for "carbon pricing". And they are not trying to fuck themselves over. They understand basic economics. If the tax reduces use of fossil fuels, then they will earn more money for selling less product.

       Also, there will be a "carbon tax"; plus a ban on burning wood and coal in stoves for heating homes. People will have to rely on the grid for energy. In Florida, it is against the law to be off of the grid.

       It serves the interest of globalists. Everyone exhales CO2 and causes it to be emitted.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Global Warming" is a way too tax existence. The tax is worldwide and therefore a global agency is needed to collect and enforce it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government has the means to pay scientists to "lie" on such a grand scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did it rather easily. If you look at the terms of reference for the IPCC, the first thing we find is that they were created to find:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Man's
       </strong>
       influence on the climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The IPCC was not supposed to look at natural variation, only man's influence. According to their terms, we can be headed straight to hell, but it doesn't matter if it's not by man's influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's like setting up the FDA to find "the harm caused by medical marijuana". It was bound to be found, they paid thousands of scientists to find just that. And when I say "they" I mean, we the people paid for it.

       Open your mind. It's a plot to cover up what they had planned since day 1. They need global warming. Nothing makes sense it's all God that's basically what we're trying to tell you. A force so powerful you could call it God controls reality.

       There is no reason not to accept climate change sans the carbon tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scenario 1. The earth is fine. Temperatures correct. On their own. We keep putting fossil fuels into the air. We continue polluting the earth, killing off species, destroying coral reefs. We survive in some form, but the bio-diversity of our planet is gone. Global warming might be fake, but global pollution is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scenario 2. We immediately start making moves to halt climate change even on the chance that it isn't real. We get clean energy. Clean cars. Stronger environmental protections. Clean air. Clean water. and a far more efficient standard of living that doesn't involve destroying the earth to make money for oil corporations.

      <p>
       In some vague "scenario". In the actual world, the big bad wolf of Big Oil wants a carbon tax, liberal governments want a carbon tax, even  conservative governments want a carbon tax and the UN wants a carbon tax. "Sustainability" courses at universities are indoctrinating students into promoting a carbon tax.

       As I live in Canada and have already been paying a carbon tax and it will just increase (without any even really proposed benefit), I'm going to ignore your input on the matter.

       It would make perfect sense, because you would get synthetic growth out of a market.
It's the same with Organic food and green energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the different producers sat down and had a meeting where they discussed how they could reset markets and yield higher profits once again, something external like the environment would be a perfect excuse.

       I'm not denying that the climate is changing,  but it does seem like people are using more energy on discussing if it's real or not than to pump out water from the basement and building protection from the weather.

       So let's assume global warming is some big crazy hoax. Did they just go to every individual scientist, grab them by the collar, and demand they keep quiet? If the MULTIPLE SOURCES of global temperature information (ice cores, tree rings, global temp data from past decades, etc) were wrong, why wouldn't someone step up and expose it? Do you guys seriously think that the "scientific community" is just one big hive mind where no one questions anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Jesus Christ guys global warming is real. You have a gigantic fossil fuel industry who's got a lot of money to lose from this. You've got the whole scientific community basically saying this is real. You have this undeniable property of carbon which allows it to retain more energy from the sun (the Callendar effect). At the same time we have historically been pumping MORE of this carbon into our atmosphere for hundreds of years. Combine this with the multiple sources of global temperature data I listed above and you start seeing how climate change isn't just some made up bullshit.

       You  do know that the world has been carbon dioxide starved for most of human history, right? You know that the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere of the Earth has resulted in greening of deserts, increases of forests with bigger trees, and most importantly, much larger food crop yields, right? You know that the increase of CO2 we have seen in modern times is directly responsible for providing food for hundreds of millions of human beings, right?

       <p>
        While CO2 absorption and release is always happening as a result of natural processes, the recent rise in CO2 levels in the atmosphere is known to be mainly due to human (anthropogenic) activity.[72] There are 4 ways human activity, especially fossil fuel burning, is known to have caused the rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 over the last few centuries. 1) Various national statistics accounting for fossil fuel consumption, combined with knowledge of how much atmospheric CO2 is produced per unit of fossil fuel (e.g. liter of gasoline).[73] 2) By examining the ratio of various carbon isotopes in the atmosphere.[72] The burning of long-buried fossil fuels releases CO2 containing carbon of different isotopic ratios to those of living plants, enabling distinction between natural and human-caused contributions to CO2 concentration. 3) Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the northern hemisphere, where most of the world's population lives (and emissions originate from), compared to the southern hemisphere. This difference has increased as anthropogenic emissions have increased.[74] 4) Atmospheric O2 levels are decreasing in earth's atmosphere as it reacts with the carbon in fossil fuels to form CO2.[75]
       </p>
       <p>
        Burning fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas is the leading cause of increased anthropogenic CO2; deforestation is the second major cause. In 2010, 9.14 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC, equivalent to 33.5 gigatonnes of CO2 or about 4.3 ppm in earth's atmosphere) were released from fossil fuels and cement production worldwide, compared to 6.15 GtC in 1990.[76] In addition, land use change contributed 0.87 GtC in 2010, compared to 1.45 GtC in 1990.[76] In 1997, human-caused Indonesian peat fires were estimated to have released between 13% and 40% of the average carbon emissions caused by the burning of fossil fuels around the world in a single year.[77][78][79] In the period 1751 to 1900, about 12 GtC were released as CO2 to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels, whereas from 1901 to 2013 the figure was about 380 GtC.[80]

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Don't tell me you cannot logically infer that the injection of 380 GtC into the earths atmosphere wouldn't have any effect on climate change, biodiversity and ocean acidification? Maybe a carbon-tax for citizens isn't the way to go, but surely something must be done?
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is only about the CO2, not about the burned or cut (rain)forests which will lead to less CO2 being absorbed by plant life. And it's also not about all the other emissions the humans have had in the past 150 years, which will have had an influence as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whole ecosystems are being destroyed slowly, and you and I will the see the effects of that in our lifetime. Hell, I'm already seeing a change from my youth (the 90's) and my parents even more so.

       There are several reasons, many of which have been mentioned in other replies, but it's worth adding something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Europe and North America is where they are today as a direct result of the industrial revolution which was filed by access to cheap fossil fuel energy. They polluted like crazy, and had smog like you see in China today. And as things became more efficient, and higher profits grew, the government put environmental regulations down. The only reason these regulations worked was because companies had profited so much from cheap, polluting energy, they could afford new technology to comply with the new rules. Renewable energy sources are still not as cheap as fossil fuels, so just like the Europe of 100yrs ago, 3rd world countries need to go through the same progression to become economically strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here comes the reason Climate Change is promoted. The USA/Europe says they will follow environmental rules, and tells emerging nations they have to follow them too. Basically emerging nations are not allowed to develop using the methods that 1st world countries have already finished exploiting. In this way, it prevents 3rd world nations from becoming powerful, and eventually harnessing modern technology. It limits competition from other countries, while at the same time allowing these countries to be exploited because they are so weak.

       I hadn't though about it like this. It makes sense and is in line with the reasoning of TPTB. I find it refreshing that you think the global climate change is a conspiracy but don't deny the climate change itself.

       As an environmental science major who learned the fundamentals of ecology, it is a "hoax" because people have a very short-term memory. Take the California drought for example. We've had quite a dry spell and lately it has been heavy with rain. The media is touting that we are out of the drought and the people believe the media so willingly that they echo their words. The problem is that we are NOT out of the drought. We have continued to use water regardless of rainfall so we have barely, if at all, replenished the groundwater. Parts of the central valley have literally sunk tens of feet because the water, which was supporting the earth above it, is now just empty space.

       Climate change is NOT a hoax. I understand some scientists have overstated the effect, apparently to try to get more funding for themselves, but the global climate 100% is shifting. Period. Anyone that claims otherwise is a liar or a fool. People who have been around for at least a few decades have the life experience to recognize that the climate today is not like it used to be. I remember having snow on Halloween occasionally when I was a child, but today we're lucky if there's snow on Christmas. It's not a MASSIVE change, but it's still a change and it will continue to change. Even if human beings weren't adversely affecting the temperatures, the global climate is still ALWAYS in constant flux. That's just how it works.

       The hoax of global warming was also a scam. The difference between "hoax" and "scam" is that a hoax is designed to deceive people, but a scam is designed to steal their money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because there is a whole lot of money involved in the field of man-made global warming, there are many, many people who are feeding from this scam. In order for the scam to continue they need to keep hoaxing the general population. If the people wise up to the hoax, the scam stops.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the top AGW is enriching the elite. They are making billions from it. But more important to the elite than money is power. They've already got money. They want more power, more control over other people, over nations. AGW is the lever that gives them that control. They can say, "Because we need to save the planet, you can't burn coal any longer." The peoplel don't revote because they are "hoaxed" into believing the "scam."
      </p>
      <p>
       At the middle level of the scam are the scientists and writers and academics who make their livings and their professional reputations from the global warming scam. But the scam doesn't protect itself just by passing out sugar -- it also carried a big stick. That stick is the threat of loss of their income, their careers, and their reputations. Any scientist who steps out of line and criticized "climate science" is immediately targeted by SJWs for destruction. They know it -- they keep their mouths shut, even when they privately believe that the man-made global warming scenario is a complete fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the bottom of the pyramid are the people who have been convinced by the media and politicians to treat this global warming scam as a new religion. They are willing to persecute anyone who disagrees with their faith, just as fanatical Muslims will stone to death anyone who says anything against the Prophet. These hoards of true believers keep the scientists in line, and keep them quiet.

       Do you know how fewer positions are required in renewables? Coal, oil, gas, and nuclear require a lot of personnel working a lot of hours continually. Because non-renewable resources are expendable, they require people to constantly get more, requiring more infrastructure to transfer the product from the source to the plant. All of these jobs are very well paying. If the consumer/taxpayer could be convinced to shoulder the cost of transition vis a vis increased rates, carbon taxes, and grants, an energy provider could charge more for a product that was heavily subsidized and costs less to operate over the long run.

       What if the passage of Nibiru is the true cause of climate change?  What if a catastrophic geophysical Poleshift were imminent?  I believe that the PTB are using jet chemtrails and global dimming aerosols to hide our view of the solar system so we don't panic and quit our jobs and stop paying our bills.

       Climate change not a hoax, anyone with senses who has been following weather for the past few years can agree.  Sadly, I believe nearly every system setup to combat the negative effects of Climate Change is a scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask anyone in an area that gets light amounts of snow if climate change is real.  People who are living in it every day and not pushing an agenda.  It's real.  Just because people are scamming off of it does not mean it's not a real thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outright denial is helping no one.  Sure you hate the scams but acting like it isn't a thing just devalues your input to the conversation.  Our planet's weather system is alive and changing all the time.  Acting like that isn't a thing is going to cost us billions of lives.  I'm not OK with that, we need to expand our knowledge further and be willing to take action to prevent loss of life.  Seawalls around heavily populated areas are a perfect example of something that should be considered.  Losing a multi-trillion dollar city because we didn't want to build a billion dollar sea wall is unacceptable.  Step one is realizing what's going on, step two is acting to fix the immediate problems, and step 3 is trying to prevent it from happening again.  The scams want to jump right to step 3, while we still have massive floods every year destroying cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can debate over the cause of it later - I believe the world is moving in a cleaner energy direction anyway.  What we cannot do is be lethargic when it comes to reacting to changes in weather.  Common sense, you either protect your nest or move it when the waters rise.  I'm sick and tired of skeptics abandoning their common sense and ability to think for themselves.  Just because something you like goes against the mainstream opinion does not mean it should be free from your scrutiny.

       <p>
        While CO2 absorption and release is always happening as a result of natural processes, the recent rise in CO2 levels in the atmosphere is known to be mainly due to human (anthropogenic) activity.[72] There are 4 ways human activity, especially fossil fuel burning, is known to have caused the rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 over the last few centuries. 1) Various national statistics accounting for fossil fuel consumption, combined with knowledge of how much atmospheric CO2 is produced per unit of fossil fuel (e.g. liter of gasoline).[73] 2) By examining the ratio of various carbon isotopes in the atmosphere.[72] The burning of long-buried fossil fuels releases CO2 containing carbon of different isotopic ratios to those of living plants, enabling distinction between natural and human-caused contributions to CO2 concentration. 3) Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the northern hemisphere, where most of the world's population lives (and emissions originate from), compared to the southern hemisphere. This difference has increased as anthropogenic emissions have increased.[74] 4) Atmospheric O2 levels are decreasing in earth's atmosphere as it reacts with the carbon in fossil fuels to form CO2.[75]
       </p>
       <p>
        Burning fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas is the leading cause of increased anthropogenic CO2; deforestation is the second major cause. In 2010, 9.14 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC, equivalent to 33.5 gigatonnes of CO2 or about 4.3 ppm in earth's atmosphere) were released from fossil fuels and cement production worldwide, compared to 6.15 GtC in 1990.[76] In addition, land use change contributed 0.87 GtC in 2010, compared to 1.45 GtC in 1990.[76] In 1997, human-caused Indonesian peat fires were estimated to have released between 13% and 40% of the average carbon emissions caused by the burning of fossil fuels around the world in a single year.[77][78][79] In the period 1751 to 1900, about 12 GtC were released as CO2 to the atmosphere from burning of fossil fuels, whereas from 1901 to 2013 the figure was about 380 GtC.[80]

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Don't tell me you cannot logically infer that the injection of 380 GtC into the earths atmosphere wouldn't have any effect on climate change, biodiversity and ocean acidification? Maybe a carbon-tax for citizens isn't the way to go, but surely something must be done?
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is only about the CO2, not about the burned or cut (rain)forests which will lead to less CO2 being absorbed by plant life. And it's also not about all the other emissions the humans have had in the past 150 years, which will have had an influence as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whole ecosystems are being destroyed slowly, and you and I will the see the effects of that in our lifetime. Hell, I'm already seeing a change from my youth (the 90's) and my parents even more so.
