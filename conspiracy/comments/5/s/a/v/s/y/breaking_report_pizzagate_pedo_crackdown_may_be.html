There are an awful lot of people both hinting that this is happening, and those wishing for it to happen, as well as a great deal of circumstantial evidence - such as Ben Swann and Milo&#39;s being told to quiet down - that indicates they&#39;ve been muzzled for some reason, perhaps to maintain the element of surprise.</p>

<p>Chaffetz said that the conversation between President Trump and himself took place after the 2017 GOP retreat in Philadelphia. This was also his second time ever speaking with the president in person.</p>

<p>The Utah Republican spoke to the committee saying, “He came up to me and said, ‘you do a great job. You do a great job,’ which of course I agreed with. Then he said, ‘listen, I understand that I am the President. You have a job to do. You do oversight. Don’t slow down. You go after everything you want to go after. You look at everything you want to look at.&quot;&quot; <a href="https://conservativedailypost.com/hillary-toast-trump-just-told-chaffetz-go-everything-want/?utm_source=Push&amp;amp;utm_campaign=1_Feb-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=OneSignal">https://conservativedailypost.com/hillary-toast-trump-just-told-chaffetz-go-everything-want/?utm_source=Push&amp;amp;utm_campaign=1_Feb-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=OneSignal</a></p>

<p>This sounds like a headline <em>The Onion</em> would use if they wanted to satirize a rascist website. Honestly I can&#39;t help but laugh everytime I read it. Like, what on earth is a potato nigger? Like, I want there to be a new DnD class &quot;Drunken, Aggressive Potato Nigger.&quot; Is it his skin color, does he look like a potato? Is he made of potato, or does he eat potatoes? Does he use potato based magic? </p>

<p>These people have honestly become a parody of themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly not a showstopper under the electoral college, as evidenced by Trump losing the popular vote by a significant margin. There&#39;s also two more major factors to consider with your less-than-scathing rebuttal:</p>

<p>The first is the spread of &quot;Trumpgret&quot;. As people realize he&#39;s going to strip them of the ACA keeping them alive, or that he truely did mean his campaign promises literally, or simply as they note he&#39;s unable to gracefully accomplish even the most simple tasks. I imagine this plays a part in his historically low approval ratings for a new president.</p>

<p>And secondly, reddit is an international website and I hate to break it to you, but Trump is no more popular overseas. Countries around the world were shocked that so many Americans could cast so many votes for someone with so many personal and professional failings. The general concensus around the world was a simple &quot;What the fuck?&quot;. Those people also submit stories, vote on content and leave comments.</p>

<p>Trump being openly mocked on Reddit isn&#39;t some liberal conspiracy -- it&#39;s exactly in line with worldwide sentiment about his presidency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, why focus on Iran when Saudi Arabia is so much worse in its treatment of gays? Second, I never said I condoned Iran&#39;s treatment of gays or any others whose rights are violated from the perspective of international human rights standards. However, you are absolutely wrong in your general characterization of the Iranian regime, they absolutely do not believe in what you call &quot;global Sharia,&quot; far from it, they are fundamentally a nationalist regime that instrumentalizes religion for genuine philosophical as well as for reasons of social control. In any case, they have--certainly in the last few decades-- always demonstrated themselves to be sane and clear-eyed enough to seek nothing other than the normal regional strategic influence that would be concomitant with a nation of its geographic size, economic potential, and populational scale. Iran doesn&#39;t wish to export &quot;sharia&quot; (whatever that is), it wants to protect its own Persian-Iranian civilization from imperialist, colonialist, and anti-Persian Arabist incursions, it does not wish to extend its civilization beyond its traditional and historical region of influence, it is not U.S., it does absurdly seek global domination if that is what you were ineptly implying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew you would mention the political revolutionary origins of the of the regime, however, the influence of Islam of which Khomeini speaks is not militarist or imperialist, for that would make of the new regime an obviously unviable contradiction in terms. No, Khomeini speaking of an influence set by example, of the new revolutionary Iran serving as anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist model in the global fight against Western capitalist hegemony. You absolutely misread the revolutionary Khomeinian message (which btw has fallen out of favor even in Iran) if you are equating with the spread of what you call-a la Fox News--the spread of &quot;global sharia.&quot; But hey, don&#39;t take my word for it, ask an American professor specializing on the modern Middle East, e.g. Prof. Juan Cole of U. Michigan, my suspicions are they would not be in agreement with your Iran-instigated &quot;global sharia&quot; thesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not joking though...there was an opinion piece in either NYT or WT about how pedophilia/pedorasty is a disease and not a crime. I dont remember the details, but I&#39;m sorry, if opiate addicts dont get the benefit of disease and get jailed and shit, kid fuckers are getting their nuts chopped off.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to say &quot;fuck, Im attracted to kids, please help&quot; and being a fucking predator. Shit, does that ever even happen? Idk how i&#39;d feel, but if someone knows its wrong and is honest and doesnt actually do anything, then help them? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You nailed it there.</p>

<p>The way I see it is this. Pedophilia is a mental disease. Rape and child porn are crimes. The two don&#39;t always go hand in hand. The ones that rape shouldn&#39;t be treated better because they have a mental issue. They should be punished but attempt treatment at the same time. The ones that aren&#39;t raping anyone and want help should be encouraged to come forward and not demonized, not condoned either mind you, so as not to push them away and possibly become worse. Everyone needs to try and put aside the taboo of it so it can be discussed rationally. As we&#39;re seeing this is a huge issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because this sub in particular is an echo chamber. Half the population of this sub frequents the_donald, anything that paints there glorious leader in a bad light will be downvoted and shit on.</p>

<p>Multiple times I mentioned Russia and Trump in the same sentence in this sub, and literally every time I was shit on and people accused me of &quot;being brainwashed by the media&quot; </p>

<p>I got no problem with the_donald personally, however, these fuck heads need to get out of this sub if all they&#39;re gonna do is praise the president while ignoring all the corrupt and sketchy shit he does.</p>

<p>Politicts isn&#39;t football folks, we&#39;re all on the same team and we need to critique president Trump just as we did President Obama and Hillary Clinton. We can&#39;t ignore all the corrupt shit that&#39;s currently going on just because you may have been caught by the hype wave that was the Trump campaign. He&#39;s our president and we need to critique every fucking move he makes, because he&#39;s in charge of our lives in a way. You&#39;re only fucking yourself over if you take sides in politics and treat this shit like it&#39;s a sport.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the mentality that makes those on the fence not want to open their minds up to the possibility of conspiracy. Using this story as an example... OP&#39;s source is the Globe, a tabloid known for ridiculous (and wrong) stories. Fine, maybe they have an inside source. Nope, the Globe doesn&#39;t have a source other than its &quot;spies&quot;, and that&#39;s the end of the evidence trail. For all we know, a middle schooler could have written the article as a creative writing exercise for English class. Considering there&#39;s literally no evidence, not even circumstantial evidence, of Hillary being detained on her way to Bahrain, are we supposed to blindly accept the Globe&#39;s article as true? That&#39;s asinine, and if you genuinely can&#39;t see the importance of using discretion when analyzing evidence of conspiracies, you&#39;re part of why the tinfoil hat stereotype exists... don&#39;t make this sub a conspiracy theory circlejerk.</p>

Just because it&#39;s in a tabloid and not in the NYT doesn&#39;t necessarily make that report false.  We saw during the election campaign that most of the MSM ran only positive items about HRC.

    <div class="md"><p>They normally do not get sued. Libel suits against public figures are extremely difficult to win, and I can&#39;t stress &quot;extremely difficult&quot; enough. You have to conclusively prove malice, specificity and material harm. You&#39;re operating under the assumption that publishing a fabricated story about a public figure is against the law or something. It is not.</p>

<p>Unlike the NYT, the sensationalism peddled by gossip tabloids like The Globe actually work in its favor in the context of libel law. David Seaman was fired (not sued) because the NYT cares about its journalistic reputation. The Globe does not. Gossip tabloids can always fall back on the &quot;What would a reasonable person believe...&quot; defense. Meaning, their bad reputation actually works in their favor as they can argue that no reasonable person would assume their articles to be truthful or literal in the first place. So proving material harm is an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Plaintiffs also have to deal with the &quot;Scorpion Defense&quot; when litigating defamation against a tabloid. Two famous examples of this would be Cruise vs Bauer Media and Taylor vs National Enquirer Inc.</p>

<p>Tom Cruise sues Life &amp; Style for printing that he abandoned his daughter and Elizabeth Taylor sues National Enquirer for claiming she was sneaking alcohol into her room while hospitalized. Both publishers use the &quot;insufficient knowledge&quot; defense. Meaning, no one can absolutely know that these alleged defamatory claims are truthful or not, so the defendants require discovery on Cruise&#39;s daughter medical records to determine her mental state, or 30 years of Taylor&#39;s medical records to determine if she was in fact hospitalized and what her blood alcohol level was. The act of proving defamation now ultimately harms the plaintiff, since they now need to reveal personal information to the defendant which will likely be used for the purposes of even more defamation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your downvotes make no sense. I think people are reading what you wrote too fast and not really understanding or don&#39;t like emojis. I agree though. Tabloids muddy the water. It&#39;s like this, if you can convince people that some news is fake, while at the same time stirring controversy over who controls said media and whether or not what you read can be trusted, then it&#39;s divisive in and of itself to talk about it you see? We&#39;re bickering. </p>

Beck&#39;s lowpoint (when he thought the Democrats would win) was when he wrote an article entitled &quot;How Barack Obama Made Me A Better Man&quot;.</p>

<p>Basically, Beck was as terrified as the rest of the Pizzagaters that Trump would get into power. Either that, or he was blackmailed into compliance.</p>

<p>(According to both of them, it&#39;s well-known in the industry.)</p>

<p>Jones only outed him at the extremity of his patience with Beck. He knew for years and never said a thing. But then Beck became unhinged and started attacking him . . . and attacking Trump. Hell, attacking everything he once claimed to believe in.</p>

<p>Once he went full-neocon, Jones stopped being polite and outed the weepy, rubber-lipped Mormon.</p>

<p>(Both Jones and Dice talk about how Beck actually took acting classes to come off as less &quot;gay&quot;. He worked hard at suppressing his actual mannerisms. But when Beck&#39;s theatrical sobbing fits start, all pretenses of the secondary personality dissolve and you see the fat man-child on display.)</p>

<p>I was never an Obama stan anyway I figured he&#39;d get shredded by the GOP and sure enough that&#39;s what happened. The only candidate I&#39;ve ever been proud of voting for was Bernie but we all know how that went. Trump, Bannon, and Putin on the other hand have me legitimately concerned.

<p>Then you were just like I was. I got most of my news from CNN/Fox/social media. I was a fan of Obama mainly because he was a great orator and the things he said made sense. I bought into the hope and change because I always hoped America could do better and he&#39;s the candidate that made me FEEL like he gave us the best shot. I wasn&#39;t too concerned about the details, not many people I know are. We just hear the message and trust they will do everything they can to deliver. That is, until Wikileaks. The &quot;Red-Pilling&quot; everyone talks about happened to me in late September. I happened to be off work for several months and spent a lot of time online. Naturally, I started reading the emails. At first I was expecting some dirt on Hillary breaking the law with her private server and maybe some truth about Benghazi. What I found, day after day of putting 12 hour shifts into reading and researching, was it was much larger than a server and larger than Hillary. </p>

<p>If you think Obama was less worrisome as a president, explain how finding out (if you did) that Citibank literally picked Obama&#39;s cabinet. How can anyone justify that? Our first black president was put in power by the despised elite bankers. Obama did exactly what he was told to do right down to surrounding himself with decision makers hand selected by bankers. All of them. If you could rationalize that for me, that would be great because, for the life of me, I can&#39;t understand why this doesn&#39;t enrage people. We were all lied to, it was all fake. Political theater. I&#39;m ashamed at how intellectually lazy I was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“‘Don’t you think my daughter’s hot? She’s hot, right?’” Trump said, according to Brook. ‘I was like, ‘Really?’ That’s just weird. She was 16. That’s creepy.” Creepy is an understatement! The NYT piece includes so many other anecdotes from women who have worked for and with Trump, and have their own horror stories to share. A miss USA contestant, Temple Taggart, said that Trump kissed her on the mouth the first time they met! Jill Harth was working on a pageant with Trump in the early 1990s, when she says that he announced he was going to sleep with her, and groped her during a business dinner!&quot; <a href="http://hollywoodlife.com/2016/05/14/donald-trump-called-teenage-ivanka-hot-daughter-miss-universe/">link</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Four women who competed in the 1997 Miss Teen USA beauty pageant said Donald Trump walked into the dressing room while contestants — some as young as 15 — were changing.</p>

<p>&quot;I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, ‘Oh my god, there’s a man in here,’ &quot; said Mariah Billado, the former Miss Vermont Teen USA.</p>

<p>Trump, she recalled, said something like, &quot;Don’t worry, ladies, I’ve seen it all before.&quot;</p>

<p>Three other women, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of getting engulfed in a media firestorm, also remembered Trump entering the dressing room while girls were changing. Two of them said the girls rushed to cover their bodies, with one calling it &quot;shocking&quot; and &quot;creepy.&quot; The third said she was clothed and introduced herself to Trump.&quot; <a href="http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2016/oct/18/allegations-about-donald-trump-and-miss-teen-usa-c/">link</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously. I used to like this sub. When do they start banning pizzagate? I&#39;m fine with any inane alt-right political posts, because it is a slippery slope to ban topically, but the specific issue of pizzagate is a <em>dead horse</em> that we&#39;re the only ones still beating into the ground. Chances are it will go away if we just ignore it or start banning it. I&#39;ve been less interested in this sub than ever, because of it. </p>

<p>President Trump may be aware of it, whooptidoo. The pizzagate movement is a yuge embarrassment to Trump, which is why he will never acknowledge it. This is saying <em>a lot</em> about the pizzagate movement.</p>

It remains to be seen how it will go down, but let&#39;s face it, we are dealing with some sick mfs. Trump knows and he needs US to help him clean this mess up. When Trump said he was gonna drain the swamp I got the impression it was gonna be a literal draining, not a long drawn out (election) type thing. Just like when Trump said in his inauguration speech that we are gonna eradicate disease and unlock the mysteries of the universe  (paraphrasing ), it wasn&#39;t just somebody telling you their dreams, I believe he knows this is gonna happen. Think about it, who would you trust, personally I trust Donald Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It keeps coming up because things are happening that are relevant to it. 473 arrests last week in LA with 28 children saved, 30 adults. 8 pedo furries arrested a couple days ago. One thing that OP missed was Chavetz (sp?) said that Trump told him to unleash the hounds, so to speak, a couple weeks back. Since Trump was elected there has been a quiet hope among the masses who had to leave to voat to talk openly about pizzagate due to that subverse being banned. Regardless of what anyone will tell you, there is without a doubt something worth investigating there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that people are willing to dismiss anything that doesn&#39;t fit their own narrative, and willing to prop up that which does. It&#39;s telling that you dismiss Pizzagate while propping up the Russian email hack conspiracy. That is literally because of partisanship. It&#39;s no different than those who are willing to dismiss the Russian email stuff and prop up Pizzagate as a Clinton link. Either you buy into shit without any actual evidence, or you don&#39;t. Also, to be perfectly clear, it really really doesn&#39;t matter if &quot;NSA guy says it&#39;s true&quot; since you know as well as anyone else that government agencies are fully capable of lying to you, so I don&#39;t give two shits about who says what is happening, no one has provided proof of the Russian email hacks, so they are just as unverifiable as Pizzagate.</p>

The email hack thing itself isn&#39;t proven, but it is at least plausible - Wikileaks <em>does</em> seem to be remarkably and consistently pro-Russian, what with Assange appearing on Russian state television and trying to downplay leaks that implicate Putin.</p>

<p>Pizzagate, meanwhile, is based entirely on the fact that if you literally rewrite John Podesta&#39;s emails to be about pedophilia, then suddenly John Podesta&#39;s emails are about pedophilia!</p>

<p>I consider the ledger to be proof. That he hasn&#39;t been charged is irrelevant. Perhaps there is a more innocent explanation, and when evidence of one is provided I will be willing to hear it. But at the very least, there is sufficient proof that Manafort is guilty of secretly lobbying for Yanukovych for it to be worth investigating.</p>

<p>Pizzagate, by contrast, has never managed to break that minimal standard of evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Brigading is strong on this comment.  Bunch of ppl trying to make it sound like it&#39;s only about getting HRC and saying there&#39;s no evidence of her criminality....which details the conversation and is actually a fairly effective tactic.  The difference between pizzagate and most conspiracy theories is that almost no joke that delves into it WANTS it to be true...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing with pizzagate is that we ran out of any new evidence and we&#39;ve been completely dry for 4+ months. Ben Swansons video was reposted maybe a hundred times on this sub within the last month. Meanwhile we have new evidence and conspiracies against Trump every single day and everyone here either dismisses it calling it &quot;propaganda&quot; or downvotes it because it paints our president in a bad way.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry for all the abused children out there, but as a sub there is only so much we can do. Pizzagate has literally had zero new information for months and yet it&#39;s still a topic that is discussed every hour of every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is such magical thinking and wish fulfillment. Somehow, the only people implicated will be democrats. And apparently literally 1/3 of washington are pedophiles. Pedophelia is a mental illness and a societally abhorrent behavior. The idea that all these so-called elites are engaging in pedophelia on some grand scale defies logic and a basic understanding of human behavior. Ask yourself, if you were suddenly thrust into wealth and power, would you go ahead and start diddling kids, or condone that among your peers? Of course not. It&#39;s ridiculous. </p>

<p>Does that mean pedophelia doesn&#39;t exist? No. And many politicians (many of them republicans, by the way) have been convicted of sexual crimes. </p>

<p>Kakistocracy.  Simple gang membership rules.  Blood in, Blood out.  And access to Haiti, so human trafficking while above the law.

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, but your reaction is exactly part of the problem that has largely surrounded the presence of this pizzagate shit on this subreddit. Anyone who casts and completely reasonable doubts over the evidence, or more appropriately, the <em>lack</em> of evidence is immediately called <em>a shill.</em> </p>

<p>And I mean, you completely missed the point of what he was saying; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This sub is overrun with shills, but somehow they&#39;re all democrat shills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You calling him out for shilling is exactly what the poster was commenting on. Anyone who disagrees with pizzagate is not only a shill, they&#39;re a <em>democrat</em> shill. The poster wasn&#39;t calling people shills, he&#39;s calling out the absurdity of the attitude that this place is <em>full</em> of shills specifically out to get your vapid thoughts on something built off of greentext. </p>

<p>Time and time again I have seen people respond to <em>absurd,</em> and I do truly mean <em>A B S U R D</em> posts like this for incredibly reasonable ways that demonstrate that their comprehension exists on a level above confirmation bias. The rhetoric that surrounds pizzagate has always been one sought to demonize a particular population of the DNC and oust them as pedophiles in charge of a child-sex-trafficking ring, the evidence floats around in a gaseous bubble, and the attitude of those pushing it is noticeably political. </p>

<p>Pointing out that that is at least a bit unbelievable should not be met by the responses is usually draws on this subreddit. People that point that out typically get called shills too. What&#39;s critical thinking for? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Highly intelligent psychopaths are attracted to positions of power. They are also very charismatic and manipulative. Perfect recipe for positions of authority, including politics. I would also say that many child abusers are probably psychopaths, not necessarily attracted to children, but children just happen to be the most vulnerable, and that&#39;s attractive to the psychopath.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also this theory, which I find extremely interesting.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Kakistocracy</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>“One of the reasons for the intimate association of the power elite with child abuse is that they might use it to maintain their, somewhat hidden, ‘kakistocracy’: government by the worst and most evil people: a highly capable brand of psychopaths if you like.</p>

<p>Psychopathy is only mildly hereditary, so an elite psychopath cannot guarantee that sons or daughters will be just as psychopathic. I expect this entails that they need a steady resupply of ruthless and power hungry individuals who understand the world deeply and pervasively and, as such, are highly capable. Normally deep and pervasive understanding leads to wisdom and a sense of responsibility, humility even. But that is precisely not what that the kakistocracy needs: it needs the same depth and pervasiveness of understanding, but in combination with utter ruthlessness and the capacity to appear respectable.</p>

<p>Enter child abuse. By abusing children you “give” them an attachment disorder by violating or destroying the deep sense of security that is the basis for an open attitude towards learning and discovering. With this trust violated the child’s world changes from a world of opportunities, to a world of potential and actual threats. And often they will search and serve those who can protect them from these threats an in doing so giving their autonomy away for life. And they might even carry it over to their children: stultifying their growth towards autonomy. Aristocrats and priest must have discovered a long time ago that abused children lead to useful adult servants; slaves actually. And while this is despicable to people with a normal moral development, it is a positive thing for psychopaths who see other people as tools anyway.</p>

<p>Yet this does not solve the problem of keeping the kakistocracy supplied with respectable appearing, super high functioning, and completely ruthless psychopaths. Only a small fraction of the population (say 1%) is psychopath and as such has the benefit of an absence of empathy and a conscience: psychopaths are able to exploit others as if they were tools. Yet the vast majority of them are not particularly evil: they can be ruthless, daring, and callous, but they find mostly norm-abiding ways to be psychopathic: they might be mountaineers, military, ER-doctors, car or insurance salesmen, real-estate brokers, or white-collar criminals. But most are definitely not the high functioning individuals that compare with how the power elite sees themselves and would accept as their peers. So how do you recruit suitable psychopaths in your midst if they do not advertise themselves as such.</p>

<p>Enter child abuse again. If you organize events for the ambitious and capable in which they progressively can show that, notwithstanding their veneer of respectability, they are actually completly ruthless, you have the ideal recruiting grounds for the kakistocracy. Of course blackmail plays a role, but the suitable candidates gladly let themselves to become blackmailable because this gives them access to the inner sanctum of the kakistocracy: they proof themselves worthy members and loyal (due to their blackmailability) and in return they will receive access to power in a way they could never dream of on their own. After a while they become fully accepted a level that suits their capabilities and they will help to maintain the system that gave them so much opportunities (and can end their respectability at any point in time).</p>

<p>I think that what I have sketched above is a useful framework to understand the dynamics of elite child abuse networks. It is never an incident, it is “just” the kakistocracy maintaining and reinvigorating itself: business as usual. But the few moments the abuse networks become exposed it provides and ideal opportunity to glimpse the kakistocracy at work (and frantically protecting itself).”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are news <em>because</em> they are rare.</p>

<p>I mean, I went to all sorts of different schools as a kid, in different countries - some of them were really good and others... not so.  </p>

<p>Various bad things happened to me, but <em>never once</em> did any teacher, doctor, anyone even glance at me in a vaguely sexual way.  (I had some guy grab my dick in a record store when I was 12, but I just walked out...)</p>

<p>What about you?</p>

<p>These things happen - but they happen somewhat rarely.</p>

<p>There are seven billion people on Earth, and by now we&#39;re so hooked up that if something uniquely terrible happens to <em>any</em> of us, we nearly all hear about it - and even fairly common bad things that happen are heard about by millions.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>By the same token, it seems perfectly reasonable to me that there exist organized rings of pederasts in the world, even successful powerful ones.  What I do <em>not</em> believe is that this is <em>universal</em> in the ranks of power and that the rest of them are in on it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those cases defy logic and a basic understanding of how human behavior works.  You can&#39;t assume it doesn&#39;t happen just because it would be bad for those caught if they were caught.  Crimes like that happen all the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about rarely. I&#39;ve read studies that show a quarter of American girls and 10% of American boys are molested. And in Egypt a poll of adult women showed 50% of them said they had been molested as children.</p>

<p>But in the US most molestation is usually by family members, family friends or trusted caregivers, like priests. I don&#39;t see how the owner of a Pizza parlor would be in a position to be trusted with access to children in any organized way. Maybe I&#39;m wrong but I&#39;ve yet to see a scrap of real evidence yet.</p>

<p>The people involved in long term abuse have access to children who are usually out of parents care for some reason, orphans in orphanages or foster care, sick kids (with Jimmy Savile though some of his victims were teens attracted to him because of his links to the rock world), kids in private schools or private boarding schools. I just don&#39;t see a Pizza shop giving anyone access.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;ve heard of them. Both a person and an institution with almost unlimited private access to children. Technically Sandusky is not a pedophile, his victims were post pubescent. </p>

<p>The Catholic Church has long attracted people with inappropriate sexual urges who believe that taking a vow of celibacy will inoculate them against acting out these behaviors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how Pedophilia works.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/24/in-plain-view">I suggest you read this article and educate on how Pedophiles operate.</a></p>

<p>TL;DR, they actively seek occupations that have</p>

<ol>
<li>Social status and power so they can be above reproach</li>
<li>Unsupervised access to children</li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus points if the occupation has both (like Savile, Sandusky, Polanski). That&#39;s why alarm bells should go off whenever a high profile person starts doing a lot of work with children&#39;s missions in the third world etc.</p>

<p>So the point is; the rich and powerful aren&#39;t suddenly becoming pedophiles - rather, Pizzagate implies that people who are pedophiles have risen in the ranks of the Democratic party and are now actively creating a safe-space for other pedophiles to operate in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your explanation is good and explains many of the showbiz pederasts.  But look at this part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unsupervised access to children</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under what circumstances do politicians <em>ever</em> get unsupervised access to children?</p>

<p>I&#39;m quite serious here - it&#39;s really hard to even come with such a situation.  The reason that politicos are around children is precisely for a photo-op - nothing more.</p>

<p>Gym teachers, kids entertainers, doctors, ministers - all of these professions are routinely put in positions where they are the only adults around children.  Politicos, never.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in a recent report on Australia&#39;s 60 Minutes they make clear that people like Hastert (here in the US), Bill Clinton and a long list of UK politicians have plenty of time and opportunity to sexually assault young children . . . </p>

<p><a href="http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/worldwide-satanic-pedophile-network.htm">http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/worldwide-satanic-pedophile-network.htm</a></p>

<p>The story was called &quot;Spies and Lords&quot; - Predators</p>

<p>Children were picked up from &quot;homes&quot;/institutions and taken to Dolphin Square - an up-market apartment complex minutes from Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>Dozens of children suffered similar fates.</p>

<p>One of these abusers was the Second in Charge of Britain&#39;s British Secret Service -- Mi6 -- one of the most powerful men in Britain.
He has been identified as Sir Peter Kelson Heyman, but when arrested he gave his name as &quot;Peter Henderson.&quot;</p>

<p>Heyman was cauht with diaries of sadistic sexual fantgasies about children but the spy chief was allowed to walk free.</p>

<p>Of the victims is a young woman now of 30, who describes being taken to a &quot;forest&quot; as a young girl -- which should remind us of stories of sexual abuse and assault told by survivors here in the US - stories of Bilderberg.</p>

<p>Now, police have re-opened the case - also acknowledging they have credible evidence of murders by the Westminster Pedophile ring.</p>

<p>Former policemen are also coming forward to reveal the extent of the cover up and how their own investigations of politicians and government officials was stopped in their tracks on orders from above.</p>

<p>During the time of LBJ and Bobby Bakker, when &quot;affairs&quot; were enough to blackmail someone, they were running a scam in the US Congress of enticing elected officials to hotel rooms or apartments where they were making women available.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll also find similar stories if you read the Franklin Scandal where children were taken from Boys Town.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In other cases it was the heads of orphanages, boys schools &amp; the actual heads of the charities that were involved in trafficking these kids.  The kids are then brought to parties (pizza parties term actually is used in these rings) or they are brought to hotel rooms many times wired for video capture.  I would always look at the head or the founding member in the political human trafficking rings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more talking about people catching her lying under oath, violating laws related to handling classified information, and of course the destruction of evidence after being subpoenaed.  </p>

<p>Can&#39;t find evidence if you destroy it right?  ( Insert meme of that black dude pointing to his head )   </p>

<p>Let&#39;s also keep an eye on the Anthony Weiner case.  From what I&#39;ve read it sounds like they&#39;ve caught him both sending and receiving illicit messages from underage girls.  </p>

<p>If the girl lives in another state, it falls under trafficking CP I believe, and is a 10 year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence.   </p>

<p>So we&#39;ll just need to pay attention to that and see if he gets special treatment.  </p>

<p>Ironic this reply chain is about &quot;wanting to believe&quot; - you seem to want to believe anyone that doesn&#39;t support Trump is an America-hating sore loser. I protested in DC and think Hilary is a piece of shit - oh my God how does that even work?! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your foaming at the mouth, hate filled message is hilarious.  It&#39;s like watching shia labeouf yell at somebody and assault them while saying &quot;he will not divide us&quot;  </p>

<p>The anarchists at a couple of events are one things, the other first amendment practicing flag burners and the people who support them are totally separate.  </p>

<p>The anarchists wouldn&#39;t have a platform if not for the other people.    What&#39;s more is that it&#39;s pretty clear that with Trump, it&#39;s business as usual.  Ramping up wars, appointing bankers just like hillary would have done.  </p>

<p>At some point people need to realize that the 2 party system is garbage and the media outlets help them push the narrative that there&#39;s only 2 candidates running.  </p>

<p>Third parties get excluded from debates and get minimal coverage... and yet people are busy talking about russians, lul.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are many reasons for paedophilia.  It is a taboo behaviour enjoyed by psychopaths.  Paedophilia along with human sacrifice is also an essential element of Luciferian rituals.  Some men have a psychological weakness and prefer a sexual partner they have complete control over.  Very importantly, some ambitious people who want to rise in politics are invited to take part in paedophilia while submitting to being photographed, in order to &quot;put some skin in the game&quot;.  (Then the puppetmasters behind the scenes in politics will advance the careers of these &quot;men in the middle&quot; who can be controlled through blackmail.)</p>

<p>I think the problem is you don&#39;t understand enough yourself about human behaviour.  You should read or listen to the evidence of the many (now grown) victims of paedophilia, which is now available on the internet.  Then the claims of the pizzagate researchers would no longer seem ridiculous to you.</p>

<p>If there was any evidence, it would have been presented.

<p>Keep in mind, this is the same dipshit man-child that tweeted &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/258593090107998208">Remember, new environment friendly lightbulbs can cause cancer.</a>&quot; Because all scientists are secretly comic-book super-villains?</p>

<p>It&#39;s posts like this that diminish and discredit any kind of exposure of of <em>real</em> conspiracies. Pizzagate is a more fitting narrative for an Austin Powers sequel.</p>

<p>The difference there is that <em>Snowden released the evidence</em>. He didn&#39;t just repeat the common knowledge that the US government had global surveillance programs, he went into detail about the extent of the surveillance, what they were doing, and then he <strong>leaked the evidence to back up his claims</strong>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to make comparisons, then you have to compare pizzagate with the likes of David Icke, who also weaves a detailed web of conspiracies with NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;d be nice if you could cut down on the personal attacks and general rudeness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, sorry, that&#39;s not possible, this pizzagate nonsense has gone on for WAY too long, and with NO SUPPORTING EVIDENCE.</p>

<p>Yes, Hillary is as corrupt as it is possible for a yank politician to be, but there is zero reason to think she&#39;s running a fucking paedophile ring out of a pizza shop. She&#39;s a multi-millionaire ex-first lady, you don&#39;t think she could find a more practical location to organise the fucking of kids?</p>

<p>You&#39;re free to believe whatever you want, but if you don&#39;t want to get mocked for it, <em>provide some bloody evidence</em>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for putting everything up for debate with no reservations.  I also appreciate that people give good reason to question theories.

    <div class="md"><p>Because conspiracies are real, they&#39;ve actually happened (e.g. Iran/Contra, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_%28testimony%29">Nayirah&#39;s bullshit testimony</a> to help start the Gulf War, and of course Watergate). But this conspiracy is pure unsupported fiction.</p>

<p>Every piece of &quot;evidence&quot; for this beat-up is pedestrian at best. &quot;Look! This politician drew a map to a pizza parlour for some out-of-town friends! Obvious paedophilia!&quot; or my favourite, &quot;Look! There&#39;s a Comet Pizza logo in this children&#39;s game, an obvious attempt to normalise fucking children!&quot;</p>

<p>Now this post is claiming the Clintons have been &quot;apprehended&quot;, and Hillary is fleeing the country. Bull. Shit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s rubbish like this that allows real conspiracies to be dismissed as further nonsense or ignored altogether. If anything, this bullshit Pizzagate nonsense is a conspiracy to distract from real shenanigans and keep simpletons occupied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But for that belief to be <em><a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/rational">rational</a></em>, it must be based on evidence or reason. Pizzagate is based on faith and ideology, no different from young-Earth creationism or the belief that Xenu murdered millions of aliens in a volcano.</p>

<p>And your accusation of &quot;shilling&quot; is quite telling. I accuse people like you of having unfounded beliefs, asserted without evidence, and your knee-jerk response is to name-call and accuse me of &quot;shilling&quot; for someone(?) <em>without any evidence</em>.</p>

<p>Which you&#39;ll notice, I&#39;m arguing against. It&#39;s kinda my point. This pizzagate nonsense is as realistic and supported by evidence as the illuminati.</p>

<p>It would be nice if this sub would discuss <em>real</em> conspiracies (e.g. collusion between law-makers and private prisons, or going to war with Iran for fabricated reasons) instead of rejected scripts from Law and Order SVU.</p>

<p>LOL.  Bullshit.  You had no idea that, &quot;I could care less&quot; is what fucking retards say instead of, &quot;I couldn&#39;t care less&quot; and you got called out on it and now you&#39;re just casually trying to play it over.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simple logic, which you lack.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t care less because that&#39;s how utterly I don&#39;t give a shit about it.</p>

<p>When you say, I could care less, then what?  You could care less about it, but what?  You do care?  You could care less about it, but you do because you are empathetic about it?</p>

<p>See?  The fucken shit don&#39;t even make sense.  But you were happy and content being that fucken ignorant because you lack even the simplest form of logic.</p>

<p>I could care less is better to use when you really want to convey that you don&#39;t give a shit about someone&#39;s opinions. Also, the fact that it pisses off grammar Nazis who take idioms too literally is also a positive too. </p>

<p>Oh, I get it.  English is not even your first language!  Now, I understand.  But this is odd.  I found that on reddit, those whose first language isn&#39;t English tend to have perfect grammar and syntax with their writing.</p>

<p>I guess you&#39;re the exception.  Perhaps you live in a third world country and don&#39;t have such good schooling, such as Sweden and Germany?</p>

<p>It&#39;s OK.  All is understood now since we now know that you don&#39;t speak English in your country.</p>

<p>shrug, like any subreddit there&#39;s hits and misses-- which people who subscribe won&#39;t necessarily agree on. </p>

<p>i come here for the open mindedness of the posters and the &quot;non-mainstream narrative&quot; discussions. </p>

<p>the idea that it&#39;s a laughing stock of the site is to be expected... people have low tolerance for new and unfamiliar things, and the content of this sub is particularly easy to dismiss or laugh at without appreciating the value of being able to float wild ideas and discuss them. </p>

<p>Lots of unwarranted opposition to this post. Here&#39;s a question, if we&#39;re all just idiots than why the fuck do you care if we talk about idiotic, fake, not-true things? What possible affect does it have on you or your life? People in this thread are crusading that it is the biggest fucking deal ever that we not talk about a conspiracy in a subreddit FOR CONSPIRACIES! </p>

<p>No one gives a shit if there is an unfounded or biased claim for UFOs and ETI. No one plasters the comments with shit like &quot;Delusional&quot; and &quot;Seek Help&quot;. This alone makes for the strongest argument of just how unnatural and inorganic the opposition really is on this matter. You idiots keep over playing your hand and you keep exposing yourselves. </p>

Also, child sexual abuse is a real thing that has actually happened to many innocent people. When real problems which leave lasting mental and physical scars are people are speculated about recklessly, you are going to draw righteous anger. Calling them shills isn&#39;t helping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t directly use that term, but I think it would be foolish to ignore the highly probable likelihood that there are ShareBlue shills commenting this fiercely on one of the most censored discussion in recent history.</p>

<p>As you yourself have said, these atrocities absolutely go on everyday, and given the admittedly circumstantial evidence that we have been made privy to, it is not unreasonable to insist that a thorough investigation be conducted on the matter. This is just with the information the outside citizenry have been able to piece together, to say nothing of what has been rumoured to be on Weiner&#39;s laptop. Something this profound and vile demands investigation, and until that is adequately satisfied this discussion is not going to go away. As public servants, they should be willing to fully cooperate with this investigation if for no other reason than to clear the air and their names of any malfeasance. As the authoritarian elite love to parrot to us: &quot;If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People care about this story in particular because we&#39;ve already had one arrest of someone going into a family pizza establishment with an AR. Using obviously false and ridiculous sources (Dailystormer and the Globe tabloid, etc) just give people a false sense of assurance. I personally don&#39;t want to see anybody use posts like these as confirmation for them to go off the deep end</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First and foremost I do not condone what the lone AR gunman did by arriving at Comet Pizza with a weapon. It was a wreckless move that has only served to discredit the investigation, and while I would point out that no injuries occurred as a result of his action, and that even the question of him firing a round is speculative at best with multiple reports citing different stories, it was still a rash and foolish thing to do. </p>

<p>The action is so detrimental that the question of whether this person was acting on their own accord or was a false flag to draw sympathy to Alefantis is one that everybody should be asking. The shooter had an iMDB entry and is the son of an independent film director who&#39;s most recent project is a sketchy, mermaid based piece featuring young girls, as well as having ties to a children&#39;s charity. It&#39;s amazing how many people who find themselves involved with the pizzagate investigation are in fact linked to various youth groups. Tie this in with the fact that the street cam that overlooks the entrance of Comet Pizza was mysteriously moved the day before the attack and quickly replaced afterwards and it is hard to ignore how many coincidences surround this pizza parlour.</p>

<p>Also, calling Comet Pizza a &#39;family restraunt&#39; is the sickest joke I can imagine. Instagram pictures from James Alefantis&#39; own account paint a very different and dark picture from what you may have been led to believe. No one in their right mind is going to take their child to a restraunt that showcases bizarre, pornographic and pedophilic art on it&#39;s walls, hires acts like Sasha Lord and advertises with naked men covering their genitals with a slice of pizza and a bottle of honey. This isn&#39;t Chuck E. Cheese we&#39;re talking about here, this is an establishment run by a deranged individual, seeking out like minded people in which to indulge their perversions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So none of this happened. The 500 arrests in California this week were mostly Johns setup in a sting operation and the prostitutes themselves, a small portion of them were underage. Because some were underage it was sold as being part of this, which it simple is not. It was all low level.</p>

<p>This type of shit just makes us look bad, totally irresponsible. </p>

<p>If shit goes down and this turns out to be correct, great!!! Because they should bring the hammer down on these people, but I&#39;ll believe it when I see it. </p>

<p>While many of the naysaying comments here are from &quot;the left&quot;, your opposition here isn&#39;t &quot;the left&quot; as many would totally support a bust like this if it was based on facts. Your opposition is trolls from the_dick that upvote this just because it is anti-hillary.</p>

<p>Cycle is this:</p>

<p>This is a conspiracy - gets posted to conspiracies.</p>

<p>The_Dilusional sees that it is anti-hillary and push it to the moon.</p>

<p>Reaches r/all</p>

<p>Others see it, don&#39;t know the headline is in conspiracies when they click.</p>

<p>Oppose in comments.</p>

<p>conspiracy subscribers push back on negative comments.</p>

<p>seems like the fight is between conspiracy subscribers and &quot;the left&quot; that commented coming from all.</p>

<p>The left is not brigading you, the_d is overexposing these theories and making your sub look bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt certain arrests of people in very high places could take place. They seem to be too powerful to touch. They did arrest Epstein and he was connected high up so it could happen but I don&#39;t think it will go all the way. At least now also law enforcement eyes have been put on Elefantis and his associates. The thing about these investigations is that we do have thousands of honest FBI and CIA agents investigating this stuff. I think that&#39;s how some cases are successful, but then also you might have the same pedos inside the government or Intelligence that may try and halt the investigations. But I think it&#39;s some of these honest FBI or CIA agents that &quot;leak&quot; this information out to to where then investigations and arrests are made. It&#39;s not done by &quot;hacking&quot; and it&#39;s just totally different.</p>

<p>OP is being a bundle of sticks. She was not stopped leaving the country because she never tried to leave. She is busy working on her next  book so she can make another few million selling out and talking about it. Not doubting pizza gate, but when you use websites that are all about the return of Batboy and bigfoot fathering children as a source, and youtube videos of fruitcakes getting their panties in a bunch, you detract from the cause and make the whole case look like it is an assumption of a bunch of internet detectives.</p>

<p>OP, Shut the fuck up! You are making the circumstances look fucking insane and detracting from the actual truth in Pizzagate. You give us all a bad name and make people chalk it up to more internet sleuths who have nothing else to do between MMOs and wank sessions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly this post is reaching too far, but the amount of people commenting their disagreement with it makes me wonder why they all feel the need to explicitly state how stupid they think it is. Tons of posts on conspiracy make r/all, many with thousands more upvotes than this and are just as unsubstantiated. I have never seen anything more violently opposed than threads on pizzagate. Say what you will about the lack of concrete proof, there is a lot of strange things that people have dug up. Does that mean there&#39;s definitely a pedo ring high up within our government? No, but it does mean the type of people who frequent subs like this are going to look into it as much as humanly possible. Like, what do you think telling them their &#39;cause&#39; is stupid is going to do? Make them stop investigating? No, they&#39;re only going to try harder and accuse you of being a shill or whatever. You are wasting your time commenting here about how stupid posts like this are. You&#39;re not going to convince anyone who already buys into it, and if it&#39;s as stupid as you say, no sane person would ever consider the possibility of this being accurate. You&#39;re just making what you&#39;re trying to silence louder. Congratu-fucking-lations</p>

<p>Chuck Schumer, yeah, I can see him being a pedo. That whole family (Amy Schumer) is just all kinds of nasty. Disgusting if true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. It&#39;s funny because if you look up Steve Bannon, he&#39;s the dude that was at Goldman Sachs who decided to fund IGE, which was the company Brock Pierce and Marc Collins-Rector founded after DEN imploded. Goldman was also pretty pivotal in funding DEN and Collins-rector&#39;s other companies before he founded DEN. Anyway pizzagaters then point to &quot;An Open Secret&quot; as proof of pizzagate when An Open Secret was trying to expose Marc Collins-Rector who got money from Goldman because of Steve Bannon. Like. </p>

<p>What&#39;s next, <strong>Weekly World News</strong> and exciting stories about Batboy?</p>

<p>Fuck this bullshit.  If you use The Globe as a source for anything in this sub, you should be fucking ashamed of yourself.  For fuck&#39;s sake, they advertise right on their main page, where you would have to go to find this story, that they will pay ANYONE FOR ANY STORY THAT THEY DECIDE TO PRINT, no questions asked.  Pitch a wild story, get that cash mon-ayyyy!</p>

<p>Fuck it, I&#39;m going to start posting Batboy stories to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> every couple of days.  I&#39;ll just spice them up with some #BatFucker tags, maybe some claims that there&#39;s a worldwide bestiality cult run by...fuck, why not Tony Danza.  Yeah, fucking Tony Danza pimps out bats, llamas, and Pekingese puppies in the basement of a government building at Minot AFB.  The Libertarians are in on it!  Just them.  No other politicians, just Libertarians.  And...ummm...the Boy Scouts are secretly the security force for all of the meetings!  Yeah.  There we go, now to send that story to The Globe, Weekly World News, and The Enquirer, profit, then start flooding Conspiracy with this story.  Fuck yeah.</p>

<p>The Fucking Globe.  </p>

<p>I need to go back and see the exact moment that this sub died.  I&#39;ve got a suspicion it was the day Trump announced his candidacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sad to see that over 90% of commentators here are outright declaring it crazy and are first time commenting on this sub. People here are flocking and commenting that ban this post. This is a conspiracy sub. Any and every type of conspiracy can be discussed. It is called conspiracy because it has not been proven yet. </p>

<p>There have been numerous incidents where conpiracies have come out to be true. This may be one such case. Why deny that pedophillic rings have existed in western society. Several of those have busted in last couple of years. </p>

<p>The idea of this sub is maybe. Maybe pizzagate is real maybe not but it is better to have a discussion than not having one.</p>

<p>It is a well written post and op has privided his obsevations. You can discuss on its merit and challenge it with counter views. But if history has taught us anything then we must try to go deeper than to abandon any conspiracy for too many of them have come true.</p>

<p>Why is it hard to think that a large scale of underground child sex ring is not possible? Is is logistics or about keeping it a secret? Because both are possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is totally irrelevant. Do you think flat Earth is proven? Whataboutism to the max on that point. I mean really, the quality of sources is irrelevant to a theory. OP obviously put a decent amount of effort into collecting sources and forming a conspiracy theory. All theories aren&#39;t going to be winners and many of them are not going to be based on solid sources or information. Otherwise, just post it in <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> instead. It is one thing if OP was just trolling, with or without a brigade crew, but it is another thing to remove conspiracy theories because they seem unlikely or poorly sourced. I really expected the mods to scoff at <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>&#39;s misplaced outrage, as they&#39;ve always done in the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly not a showstopper under the electoral college, as evidenced by Trump losing the popular vote by a significant margin. There&#39;s also two more major factors to consider with your less-than-scathing rebuttal:</p>

<p>The first is the spread of &quot;Trumpgret&quot;. As people realize he&#39;s going to strip them of the ACA keeping them alive, or that he truely did mean his campaign promises literally, or simply as they note he&#39;s unable to gracefully accomplish even the most simple tasks. I imagine this plays a part in his historically low approval ratings for a new president.</p>

<p>And secondly, reddit is an international website and I hate to break it to you, but Trump is no more popular overseas. Countries around the world were shocked that so many Americans could cast so many votes for someone with so many personal and professional failings. The general concensus around the world was a simple &quot;What the fuck?&quot;. Those people also submit stories, vote on content and leave comments.</p>

<p>Trump being openly mocked on Reddit isn&#39;t some liberal conspiracy -- it&#39;s exactly in line with worldwide sentiment about his presidency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more talking about people catching her lying under oath, violating laws related to handling classified information, and of course the destruction of evidence after being subpoenaed.  </p>

<p>Can&#39;t find evidence if you destroy it right?  ( Insert meme of that black dude pointing to his head )   </p>

<p>Let&#39;s also keep an eye on the Anthony Weiner case.  From what I&#39;ve read it sounds like they&#39;ve caught him both sending and receiving illicit messages from underage girls.  </p>

<p>If the girl lives in another state, it falls under trafficking CP I believe, and is a 10 year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence.   </p>

<p>So we&#39;ll just need to pay attention to that and see if he gets special treatment.  </p>

If you&#39;re rich and powerful, a good amount of women will LET you (implying consent) do anything, even grab em by the Pu$$ as in joking of how much they&#39;ll let you do just because you have money attached to you.
