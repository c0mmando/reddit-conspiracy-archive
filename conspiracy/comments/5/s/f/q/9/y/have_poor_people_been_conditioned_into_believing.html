<p>Do you think we could do it easily, though? Post-scarcity implies that it requires little to no labor so as to be essentially free to everyone.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong I think we have enough resources to feed the whole planet, just not easily and therefore we&#39;re not quite at post-scarcity. We&#39;re approaching it rather quickly, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL;DR:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As someone who [...] was denied by 3 different banks [...] the emotional crush [...] from so much work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in what world is going 3 banks so much work?</p>

<p>stop going to banks.  go seek out venture capital firms.  and yes, giving up after 3 banks is a pittance.  come back after you&#39;ve talked to 300 people who are able to fund you.  </p>

<p>i think i talked to 25+ banks and 150 or more millionaires when i was starting my first 2 businesses.  none of them funded me.  i realized a 74 page business plan meant shit to them.  they didn&#39;t want to read it, they wanted me to be excited and for me to tell them what i&#39;ve done.  and i hadn&#39;t done shit because i was writing a business plan.  third business i said fuck them and started on my own.  $50k turned into $500k of retail sales.  but the margins were horrible.  so i closed up shop.  i didn&#39;t even attempt to sell it.  i left a lot of money on the table there, so next biz i decided to build it purely so i could sell it later.  $15k turned into about $300k of steady profit.  zero business plan, i went back to the VCs to try to sell it to them.  they threw money at me.  literally. </p>

<p>why?  because i took steps to put a business together and execute on it.  they saw action, they saw progress, they saw a working idea.  a business plan is an elogantly worded thought.  everyone has thoughts.  very few act on their thoughts.  get over your bruised ego.  go pitch your idea to a minimum of 100 different people.  hard work doesn&#39;t stop because you&#39;re pissed.  that should fuel you to work even harder to say fuck you to everyone else who passed you by.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFX95HahaUs">watch this</a>, the entire series is a great watch, though geared towards the tech industry, has concepts that apply to any business that is starting for the first time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a case of survivor bias, I tried myself about 5 times and have seen it many more, having a successful business has little to do with &quot;trying hard&quot;, just some rat race bullshit peddled by the money maker. Three thing matter: timing, who you know and luck. And even with that you are likely to find yourself with nothing to show for.</p>

<p>For every you there is a hundred failures, with no lack of hard work or good idea, with a crushed soul and fucked up health probably too.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurs and startup are to stay away from, they will still your youth (if you are young), and your cash if you have any to feed the real money maker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And there are thousands of you who are jaded and can&#39;t see reality for what it is.  &quot;Trying hard&quot; means you actually work on a business.  Success is defined by the beholder.  My first 3 companies left me with nothing to shoe for, they were successful by my accounts but not by market standards.  You cannot, for instance, say &quot;i&#39;m going to start a web based retailer&quot; and expect to be bigger than Amazon unless you have disruptive ideas.  OP wanted to start a <em>coffee shop</em>.  And he spent all his time on a business plan rather than, you know, starting a coffee shop.  And he only went to 3 banks.  In what world is that trying hard?  Of course he&#39;s going to fail if he gives up at the first sign of difficulty.</p>

<p>YOU yourself said you have only tried 5 times.    I&#39;m on try 5 right now.  Will I fail again?  Probably.  But you learn during each failure and learn how to better yourself.  And if you are letting your health slip then <strong>you are doing it wrong</strong>.  You come first, without you you have no business.  Please do not try to blame &quot;money makers&quot; as the problem here.  The  problem is you.  Once you understand that you will begin your path to fixing it.</p>

<p>Again come join us in <a href="/r/entrepreneur">/r/entrepreneur</a> and <a href="/r/startup">/r/startup</a> to further talk about this topics.  Come learn from the hundred failures.. or you can just bitch here and not learn a damn thing :D</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Trying hard&quot; means you actually work on a business. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>One definition we can agree on, our conclusion as to what happens when you do that will be different. I still maintain than &quot;trying hard&quot; has little influence on the outcome of your business endeavour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>YOU yourself said you have only tried 5 times</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Only&quot;, thank you that was over 10 years of my life, I guess I&#39;ve got that much more to spare for a tiny tiny tiny chance to &quot;make it&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>. But you learn during each failure and learn how to better yourself. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is our fundamental disagreement, I&#39;ve learnt that to better myself it is wiser to not meddle with a system I see as fundamentally unfair and broken. They are other avenues to better myself, avenues that will not take me down a path where I am a willing participant in that broken system all the while contributing to my community and my family&#39;s future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Come learn from the hundred failures.. or you can just bitch here and not learn a damn thing :D</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or I can focus on my family and being happy in life without engaging in what I&#39;ve determined to be a negative endeavour. Also, I&#39;ve learnt plenty, and we will probably never agree on what is to be learned, you call it bitching I call it warning others. </p>

<p>I appreciate the invitation but working towards self-sustenance and detaching myself and my family from a system I see as totally broken from top to bottom is a better use of my time.</p>

<p>Still, wish you luck on your endeavours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have the same endeavour, we just view the path to get there differently.  I will already be financially independent when I retire.  I could work a simple 9-5 job for the next 10-15 years and I will be done with work.  However my desire is to be done with working in the next 5 years.  I want to be able to spend all of my time with my family, not stuck as a slave for some mindless corporation.  However I understand there are people who would rather be a slave, so I will do all the necessary work to be a slave owner.  My ancestors would be proud.</p>

<p>I wish you the best on your endeavours as well.  If we cross paths again in the future, I will try to help you out.  I don&#39;t think anyone should have to figure out the broken system, but thats not the world we live in.  So my goal is to assist everyone that I have ever crossed paths with in life.  You are on my list now.  Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do, actually.  But I made my first million not from my business, but by investing in a stock very early in its life.  I bought $50k of the stock CPXX when it was like $1.50 after hearing about it&#39;s drug (here on reddit of all places).  I did research first, realized the drug was amazing and no one was talking about it and invested.  The company was bought out for $30/share and I made $1m based on the conversion to the new company and the amount of shares I owned.</p>

It&#39;s like NO FUCKING DUH THATS CAPITALISM HOMEY and they say, &quot;...get out of here you commie I was about to say it&#39;s because they&#39;re JEWWWSSSSS&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a simple math problem. You have a simple economy with 50 men, 50 women and 50 jobs. If the culture of that economy sees women stay home, those men will make X amount. If the culture changes where women now work, you still have 50 jobs but now 100 available workers. Therefore, while the number of jobs has stayed constant, the supply of labor has doubled --&gt; employers pay less (half) for labor. Is it any wonder that what could once be provided on a single income now requires a two income household (or a significantly higher educated person in a much more demanding field)?</p>

<p>Now, its actually a lot more complicated than that. When you introduce women in this imaginary economy, productivity skyrockets. Men have a main advantage when physical labor is involved, but increasingly machines perform those jobs; women are every bit as capable as men otherwise and so again women made the US economy even more of a beast than it was. Theoretically the added productive capacity should raise standards of living if both men and women work the # of hours that men exclusively used to work, or each could work half as many hours to generate the same amount of labor.</p>

<p>And this is where the fucked up part comes in- neither of those scenarios happened. Instead of having to work fewer hours or passing some of the efficiency gains of the added productive capacity (with women joining the workforce) down, almost all the benefits have shot straight to the top. This is why real wages have effectively stagnated, while profits for the very rich have skyrocketed.</p>

<p>Expect globalization and automation to do more of the same. The problem isnt women joining the workforce at all- the problem is that all added productive capacity (means of production) has been used to benefit the capitalist exclusively.</p>

<p>This is my current running understanding FWIW. Im sure some capitalist could come in and spew heighty philosophies laiden with slews of numbers and various economic indicators to prove me &quot;wrong-&quot; but there isnt really shit he can say to justify a system of such insane wealth inequality or where standards of living <em>in terms of financial wealth</em> have stagnated. Blaming the poor isnt a solution.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you exactly what happened. &quot;Get government out of the way.&quot; Libertarianism. Deregulation and consolidation of industries. And with all of these, productivity increases could be absorbed by the owner class. </p>

<p>You can see exactly where the wage and productivity lines separate: 1982. The year of the Reagan tax cuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats an important set of points to make as well. Really, many things happened that lead us here... but suffice to say mass additions to the work force was one of the biggest reasons.</p>

<p>We could argue about the destruction of workers unions too- in my above scenario a union could organize a strike to force the capitalist to pass on some of the benefits of added productive capacity to the workers. There are also other aspects too though. The bretton woods agreement where dollars were pegged to gold (and that arrangement ending),  the exporting of industry overseas to save on the cost of labor (by paying slave wages to third world workers), the computer industry (which destroyed many jobs, and is getting better and better at replacing humans as time goes on- a <em>good thing</em>, except again resources all go straight up), deregulation, normalization of shitty work conditions (because employers increasingly know people are desperate), etc etc etc.</p>

<p>It is not even disputed that our productive capacity in this country is far above what it used to be- and yet real wages <em>stagnate for the middle and working class</em> while profits skyrocket for the wealthy. Living standards <em>HAVE</em> risen, but <em>exclusively due to the power of technology.</em> Living standards have risen exponentially larger for the capitalist class who are even larger beneficiaries of this technology.</p>

<p>And many issues we have <em>because of our stagnation</em> exist now. For example, college. People are carrying massive student loan <em>debt</em> now for what reason? To put themselves in the market for the few jobs available so they can make money they need to survive. And who does this debt benefit? The bankers, people who probably package student loan debt into various financial instruments (because you cant escape the debt with bankruptcy), the increasingly greedy corporations, etc. This is just one example.</p>

<p>I really think MLK jr said it best though- we have lost our humanity. Our attitude seeing a man struggling to make it is to look down on him from our Towers and call him &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot; etc- telling ourselves &quot;it wont be my kids.&quot; But if it keeps going this way, that man may very well be our children one day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of my first Network Engineer job at Comcast.  They started me at $14.25 an hour.  After about 6 months of slave sweat shop call center craziness, I started to look around the room.  Dude sitting next to me was all psyched because he was there 4 years and just got a pay raise.  How much was the raise? 25 cents.  25 fucking cent pay raise for a whole year of sweat shop.  He was now making a whole dollar an hour more than me after 4 years.  Fuck that.</p>

<p>Applied to a managed services company with a bunch of data centers after 6 months of working at Comcast.  Was hired on at $25.00 per hour.  Now am salaried at over 77k.  All those dudes are still at still working at Comcast making only $16.25 after 8 fucking years.  </p>

<p>I guess my point is that people need to not sell them selves short and just accept whatever measly pay that is thrown at them.  Don&#39;t stagnate in the same environment.  Look around and see what better opportunities are out there for you.  Companies like Comcast prey on people who are happy with only 25 cents extra a year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comcast is a bad example IMO because cable companies don&#39;t really exist in a free market with true competition. In lots of areas, they have mono/duo-oploys and many people feel forced to do business with them if they want their x,y,z show/sports/etc. These companies, or basically any government run entity (which therefore does not operate in free-market) often treat their workers like shit, and customers because people have almost no one else to give their business to. Since the quality of service is so low, these companies are allowed to have medicore people fill these jobs, and many rely on having a semi-high turn-over rate to keep wages low.</p>

<p>Once upon a time I was a $6/hr callcenter monkey that got a raise to be the callcenter tier-2 &quot;sysadmin&quot; for $6.50/hr.  I totally understand <a href="/u/Homer_Simpson_Doh">/u/Homer_Simpson_Doh</a>&#39;s position.  The thing is, jobs won&#39;t just fall into your lap you need to seek them out.  One of the ways, I found, was to increase my salary requirements.  Instead of being modest and saying I wanted a salary of $35k/year, I put $80k/year.  Suddenly I&#39;m getting recruiters calling for <em>real</em> sysadmin positions.  Not satisfied I did it again but put $200k/year.  That&#39;s how I got the comcast job.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This kind of shit living is reinforced by religion, where work is godly. Arbeit macht frei, right? BIG FALLACY. The more you work, the more you sink into the quagmire of poverty and slavery, and you are to be disposed of like a used Kleenex. The Protestant churches are to blame for this. Be happy with your lot in life and praise God. Don&#39;t rock the boat. In the meantime, smart people are the ones getting rich. They also indoctrinate the poor with the idea that if they work hard, one day they, also, will become rich, another fallacy. Of course they want to support this kind of ideas among the masses, otherwise we&#39;d have a fucking revolution on our hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. This is my favorite quote from him even if it&#39;s his most popular quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.”

The right way to do it would be to invest in the communities as you alluded to.  One of my bigger life goals is to get into a local HS in an impoverished area and start an after school entrepreneurship class.  Ask them what their community needs most, work on a business model with them, invest in the business they helped me create, and hire them on as employees.

    <div class="md"><p>You know this came up the other day at work meeting.</p>

<p>I made a comment regarding Trump and how I didn&#39;t think it mattered what jobs he brought back because alot of those blue collar labor intensive ones will be automated to a certain point. Then I said that eventually everything that requires physical labor will be automated and that big part of the workforce will basically be out of a job and that maybe the government would have to figure out how to get universal (basic) income for everyone. </p>

<p>My boss immediately started railing &quot;ya that just sounds lazy, people just want free money without earning it&quot;, mind you this is a baby boomer telling me this. Everyone pretty much sounded off the same and I didn&#39;t want to press it further because there were more important things to discuss.</p>

<p>But after my meeting I thought how..? There are people currently working 35-40 hour weeks and can&#39;t even pay their rent, they can&#39;t even have the most basic of basic needs met (&quot;food&quot; and &quot;shelter&quot;) while giving up so many hours to the labor force. </p>

<p>In part I don&#39;t think its brainwashing or anything of that extent. I think its human nature. We will always be on each others necks no matter what, until we actually experience something new and adapt to it.</p>

<p>This has been underway a long time, even scarier is that mental labor is quickly getting replaced as well.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>On September 16, 1940, the United States instituted the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, which required all men between the ages of 21 and 45 to register for the draft. This was the first peacetime draft in United States&#39; history.</p>

<p>Assuming the citation (George Q. Flynn, The Draft, 1940–1973) is correct, 50 million men from 18 to 45 were registered. The Selective Service statistics page gives the total inductions during WWII as 10,110,104, which would indicate that the percentage would be somewhere around 20% were drafted based on registration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the happiest people I know have found a way to live very cheaply and live the life they want to live, instead of the life corporate America tells them to live. They work ~10 hours a week, live off of 10-12K a year. One of them is a musician with two children that she adopted from abusive homes. She makes 15K a year. Another lives alone, travels around the country, and sells jewelry that he makes from nature. He lives off ~12K a year. Those are just a couple of examples. I make quite a bit more than that, but I invest nearly everything I earn, so I live off of around 12K. (The high rate of investment means I&#39;ll be able to retire earlier.)</p>

<p>The point is this: if you choose to live a life that requires you to buy all of the things that corporate America is selling you, you&#39;ll need to work like a dog to have a few hours of free time a week. If you choose to to abandon all of that and live simply, you can spend most of your time not working. Now, some people really seem to enjoy working all of the time--and more power to them. But for the rest of us, it&#39;s worth considering if all of the things we own are worth the price of our entire lives. </p>

It&#39;s just by time Europeans started actively interacting with native americans those nations have long collapsed and without writing there was nothing to carry on the history but verbal account and considering how many tribes died out completely...well there is now no way to know the true history.</p>

<p>I think we won&#39;t really get far into this line of thinking/persuasion without outlining some kind of alternative setup. The ways individuals typically live in this culture define the overall system of inputs and outputs, and unless you can spec out a different system, people will have a hard time imagining what an alternative would be.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re right that having pride in this system is certainly unwarranted, but if you want to convince people it&#39;s not what we&#39;re meant to do, try to tell them also what we ARE meant to do, and how we can get to a point where it&#39;s possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My child stumbled on this old song on an old CD today and it really grosses me out. But the take home to me is, people like feeling like they have some control over things, and like all you have to do is be a  smart person, go to school, study hard, work hard, and it will all work out for you. And if it isn&#39;t working out for some people, that&#39;s their own problem but that wouldn&#39;t happen to you because you are a good, smart, hard-working person. Accepting that it&#39;s not that simple is painful. </p>

<p>the song: Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule
A mule is an animal with long funny ears
He kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny - and his brain is weak
He&#39;s just plain stupid with a - stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule
Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig
A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He ain&#39;t got no manners when he eats his food
He&#39;s fat and lazy - and extremely rude
But if you don&#39;t care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig
Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish
A fish won&#39;t do anything but swim in a brook
He can&#39;t write his name or read a book
And to fool the people is his only thought
Though he slippery - he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish
And all the monkeys aren&#39;t in a zoo
Every day you meet quite a few
So you see it&#39;s all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swinging on a star</p>

<p>Second, what&#39;s it mean to be &quot;self employed&quot; at the turn of the 1900&#39;s? Like, if I get a free plot of land from the government out West and start a dirt farm that just barely generates enough food for my family and lets us live in squalor, is that &quot;self-employed&quot;?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a problem that people have to work for a living? If there were no &quot;wage slaves&quot; as you like to call them, nothing would be produced. The economy would collapse. There needs to be workers <em>and</em> entrepreneurs. You can have one factor of production without another.</p>

I encourage you to read the whole article, but here&#39;s an interesting but that seems to contradict that idea:</p>

<p>&quot;Yet Forbes said that wealth in America has become far more meritocratic over time. It said that in 1984, &#39;less than half of those on The Forbes 400 were self-made; today, 69 percent of the 400 created their own fortunes.&#39;&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pure mythology</p>

<p>&quot;Be a slave long enough, and maybe you can become a master. Also, here are some complete lies about how easy it is to become a master if you work hard enough!&quot;</p>

<p>Still fail to see how working for a salary is evil and is on par with being a slave. I don&#39;t understand your reasoning.</p>

<p>So you understand that the only way the capitalist economy sustains itself is by continually exploiting the &quot;wage slaves&quot; and keeping them poor. Congratulations, you&#39;ve taken the first step.</p>

<p>You understand that the economic distribution is roughly a pyramid, right? Well, by necessity, most people will be living on the bottom of that pyramid. Why is it that that group, the ones creating all of the value through their labor, do not see the rewards of that labor?</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is that the ruling class maximises profit by keeping their labor costs low, and paying as little as they can get away with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But business owners and entrepreneurs put in the fucking work and took on massive financial risk in order to even get to that point, so they have every right to employ <em>laborers</em> who <em>voluntarily</em> apply to work for their fucking companies. Workers aren&#39;t goddamn slaves and they aren&#39;t oppressed.</p>

<p>There are two very viable and attainable ways to live in a capitalist system and a free market economy:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start your own business and take on massive financial risk on the prospect that you might get very rich.</p></li>
<li><p>Get an education in something that you would enjoy doing. Most people like a cozy job and answering to someone else. This is a fact, most people are sheep and they don&#39;t like a whole lot of responsibility.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And don&#39;t use the &quot;I&#39;m poor&quot; excuse because the middle and especially the upper classes are heavily taxed in order to provide grant money for those who need it to go to college. The underprivileged also qualify for many scholarships simply for being poor. So money is not an issue.</p>

<p>Time is an issue you say? If you&#39;re working a full time job or two let&#39;s say you can take at least one or two classes. You&#39;ll finish school later, but you can get it done. My mother did it and several people I know have worked their way through college. It&#39;s not impossible.</p>

<p>Yes, you have to work for money so that you don&#39;t starve. You have to work for a living. Just like if you were in the wild you&#39;d have to work to provide for yourself.

<p>My god, it&#39;s not &quot;dominating the weak&quot; when a business owner employs a laborer to work for the company. This is simple economics. &quot;Dominating the weak&quot; would be literal slavery, like we saw in the 1800s. We&#39;re long past that point now. And collectivism works for small tribes because they&#39;re small. Doesn&#39;t work so well for very large populations because it&#39;s very hard to manage and the power structures end up enriching themselves at the expense of the people. If you want to live in a communist/collectivist society go live in North Korea and tell me how enjoyable that is for you.</p>

<p>We&#39;re more technologically advanced than random tribes in the wild. We have enough resources and goods to provide for everyone. That we don&#39;t do so, and let people suffer because the free market is shit at distributing goods, is immoral.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot to unpack here. First of all, we <em>do</em> have slavery occurring on a massive scale today. Global supply chains depend on sweatshop labor and indentured servitude. You hear about stuff like this happening in Qatar and the UAE, but it&#39;s global. The US prison system, for example - remember how the 13th amendment has a loophole that allows slavery if someone is imprisoned? Private prisons make <em>bank</em> off that, they use prisoners as a source of cheap labor for contractors.</p>

<p>Collectivism actually does work on a larger scale, look at Rojava.</p>

<p>And North Korea, well, they&#39;re basically a monarchy at this point, eh? I can&#39;t think of any circumstance where they truly fulfilled the basic aspects of socialism (democratic worker control of workplaces). Some crazy tankies will defend them, but as a libertarian socialist I obviously condemn them - but do not see their failure as a referendum on the failure of the socialist project as a whole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you seem to be of the mindset that every single worker is an oppressed, miserable slave that deserves to reap the benefits of another person&#39;s years of work building up a company and doing all the other necessary work required to be a successful businessman.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they deserve to reap the benefit of the work they did. Steve Jobs didn&#39;t design the iPhone, teams of researchers did. And teams of laborers in China and all around the world assembled them. Those people ought to see the rewards of the product they created. That&#39;s all there is to it.</p>

<p>We also need to make a distinction - wage labor is oppressive, that doesn&#39;t mean that all laborers are oppressed. There&#39;s lots of self-employed people out there, lots of people who enjoy their job. And that&#39;s fine! But capitalism encourages exploitative business practices in order to maximise profits.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Efficiency is the problem with capitalism. The entire point of an economic system is to allocate and distribute resources. Capitalism fails at this. This is why we have, in the USA, 5 empty homes for each homeless person. Why we have simultaneous worldwide epidemics of obesity and starvation. The profit motive leads to irrational outcomes.</p>

<p>The difference is that a capitalist economy is run privately. By the people...supply and demand...no regulations. It fluctuates freely.</p>

<p>A socialist economy is run by the state OR by a group as a whole. There are organizations, policies, rules laws, etc. etc.</p>

<p>You think were capitalist? Then why are there ANY state/federal organizations/policies that control our economy?? Why is there an international organization for it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re joking right? Socialism abolishes private property and as a consequence wage labor.  These things are incompatible with socialism.  In socialism the workers own the means of production collectively.  It has nothing to do with regulations, taxes or anything a government might do.  Regulations do not make an economy socialist.  Capitalism doesnt require an absence of influence.  We live in capitalism, period.  The means of production are privately owned.</p>

<p>In socialism, the workers control the means of production. The workers. Not the state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then allow me to clarify. </p>

<p>I mine gold. I need clothes, but I can&#39;t make them. 
Gold is my currency. The clothes makers use the gold to pay for the tools to make my clothes. If I want those clothes I have to have the gold. </p>

<p>I pay the 2 gold nuggets for my clothes. Transaction FINISHED. There&#39;s no sales tax, no income tax, nothing. </p>

<p>The names you mentioned. That run said organizations. That demand I pay taxes for my purchase. And taxes for my earnings....Oh wait. It&#39;s STILL not a good enough example. Gold actually has value. It cant just be printed off and pumped into the economy to bail a banker out. Or to promote a stimulus for the economy. </p>

<p>You gave them names, and technically they aren&#39;t government officials. That still doesn&#39;t actually address the problem. You just labeled the people smart enough to get to the top of the ponzi scheme.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the rich siphon off profits from your labor. That is correct. The medium of exchange itself is fairly arbitrary - gold, paper, digital currency, could be anything - but the value of the labor you do, the amount of money you make for the business you work for, does not get fully returned to you. You do the work to make 2 gold nuggets, in this example, and as payment your boss gives you a shirt that&#39;s worth, say, 1.8 gold nuggets. Why? Because your boss has the motive to maximise their profits, because their shareholders want it. </p>

<p>Wage labor is inherently exploitative because the worker does not receive the full value of the work they do. You&#39;re focusing on how taxes are exploitative... but that&#39;s not where most of the theft is going on. Fact is, in the modern economy, most people <em>are</em> wage laborers, and they&#39;re being told that they&#39;re poor because of some specific boogeyman, when in fact it&#39;s the entire nature of the capitalist system, which allows people to get so filthy rich and incentivizes them to exploit everyone else to the greatest degree possible, that&#39;s at fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you fucking joking? We absolutely live in a capitalist corporatocracy.  Corporations are more powerful than countries.  All the federal govts in the world are massively in debt to commercial banks and holding companies that own the bonds.  Our monetary system is controlled by private banks.  Our politicians act only to serve the companies that fund them.  The IMF acts as capitalist muscle.  It literally just creates money out of nowhere, then lends it to nations on the condition that the corporations can move in and rape the resources.  </p>

<p>Why are there so many taxes and such high barrier to entry to new business? Because thats what the corporatocracy wants.  They already own the government and the land, they don&#39;t want new competition.  The big corporations don&#39;t pay tax because they&#39;ve already bought the politicians who introduce bills to subsidize them.  </p>

<p>We live in <strong>THE EXACT FUCKING OPPOSITE</strong> of a socialist system.  Socialism redistributes wealth somewhat evenly among the working class.  We live in a system where a tiny few have all the wealth, and everyone else not only doesn&#39;t have wealth, we have negative wealth.</p>

<p>They worked harder to get the bare minimum done, lived more communally and had waaaaay less free time, information and entertainment than we do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anthropology and Sociology have long challenged these assessments.  In capitalism, prior to the imposition of the working day, capital was free to exploit workers 10, 12, 14 hrs a day, 7 days a week.  The need for work in non-capitalist societies is more regulated by natural cycles and meeting needs directly.  Hunter gatherers  worked from 6 to 20 hrs a week to meet their needs. </p>

<p>Agricultural Societies were regulating by cycles of planting and harvesting, and while it is certainly true that during those phases work was intense and long.  There was leisure time between planting and harvest, and a lot of downtime in the winter months until the next planting was to begin.</p>

<p>Concerning the information and entertainment... People possessed different type of information.  They knew their neighbors and relatives better. They knew the land and what to plant and how, which plants to use for which maladies, etc.  Knowledge was different.  </p>

<p>Two important references for anthropology are:</p>

<p>There were some English critics from the Victorian period who noticed, during industrialization, that the working class was getting an increasingly bum deal. You might be interested in the works of William Cobbett and John Ruskin -- both are on Project Gutenberg.</p>

<p>Once overheard someone with a shitty job talking about how shitty it was. She was comparing it to someone else&#39;s who wasn&#39;t so shitty.

It&#39;s like how evolution will trim off superfluous things, like all-over boy hair, claws or a prehensile tail in human beings, since at a certain point in our development they just became dead weight, the whole artisan class ethic has become superfluous for most people. There are too many of us for everyone to survive in a skilled trade with our own shop and the owner-operator mindset that goes with it. We can plug ourselves into an industrial hive, though, and accept the morsels everyone else waits in line for. I&#39;m doing the shower thoughts thing on this post, feedback is welcome.

    <div class="md"><p>I think this will all be resolved in the future once we start creating humanoid robots which we can work as slaves 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Slavery, having been condemned long ago, will make a comeback and send us into a new Industrial Revolution probably catapulting us into the colonization of space. Although when this happens, what will TPTB do will all the remaining humans that are basically useless? Will the majority population of Earth be robot slaves with a few remaining human overlords to direct the flow of work from one project to another, or will we keep our population intact while spreading to distant planets thus relieving the problem of overcrowding? After all, TPTB can&#39;t make money off a robot population. They would definitely need humans to consume and borrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rich have turned the working class against itself. The Trump-voter section of the working class will mock people who question the maxim of &quot;work or die&quot; that dominates our society - they do it because they&#39;ve been told that everyone else is lazier than them and is profiting at their expense. Meanwhile, the people <em>they</em> work for are stealing the value of their labor. This country totally lacks class consciousness, and when the capitalist doublethink becomes as ingrained as it is, it&#39;s hard to get anyone to <em>develop</em> class consciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s your solution then? I agree that the work structure doesn&#39;t benefit but a few. For example I make a decent salary and get paid healthy bonuses, yet others in the same company make 10 fold what I take in. It does make you wonder, at the same time though, I know I am better off than a lot of others out there. Where can I complain about my position in life? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to strip others of their well being just due to circumstance. A lot of people fell into great situations, some took them and some earned them. Who are we to say otherwise. At the end of the day everyone just wants to benefit themselves and I won&#39;t sit here and listen to a pinch of random posters who wouldn&#39;t due what the wealthy is if they were in their situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something about your suggestions don&#39;t sit right with me. Working harder and being innovative has landed a <em>huge</em> number of people who weren&#39;t born wealthy into wealth. Even if you took all the world&#39;s wealth and distributed it evenly between the people, everyone would honestly make barely anything more than they make now. Some would make substantially less, yes, but on the grand scale that would defeat innovation and economic progress.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for incorporating <em>some</em> socialist values, but someone has to be on the top to make the climb more inspiring. Not that they deserve such a large share of the wealth or anything, but still. </p>

<p>Dumb people shouldn&#39;t be rewarded for their laziness or lack of intelligence. Smart people should be rewarded for the opposite, and often they are. You sound like someone who doesn&#39;t know any rich people who have worked 60-80 hours a week to <em>create</em> their fortunate circumstances for themselves. I&#39;d wager you aren&#39;t quite 30 years old yet, and have a relatively limited grasp on economic theory. I&#39;m not trying to be incendiary here, but please read up on poverty, welfare, and rugged individualism. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a cheap book series that is published every quarter aptly named Lapham&#39;s Quarterly. I advise you to find the one titled &#39;<em>Philanthropy</em>&#39;. Some of the greater (and lesser) minds of the world have written passages on poverty and the unfettered giving to the poor, and I think you&#39;d be enlightened by what you read.</p>

<p>Good luck, and fare well. Be the best human you can be; knowledgeable, unbiased, kind, and above all, wise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thoughts that come to my mind from this:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Old money&quot; today is what was &quot;new money&quot; in late Victorian times; most existing fortunes date back to the Gruenderzeit/Gilded Age, the 1870s and their surroundings.</li>
<li>Paul Graham argues that the main thing social policy can effect is whether the not-rich can become rich. (Massive income taxes tend not to make the rich less rich; they still have unrealized capital gains, and their employers can give them lavish non-taxed perks. In Britain before Thatcher, employers routinely paid executives&#39; children&#39;s private school tuition.) People will work much harder to get rich than for any other purpose -- and that hard work normally rubs off on others.</li>
<li>A social safety hammock is probably harmless, unless it can only be funded by confiscatory taxes; the danger is those taxes, on wealth or especially on income. There will always be people who want to make something of themselves; if they can&#39;t do it in the world of work, they&#39;ll find other ways to rise, and not necessarily good ones.</li>
<li>If you&#39;re rich, tax evasion is straightforward, and the tax you pay tends to be the amount you consider fair. The rich under the New Deal (95% maximum marginal income tax bracket) paid about as much in real taxes as the rich today -- in both cases about 22%, I think.</li>
<li>I&#39;d like to be rich, but I don&#39;t think I could work 80 hours a week. I&#39;ll settle for 40 hours and aggressive investment...</li>
<li>Conditioning to miserable lives sounds like a combination of the just-world fallacy, and <a href="http://newworldeconomics.com/transitioning-to-the-traditional-city/">failure to imagine that an alternative could exist</a>. The link discusses urban planning, but imagine the same thought process applied to personal finance. The stock market is very accessible these days, and some companies are really fire-and-forget; if you&#39;re willing to buy and hold, it&#39;s not very hard to support yourself, <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/">especially if you only think you have good taste</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Off to look up the Lapham&#39;s Quarterly issue; I&#39;ve heard of that magazine, but never read it. Thanks for the link.</p>

The US is being knit together by a new network of gas pipelines (the Dakota Access Pipeline was just one; most aren&#39;t run through literal Indian burial grounds, and therefore don&#39;t show up in the news), and the companies involved are mostly MLPs, Master Limited Partnerships, which pay colossal dividends (10% per annum is common, while the rest of the stock market will seldom pay more than 5%) and fund their operations by selling bonds. They often try and fail to merge with each other, panicking the stock market and driving down the price of their shares; that&#39;s the time to strike.</p>

<p>And if you don&#39;t have any free money, but you&#39;re willing and able to do welding in North Dakota, every last one of those six-foot pipeline segments has to be joined to the adjacent ones by hand. My brother worked on pipeline-building for a year, came home, and bought a house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me assure you and all in this post. No matter what type of economy or governance, THE SAME TYPE PEOPLE WILL STILL BE IN POWER WHO ARE IN POWER TODAY. Do no throw away a fractional and if needed self-sufficient government like the Constitution. I believe FDR was the greatest president in 100 years. He did not need a constitutional convention or a coup for a new government to achieve the American dream we reference today. Creating programs of employment and infrastructure lead to the boom and growth in the following decades. We need a new &quot;New Deal&quot; of economic recovery and expansion focusing on advanced physics(nuclear fusion) and manufacturing(nano fabrication). I know Webster Tarpley has his biases and opinions, but historical analysis and economics are his strengths. Here are some great lectures on relative subjects.

She wants me to go to college when she gets out so we both can have a &quot;good job&quot;. The thing is, I actually already love my job.. no I don&#39;t make a lot of money, but it pays the bills. I don&#39;t have to do back breaking labor all day. I get to sit on Reddit and read for 3/4 of the day and when I am working I get to listen to my podcasts and audio books on my head phones. I&#39;m incredibly happy and content doing laundry at a nursing home. 9 dollars an hour isn&#39;t a lot, but I don&#39;t care about money like she does. I wasn&#39;t brought up like she was hough. She has her college paid for because her parents  work at her collage. I can understand going if you get a free ride. I dont have that luxury though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is indeed a class structure that is firmly in place.  There is an excellent essay by someone who lays this out, I will find it if there is enough interest.  I will lay it out as I remember it.  The essay was wonderful, in which it laid out the thinking mentality of each class, and how it all supported itself.  For instance, the lower class, the working class had a mentality of honour in a honest working day.  The middle artisan class had a mentality completely different, and this was the main thing that separates the classes.</p>

<p>Basically, there are three classes, with three tiers each.  People can move up and down in them, the guidelines are in the essay.</p>

<p>First class - the Elite.  This class is all about ownership. There are three tiers in this, the top being TPTB, the people who seek power, just for the sake of having power.  Everyone in this tier is pure evil, apparently. Middle tier is the majority of this class, the bottom tier, the folks just entering this class - ie, newly employed people on the track to being CEOs, lawyers etc.</p>

<p>Second class - the Artisans.  These are the people who don&#39;t have to work.  There is also three tiers.  I am hazy on remembering details, but these are the celebrities, the artists and the entrepreneurs.  These people create value for themselves, instead of for others.</p>

<p>The third class, is the working class.  There are three tiers here as well.  The top tier, being small business owners/managers.  The middle tier is the majority of the working force.  The bottom tier, being those who are unemployed.</p>

<p>In the essay I read, he says those who get in the top tier of the top class, have to be evil, just to survive.  He goes into depth into the mentality of each class, whereas this guy just skims it, and doesn&#39;t mention the elite being evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it would be Church -- this was his only essay on social class, as near as I can tell, or at least the only one concerned with the elite. I felt like Church&#39;s essay went into some depth on the matter... but in different ways from the essay you summarized.</p>

<p>Looking back at your post, it looks like I skimmed it, saw three sets of three populations, and assumed you meant Church; the taxonomy you lay out is quite different from his. If you find the post you&#39;re thinking of, please let me know; it sounds extremely interesting!</p>

<p>Also, have you come across <em>My Friend the Mercenary</em>? The second half of that book, concerned with the failed coup in Equatorial Guinea in 2004, gives a glimpse into what members of the global elite look like -- and why they&#39;re not quite invincible, although they&#39;re certainly powerful. No idea if you&#39;d be interested or not; you certainly don&#39;t have to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in the trades. Everyone I know does under the table work on weekends. The smart ones do enough that they can afford to start out for themselves.</p>

<p>The trades are also unique that if you&#39;re genuinely talented employers are desperate to lock you down. So the pay/comp isn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s usually just not enough to have the hope of going it alone.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of people manage it, and everyone supports their buddies that do. I haven&#39;t seen many McDonalds workers come up with the $1+ million to start their own successful burger joint. I&#39;ve seen a lot of guys come up with the $10k-50k to start their own trades business.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t employers paying too low (skilled worker shortages - I mean guys who can do work worthy of a $1m dollar house not a $100k new construction shod job), nor the big guys being anti-competitive (with companies paying fair prices for subcontractors and piece workers they make it easier). It&#39;s a million government regs. Accounting has to be immaculate or the tax man accuses you of skimming, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know a woman who was a &quot;wage slave&quot; for much of her life and never complained. She eventually expanded the knowledge she gained from being a &quot;wage slave&quot; and started her own business(landscape and plant nursery) which is very successful. She is in her early 50&#39;s and never had air conditioning growing up in the US. She was my boss and mentor. I don&#39;t work for her anymore, but still have a special kinship with her. I work for myself now, doing the work she taught me. Have you ever considered trying to put in some work, having patience, and trying to climb the ladder one rung at a time?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I first read this as &quot;there&#39;s horror in being a wage slave with no life&quot; and .</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we are all here and want food, water, a nice house, and to have a good time, but if we didn&#39;t come with it, we have to offer something of value to someone else to give it to us. Used to be hard, but now in an everything-automated kind of world, you can make copies all day and have a warm room, instant chat with your friends and family, an occasional personal trainer, and not have to fight for your life.</p>

<p>We could have the government take the stuff we made, and distribute it how they please.</p>

<p>I personally am just investing like crazy so I can retire super early because I&#39;d rather put up my capital as value instead of my labor, so I know what you mean. But work in a sense is about respect when you think about what you&#39;re taking in exchange. Someone else cooked that food, made your air conditioning, and you are giving them money, which they can rest assured (relatively) is of value, because all dollars are somewhat of value, because dollars are generally only exchanged for a job well done.</p>

<p>So you don&#39;t have to feel like you&#39;re being forced to do something necessarily when you&#39;re wage-slaving. What would you rather do of value for the things people trade with you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of this thinking is based on Protestant principles in which only &quot;good&quot; works and duty can gain you entrance into heaven. (Not just belief, avoidance of sin, and repentance like other Christian sects) </p>

<p>It&#39;s something that&#39;s been passed down through the generations and bastardized into application through capitalism. Even today, people who are atheist/agnostic who follow this sense of duty and taking pride in your work don&#39;t understand it&#39;s just social grooming from religious edict.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t take pride in your work if you love your work. It&#39;s your choice what you take pride in.
