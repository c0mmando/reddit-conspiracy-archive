<p>Consuming too many depressing stories can wear you down and affect your mental state. Stuff like human trafficking, pedophilia, and murder can scar you emotionally and make you extremely paranoid.</p>

<p>Idk what others do around here but I hit up other subs to detox for a while, even take breaks for a little bit, cus man, this shit can wear you down.</p>

<p>Stay positive and take care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that material world is an illusion, an interference pattern created by subjective consciousness is not evil. It is the maya in buddhist thought. &quot;We are not if this world &quot; in the words of Christ. It is a liberating epiphany. </p>

<p>If the horrible crimes of the eich and powerful make you depressed may I suggest a turn to the left? The veda, pythagoras, the gnostics. Alchemy? Truth lies within the hidden and esoteric sciences. The occult. It shall set you free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Esoteric means inner. Psychology and philosophy are both examples of esoteric science, while for example physics would be exoteric, science dealing with the external world. The esoteric sciences are the study of the self and the inner world.</p>

<p>Meta-physics is one of the foundation stones of philosophy. It deals with the immaterial concepts that we use to define for example truth. It is the basis of for example mathematics. </p>

<p>So it is definitly science. However its practioners were burned at the stakes by the church as heretics forcing it underground for almost two millenia. Occult=hidden. </p>

<p>For a more academically accepted version, you can never go wrong with Plato.</p>

<p>But what you will find is the true reality. That all of these religions, projections of evil,  etc are false. That the new age beliefs that permeates this subreddit are of an astrological origin etc. That the &quot;satanic pedo cults&quot; do not actually exist. That the mental prison you live in is the same as Plato&#39;s cave. </p>

<p>Or you can study mediums channeling aliens from the pleiades, belive in nazis in antarcti and a grand masonic conspiracy which include beyoncé. Scientifically of course </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know how you can say this and then act like you have read the Law of One material. Ra tried to do everything they could to not be worshiped back in Egypt, but they shared too much too quickly and the people turned them into Gods. That&#39;s why they left - they had messed up the introduction.</p>

<p>By attempting to help us progress, they kept opening up opportunities for the Service-to-Self &#39;Orion group&#39; to make contact as well, which led to religion (the priest class) and &#39;elitism&#39; on earth. Ra had already decided not to come back in physical form, so they had to find new ways of making contact and passing along information. The Orion Group, however, had humans who desired power and were willing to listen, and that&#39;s how &#39;the elite&#39; got their start. Equal opportunity for service to self or to others - they push each other ever upwards. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also I have a feeling that the same people (so called &quot;ra&quot;, etc?) who are spreading such lies are also the ones that caused genocides against the people on mars and earth back then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The genocides were created by our own free will. The technology may have been passed along by Ra, but it was more likely that it was an Service-to-self entity or that a positive technology was twisted for negative use. I&#39;m not sure how anybody could paint Ra as a negative entity, considering how much energy they spent to preserve free will throughout.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people apparently &quot;out there&quot; (space?,underground bases?) are apparently/seemingly spreading such information/lies (some truth with a lot of lies) out there because they seem to want to control other people.</p>

<p>How does this play into Law of One? Don and Carla are dead, not sure about Jim but they don&#39;t really monetize anything off this stuff. The Law of One is the opposite of controlling - it&#39;s freeing. It tells you to do your thing - not follow some path. So how did you feel the Law of One was controlling? i&#39;m curious, just even for my own perception. It is good to see different angles.</p>

Major catastrophes have ruined our Earth.  We aren&#39;t new.  We advance, get wiped the fuck out, and have to start all over again.  Who knows what human beings have accomplished?  Did we fly off somewhere?  Did we build the moon?  Were we visited by ETs?  If you can get down with the idea that we know little about our history, it forces you to ask a lot of questions.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H5LCLljJho">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H5LCLljJho</a></p>

<p>I like doing this. The problem is that there&#39;s now at least one plane per minute flying over the place I live (in the Norwegian countryside, far from airports). I use flightradar24 every now and then, and have noticed that international flights from places like Stockholm to cities like Chicago or New York for some reason fly directly above the rural village I live in. And then there&#39;s all the other traffic (which doesn&#39;t show up on flightradar), namely military/chemtrail planes + unidentified objects. Lots of contrails and chemtrails in the skies here now, and it&#39;s definitely gotten a lot worse lately. It&#39;s hard to stay focused on nature these days. </p>

<p>This really helps to keep things in perspective. If the weather&#39;s too terrible, music is great. </p>

<p>This amazing recording of Vaughan Williams&#39; Thomas Tallis fantasia from Gloucester Cathedral is ethereal and soul stirring and reminds us that even though humans are capable of truly terrible things, we are also capable of amazing, profound and beautiful things also.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really good timing. Feeling very bad about everything I read lately and the more you read, the worse it gets. Not everything is true obviously but elements of truth pop through and its getting to me. </p>

<p>Spent 12 yrs in the military and was always very anti anything government conspiracy related. I was just brainwashed and I realise it now. Thats what hurts the most. People I try to talk to about it to hear their views just dont seem to give a shit.  </p>

<p>I have tried and detox from the site (I always read, rarely post) but by not logging on to the site I still find myself having a sneaky refresh of Narwhal after about 2 hrs which defeats the purpose.. I even have to stop myself when I wake up from having a quck scan before I get out of bed. My brain is worn out. </p>

<p>Only recently found the C_S_T sub as well. Oh man. Deep doesnt even begin to describe the hole. </p>

I never claimed to have all the answers and i never said you were a sheep. And if you want an answer to a question you could just ask. I cant explain everything in one message lol.. the world isnt so black and white and im not here to attack you or anyone else. There are many different layers in which people experience reality and are able to discern fact from fiction. Reality is a subjective perception of what is really there. And im always in pursuit of knowledge as i dont have all the answers and never will. Your &quot;reality&quot; isnt any more valid than mine, vice versa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this post. It&#39;s good to give these reminders every once in a while. I for one can say that I&#39;ve been extremely negative with this whole American election. With the WikiLeaks about Clinton and the pedogate scandal, seeing so much inaction on this corruption...It is really draining. It&#39;s hard to see so many people indoctrinated to their side of the coin. Being a comedian, seeing so many people that I love in the industry jumping on the bandwagon, it&#39;s sad. It&#39;s sad that I feel uncomfortable having conversations about all this crap with my friends and family, fearing that they&#39;ll think I&#39;m certifiable. 
The recent arrests have been uplifting though. People like Alex jones, Ben Swann, Jason chaffetz and a few others give me hope though.</p>

<p>Stay REAL.  <em>That&#39;s</em> what everyone has to do.  Stay fucking <em>real</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the reality of this planet is that it is a very, very evil place.  So long as the evil continues though, it is not the job of the truth seeker and of the person who&#39;s trying to do away with that evil to &quot;detox&quot; from the evil.  Fuck no.  So long as the evil continues to exist, the battler continuously has to <em>fight</em> it.</p>

<p>The shit is ugly.  The shit is evil.  And the evil doesn&#39;t stop.  It doesn&#39;t take a break.</p>

<p>So neither can they who are working on stopping it.</p>

<p>The key is not to &quot;take a break&quot;.  The key is to know how to take on the type of world view and mentality that has the ability to keep its sanity while still understanding that the world is in fact this evil.</p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly not an easy thing to do, but so long as the evil continues on this planet, I don&#39;t think anyone is doing a service to the truth movement by &quot;taking a break&quot; from it.</p>

<p>So long as you&#39;re taking a break, the evil is continuing.</p>

<p><em>Fight</em> it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, this is upsetting... At the risk of sounding like someone the Feds should be watching, I love reading and learning about twisted shit like homicide. I love learning about the fucked up psychology of it all. </p>

<p>But at the same time, I am a little neurotic in certain contexts... But mostly about scenarios where someone has a heart attack and I don&#39;t have a proper breathing barrier, or where someone is seriously injured and I don&#39;t have the proper supplies to help to the very best of my abilities. And, God forbid, being stuck somewhere without my knitting. It comes with me EVERYWHERE. What if my car breaks down five minutes from my house and I have nothing to do while waiting for a tow truck? Fucking NOPE. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a decent paper going into the physiological changes, increased gray matter density in something silly like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3004979/">9 hours of meditation</a>. I&#39;m sorry that you didn&#39;t find it helpful in the past, how long were you sitting for? When I first started, it seemed like I needed a good 15-20 minute session to have noticeable effect afterward. I haven&#39;t meditated with any regularity in years, but now just a couple minutes of mindfulness meditation takes me from meltdown to a super even keel. </p>
