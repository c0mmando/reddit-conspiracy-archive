<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXGuJlTVXfw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXGuJlTVXfw</a></p>

<p>The second half gets really strange. They have deposition footage where he&#39;s trying to read. </p>

<p>Samantha Bee ran the same story in October as a joke, but maybe it&#39;s not a joke? The new video uses a lot of the same footage:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFkN7QGp2c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFkN7QGp2c</a></p>

<p>I checked to see if anyone had already posted about this, and saw this recent video where he&#39;s actually reading his travel ban law:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M861PkCDmT0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M861PkCDmT0</a></p>

<p>I was surprised to see such direct contradiction to the report. It seemed like such a weird coincidence. But then I watched the video, and it&#39;s pretty strange. He reads it, and explains it to the crowd the way you would to a child. It comes off like he&#39;s being condescending, but after watching the conspiracy video, maybe this is just the level he reads at?</p>

<p>He spends so much time talking about reading and writing. Is it possible he&#39;s directly responding to the conspiracy video?</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, if there happen to be any Trump voters in this sub, would you have voted for him if you knew he could only read at a 3rd grade level?</p>

<p>But no they still would have voted for him. They apparently love demagogues and oligarchs running their lives. They&#39;re too stupid to understand that theyre lying down and just letting them put boots on their throats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to go with the theory that he once was literate (college, military academy, etc), but over the last few decades has been solely reliant on TV and what people verbally tell him.  Most of his most outlandish statements are rooted in a story he heard or something he saw on TV.  The fact that he admits doesn&#39;t read books, or use a computer, would support this. All of his reactions are to something verbally or visually presented to him.  If the guy actually read the stuff on the internet his twitter feed would be off the charts more than it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on how you use the language, I guess.</p>

<p>A strawman argument is, according to wiki,  &quot;refuting an opponent&#39;s argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not advanced by that opponent.&quot;  </p>

<p>The strawman in the &quot;strawman argument&quot; is the false model.  Strawmen are constructed things.  They are sometimes intimidating upon superficial analysis, but upon closer inspection they are not.  They are easily torn down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy doing this is obviously reading off a combo of his screen and que cards. Watch his eyes. Very silly given the context. Also, he&#39;s using short disected clips of Trump from different occasions. Plus he had all the time in the world to edit it together, unlike Trump. Also? Trump&#39;s &quot;you knows?&quot; are just Obama&#39;s &quot;ahhhs&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;I signed hundreds&quot;... HE WAS A GODDAMNED BUSINESSMAN. He has people for that. He has a whole group of lawyers and advisors for that whole reason. Fun fact: as president he has a whole cabinet with specific niches that are far more powerful and knowledgeable then when he was a business mogul. You think Obama and Bush did everything themselves with the entire weight of the Executive Branch at their fingertips?</p>
