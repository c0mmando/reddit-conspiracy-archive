       I know this sounds ridiculous, but I saw this video and it's pretty compelling:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXGuJlTVXfw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXGuJlTVXfw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The second half gets really strange. They have deposition footage where he's trying to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       Samantha Bee ran the same story in October as a joke, but maybe it's not a joke? The new video uses a lot of the same footage:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFkN7QGp2c">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LFkN7QGp2c
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I checked to see if anyone had already posted about this, and saw this recent video where he's actually reading his travel ban law:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M861PkCDmT0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M861PkCDmT0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I was surprised to see such direct contradiction to the report. It seemed like such a weird coincidence. But then I watched the video, and it's pretty strange. He reads it, and explains it to the crowd the way you would to a child. It comes off like he's being condescending, but after watching the conspiracy video, maybe this is just the level he reads at?
      </p>
      <p>
       He spends so much time talking about reading and writing. Is it possible he's directly responding to the conspiracy video?
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of curiosity, if there happen to be any Trump voters in this sub, would you have voted for him if you knew he could only read at a 3rd grade level?

       But no they still would have voted for him. They apparently love demagogues and oligarchs running their lives. They're too stupid to understand that theyre lying down and just letting them put boots on their throats.

       I don't like Trump at all but this is so BS. Dude convinced thousands of people he was an outsider from atop a gilded penthouse and has "freethinkers" hanging on to his every word as though he's some anti-establishment pariah. He's not an idiot.

       You're right. You can be smart and have dyslexia or something similar. Usually when people would accuse someone of not being able to read or do other normally simple tasks they are implying said person is an idiot however.

       I don't agree with that. I can't recall anyone claiming he wasn't intelligent. I think we all understand that to do what he's done takes significant skills. And as other posters have said, there's nothing linking intelligence to literacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he can't read, it really says something about the life he's lead. Why learn to read if you have every need provided for you?

       I'll watch the Dinner video again. My memory of it was that it was pretty stilted. But he often acts like he's reading something. It's hard to say if he actually is. He certainly ad libs a lot. Usually off topic.

       Yes.  I still would have voted for him.  Actually if he can compensate for dyslexia and make billions of dollars, be a successful tv personality and then top it off with POTUS, then I am doubly impressed.

       I am going to go with the theory that he once was literate (college, military academy, etc), but over the last few decades has been solely reliant on TV and what people verbally tell him.  Most of his most outlandish statements are rooted in a story he heard or something he saw on TV.  The fact that he admits doesn't read books, or use a computer, would support this. All of his reactions are to something verbally or visually presented to him.  If the guy actually read the stuff on the internet his twitter feed would be off the charts more than it is.

       Isn't a straw man argument a counter point to someone else's claim, but I rephrase their claim inaccurately to try to prove my point?

       Depends on how you use the language, I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       A strawman argument is, according to wiki,  "refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not advanced by that opponent."
      </p>
      <p>
       The strawman in the "strawman argument" is the false model.  Strawmen are constructed things.  They are sometimes intimidating upon superficial analysis, but upon closer inspection they are not.  They are easily torn down.

       Makes sense. Thanks for the clarification. So maybe a better term for my post is a shitty argument and not a straw man? :)

       I still think it has merit and explains a lot of his behavior.

       And obviously this recent story about Trump's frustration over Bannon getting on the security council. Makes perfect sense if he didn't even skim what he signed.

       I absolutely believe this. It's not just one or two people but dozens saying he has a hard time reading things that are put in front of him. Also the way he speaks, you can tell he has a hard time forming a sentence.

       The guy doing this is obviously reading off a combo of his screen and que cards. Watch his eyes. Very silly given the context. Also, he's using short disected clips of Trump from different occasions. Plus he had all the time in the world to edit it together, unlike Trump. Also? Trump's "you knows?" are just Obama's "ahhhs".
      </p>
      <p>
       "I signed hundreds"... HE WAS A GODDAMNED BUSINESSMAN. He has people for that. He has a whole group of lawyers and advisors for that whole reason. Fun fact: as president he has a whole cabinet with specific niches that are far more powerful and knowledgeable then when he was a business mogul. You think Obama and Bush did everything themselves with the entire weight of the Executive Branch at their fingertips?

       From someone who doesn't even like Trump? This is just a hit job from some YouTuber. No more no less.

       I'm not gonna hate on the dope just because he can't actually read. It's not a crime to be undereducated, or loud, or obnoxious. He's a true representative of the people he governs.

       This isn't implying that he can't read, but that he has a low literacy level and comprehension.

       Seriously? This is the best the MSM could do? Attacks on his moral standings didn't work, so resort to petty playground insults and insinuations? All the evidence points to him being able to read (Twitter, expensive education, possible paranoid news binges as we all have from time to time). This is just pathetic. Just catch him masturbating with a cross and you're good to go.

       Not to defend MSM, but they certainly have a lot of material to work with. I don't think the attacks on his morality have ended. But I think this might explain a lot of his insecurity and defensiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is saying he's completely illiterate. That's very rare.  But if he reads at a 3rd grade level, he wouldn't be able to parse legal documents himself. Obviously he has people he can rely on do that, but I think it's unusual.
