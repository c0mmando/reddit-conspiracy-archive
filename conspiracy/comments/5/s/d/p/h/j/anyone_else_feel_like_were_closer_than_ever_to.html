       For one I believe a sizable percentage of our  government and celebrities are involved in child sex slavery and they're going to be exposed soon. Far too many people looking into it.

       When that happens, and the people with all that money and power no longer have anything to hide, it will be interesting to see what happens.

       Dontchaknow Breitbart and ilk count as propaganda now since they're towing the line of the party in power? Or is the government propagandizing for them? Hard to tell any more.

       It's always follow the money with these people. They begin to seek power more than anything. I believe this is what fuels their thirst for children -taking away a human being's innocence simply quenches their thirst for power.

       The allegations are serious.  People on Reddit get up in arms over women faking rape cases, but I see pedophile accusations
       <em>
        everywhere
       </em>
       now.  The actual evidence behind these accusations is minimal or nonexistent.  It's as ridiculous as the satanic panic 20 years ago.

       They've been happening for years unfortunately.  Whether it be in the Catholic Church, entertainment industry, etc.  None of this is brand new.  The most that people can do is push for more investigations, but that shouldn't entail ruining people's lives over baseless accusations.

       Look....take a minute. go drink a beer or maybe smoke a bowl. then try to empty your mind of the confirmation bias you've baked in to it over months and months of reading

       and then re-read your post.

      </p>
      <p>
       Do you TRULY 100% believe that we have a MASSIVE child sex slavery ring that is magically being hidden by a huge number of people whom are in the public spotlight all the time? Do all these politicians and celebrities magically disappear at certain times to descend in to their child sex slave dungeons and have their way with their sex slaves only to emerge the next day to continue on about their life? Like just step outside your little insane bubble for a minute and think about it...It's sad to read really. Sad that you have allowed yourself to be so fucking indoctrinated with insane far reaching bullshit that you believe a "sizeable percentage" of our gov't is fucking kid slaves. My brain draws a blank to even think of what to think about it.

       seems to me that child sacrifice cannot become massive because it is an elite membership and control mechanism.  IE the initiation and performance of truly appalling acts that are recorded with children assures the elite of obedience..or else.  so perhaps what we are seeing is the pruning of the elite (hillary, podesta et al and there many minions within government)  because it has become too large for the super elite to manage.  this is clif highs plan b model being executed now by the alphabets.

       I do and here is why:  One of the most famous serial killers of all time, Gacy, had a list of 30k clients - many of them Washington elites.  But now, he's just Gacy, a lone wolf pedophile.

       This x1,000. Many government elites in Britain were exposed not too long ago. It's not as far fetched as you may think... And there is evidence that suggests it's real. This isn't just coming out of thin air.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of this sub is to think for yourself. Part of this is to notice when there are too many coincidences and investigate further.

       It's ridiculous to think that something like that could exist, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Until you think about a few things:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        There have been previous large cases of this discovered in the past.
       </li>
       <li>
        All these people that are implicated are those that are 'bought' (by those orchestrating the false dichotomy of D/R etc) and to insure their loyalty, are blackmailed with evidence of their participation in this.
       </li>
       <li>
        If this was happening on such a large scale, do you not think the NSA/CIA/FBI would be aware of it and stop it? Unless maybe they were part of it like the rest of the government?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Who knows though, its probably just some crazy conspiracy theory and we all know that all those guys are just racist flat-earthers that ignore fact and logic for a false narrative (vs the one the news provides with its lack of corporate agenda and funding) /s

       It seems farfetched because it's appalling and you've been conditioned to believe that it's heinous and not factual. Take a fucking seat bitch and use your own advice. Take away your bias that you've been ingrained in and realize that EVIDENCE = FACT. Once we get the right evidence, things will hit the fan.

       And you think the government is really that good at keeping a secret like that?  They couldn't even keep secrets from low-level contractors like Snowden.  How would they keep something as explosive as a child sex ring completely secret?  All it would have taken is one person in the NSA to intercept something dodgy to blow the whole lid off it.

       It is evolving, as are the forces trying to tamp them down.  It is a mess, and I sometimes wonder if it is savable.

       I see Trump supporters ideas are now evolving into what I predicted.   Hate and thoughts of genocide.  But, you guys are going to save the system.
It has been interesting watches you folks.  It's like watching.the fall of the Weimar Republic and the rise of fascism, but in 2017.

       Nobody's talking about violence. We use our guns for self defense, unlike the Leftists who use it to cause violence. You can purge the system of the wicked people without violence. It's happening before your very eyes right now

       Are you that type of guy who is going to say 90% of Sweden's crime is committed by like 400 people?

      <p>
       Look, white males are the ones doing mass shootings. White males are the ones walking into a theater and shooting it up because they can't get laid. They are the ones that threaten "normal" society. Yes, there are shootings daily in bad parts of Chicago, for example. No, it's not a relevant concern for 98% of that city. Ghettos are ghettos.

       You get too much main stream media.  They are currently pushing the "chaos" narrative.  It is in your head.  Stop it.  No one is panicing, the chaos is homemade paid protestors.  Be vigilant, be prepared, be defensive, but don't be scared or buy what they are selling.

       Not true. It is not 90% of the people running around on fire in the middle of a zombie attack panic, but there are real people around me that are literally operating in a panicked state.

       I'm not talking about whether the news is reporting facts or falsities, but the fact that you state that "no on is panicking" is clearly not true. People are panicking. Not as many as the headlines would have you believe, and possibly not for any good reason, but some people are indeed panicking. However it would be fair to say that this is perfectly normal.

       One thing I am curious about, is whether the election of Trump is more evidence of conspirancy, or of people waking up?

       You are absolutely right and I am wrong.  I should not talk in absolutely like that.  My point, and I worded it really badly, was that the media is making mountains out of molehills, and it is true, that energy does get people panicky.
      </p>
      <p>
       To your last question, I am unsure.  I honestly have a feeling that the MSM worked accidentally against Hillary in that they let people know she had it in the bag - so all those people that were lazy or tired didn't go vote.  Whereby people voting Green or Libertarian, and in some cases Trump, they knew those votes counted and didn't squander them.

       Or a couple weeks ago when I was driving through Lancaster Pennsylvania the woman with the dead fetus hat... Maybe they were paid protesters, but some of the people stuck in the middle of the protest looked a little panicked. I'm just saying that if you want people to become woke to reality, you can't just brush aside things as if they are not happening at all. People are panicking, just not in the droves and droves that the media would have you believe. It sounds nice to say "people are not panicking", but it's also nice to believe that all authority is working to better you life, and if that were true, then there would be no point to this subreddit.

       I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta to say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink Polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song, about Kanye?
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye," man that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

       There is faith in democracy only because "we" are socially engineered to have faith in it. At the top there is a deep rooted belief that if we do not make the general population into a democracy cheering bunch, their irrational side will take over and elect a new Hitler. (Very simplified explanation, but in short that's what a lot of psy related research post-WW2 was about, the likes of Anna Freud or Edward Barnays being core to it).

       Think about, how would you even know that to be true? The belief of a "top" that rules the common populace is also something we believe only because we have been socially engineered for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we actually suppose that such a top existed, how would you even know what their deep rooted beliefs was? Or is an ability to read minds something that's achieved when taking the red pill? Because otherwise how can you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       know what other peoples true beliefs are, or how deep those beliefs go?

       Well, will human nature fundamentally change?  Probably not.  So we will just repeat this cycle again.  I dont think anything is ending since we are just existing in a continual loop.  We are just at a different point in the loop than we were yesterday and tomorrow will be diffrent than today, but we'll come back around eventually.

       This is, I think... the point where an unfeeling unbribable machine administrative complex would come in handy, if for nothing else than a change of scenery. The common element to human administration is the corruption element. Take that out of the mix and look to a decentralized, open source architecture, and you get something very different. And this sort of thing removes a large portion of what human nature stands to impede progress on. Would it be perfect, likely not, but would it be a change? Yes.

If you read a newspaper or turn the TV on, you'll see what everybody else consumes. They are the 99% (not talking about the rich-poor gap here). Don't forget that this conspiracy community and others on the internet, are the 1%; and 99.9% of this 1% (including yourself probably) are doing nothing to further the cause, instead are just consuming whatever is on this sub on the safety of an armchair behind a computer screen.

       Lots of people are waking up, I think the current political climate is suppressing lurkers and others who are afraid to voice their opinions publicly from losing friends and/or harassment. I think there are more of us than we estimate and the numbers are growing quite rapidly. I'm taking the optimistic approach as I know it's just a matter of time before it truly does break wide open.

       I think there is definitely a silent majority who are getting fed up with the system.  The identity politics.  The ideological tribalism.  It's all nauseating.
      </p>
      <p>
       To top it off intellectualism has been on a slow and steady rise especially with access to the Internet.  For the first time people are able to investigate issues themselves and not have to be spoon fed by news and television.

       It may not be a tipping point where one day something happens.   People will just be more prone to call bullshit and think for themselves.

       I totally disagree. I see more and more "alternative" viewpoints popping up everywhere I go in the most unexpected places. I see it in my family and community, people far from online conspiracy communities.

       i think that seeing this stuff, being tuned into it and talking about it with others is the key to unlocking people from their conditioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       My Mum and Dad were incredibly easy to pursuade, somewhat suprisingly. Although a lot of other people i know are fighting it hard. They cannot believe that the people they know and percieve on TV are false idols and have been lying to them despite mountains of evidence that shows it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that what we do, talking about things on this and other subs helps us fine tune what it is we all are becoming aware of, which then drives the word of mouth that helped so many people go against the grain of the establishment media and organisations that set the narrative.

       You're young, this is the first election you and the people you've known have been old enough to
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       understand or participate in.
      </p>
      <p>
       More than that, this is the first election you've witnessed where your freedoms are actually on the line. The young generation these days thinks the government has always been progressive and promoted equality, as if we weren't going through similar republican bullshit just 8 short years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's confirmation bias, baadher-meinhoff, and plain ignorance through and through. Trump is a lunatic, yes. He's worse than your average republican president, yes. He's going to do terrible things to the country, yes. But this "we're all going to die" attitude has been around for hundreds of years, it's nothing new. Every election, half of the country thinks the government is about to burn to the ground and the other half couldn't be happier with the result.

       I see that too, and it worries me, because a lot of the "alternative viewpoints" are fake news and gullible people are buying it hook, line, and sinker.

       There was a massive operation in Eastern Europe to churn the crap out in the run up to the election.  Tons of people in the US were being trolled on a massive scale by Macedonian teenagers.  That's not a positive development, IMHO.

       agree, not saying that it isnt happening. But we are in our own echo chamber, also to a certain extent we are on reddit and just a sub of it. This isnt the deep dark web, you didnt have to go throughdowloads, and steps to get here. Which begs the question is this also controlled content, Certainly not like the rest of the world but still. Sure we are wise to certain themes that play over and over again in MSM, but maybe we could be more awake and question more.  It can make you crazy just over thinking it.

       That's the best part.  Most get their start on politics and then before you know it they are asking about the hollow earth and the erasing of human history.  Politics is a gateway for normies that allows them to start questioning their reality.  I hate the political spam on this sub, it's a tactic to create noise, but I do think we are picking up free thinkers along the way.  We are all more connected then we are lead to believe

       Idk though. The collective human frequency is rising (schumann). Open-mindedness is contagious because when one recognizes one isn't open-minded, and witnesses true open-mindedness in a companion, that closed-minded person is personally introduced to an enormous flaw in character. And I see this happening regularly now. People are changing and so is the Earth's/our environment's frequency. It's all connected. Just maybe not to the degree OP fathoms.

       It's happening faster and faster. The awakening grows exponentially but will take years just because some people are so deeply brainwashed. Just thinking about the change that has happened in my immediate social circle is amazing. It gives me hope for humanity as a whole.

       I was redpilled this election, and I have (somewhat) redpilled my parents and my friends. Even the people who are fighting it hard are at least seeing that there is a tangible force that is rising and starting to dominate, and they do not understand.

       Observing the manipulation and censorship doesn't necessarily tell you anything.

       Consider Reddit right now. Itis filled to the brim with shill accounts and propaganda subs like politics and ETS.

       They've gone one step further than shills and now manipulate votes to hide dissenting speech or freon it out with falsehoods.

       I thought this too, then my gym buddy- who goes home and watches tv and smokes, and only really has access to liberal perspectives (heavily blue state)- says Hillary is probably corrupt and DJ is the better choice.

       No, I really don't think so. I have had the feeling though - but I'll sum it up to confirmation bias from exposing yourself to a lot of different sources on the matter and in that extent a lot of people of the same mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it's a bit like when religous people claim that the return of the their messiah will happen in their lifetime. It's mostly claimed by people with an above average dedication to their faith. Some of them will even scour through litterature, news and events looking for signs and symbols of this end - not dissimilar to what some of the people in this sub are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deeper you delve into it - and the more vague cues and clues you allow yourself to follow, the bigger the odds are that you'll feel that there's a correlation between what you read and talk about - and what is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't believe in great unifying conspiracies - like the illuminati or the occult cabals. There seems to be an incoherence in it all, where people believe them to be all powerful and orchestrating everything, but at the same time they're braggy and clumsy. Leaving clues both intentionally and unintentionally everywhere. I mean, pick one.
I find it far more probable that a few people manipulate and control fewer events and spheres, acting on self interest to promote income and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that it's much easier to promote ideologies and movements to believing their being mistreated, victims or that everyone else is better off, than it is that you hire dusins of crisis actors and not have it being discovered.

       I very much disagree.
The internet is the greatest polarizing tool around, because it gives everyone a voice and a belief that they know a lot about something that they basically know nothing about.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the easiest way to group and enforce every stereotype - and undermine and drown out credible sources. Again - like I suggested earlier; Just like demonstrations, riots and even social media - the easiest thing is to convince people that they're the ones who have to contribute in one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you want control - giving every idiot a platform and a voice has grouped people of similar beliefs - and with the base assumption that the most moronic people are often the loudest, it's quickly the easiest way to discredit anyone. In example, there is surely some credence to BLM, Feminism and alike - but what credibility there is being drowned out by the loudest voices. And just like everything else - social acclimatization and normalization occurs; Basically - what this does is moving the bar of normalcy. In example - a few years back - there was a case in northern europe (where I live), where care personal were caught being horrendously abusive towards mentally challenged elders - doing everything from screaming to hitting and punching them.
What happened was, that when someone new started - this behavior seemed inappropriate - but the degree that they encountered in, gave them a sense of normalcy - deciding that this is normal because those around them all did the same. There's an indiriect peer-pressure going on here - where people act psychologically against their better judgement, because their shown or told the contrary to be true or alright, by those around them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite similarly, a group of feminists screaming their lungs out, doxxing or alike is considered normal and acceptable by the group, because of the prior actions of the group.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the internet has done - is enforce this sort of behavior - and allowed extreme opinions, actions and so on to gain ground. People need nothing more than a social platform, where they can gather with like-minded individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The loudest ones will be the ones heard and seen by the outsiders - even more so when the extremes rise. And this will help to form a picture of the group as a whole - creating and enforcing a certain stereotype. Which in turn polarizes people into their groups - which make them far easier to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also - believing that just because traditional media is on it's way out, when it comes to credibility - that the internet isn't affected and is some sort of untouchable free speech zone, is letting your guard down.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the greatest trick in the book -- letting people think you're dumber and clumsier than you are, because that gives you all the room in the world to act as you please, when and where they aren't looking.

       I don't really think it's all that secret.  It's just the people with the most money creating/manipulating events.  Most people dont know about it, or just never get the information of what their doing, ir where their money is flowing, so they come up with the vague idea of the illuminati.

       Yeah - That's a further point, that I've given quite some thought - that for the most part you can shape the general consensus if you control the primary outlets of information for the majority of the population. People are inclined to believe - and sometimes adamantly - the first piece of information they're given. That discredits a lot of the alternative theories. But the matter of the fact is, that a vast majority of what we know - both the ordinary population and those who delve deeper - is second hand accounts. It's damn near impossible to be sure about anything - which is why general consensus rules supreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that - to me - doesn't mean I believe in the symbolism and the outright flaunting is something that occurs. And I still maintain my view that most conspiracies are orchestrated by a handful of people who aren't necessarily collaborating or even aware of one another.

       The cold war never ended. WWIII was conceived on 9/11, if there will be one. A third world war may cover a financial crash of the USD, like it did before. Hopefully WWIII will be aborted.
      </p>

       With the way the Federal Reserve private banking cartel is set up, the USD will eventually crash. Without the petrodollar system, the USD would have collapsed decades ago. The USD is the world reserve currency and effects the value of most, if not, all other currencies, especially fiat ones. Under the petrodollar system, many countries are forced to trade oil for USD. Leaders and governments that decide to use another, often gold backed currency, are taken out (Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi, etc.).

       Global Elites like the Rothschilds have funded both sides of many western wars since Napoleon. After WWI, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds created the League of Nations, a step into global governing. The same and other global elites financed the second world war (included papa HW Bush's papa, who has funded the Nazis in WWII).
      </p>
      <p>
       After WWII, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds created the United Nations. The Rockefellers and the Rothschilds are two of the families of "The Council of 13" (highest known, but others may be even above them) of the "Illuminati" - but for not getting labeled as a "nutter" - call them the global elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, there are people that profit from the war industry itself (Haliburton, Boeing, arms &amp; ammunition manufacturers ect.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain global elites started in oil and/or banking (such as the Rockefellers and Rothschilds), which remain as key avenues. Some families have also went into big pharma, biotech, MSM, federal politics, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       All wars are bankers wars. Most, if not all wars in the last or few centuries were just business opportunities and to expand powers of business and revenue (the fundamental basis of the global elites (see Confessions of an Economic Hitman by John Perkins, War is a Racket by Major General Smedley D Butler (the highest decorated general in US history (served 33 years and 4 months))), the Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       The wars of the lest century and onward are at least for profit and natural resources like oil, minerals, gold (See Ukraine - most of their gold went missing after the western backed Neo Nazis took over the government) - but it does not end there - their thirst for power includes controlling forieng government puppets, central banks, and leverage over Russia, especial in those regions.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the people (Rockefellers, Rothschilds, other global elites) also control Russia (or at least the people above them control them both). One or some of the people that are running the IMF and/or World Bank also control the Russian powered BRICS banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end goal of these global elites is rather cliche - they want total control over everything on this planet, like a psychopath. The end goal of most of these western global elites is to have a one world government and one world currency, all under their control.
      </p>
      <p>
       These powers that be want total control over everything and everyone on this planet, just like how the original Illuminati had wanted to do before they were caught and diminished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were they truely executed or did they reimerged like a Phoenix from a satanic hellfire? The original Bavarian Illuminati had contingency plans for if they were discovered and stopped. By the way things are going, their contingency plans have prevailed.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, and especially thanks to internet and instant communications, many people are awakening to the evils of certain big governments and big corporations that seem to be orchestrating the end goals of this original Illuminati group, weather they are the Illuminati, or just a new set of few individuals looking for absolute power over everything on this planet, even after they had accumulated vast amounts of wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       These global elite families, extended families, political puppets, etc. all want control over all monies, countries, and all aspects of us plebs on this planet full of sleeping giants that are just emerging from their deep slumber and are now awakening in much more and full force than ever before thanks to internet and instant communications.
      </p>
      <p>
       People in your previous generation (if you are as young as me) may have thought masses were waking up big-time, but failed to do anything - they may just well see the greater humanity awake -right now or very soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of the experiment/story of the "100th monkey". After nuclear bombs were tested, some researchers decided to put a pack of monkeys on an island that had been nuked. They teached some of the monkeys to wash radioactive coconuts in water for cleansing. Not many monkies did at the beginning. The monkoes that did wash them taught others, slowly building up like a curve on a data graph. It took time to kick in, but by the time the 100th monkey started washing his coconut, all of the other monkeys of the population joined into what the dissenting monkeys were doing, by washing their coconuts!
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in extraordinary times right now as humans on earth. Big things seem like they may be coming. Do not feel defeated and hopeless, although how difficult it may seem. By the looks of it, the anti-humanist global elites are shitting themselves right now as they are loosing power as the general populations are waking up to their bullshit!
      </p>
      <p>
       A free and prosperous human race will endure without negative interference of these anti-humanist global elites ruining everything!
      </p>
      <p>
       Live long and prosper brothers/sisters!

But it's hard for people to have the energy to do anything else when they're basically sick from all the chemicals in our food, water, and air. Fuck TV. I haven't watched anything since Breaking Bad!

       It artificially raises the minimum wage and pushes out the young, unskilled and elderly from the job market (which puts more burden on the welfare state). It also prevents small businesses from being able to afford employees which stops economic growth in the small business sector. Then you add in all those other regulations that the Obama administration implemented and you understand why the American economy is the way it is.

       Don't forget that in order to accommodate a jump in wages that drastic, most employers will either need to make layoffs, raise prices, or automate.  Raising prices would be inevitable, and after a few short years, $15 is just as shitty a wage as the current minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not supposed to be able to make a living on minimum wage jobs.  They're supposed to either be stepping stones so you can get a better job after some experience as a young or supplement your income as an elderly person.  Btw, having a smart phone and cable don't count as part of surviving.

       I live in the south, so $7.50 an hour plus another job is enough to survive, but in some states that's just not the case. No argument, as I too live in a bubble, where most people believe other states are lazy. But truthfully, our most populated areas aren't doing well.

       I would suggest you read up on all the arguments on why the $15 minimum wage is a good idea and then read up on all the arguments on why the $15 minimum wage is bad. Once you see both arguments it is really hard to back a $15 minimum wage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free market capitalism will be the fairest way to determine wages in the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to discuss this at further length I would be more than happy to, because at first glance... Just looking at the surface of the issue.. of course the argument makes sense for a $15 minimum wage... But in reality it is really bad.

       There is a reasonable maximum to an individual's pay relative to their employees. At a certain point, you don't need and cannot possibly justify acquisition of
       <em>
        more.
       </em>
      </p>

       Limiting that ratio forces employers to justly compensate their employees relative to the total success of the business.

       Fuck man, I've been saying this for sooo long. If, even an owner, was only allowed to receive a maximum percentage more than the lowest worker, and all in between a division of that, then the system would be fixed. Boom equality. But no, muh capitalism.

       Warren buffet made over 11 billion dollars last year. Yet the minimum standard of living in our country is homelessness. that level of wealth inequality is inarguably immoral.
      </p>
      <p>
       the best options to combat this inequality are a maximum wage and a maximum inheritance.

       warren buffet earned the most of all Americans last year; i used him illustratively as one end of the wealth inequality spectrum
      </p>
      <p>
       a maximum wage is really rather self explanatory. there should be a certain limit beyond which the acquisition of personal wealth is not allowed. any wealth created beyond that limit should be used for the good of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       to determine what that limit should be would require a real national conversation about the system we live in.
but it seems as a nation all we are capable of is national argument.

       marxism is abhorrent. the main idea of marxism is the destruction of the individual (society itself subsumes and replaces the individual). it is a fundamental misunderstanding of the entirety of evolutionary history. what makes things special is what makes them different.
      </p>
      <p>
       what cultural marxism is the destruction of individual choice in culture. society tells you what culture is acceptable. everyone is forced to think the same ("political correctness" what an oxymoronic term in the first place). But that's not what makes us great! the best thing about america is that everyone is allowed to be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's the difference between equality and equal rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Equality tries to tell us everyone should be the same. this is a fallacy
      </p>
      <p>
       equal rights tells us everyone is allowed to be different. that's a better ideal. that's the greatest ideal of america!
      </p>
      <p>
       but we are off on a tangent. this is the false dialectic that i talk about. this is where the division in society exists now. we were talking about power structures but now you are talking about thought structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       in society now we have a Marxist thought structure and an anachro-capitalist power structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look at the marxist thought structure and think it is terrible as well, we can agree on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       but the anachro-capitalist power structure is horrible as well! it's basically jungle law; at the top of our power structure our "leaders" (rulers) can do WHATEVER the fuck they want. this is the power structure that allows a dupont heir to rape his 3 year old daughter and be spared jail. this is the power structure that allows the promotion of sociopaths to the top of our society. on a macro level this is the power structure that enabled america to install dictators all over the world; as the most powerful country we can just do whatever the fuck we want. shit here in r/ conspiracy there are people who will tell you that our elites abduct children, rape them, murder them, consume there pineal gland for an adrenochrome high and then inject children's blood to live longer. they can believe that because they can see that our rulers CAN do whatever the fuck they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the red tie cunts do is pretend to attack the bullshit marxist thought structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the blue tie cunts do is pretend to attack the bullshit anachro-capitalist power structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       But nothing ever seems to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       and that's EXACTLY how TPTB want it. they want to be able to do whatever the fuck they want. and they want us all to think the same so that we are easy to control. both of those things are entirely inhumane.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to find real unity and resurrect real productive conversation. we can create a synthesis and create a new system that is better on both fronts

       i wouldnt say television shows are all that bad to watch so long as you watch them on your own time. It is when you tune in to cable television "programming" where things get fucky real quick. Commercials, news alerts, breaking news stories, reality shows, fake history shows etc. To me watching breaking bad cannot be put in the same category.

       Yeah, but some of that is about personal responsibility.  If you eat like shit, you shouldn't be too surprised when you feel like shit.

       Same. When I go back to visit my parents all three TVs are playing... mom is in her sewing room watching Dancing with the Stars, dad is in the den watching Fox News, and the TV nobody is watching has the sports channel blaring. Makes me kinda sad for them.

       They don't know what to do instead of watching tv. It acts as a release for many ppl (like video games) when you are constantly being subdued by some BS tv programme average life becomes more tedious

       Video Games to me are on a whole other level. I play what games i want when i want to. My mind gets stimulated moreso than any time i have watched TV. It actually really angers me when people mention playing video games in relation to watching television. My parents would watch television for 3-4 hours per night and tell me i need to stop playing video games as it is wrecking my mind. You have no idea how much that angers me now that i am older and red pilled.

       how so? Video games are the highest form of art known to man. Video Games encompass everything that is creative about us as humans. Video Games encourage critical thinking. Video Games can tell a story better than any movie. Video Games can teach you something better than any classroom. With Video Games there is a level of interaction that is unavaiable in every other form of media entertainment. Video Games also bring many social aspects to peoples lives who wouldnt normally be social.

       My wife and I are 59.  I've gotta admit that slumping in front of the tube feels good at the end of a long day.  It's my wife who likes it most. I'm usually browsing the web and only looking up from time to time... usually to make rude comments about some particularly outrageous bit of propaganda embedded in the script.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had stopped watching TV at age 15, long before the 'net existed, and didn't really start watching again until I was 24 and my roommate brought a used one from his parents' house.  We thought we'd just watch it "ironically", but man, we got sucked in about as hard as anyone else.  Pretty scary.
      </p>
      <p>
       OTOH, somehow I have always had a certain level of "propaganda resistance" or skepticism, even as a little kid.  I just couldn't take what the teachers said without examining it, then trying to get better explanations - which marked me as a troublemaker/"poor student".  And later, watching politicians, I would think "Isn't their bullshitting obvious? Do people really take this at face value?"
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are stuck at a house with the TV on, an interesting exercise is to aim your eyes just far enough away from the TV so that no part of the image is even in your peripheral vision. I usually look at the floor in front of me.  Just watch the flickering. Especially during the ads, you'll begin to notice an almost hypnotic rhythm as they cut from scene to scene. It is eerily consistent from one ad to the next.  When I say this to people, they say "well of course, they only have a very short time, so they're going to cut often - and they're all under the same constraint, so the cuts are going to be about the same." I don't know if that's necessarily true. And a few ads do use slower pacing.  My sense is they're doing some very basic hypnosis to bypass the rational part of your mind.  Who knows... anyway, give it a try.

       hey great remarks I do agree that you can mitigate some of the damage by looking away, by muting, by changing the channels, and basically becoming active in your viewing habits. But nothing like eliminating it from the house. netflix, streams, downloads, it's all available online, and without the bullshit.

       Thanks! This channel is how I watched it on my last marathon of old TV shows, just wish one of the major providers had it so I could watch the entire episodes in HD and not have to search for parts 1-3. MTV used to produce some really amazing stuff, wish they'd get back to their roots.

       According to theory the "connection is severed" just by watching the screen, so watching bob ross painting will fry your brain as much as anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if that's true, using the computer would also be shutting down circuits in the brain, which could actually mean that what a lot of people are interpreting as "waking up" is actually the exact opposite - critical thinking shutting down, and because of the lack of critical thinking abilities people suddenly start thinking that all kinds of absurd and illogical stuff is true, and that anyone not agreeing with them has to be wrong.

       I would argue that the computer is a different kind of beast, in the sense that it actually requires interaction sometimes (threads, Reddit, Fb, etc), but you hit it on the head in terms of limiting critical thinking for the most part. I have to come to subs like these to see what people are really talking about, and having actual (for the most part) intelligent (I say this rather loosely) conversations about what's happening in the world these days. The TV just broadcasts what they're allowed to show, whereas the internet offers a plethora of content which can be filtered by the user.  So, if someone just wants to read TMZ, then they can, but it can also be avoided if they wish.

       But if the theory holds up it goes for all of us, if using the computer compromises critical thinking, you have to consider that everything which happens online is happening through that not-so-critical filter, even this conversation!
      </p>
      <p>
       But then again, the idea that tv (and computers) fry your brain is usually a concept that most people is introduced to either online or through tv, so you would also have to consider if you had actually thought critically about the concept or just un-critically accepted it as fact.

       that's what I mean. With Netflix, you can pick and choose what you watch (although alot of it is still garbage), but it's the advertising on Cable, buy this, consume, get a home loan you can't afford, blah blah, real "They Live" kind of crap. And now, I feel sort of "unplugged". Half the time I don't even know what major movies are in the theatres cause I miss the trailers and the lead up to release. lol. My mom and dad still have Cable though, so when we go to visit I see commercials and I realize how much garbage we're being fed on a regular constant basis. it's kind of daunting when you go from one extreme to another.

       The lack of commercials is specifically why I got Netflix when I canceled cable.  I watch a LOT less TV now and I can't help but think it's good for my mental state.  The garbage they peddle on cable "news" is ridiculous.

       Also, just putting this here 'cause I don't like making new links, someone should mention that the Queen isn't planning on celebrating her 65th Anniversary which is today and also they've published an old photo instead. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but I think there's summat definitely up there. Made a massive fuss when she hit 'the longest' last year. This year another first and nothing (at all). Odd to say the least. Saw the link via CNN not checked the BBC's mention of it yet. Sorry for putting this here, hope someone spots it.

        Television places your brain in a susceptible alpha-wave state as quickly as 60 seconds after you start watching it.
       </a>

      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         For a brain to comprehend and communicate complex meaning, it must be in a state of “chaotic disequilibrium.” This means that there must be a dynamic flow of communication between all of the regions of the brain, which facilitates the comprehension of higher levels of order (breaking conceptual thresholds), and leads to the formation of complex ideas. High levels of chaotic brain activity are present during challenging tasks like reading, writing, and working mathematical equations in your head. They are not present while watching TV. Levels of brain activity are measured by an electroencenograph (EEG) machine. While watching television, the brain appears to slow to a halt, registering low alpha wave readings on the EEG. This is caused by the radiant light produced by cathode ray technology within the television set. Even if you're reading text on a television screen the brain registers low levels of activity. Once again, regardless of the content being presented, television essentially turns off your nervous system.

       It it was known this effect was produced by the cathode ray tube, what possible reasons would it have been eliminated when moving to liquid crystal display? The effect is caused by the radiant light patterns, which are by definition more crisp and pronounced with LCD displays. As we get into High Definition and now 4K technology, it appears that the prevalent trend is to deliver as convincing and precise a signal to the eyes as possible.

       Many people in the UK actually think she is dead. Her Christmas message is recorded months before and she was super ill over Christmas and canceled many of her engagements, we've been told she's better but I don't think there have been any recent photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the chaos it would cause if we found out she was dead at a time like this! The UK is already a headless chicken.

       Do we? I haven't come across anyone here who thinks she's dead. However, many of us do hope that when she kicks the bucket the RF as a whole dissappears.

       Yeah my wife and i have been fully satisfied with Netflix and Youtube (through the Chromecast, which somehow makes youtube rarely play any commercials).
Not to say this is way better than broadcast TV, but not having commercials and not being exposed to anything but what we select i think cuts down on the BS.

       In the matrix Morpheus offers Neo either a red pill or a blue pill. The red pill let's him escape the matrix and see the truth of "reality", but the blue pill makes him forget everything he learned and go back to his normal life believing whatever he wants.
       <br/>
       "This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more." - Morpheus

       TV news is basically just someone spouting opinions off at you: whether you really believe it or not, there is definitely the possibility of subliminal influence. Not to mention how many stations are controlled by so few.

       I was watching a documentary about the Vietnam War (yes, I know - more TV) and I noticed something interesting. The 1960s news shows would show a clip of someone talking for at least 30 seconds, then follow up with their own commentary.  Sure, the clip was probably carefully selected to eliminate important context. Still, you heard the person's actual words.  Some time later they began to show the clip muted, while the newscaster talks over it, to "tell you what the person said".  That way they have complete control over the way you perceive it.  What they tell you may be a completely inaccurate and biased re-interpretation of the person's words, or simply their opinion about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It struck me pretty strongly because I was a kid in the 1960s and had been familiar with the older style, yet someone missed the transition to the new style until confronted with it by that documentary.  (and even the documentary itself was propaganda, as it left out many of the realities of how the war was instigated by false-flag, and the rampant atrocities in its prosecution.)

       I find it quite hopeless with the rest. The midwest rural areas had 1 or 2 channels til cable  came in around 2005, and many are still without it. Give a midwest/southern/rural moron 100 channels and they'll be glued for life to the very thing they've been dreaming of. Tee Veeeeeeeeeee!

       agree with this 100%. I stopped watching cable television completely about 5 years ago and i have zero desire to go back. I am now at a point where i watch what i want when i want rather than being forced to watch what corporate media wants me to watch.

       Comcast Xfinity is 44.99/mo for 12mo for 100mbps Internet and 40 channels of X1 "talk into your remote" interactive TV with built in Netflix... Or! 49.99/mo for standalone 25mbps internet. I wonder where the incentive is? Maybe I should ask my remote for answers.

       This is a lot easier now. I can stream/YouTube anything that hits the TV that I want to watch with no commercials. Watching the News blows my mind sometimes, and it's to the point where it seems like information tug of war between multiple media sources with information that doesn't collaborate sometimes/alot of the time. It's honestly just incredibly stressful to keep an eye on what is going on in the world right now.

       10 minute rational explanation of the world elite's fascination with Antarctica that doesn't involve aliens, demons, or Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summary: It's about resources, Antarctica is an entire continent that has (most likely) never been harvested by humans. If conditions / technology have changed enough to make harvesting possible the continent is likely worth trillions and trillions of dollars. This would be worth some personal visits by important people and a military presence to defend claims.

       Of course you're more interested in the age of someone than the information they're spreading. Fuck you. Truth comes from all angles, even the ones you look down on. Realize that your age has nothing to do with experience. Realize that a 10 year old can live a more fulfilled life and be more understanding than a 35 year old. The only thing age gives you is the chance to experience more. That doesn't mean you even experienced it, just that you had the chance. What I have heard/read from your comments implies that you are older, but that is the most detrimental part of you. You've had more time being exposed to television, the radio, the "news". You have been ideologically assaulted by the mainstream media who has polarized you. You believe that anyone who doesn't think like you is wrong. You have been conditioned since birth to think, believe, and act in certain ways. You've been told that certain ideas are crazy, or insane, because that is what the people on top want you to believe. Honestly I would recommend you a dose of LSD, or Psilocybin (in the form of magic mushrooms) so that you can brush the cobwebs off the underutilized parts of your brain. Unless you have a family or medical history of mental illness, in  which I'd hesitate to recommend psychedelics since it can exacerbate or bring a dormant illness to the surface.

       I did both, multiple times each, when I was in college. They were very eye-opening and helped me turn myself into a more honest, hard working, driven man. I also smoke an ounce of marijuana every month and drink a beer or two with dinner every day. Interesting how little you know about me yet you assume so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, kid. You have no perspective on life. You just went through your first election as a bona fide adult and you're frightened by all the corruption and bullshit you saw. Don't get me wrong, this election was more eventful than recent elections, but the doomsday attitude you and your peers have picked up is irrational and has been around since the creation of the government.

       I'm older than you. 1992. Just because 2 people come to different conclusions due to multiple news sources does not mean one is wrong and one is right. This is called polarization and also the reason you've been so dismissive of things that you don't deem "sane". The idea that a corrupt government (we atleast agree on that right?) would use a war to distract the populace from the corruption is not an insane idea. It has happened before, and it will happen again. Do psychology research, do government research, do research on history, the history of our nation, the history of socio-political movements. Once you have done enough research more things come to light in your perception. When you look for something, you'll find it. Call it confirmation bias, call it baader-meinhoff syndrome. The fact is that you allow news sources to do your research for you. You just said so. That means, by your own logic, that you are wrong. I, on the other hand, do my own research. I read the e-mails, I studied the rhetoric, I've researched the mechanisms of our situation. I have read on right leaning boards, I have read left leaning boards, (definitely more than right tbh), I have read and discussed at length peer-reviewed journals and scientific analyses of our political climate. Once you have grown beyond the notion of letting people teach you, then you'll understand my point of view. I teach myself, i take into account partisan bias, and I read and critically analyze viewpoints that are not my own. Only once you have fully researched and understand the depth and breadth of our situation will you realize that war is evident.

       I think that'll only fuel the flame, because a large portion of this "woke" crowd is distasted by wars. I think the blow back from the public would be similar to, and most likely larger then the protests against Vietnam. The difference now is people are smarter and have learned from a lot of past protests what works and doesn't. People are easier contacted and easier given information to convince them war is wrong now too.

       I'm pretty conservative and even served in the military at one point. I'm completely anti war unless someone is actually invading the US. I may be projecting my own feelings onto others but I think most of The People are in this mindset.

       It's getting harder for TPTB to move the populace to war. The Syria engagement just got shut down a couple years ago and that was after a bright line chemical attack. Granted they did a work around with ISIS but there were no major US deployments to that country.

       I have always been red pilled.  But I was a huge fan of American news.  Even though I lived in Canada I couldn't stop watching CNN, and loved to yell at the television.  I was also a heavy marijuana smoker.  Eventually I moved to South Korea and quit all drugs, alcohol, smoking and television.  Everything from my posture, to spending habits, to diet, to mental wellbeing improved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking back, what I found most odd was I would preach to people about the illuminati about how they controlled the world and yada yada while smoking joints and cigarettes, drinking beers and caring about brand names and trivial shit.  Some of the people I preached to had no idea about the illuminati but it didn't matter.  They had no vices; just good family, friends and a love for knowledge, albeit in the name of science and tech.
      </p>
      <p>
       A huge change for me is I can reflect and am not tied to any beliefs.  If you can convince me of something I will accept your opinion.  Liberals these days not so much.

       No, just the opposite. The people are divided more than ever, fighting against each other instead of the powers that control them.
      </p>
      <p>
       More propaganda (fake news) and shills than ever. People reading/seeing all sorts of shit that turns out to be untrue leaving people confused, not knowing what to believe, so that they remain in a state of paranoia and doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any real free-thinkers that manage to read between the lines become pushed outside the acceptable boundaries and they too are accused of pushing fake news and won't be believed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reaction to this we have people who think they are liberal and to the left pushing a neo-con agenda and people on the right supporting a different kind of agenda disguised as being anti-establishment but still very much in control of elites and bankers. Those who don't take either side are attacked by both sides. And yet here we have people rejoicing at how free and awake we are. It could not be further from the truth. It is an illusion.

       Not joining hands and singing w fascists.
I checked out Op's profile. 
He is partisan as you get and recently stated he wants to kill liberals.
That is nobody, I can work with.
Look deeper, be critical, do not brush off media because it doesn't fit your preconceived notions.  Watch it critically, don't put your head in the sand.
I can withstand attempts at brainwashing, are you so mentally weak as to fear it?

       As long as the message is to reject politics, understand that we are all connected, and our reality can be shaped however we please, I'm down.  I just don't want to feed into the "he said this so he is bad and I am different than him" trap.  That's not us.  We didn't invent liberal, or right or left or any of that bullshit, so why join in?  We can simply ignore all the labels that are slapped on us and be brothers together

       So yesterday, as per this

        damning culmination of "facts"

       , hillary and others were being rounded up and justice was about to be served.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTF do you guys tell yourselves when all this bullshit proves to be... bullshit?  Like this morning, when none of that actually happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean seriously?  Do you honestly believe a word of this insane shit?  Even when nothing happens, you re-stoke the completely idiotic fires of a stupid cause that has no actual proof, outside of crazy people like alex jones, circles.  I'm not a supporter of hillary of any of the people that this involves, but rather a person who follows truth.  This is a dry well.  Move on to more important matters, as this is silly and has caused me to no longer take this sub seriously.

       Dude, this is so true. Like one of the comments below me, I think less and less people are watching TV, so that hugely alters their grasp over our minds. Not to mention the way the dominoes have been falling since the election process started. HRC showed us that not only can politicians be super fucked up and full-fledged criminal status, but they can be that way and almost secure the POTUS... Since then, with more and more people seeing the light, I think you're right. I think we are ready for the truth, and I think most are aware that we've been fed lies our entire lives. I'm very optimistic at this point.

       I hope your right. The people that have been questioning why FBI anon would speak out if real is important to me. Real or not it's amping up the woke people. The more the people are woke the better chance we have for action. If all are quiet and unknowing they can sweep it under the rug. I give a lot of credit to citizen investigation! George Webb and others (all of you investigators!) who keep up the great work and push every day to get all this out in the open are incredible!

       Wide range of awareness regarding things that make you go hmmm.. the concept that like-minded individuals organising isn't a foreign concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       What isn't clear is the right path forward, when you feel like you're only scratching the surface its tough to come up with a gameplan. Its tough not to have that gameplan be incorrect, or it be co-opted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, if you're successful and find that correct path forward.. an entire new set of challenges present themselves, that could result in you either being bought/paid off, or disappeared, publicly, or covertly.

       In 2015, I would have said something along the lines of
       <em>
        just remember how powerful they actually are
       </em>
       .
       <br/>
       After witnessing all the shit that went down in 2016, I think you're absolutely right.
       <br/>
       The psychopaths who've hijacked the U.S. gov may be disgusting murderous fucks, but, apparently, they're surprisingly
       <strong>
        clumsy
       </strong>
       disgusting murderous fucks.

       Maybe the crafty old geezers are dying off and they left their kids with a bag of tricks that really only worked in the pre-Internet era, and the kids are too dumb to create a new bag of tricks.

       TV is the worst. Sad to say, but advertising works, they wouldn't do it if it didn't. Thus, we must assume that tv propaganda works, too. And when it arrives via the evening 'news', it becomes even more pernicious. I ditched my tv some years ago and haven't looked back since. The world doesn't suddenly become black and white but there's certainly a lot less grey.

       The only issue is some people still think being "awake" is that new age bullshit of rainbows and happiness, or good willed aliens or some universe synchronization.

       The only "awake" people is that who can understand who are their owners, the co-opted system that preserve and extend this order, the exploitation of entertainment and media to permeate the culture, and of course the new weapons and surreptitious strategies to preserve their game.

       I really want to have Term limits  because politicians would have to sell each other out onto the alter of populisim to get reelected.The establishment politicians who've been in office since  before Clinton was in the WH would be thrown out,they would be replaced with populist who would also be replaced with populist when term limits run out.

       Yes, but im really concerned with trump. I have feelings that he will be removed very soon. The Left is obviously 100% against him.. The right (im talking politicians) are as well. We need to do something to help.

       2012 "end of the world" are based on the Mayan calendar and the "Great Year," a 26,000 year cycle of axial procession. 2012 was the start of a new age, cosmologically. Pretty cool stuff. The Pyramid Code on netflix goes into it.

       Our current reality.  Shaped by war, greed, media, government, tptb, etc etc.  Do you feel in control or are you merely given the illusion of choice?  If you had all the money and all the resources, is this the reality you would build or would you give the people free will to shape their journey however they choose?

       Best part is we still have free will my brother. Think of all that would be accomplished if we didn't hand over our free will to these politicians and the elite.  Instead of focusing on the boogeyman, we focus on lighting out neighbors house, fuck the whole neighborhood for free.  The system is going to tell me we can turn an idea into an atom bomb in 4 years to save our asses but we can't turn the fucking light on in Detroit?  The these cities are our problems because we all hate each other?  Come the fuck on, you know?  I know you would give free will because you are good.  People are good.  You have free will and I have free will.

       The 2016 election was the biggest psyop I've ever seen. People have never been so confused. The establishment finally destroyed the freedom of the internet and they did it with a vengeance.
      </p>
      <p>
       People were "waking up" for a few years, but now they are drowning in Hegelian Dialectic.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, with the fake outsider in office, net neutrality will be destroyed and they will lock in this new paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the biggest lies today:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Donald Trump is an outsider -- no, he is a Republican dirty trick
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The media is either "liberal" or even "Democratic" -- no it's corporate
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Libertarianism represents an alternative for freedom -- no, it was created by a
         <em>
          community
         </em>
         of oligarchs to support wealth consolidation
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       If we could get through these three basic falsehoods, we would be way ahead. :)

       SometimesI think things are going to change then I go to r/politics. Don't view it as anit-anything, only just validating propaganda that msm puts out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything I read there is how wonder a job the msm is doing and who ever they say is god is god and the Putin - sorry the devil - is definitely real and truthful 100%.

      <p>
       Russia hacked the election is absolutely true. Any questioning means you are silly and unpatriotic. Hillary lost because of silly people like you. Hillary's corruption is just due to how the Assange Russian puppet edited and then very malicously released the emails. Bernie Sanders lost fair and square, 40,000,000 votes shows no DNC or media manipulations involved.

       I don't think the fact that we are awake is our doing, unfortunately the timing doesn't seem to be in our favor. Although people are waking up, it doesn't really matter if the information is shared or not. Case in point, 911 that shit obviously had something wicked involved and there still is basically no information released

       I'm really late to the thread but Jean-Baptiste Baudrillard has a great quote on this that makes me inclined to disagree:
      </p>
      <p>
       "It is useless to dream of revolution through content, useless to dream of revelation through form, because the medium and the real are now in a single nebula whose truth is indecipherable."
      </p>
      <p>
       What Baudrillard is trying to tell us is that our system (the government and media) instill upon us both the means and the ends to a revolution, but only on their terms. We are numbed to the killings and uprisings that should cause us to stir. We are numbed to the dissent and angry voices that should cause us to take arms.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are numb with content, a weapon this government uses effectively more than any other country through consumerism. We are too content with the now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until we can change that, there will be "breaking the system"

       that's what I mean. With Netflix, you can pick and choose what you watch (although alot of it is still garbage), but it's the advertising on Cable, buy this, consume, get a home loan you can't afford, blah blah, real "They Live" kind of crap. And now, I feel sort of "unplugged". Half the time I don't even know what major movies are in the theatres cause I miss the trailers and the lead up to release. lol. My mom and dad still have Cable though, so when we go to visit I see commercials and I realize how much garbage we're being fed on a regular constant basis. it's kind of daunting when you go from one extreme to another.

       I'm pretty conservative and even served in the military at one point. I'm completely anti war unless someone is actually invading the US. I may be projecting my own feelings onto others but I think most of The People are in this mindset.

       It's getting harder for TPTB to move the populace to war. The Syria engagement just got shut down a couple years ago and that was after a bright line chemical attack. Granted they did a work around with ISIS but there were no major US deployments to that country.

       marxism is abhorrent. the main idea of marxism is the destruction of the individual (society itself subsumes and replaces the individual). it is a fundamental misunderstanding of the entirety of evolutionary history. what makes things special is what makes them different.
      </p>
      <p>
       what cultural marxism is the destruction of individual choice in culture. society tells you what culture is acceptable. everyone is forced to think the same ("political correctness" what an oxymoronic term in the first place). But that's not what makes us great! the best thing about america is that everyone is allowed to be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's the difference between equality and equal rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Equality tries to tell us everyone should be the same. this is a fallacy
      </p>
      <p>
       equal rights tells us everyone is allowed to be different. that's a better ideal. that's the greatest ideal of america!
      </p>
      <p>
       but we are off on a tangent. this is the false dialectic that i talk about. this is where the division in society exists now. we were talking about power structures but now you are talking about thought structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       in society now we have a Marxist thought structure and an anachro-capitalist power structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look at the marxist thought structure and think it is terrible as well, we can agree on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       but the anachro-capitalist power structure is horrible as well! it's basically jungle law; at the top of our power structure our "leaders" (rulers) can do WHATEVER the fuck they want. this is the power structure that allows a dupont heir to rape his 3 year old daughter and be spared jail. this is the power structure that allows the promotion of sociopaths to the top of our society. on a macro level this is the power structure that enabled america to install dictators all over the world; as the most powerful country we can just do whatever the fuck we want. shit here in r/ conspiracy there are people who will tell you that our elites abduct children, rape them, murder them, consume there pineal gland for an adrenochrome high and then inject children's blood to live longer. they can believe that because they can see that our rulers CAN do whatever the fuck they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the red tie cunts do is pretend to attack the bullshit marxist thought structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the blue tie cunts do is pretend to attack the bullshit anachro-capitalist power structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       But nothing ever seems to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       and that's EXACTLY how TPTB want it. they want to be able to do whatever the fuck they want. and they want us all to think the same so that we are easy to control. both of those things are entirely inhumane.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to find real unity and resurrect real productive conversation. we can create a synthesis and create a new system that is better on both fronts

       I live in the south, so $7.50 an hour plus another job is enough to survive, but in some states that's just not the case. No argument, as I too live in a bubble, where most people believe other states are lazy. But truthfully, our most populated areas aren't doing well.
