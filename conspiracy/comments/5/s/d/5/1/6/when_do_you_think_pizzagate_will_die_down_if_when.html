<p>Hayes said. “We have animals that are females, in the sense that they behave like females: They have estrogen, lay eggs, they mate with other males. Atrazine has caused a hormonal imbalance that has made them develop into the wrong sex, in terms of their genetic constitution.”</p>

<p><strong>Human Trafficking and Global Pedophilia Networks</strong></p>

<pre><code>Franklin, Nebraska Child Prostitution Ring Scandal and its Coverup -- According to Wikipedia, &quot;between 1988 and 1991 and involved an alleged child sex ring serving prominent citizens of Nebraska, as well as high-level U.S. politicians. The allegations also claimed that the alleged sex ring was led by, &quot;a cult of devil worshipers involved in the mutilation, sacrifice and cannibalism of numerous children.&quot; Although dismissed as an &#39;elaborate hoax&#39;, there are numerous witnesses, hard evidence, and a conspiracy of elite-protective countermeasures having been revealed as disinfo, all of which continues to be ignored by the mainstream even today. A documentary &#39;conspiracy of silence&#39; had been suppressed until recently. This evidence, along with Operation Hydrant and the revelations from Operation Yewtree, are the justification for including this entry in our confirmed conspiracies This evidence is the justification for including this entry in our confirmed conspiracies. Sources[1][2][3][4]. It&#39;s important to note that Wikipedia&#39;s article on the Franklin scandal, &quot;Franklin child prostitution ring allegations&quot;, is disingenuous claiming these to be allegations, censoring this issue, and acting as a continuation of this coverup. [G,U,I,J,M,F,O,P]



Marc Dutroux -- Dutroux Coverup : &quot;is a Belgian serial killer and child molester, convicted of having kidnapped, tortured and sexually abused six girls from 1995 to 1996, ranging in age from 8 to 19, four of whom he murdered. His wife, Michelle Martin, was convicted as an accomplice. Dutroux was also convicted of having killed a suspected former accomplice, Bernard Weinstein. He was arrested in 1996 and has been in prison ever since, though he briefly escaped in April 1998.&quot; Dutroux was arrested for kidnapping and raping five girls and severed an exceedingly short sentence and released on parole with government pension. He used sleeping pills he received from his psychiatrist on his further victims in a pornographic rape dungeon with assistance from his wife and at least one other accomplice; starving their victims to death and burying their bodies in a garden. He was again arrested for six months while his wife managed the rape dungeon. He was arrested a third time with his wife and accomplice Lelievre, and police found the victims&#39; bodies including former accomplish Wittingstein, and a huge stash of pornographic videos. A total of 4 conspirators and 7 victims in this sex/murder ring, but questions were asked about the Belgian Justice system with respect to how investigations were botched in allowing this to happen, though the conclusions drawn were that Dutroux benefitted from corruption, sloppiness and incompetence.[1]
