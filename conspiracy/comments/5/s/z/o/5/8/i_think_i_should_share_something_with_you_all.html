        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The signs are a bit too intense to ignore.</p>

<p>What is happening right now, has already been foretold.
Going with that, I may know what happens next.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to educate as many people as I can on this, and knowing what I know there are some things that I must personally go do after this discussion.</p>

<p>But what I want to share with you all, is the actual power of the human body and spirit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to begin by putting a label on it, because it is literally everything that it has been called, there is no wrong or right description for what it is. Here&#39;s a video, not going to say what it is, watch it with an open mind.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqsvJedwUyg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqsvJedwUyg</a></p>

<p>What did you think? If you look deeper into this fellow, he says that all humans are capable of doing everything he has demonstrated throughout his life.</p>

<p>I agree, not because he says so, but because I can do certain things he does, and certain different things that I don&#39;t know if he does or practices.</p>

<p>Here are some different names for what is going on:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGab9Ux34A4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGab9Ux34A4</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZM3t9JpGjw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZM3t9JpGjw</a></p>

<p>If you are truly a critical thinker, research this shit immediately.</p>

<p>Please, if you are going to try to convince me that this is fake, and that I am mentally ill, save your breath. I can literally feel Chi constantly going through my body, I&#39;ve shown it to people IRL, I&#39;ve shown them and told them about other things.</p>

<p>I am telling you all this, because TPTB want to hide this from you. Others and I are working to keep their energies low. To keep this from anyone is to deny themselves control of their own actions. </p>

<p>They will try to have everyone worship a god, when you yourself are capable of anything you wish to achieve without relying on a god. If you do choose to worship a god, I want YOU to be able to make that decision and not having the decision made for you through mind-control programming.</p>

<p>This is an open discussion, think critically my friends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alot of posts about feeling stuff lately. I have a theory: </p>

<p>Someone is posting all this well aware that many of us are feeling ill after all this pizzagate stuff, which I believe is real. I FEEL like someone is trying to make us investigate weird stuff so that our &quot;weak&quot; minds get influenced by whatever we read, and then start talking about it to people around us - we would sound crazy. And so everything else we say is also crazy. </p>

<p>This is just a theory. I&#39;m just thinking critically :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brother, I know how to do many things.</p>

<p>One thing that I know, is that you know everything that I know. It is within you, this is why it is not important to rely on others, you must be the pillar for others to rely on.</p>

<p>If you would like more information, I would suggest reading on your Chakras, what they are, how they work. </p>

<p>I would read up on negative frequencies, sacred geometry. Do not be scared to read about dark magic and voodoo, for it is knowledge, but I must tell you to practice it is to literally give up your inner power for something much weaker. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.wellbeingalignment.com/white-light-healing.html">http://www.wellbeingalignment.com/white-light-healing.html</a> This is a good resource, in my post history there should be posts depicting how to emit these white rectangles. </p>

<p>I hope that other brothers who know about these things can come help you, for although I do know things, I do not necessarily know everything that is good to know.</p>

<p>I know white light healing works for your psyche, I know you can emit Chi into your own muscles to heal them. The thing is though, if you just relax, get away from all the negativity and bad energy, be yourself for a second, you will have impulses to do these things naturally anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can definitely see them any time you want, it is just about being in a state. The things that stop you from seeing them all the time, is your subconcious! You kinda secretly don&#39;t want to see them anymore, because you thought they were weird.</p>

<p>This is a great tool, as there are people with black Rukh that surround them. You can use this method to identify between people who have black rukh, white rukh or no rukh. &lt; Imo. I have seen black rukh, they emit from people who instantly make most people feel uneasy or anxious when they walk in a room.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for sharing the ATS link. Let&#39;s grow together. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a friend who studied Qi Gong Kung Fu to the point where he now owns his own school... anyways, back when he and I hung out we used to play this game that we cleverly named &quot;push hands&quot;. We&#39;d sit across from one another, cross legged, and put our hands up, palms forward, and attempt to push the other persons hands forwards by using only intention. We couldn&#39;t touch hands, we had to use Qi. </p>

<p>now this sounds crazy, but this was a guy who knew how to control his Qi, and so I felt his &quot;intention&quot; when he used it to push my hands backwards, and through that was able to find and focus my own Qi until I got to the point where I could sufficiently resist his intentions with my own... I even beat him a few times. </p>

<p>I know it sounds like malarky to those who haven&#39;t experienced it, but I&#39; with you OP. There is more to us than we will ever now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I have attempted Telepathic communication.</p>

<p>The person I attempted it to is my best friend in the entire world who I will refer to as E.F.. I had not seen him in 3 years, but I knew I would see him soon, as we would both be in the same spot over Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>I would always meditate for his well-being, but this time was different. It was a few days before we were going to meet up, he was across the country. I had been learning/feeling certain things, and done certain things, so I thought to myself, I can definitely send &quot;E.F.&quot; a message.</p>

<p>I sat in my shower, lights off, heat full blast, calmed myself, focus my Chi to my pineal gland and felt the energy be quite powerful when going through my throat chakra. Thought of E.F., how much I loved him, how I wanted him to do well in life, and to be happy. I also spoke to him where I would hear his &quot;replies&quot;, which I could not really distinguish clearly, but I could always attempt to make out what he was saying.</p>

<p>This is all fine and dandy, and one way or another, could or could not have worked. But, when we met up, I picked him up from home, said Hi to his parents, and immediately he was like man, tell me about what you&#39;ve been doing, etc etc. I thought he meant in life and general, but he was talking about the messages, and the communications I would send him. He said a few days before coming back home, he had been overwhelmed by like a force that was telling him it loved him, and he could speak to it. And that he felt this force in smaller amounts before. I explained everything to him. He believes that he too will be unlocking these mysteries of his body.</p>

<p>This happened as I 100% believe it happened, I did not purposeful embellish any facts, or distort any facts other than my friend&#39;s name.</p>

<p>This does not mean 100% that it is true. If you are not physically there to experience or feel something, then how can you truly know it has happened in that specific manner.</p>
