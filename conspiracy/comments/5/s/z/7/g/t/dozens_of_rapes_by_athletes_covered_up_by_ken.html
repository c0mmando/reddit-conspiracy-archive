        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sorry if this is already addressed below and I&#39;m stealing your thunder.</p>

<p>So many rapes at Baylor; NCAA death penalty likely; who was in charge? KEN FREAKIN STARR!</p>

<p>He had been behaving weirdly on this case for a while, check this out for incredibly damning behavior from Starr in an interview last year on this topic. We now know why: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZY6fSg495s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZY6fSg495s</a></p>

<p>Tevin Elliot, serial rapist, was being drummed out of the university for serious plagiarism, and boom, Ken Starr intervened and made his discipline controlled by the athletic department. Check out more of the quotes from Baylor athletics officials if you want to throw up and see the exact same type of thing that went on with Penn State: <a href="http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/18609288/art-briles-baylor-bears-assistants-buried-player-misbehavior-documents-say">http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/18609288/art-briles-baylor-bears-assistants-buried-player-misbehavior-documents-say</a></p>

<p>Ken Starr is evil, in case you didn&#39;t know, and was the lawyer for Jeffrey Epstein, super predator friend of Bill Clinton. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/30/conservative-scold-ken-starr-got-a-billionaire-pedophile-off.html">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/30/conservative-scold-ken-starr-got-a-billionaire-pedophile-off.html</a></p>

<p>There are other weird things in Starr&#39;s past, such as him writing on behalf of Christopher Kloman, a name I learned on a Pizzagate forum: <a href="http://gawker.com/he-took-the-time-to-chat-ken-starr-s-plea-for-a-chil-1464516616">http://gawker.com/he-took-the-time-to-chat-ken-starr-s-plea-for-a-chil-1464516616</a></p>

<p>....</p>

<p>Where does this all end? Before you go, consider that the person who cleared the Clintons of wrongdoing on Vince Foster, cleared Bill of Travelgate, and so many other scandals, and made Whitewater, where the Clintons were caught red handed of financial evil, instead about stains on a dress, was Ken Starr. And he&#39;s recently been praising Bill... <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/281021-kenneth-starr-praises-clinton-for-redemptive-process">http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/281021-kenneth-starr-praises-clinton-for-redemptive-process</a></p>

<p>KEN STARR WAS A PLANT BY THE CLINTONS ALL ALONG (who appointed him lol)!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;death penalty&quot; is not likely. They&#39;ve only done that once, and it was because the school (SMU) got busted while on probation for doing the same exact thing. SMU has never recovered and that was done in the 80&#39;s. </p>

<p>Baylor will be punished harshly, as they should but no, they won&#39;t get the NCAA death penalty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guarantee you the death penalty, with 52 rapes involving players, I think anything less than the death penalty will be seen as light. They might do a USF and commit athletic suicide, but we&#39;ll see. The Big 12 is denying revenue. I know lots of the pundits agree with you, but I wish there were some way I could bet on Baylor never playing DI athletics again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make good and true points, and you and most sports writers seem to agree on this.
However, I am speculating based on how the prevalence of campus sexual assault is under the media lens right now, the NCAA will start to face criticism from people outside of sports, for being soft on rape. This type of criticism is particularly effective against academic and bureaucrat types, to see your name in a New York Times op-ed or something. This is a shit-storm that we are only starting to understand, and more details are going to emerge.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you are right, it&#39;s hard to imagine something worse than Sandusky. </p>

<p>The arrow of time seems to make these things less tolerated, see for instance how Bob Stoops said Joe Mixon would be kicked off the team had his incident happened more recently than it had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Politicians and those who benefit from political favors need to maintain the status quo. That means protecting the image of the institution/system as much as the individual.</p>

<p>Even though there has been proof of political corruption for decades Americans like to think they are above the shrude pettiness and are not stone cold killers. If %100 acceptable proof cameout on things like murder the people would&#39;ve lost faith in the system long ago. If the system goes so goes their job security, money and power.</p>

<p>I always felt that Starr was a bit sluggish when trying to close the deal or obtain prosecution shall we say.</p>
