      <p>
       I've been severely depressed for the past year and when it first came out, Pokémon Go was monumental in getting me out of the house and active again. As a lifetime fan of the handheld games and the franchise, I really rode that widespread nostalgic high. Everyone was playing for a moment in time, and during those weeks my pokenerdism felt validated and it was cool again. Well fast forward to now and until two weeks ago, I was still playing daily and making a hobby out of it. It is a pretty fun app when used alongside fitness endeavors.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, as a lifetime fan of the franchise... a lot the way the app gameplay is styled has never quite sat right with me. The messages that the handheld game has always advocated are respect and reverence for nature, love and patience when training pokes, and the importance of working together. The game is especially keen on emphasizing that weak pokemon have value, can grow and improve just like people can, and that even when pokemon fight against one another and such, the most important thing is the trainer-pokemon bond.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what betrays so much of this when it comes to the app is the setup of progress. The way the game is designed, if you want a strong and powerful pokemon you can use in gyms, you have to power it up. How do you power it up? With "candy" obtained after "transferring" weaker level mons, which can be pretty easily seen as morbid and gruesome if you translate these actions IRL (think cannibalism...). After playing the app for a while, there really isn't a lot of similarity with the original vision of Pokémon. And this bothers me a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alright, so backtracking a bit... remember when spirit cooking started getting talked about? Well, that kind of prompted me to wake up with a little more gusto. I've always been one prone to conspiracy thought, been very passionate in the past against big pharma and the medical model in the US. A big fan of history, I've been aware of how filtered it is what we are taught, and secret societies have always kind of jumped at me. But I never quite followed such thought to the core, with genuine research and genuine time invested... you know, really getting into the spirit of questioning things because the consequence of knowledge is an eager tongue, and it's very easy to lose friends when you make them uncomfortable with what you want to talk about. Who wants to consider that the government is malicious, that we are purposefully being manipulated into mindless consumer behavior, and even more damning of all is consciousness-suppression? That answer is not many.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when I fell into my depressive episode last year, I just kind of stopped giving a shit. It was just the way the world worked, and yes, it sucks but what can you do? I just accepted it and didn't give it much thought... you don't care much about the state of the world when you don't even think you'll be alive by the end of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, well spirit cooking kind of jolted me awake. The email leaks grabbed my attention, because here, brought to light, was STRONG occult-in-government correlation. What struck me is how casual it all is... the fact that we have pictures of "performance art" dinners where these things are either likely occurring, or occurring with a likeness to it... and nobody really bats an eye. This is normalized? Either way, it disturbed me enough to go down the pizzagate rabbithole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter now... and I feel like I'm waking back up again. I've been researching so much as of late and going down all kinds of rabbitholes I wouldn't have touched before... I initially scoffed at Sandy Hook truthers and was actually really angry at the lack of insensitivity... but opening my eyes to the widespread pedophilia in the echelons of government really brought it home that false flags are entirely substantial enough to look into now, that it is not beyond THEM to hurt children... and now I'm ashamed to been so dismissive. But I understand it, because it is what they count on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just.. I'm angry. There is so much to be angry about. But the truth sets you free, and now it's time for the next steps... I don't know what this is in the days coming forward and the years to come... but I WILL do what I can to bring as much light into this world, to spread love and emanate love and to BE love. It's the most important thing we need in a world as bleak as this. We need each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being depressed for an entire year will dull you. And right now I feel the exact opposite of that. I feel sharp, I feel critical, I feel observant, aware, kind, and overall... I feel alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been reading that there's a consensus that all conspiracy thought leads you to spirituality... and I'm no different. This feels right, to understand the dual forces in our universe and to surrender yourself to what is instinctive and to what feels right...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, anyway, I've had trouble with continuing my use of Pokémon Go. I finally had to really take into consideration the background of John Hanke, the convoluted and confusing ball that the CIA seems to be, and marketing of the app in general. It's free, based on a nostalgic franchise that was guaranteed popular use (even if only for a bit)... it just seems too good of an opportunity to gather intel to be passed up. Consider the fact that honestly... the game sucks... the developers don't really have their heart in it either. Zero communication with the gaming community. I don't have a reason to play anymore. I'm honestly really, really sad to see something that I love be used so nefariously. :/
      </p>
      <p>
       So with this post written and rambled, I'll be deleting my account and deleting the app. There are better things I can be doing with my time, and I feel motivated to invest myself into becoming a person who can actually enact change. I'm not sure where that is big picture, but small picture right now is focusing on finishing my degree. I hope you all don't mind my rambliness, but I've been perusing this sub a lot lately and it's where I feel a little more sane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm very appreciative for a community like this. &lt;3

       I agree 100%. I have had this sort of awakening myself recently, and it becomes more disturbing the more you pull at the curtain. I believe just one person can enact change. The butterfly effect leading to complete awareness is drawing near. Good luck brother, and remember not to let this information cloud your vision.

       Definitely. The individual has so much more influence than we allow ourselves. I hope the future is bright and that the process of awakening only spreads. We can do our part. But smartly.

       I've thought about the craze often and it disturbs me how I fell sucker for it and even dropped like 150 bucks on buying "power ups'. That I could be herded like sheep even though I consider myself "woke"

       I actually was kind of a downer with the group of friends I used to play with because of how often I pointed out we were acting like a herd... And you're so right about how the app does villanize us in the eyes of the original game! Wow.

       pokémon go was crowdsourced high res mapping, they had to make it about extreme 'consumption' of pokemon to accomplish this goal-- i had the same qualms about my friends playing it as you did, it seemed cruel to value your pokemon by what they give YOU, like that's what the villains do.

       I actually gave a listen to Watts' talk on How to Be Better Self yesterday while running errands. I'm drawing upon him as a spiritual teacher while I embark on the beginnings of this path. I take your recommendation as only further cementing of a good decision, heh.

       My degree is in psychology! I know it's kind of a biiig aspiration but I've been thinking about law school or an MA in policy.. I've had some successful stints with local grassroot politics and while they were brief, it's given me the experience that makes me think I'd really enjoy serving for the people at some level government. I want to be one of the good guys. I think I can be.

       Check out the Law of One
      </p>
      <p>
       Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of human civilization define Infinity as Unity, ultimately everything is part of All there is/Infinity and thus everything can't help but be the Creator/Universe experiencing itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of "God"/existence as well in session 13

        The way the game is designed, if you want a strong and powerful pokemon you can use in gyms, you have to power it up. How do you power it up? With "candy" obtained after "transferring" weaker level mons, which can be pretty easily seen as morbid and gruesome if you translate these actions IRL (think cannibalism...). After playing the app for a while, there really isn't a lot of similarity with the original vision of Pokémon. And this bothers me a lot.

       From my understanding, you can give your "weaker" pokemon to the professor, where he basically converts them into a candy item that you can feed to your other pokemon to make them stronger. The process that professor uses to make the candy is unknown, but a lot can be inferred in that the weaker pokemon is "sacrificed" so it's essence can be consumed as a candy by other pokemon.

       I'm one of those with an eye for details like that freed converted natives in Sid Meier's

       (and in
       <em>
        FreeCol
       </em>
       as well) turn white upon learning a profession, so I would have made a similar connection to cannibalism, no doubt. Especially since one forms emotional attachments to one's own mons, giving them names, watching them "grow" and stuff, it's even more gruesome.

       Welcome to the community, though I dislike the "red pill blue pill" analogy.  There are many, many false pills so take things with a grain of salt. There are multiple channels of disinfo using both shills and bots and very little verifiable truth to go around. Especially in politics.

       Welcome friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never indulged in Pokémon Go. I really was a huge fan of it in my childhood (90's kids forever), but I was naturally distrustful of several aspects of gameplay, specifically the mapping, camera functions, and app permissions. I can't say that I believe it was a government tool, but I suspect - and I do think it could have been used for much evil if allowed. Always stay suspicious and aware of your surroundings, even devices around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely agree on the correlation/causation (which?) of awakening and spirituality. It's hard to believe in moral and imperative right/wrong without believing that there is someone or something higher than you to answer to or to be beholden by.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly believe that this world is more aware than ever, and that it is growing more strong every day. I hope we continue down the path of enlightenment. Many spiritual leaders  are saying we are now entering an age of enlightenment. I certainly hope so.

       If you could keep the basic mechanic of human moves fone thrpugh augmented gameworld and otherwise the "play" could be similar or entirely different, what would you design as some of the cool updates to the original franchise in this setting? Ie, training pokemon sounds actually cool, so somehow include that, right? What else?
