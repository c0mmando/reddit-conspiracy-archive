    <div class="md"><p>never said any hacking, i&#39;m just saying it&#39;s not news that they try to probe our infrastructure. All countries do it, including china (who gets our plans for military blueprints like jets), which they seemingly don&#39;t mention at all unless it&#39;s Trump or his team explaining it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a (false) narrative pushed by the news for a reason. Let me ask you if they did overwhelmingly hack to influence the election: don&#39;t you think its more impactful for a certain party to hold a tape like the D Trump &quot;grab em by the pussy&quot; tape (which you know they were sitting on for a while, and release it right before the debate? Or the fact that there is CLEAR evidence the primaries were heavily tilted, if not rigged, in favor of Clinton? Why is Russian hacking discussed, but that isn&#39;t? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not old news, there are still plenty of brainwashed lefties in California / New York that still believe Hillary is the winner/russia is responsible (along with comey, racists, men, white women, enter following tantrum excuse to your desire). I live in LA, you should see my facebook feed. </p>

<p>I&#39;d argue that again, according to main press outlets, he is the least popular president ever. Most of the conversations i&#39;ve had in business and in my personal life have the majority of people either liking him or liking what he&#39;s doing (actually taking action). I trust the approval rating polls as much as i trust the pre-election polls. They are just stats and stats can be manipulated to present a desired outcome. </p>

<p>He won the presidency because the rule to winning is you need 270 electoral votes, so he campaigned like a mad man on his own 747 jet in the areas he needed to, he had a game plan (while clinton sat back having the press, celebrities and Obama/his wife tell everyone they should vote for her while nothing has changed). Take away California (brainwashed by Hollywood and San Fran progressive Berkeley/elitist tendencies) , Trump wins by 1.4MM votes. Also, many articles coming out showing that hillary did in fact receive illegal votes, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised 2MM in the least. check this article. Also, fun fact, my parents have a family friend who&#39;s canadia and was laughing about how he voted this election, EZ, just went in and voted, didnt have to provide anything (so it&#39;s completely possible unlike the left/media us). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, she <em>did</em> win the popular vote. Unless you completely disagree with the voting stats that&#39;s not up for debate. </p>

<p>As for Cali, come on now, you can&#39;t pick and choose states and still say we&#39;re the <strong>U</strong>SA. That&#39;s like saying &quot;Take Away Texas and Florida&quot; and...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying take away a state, i&#39;m just showing you the magnitude of California alone (where a lot of people also conveniently poor in from south of the border). The point i&#39;m making is the popular vote doesn&#39;t even matter, you NEED 270 electoral votes to even be considered a president. So do say &quot;She won the popular vote&quot; is essentially comparable to me saying &quot;if you don&#39;t count California...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s actually the ~63 million people that were conned by Trump that more closely resemble brainless sheep.

    <div class="md"><p>on the ACA because they were legally obligated to thanks to obama, unless they wanted to pay penalties (he made it law). I think ~63 million people voted for an actual change to happen, not trump himself. Something that hasn&#39;t happened in a long long time and didn&#39;t happen with Obama either, no matter what he&#39;ll tell you. Our country was not going in the right direction, and people paying attention could easily see that was the case. If anyone really cares they could see where clinton stood on almost every issue, and it wasn&#39;t progress, i&#39;ll tell you that right now </p>

<p>The federal government was never supposed to control our education - it was an issue that should have been left to the states because each state varies tremendously in the needs for their students. Having broad, overreaching policies has stifled education and we need some competition a fire under educators&#39; asses. School choice and vouchers are the only way to introduce competition to our failing system. </p>

<p>They absolutely are. The impossible part is identifying them and distinguishing them from the normal people with opinions that the professionals are trying to imitate.</p>

<p>Take a post you think is CTR and prove that it actually is from CTR and not someone who just agrees with their message, or from another manipulation group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 25. Realized a few years ago everything I know about history is wrong and that I&#39;ve been programmed by public school to be a good little boy that never asks any questions and that I can &quot;do anything I set my mind to&quot; like become a women&#39;s studies professional and work at starbucks till I die. The world as taught to us in public school is not the world we actually live in. We were trained from 1st grade on to memorize incorrect facts so we can fill in little bubbles and if we get enough bubbles correct the school gets paid. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just highly unlikely to me that this Betsy outsider lady that&#39;s being demonized right now could possibly do any worse than what I was forced to attend.

I live in LA, you should see my facebook feed. </p>

<p>I&#39;d argue that again, according to main press outlets, he is the least popular president ever. Most of the conversations i&#39;ve had in business and in my personal life have the majority of people either liking him or liking what he&#39;s doing (actually taking action). I trust the approval rating polls as much as i trust the pre-election polls. They are just stats and stats can be manipulated to present a desired outcome. </p>

<p>He won the presidency because the rule to winning is you need 270 electoral votes, so he campaigned like a mad man on his own 747 jet in the areas he needed to, he had a game plan (while clinton sat back having the press, celebrities and Obama/his wife tell everyone they should vote for her while nothing has changed). Take away California (brainwashed by Hollywood and San Fran progressive Berkeley/elitist tendencies) , Trump wins by 1.4MM votes. Also, many articles coming out showing that hillary did in fact receive illegal votes, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised 2MM in the least. check this article. Also, fun fact, my parents have a family friend who&#39;s canadia and was laughing about how he voted this election, EZ, just went in and voted, didnt have to provide anything (so it&#39;s completely possible unlike the left/media us). </p>
