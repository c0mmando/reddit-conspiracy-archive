        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, I&#39;m going to sum the idea up to capture your attention.</p>

<p>The 32 NFL owners + the commissioner gather every week to talk about their business:</p>

<p>Commissioner: How can we make more money?</p>

<p>Owners: We need to have very epic games, close games... Entertaining games.</p>

<p>Commissioner: Yes, I know, but what can we do when a team is destroying the opposite team in an important game like the Super Bowl, making it boring.</p>

<p>Owners: Well, we can rig the game in several ways to make it more interesting.</p>

<p>Commissioner: Got it.</p>

<p>So, basically owners win more money if matches are entertaining (especially the very important matches like the Super Bowl).</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if their own teams win the trophy, for owners winning is not the important thing... The important thing is entertainment, that will grow the league&#39;s fan base, which will generate more revenue for the league and therefore they will win more money.</p>

<p>But how can you rig something without making it too obvious?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Referees: They ask referees to give the 50-50% calls and the 40-60% calls to the team that is losing... All sports have these kind of calls that can go either way without creating much controversy. </p></li>
<li><p>Coaching staff: There are some coaches that are not in the spotlight and have a lot of influence in the game that can be easily convinced to make the game more entertaining, which is what happened in the Super Bowl LI, the offensive coach was told by NFL directives not to burn the clock down (which is very boring), to make the match more interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>Players: There are some players that don&#39;t make much money and are on the verge of retirement that are easier to bribe, these players can make stupid mistakes that can change things completely... I mean it&#39;s very hard to bribe top quarterbacks (they don&#39;t even try to bribe them) who are sponsored by top brands, brands that will give them a lot of money for winning the whole thing... So they bribe &#39;desperate&#39; players.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Many people think that leagues do everything possible to make one player (the star of the sport) win the whole thing... No, the NFL didn&#39;t want Tom Brady to win it... The NFL just want entertaining matches, close matches, and close matches can go either way. </p>

<p>In the case of MLB and NBA, they do everything possible to take the finals to the seventh game, which means more money. </p>

<p>I watched the NBA finals of last year and they were absolutely rigged.</p>

<p>Today I heard this, the MLS commissioner admitted that in the past the league favoured teams because it was building the league. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.tsn.ca/radio/vancouver-1040-i-1410/garber-no-favouritism-in-mls-in-the-past-there-was-1.665819">Link</a></p>

<p>So in short, the problem is that owners don&#39;t compete against each other to win more money or to not go bankruptcy, they win more money if the league wins more money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with American leagues is that there is no balance of power. All owners are a single entity... They all win or they all lose.</p>

<p>For example in the European Soccer Leagues, clubs can go bankruptcy for losing taking with them the owners and presidents. They compete against each other. In American Leagues owners are one team they compete against other sports, and to compete against other sports and win you have to be more entertaining than the other sports. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s surely the case with the NBA though I don&#39;t think every owner is involved in this, if at all, because they might have other motivations than making the most profit. For some owners teams are primary hobbies and long term investment secondary.</p>

<p>In the case of the NBA I assume this is coming from the league management itself trying to create a more exciting product/next superstar to sell for marketing which indirectly guarantees their own income growth.</p>

<p>Think of increasing shareholder by the management by whatever means to increase the value of their bonuses.</p>

<p>David Stern, the ex commissioner, was &quot;god&quot; for decades and most, if not &quot;all&quot;, team owners weren&#39;t much more than franchise licensees. If somebody steps over the line they&#39;ll get punished.</p>

<p>P.S. Then there&#39;s also the betting mafia...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can influence the game but they can&#39;t outright rig it. They can&#39;t control if the hoop goes in the basket, etc. </p>

<p>When I watch underdog teams in professional sports it&#39;s clear they&#39;re not just playing against the opposing team.</p>

<p>Statistically it&#39;s hard to prove influence because referees are often aware to balance playcalling on both sides, but it ultimately comes down to situational influence, as certain calls are way more critical to the game.</p>

<p>My introduction to the the nba being anti-competitive cme during the Sacramento kings vs lakers conference finals however long ago that was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the point, they can&#39;t control all of that, but they can do many things to make games entertaining.</p>

<p>I mean in the Super Bowl, Atlanta Falcons was winning by a large margin so NFL directives did everything possible to help New England Patriots to score points, they did this by asking referees to benefit the Patriots and asking the Falcons offensive coach to make silly mistakes, for example, to not burn the clock down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I only watched the 4th quarter but I didn&#39;t notice anything too egregious in the super bowl. In my humble opinion, Falcons lost because they had everything to lose, causing them to play under duress, while the Patriots benefit from having nothing to lose usually.</p>

<p>The coaches would not be in on any sort of conspiracy, you&#39;re giving them way too much credit. They&#39;re not even necessarily that smart many of them--Mike Tice for example, got caught scalping tickets to games etc.</p>

<p>If you want an example of &quot;rigging&quot; I&#39;d rewatch the lions-greenbay game from the wildcard.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a tad nearsighted due to how ridiculous that Super Bowl was. Last year&#39;s game was okay, mostly uneventful and not too close. Year before that Pats Seahawks was an all-timer, but the year before that, Denver Seattle was an absolute blowout. I&#39;m not discrediting your theory and there&#39;s definitely some validity to it, but just thought I&#39;d raise a counterpoint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why the offensive coach didn&#39;t burn the clock down? I mean even fans who barely know the rules know that the best thing to do in that situation is burning down the clock.</p>

<p>Owners win more money if the Super Bowl is entertaining, and given the recent problems of the leagues, they needed this kind of entertaining match a lot.</p>

<p>If the offensive coach burned the clock down it would have been one of the most boring Super Bowls in history, which would have affected the NFL. He was asked not to do that.</p>
