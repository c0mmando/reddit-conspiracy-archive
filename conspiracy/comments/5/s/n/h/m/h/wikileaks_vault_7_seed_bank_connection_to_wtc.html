        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Don&#39;t know if its of any importance, but Cary Fowler who started the Svalbard Global Seed Bank is married to billionaire Amy Goldman, daughter of Sol Goldman who owned a sizable chunk of New York and whose portfolio at the time of his death in 1987 is estimated to be worth over $13 billion now.</p>

<p>Speaking of Goldman&#39;s company Solil in a 2016 <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2016/06/29/billionaire-goldman-family-richest-in-real-estate/2/#1fd9dc8114b4">Forbes article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Both Solil and cousin Lloyd Goldman&#39;s BLDG Management each also have a 16.67% stake in the World Trade Center projects reinvigorating downtown Manhattan.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meaning the wife of the man who built and still actively participates in the management of Svalbard Global Seed Vault has familial and financial ties to 33.33% of the rebuilding efforts on the WTC property following 9/11.  Also, the marriage is very recent and both Fowler and Goldman are older, seems like it could have been a marriage of convenience? </p>

<p>From Lloyd Goldman&#39;s (1 of 2 main heirs and managers of Sol&#39;s portfolio) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Goldman">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In early 2001, he partnered with <strong>Larry Silverstein</strong> and Joseph Cayre to purchase the lease of the World Trade Center from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey[3][1] for $3.2 billion.[4] The partnership was required to post $800 million in fees and down payments to win the deal. Goldman and Cayre posted a combined $110 million; Silverstein contributed $14 million; Frank Lowy&#39;s Westfield America contributed $127 million (Westfield controlled the retail mall at the trade center); and $563 million was borrowed from GMAC Financing.[5] Goldman was to receive 25% of the management fees.[1] In 2006, Goldman&#39;s share was increased to 50% and he will take over control of the project from Silverstein in 2016.[1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dunno.  Given that many of the more recent connections stemming from the Vault 7 tweets seem to relate, at least tangentially, to 9/11 I thought that this might be worth someone with a better grasp on all of this investigating. Hell, someone probably already has and found that there isn&#39;t much here.  But thought it might at least be worth spinning some wheels on until we get the next tweet.</p>

Bill and Melinda Gates, Rockefeller foundation, and DuPont are among the initial donors to the Crop Trust, so that seems like a great crew. /s</p>
