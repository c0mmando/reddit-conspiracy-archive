       While investigating Pizzagate the following connections were made: a woman who had been abused as a child was involved in a ring that is now long gone. Looking into the currently 80+ year old former ringleader, it was found that he/she is connected to a location called Harbin Hot Springs in California.

       were found that in the 60s this location was run by a CIA agent, Donald Hamrick, who used psychotherapists to perform MKUltra experiments at the commune inside the Harbin compound called Harbinger. The information that started this investigation as well as the links that followed is documented in a

       There became a lot of suspicious things associated with Harbin Hot Springs, but what became clear almost immediately is that Harbin is just one of many “New Age” locations that are part of an

        international infrastructure
       </a>
       (via an organization called Centers Gathering) with ties to the UN, the European educational system, and so much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was first discovered that Harbin was tied to 5 other organizations under the umbrella of

       It was at this point that I came across a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHxGQjirV-c">
        curious presentation
       </a>
       titled “How the Secret World Government Works” given by Dr. Steven Greer, the founder of the Disclosure project, in November 2015. The Disclosure Project, formed in 1994, brought together hundreds of government and military witnesses willing to testify in front of Congress their experience with UFO phenomena in their careers. Dr. Greer gives a history of the “Deep State” network that details how since the Roswell incident in 1947, and potentially earlier, the Deep State has worked to tighten security around the fact that we are now, and have been in the past, being visited by alien life. Greer presents witness testimony and documentation that suggests by 1957 Eisenhower had lost control of the UFO project, prompting his
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyBNmecVtdU">
        warning about the Military Industrial Complex
       </a>
       before leaving office. Dr. Greer goes on to show classified documents where the CIA discusses the creation of these aforementioned “Satanic UFO Cults” as means of psychological warfare. He argues the drug trade and weapons deals allow the Deep State to fund these “Unacknowledged Special Access Projects”. It seems that human trafficking also provides funds for these black projects. The development of these black projects seem to date back to the time of Nikola Tesla’s death. Dr. Greer in November 2015 formally accused the FBI of taking these documents, which detail, upon others, Tesla’s latest creation of an
       <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/nikola-tesla">
        electromagnet death ray
       </a>
       . This death ray, according to Greer and witnesses, was used to shoot down the alien craft in Roswell in 1947. Just recently the FBI, in what appeared to be a nod to
       <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/85674498/">
        4chan’s theory
       </a>
       about Trump being a time traveler, released documents officially declassifying the documents around the FBI’s confiscation of Tesla’s work. The 4chan post detailed Trump’s grandfather’s connection to Nikola Tesla, and argued that Trump holds secrets of Tesla’s as well that the FBI didn’t confiscate. These recently declassified documents mention Tesla’s latest work at the time involving
       <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/nikola-tesla/Nikola%20Tesla%20Part%2001%20of%2003/view">
        "gravity and cosmic ray research"
       </a>
       , which led to his
       <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/361046-tesla-death-ray-fbi/">
        electromagnetic ray
       </a>
       being used 4 years later at Roswell.
      </p>
      <p>
       While there are various "opinions" on the internet that paint Greer as a scam artist, the large amount of government witnesses that he has gathered over the years willing to testify in front of Congress regarding their experiences is astounding on its own. In 2001, a few months before 9/11, Dr. Greer held a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkswXVmG4xM">
        press conference
       </a>
       in Washington DC where many witnesses gave a short talk about their experiences, and distributed a briefing document that detailed the experiences of 400+ witnesses Greer had identified.
      </p>
      <p>
       After looking into
       <a href="https://youtu.be/aS4GYJtVqkY">
        NASA footage
       </a>
       , suspicious
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x84QrZxRKE">
        activity surrounding atomic weapons
       </a>
       sites around the globe, and UFO witness testimony in general, it becomes convincing that there was something being hidden around the UFO phenomena. Greer’s research done into the actions of the Deep State explains a lot of the geopolitical situations that have occurred over the past 7 decades. This post will not be able to singlehandedly convince you of the fact that this is real, but please look at the witness testimony. Greer’s presentations and the evidence he presents within, while long, are substantial enough to stand on their own and against any further scrutiny down the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was at this point that I stumbled upon
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_Monast">
        Serge Monast
       </a>
       . Being inspired by
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Guy_Carr">
        William Carr
       </a>
       , Monast began writing in the early 90s about a New World Order. He believed that there was a NASA project called Blue Beam with the goal of uniting the population under one world religion. He specifically cites the
       <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/sergemonast1994transcript.shtml">
        writing of David Spangler
       </a>
       , Findhorn founder, as the basis of this world religion. In a transcript of a talk given by Monast in 1994, he talks about how Blue Beam’s plan is to stage an ancient discovery that will shatter the current story of human history, and in turn shatter world dogma. Following this discovery, a “cosmic false flag” event would occur where holograms and other technology would be used to stage a “cosmic light show” that would be used to establish a new messiah under New Age religion. Monast died a day after being taken into custody by local authorities from a heart attack, with his supporters claiming he was killed by the use of “psychotronic” weapons. According to
       <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/search/site/psychotronic">
        documents
       </a>
       digitized a few weeks ago by the CIA, this psychotronic technology is real and was studied by the CIA.

It appears unclear exactly what is detailed in their handwriting, but marked in a photocopied book at the end of this release are these two subject ID’s where they detail an alien abduction event with memory loss on the anonymous source. The psychological experimentation done by the CIA is instrumental in the planning of this false flag Monast talked about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oddly enough, Dr. Greer has been warning about a cosmic false flag event occurring since 1993. His story of the events, instead, is that using reverse engineered spacecraft that we have developed since 1947, this shadow government will stage an interstellar invasion with the intention of convincing us that alien life is dangerous. Greer argues that this is how the Military Industrial Complex will keep their control over the Disclosure process. In November 2016, he gave
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyWhf6BglXE">
        another presentation
       </a>
       titled “The Cosmic False Flag”, arguing that they have had the ability to pull this event off for a long time, they have been preparing for it, and that this event is imminent. Greer also makes mention of holograms and other technology that will be used to convince us this attack is real, as well as hinting at the fact that psychotronic weapons are real and have been used by this group to stage alien abductions. Towards the end of the presentation he answers a question about Corey Goode, and specifically mentions Tom Delonge and Corey Goode as being people who are, by the use of psychotronic weapons and deception, being used by these military agencies to feed us this narrative of a threatening alien race. Tom Delonge is featured
       <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?q=tom+delonge">
        multiple times
       </a>
       in the Podesta Emails updating Podesta on his project with General MacCaskill to write a series of fictional and nonfiction books to help bring Disclosure to the younger generation. In an
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzLqBx5lN8Y">
        interview with Jimmy Church
       </a>
       , Tom implies that when the “truth” comes out, we will all be very thankful for the men and women working on these black projects for protecting us from a perceived alien threat. Corey Goode claims to have insider knowledge of the alien programs as well as having been abducted himself. Greer argues these experiences were actually created for Goode so that he would spread the narrative that is being given to him. In turn, the stories would bait Tom to repeat the cabal’s narrative that we are under attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in the Podesta files are
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=Edgar+Mitchell&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=6#searchresult">
        multiple emails from individuals like Edgar Mitchell
       </a>
       , the 6th man on the moon, about Zero Point Energy and alien Disclosure – arguing that rumors of an alien threat are dangerous and in fact a lie. This group has been holding back life changing energy devices, and it appears that Wikileaks was revealing other things in these emails. Mitchell tells Podesta to be on the side of peaceful Disclosure – even sending Podesta a draft of a treaty banning weapons in space – a treaty that Russia and China signed later – missing the signatures of the United States, Ukraine, and Israel. Several amendments suggested by Mitchell’s staff were adopted into the final draft that was signed. Through various sequences of emails you can see that Podesta, via his secretary, set up meetings with multiple individuals around the UFO subject. No matter what the truth is, John Podesta, and many others throughout history have taken this subject very seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corey Goode has had buzz around him recently due to his

       . Assuming Greer is telling the truth, Corey Goode is being fed a narrative that is according to “their” plan. Serge Monast argued that the NWO would make an ancient discovery that would be used as the first step towards “Partial Disclosure” where a fake narrative will be given to us to reveal the existence of this free energy technology. This ties directly into Greer’s warning of a Cosmic False Flag event being imminent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on this research, the following conclusions can be made:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) One or both of the following is true:
      </p>
      <p>
       a. Non-Human entities exist and the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMbmdFOvTs">
        secret societies
       </a>
       JFK warned us about have been in contact with them in one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       b. There exists a large-scale psychological operation, rooted in MKUltra, perpetrated with the help of the Military Industrial Complex to use the UFO phenomena to control the public while technology that has been in development since the death of Nikola Tesla is kept secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) New Age organizations will play a key role in whatever “their” plan is in the disclosure of this technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) TPTB are preparing for an event that will be focused around Antarctica. If the rumors about Pizzagate arrests are true, I imagine this will be used to drown out the scope of those arrests. This global cabal is on its last leg and has failed in their attempt to get their “priestess” Hillary Clinton in control while UFOlogist and child-molester John Podesta was
       <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/apas/status/818784929874112513">
        preparing to be her Secretary of State
       </a>
       . This discovery in Antarctica will simply be used to “discover” that human history is at least tens of thousands of years older and lost to an ancient civilization. This is in the same vein at
       <a href="https://grahamhancock.com/ancient-aliens-or-a-lost-civilization/">
        Graham Hancock’s work
       </a>
       (which was
       <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1377806/BBC-re-edits-Horizon-after-watchdogs-attack.html">
        censored by the BBC
       </a>
       ). It is no surprise that TPTB have been holding on to this information. This will be used to reveal the existence of very advanced technology that has solved many of the quagmires of modern physics. Our past holds the clues to our future, and as Orwell said:
      </p>
      <p>
       “He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.”
      </p>
      <p>
       We are close to a pivotal moment in current human history that could determine whether or not we go the way of our ancestors. Alex Jones, who first broke the story about the existence of these societies like
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpKdSvwYsrE">
        Bohemian Grove

       OP, you might be interested to look into the Vatican side of this. They have ("share premises with") a telescope called VATT-Lucifer looking for exoplanets, and the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Gabriel_Funes">
        head of the Roman Observatory
       </a>
       (an Argentine Jesuit, friend of Francis),
       <a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/believing_in_aliens_not_opposed_to_christianity_vaticans_top_astronomer_says/">
        said
       </a>
       , in essence, ETIs would not have committed the original sin, would not have been thrown out of the garden of Eden, would thus not be concerned with redemption. This means the Vatican saying if an ETI ever shows up we could turn to it as the messiah. This is what he says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We could think that in this universe there can be 100 sheep, equivalent to different kinds of creatures. We, belonging to human kind could be precisely the lost sheep, the sinners that need the shepherd. God became man in Jesus to save us. In that way, assuming that there would be other intelligent beings, we could not say that they need redemption . They could have remained in full friendship with the Creator."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think people underestimate the theological implications of this.

       Wow great comment thanks. The Vatican is 100℅ involved in this, I just can't understand how exactly. One of the witnesses in Greer's 2001 Press Conference mentioned being involved in a lawsuit against the Vatican pertaining to documents they had in relation to ETs. He claims to have seen those documents. I'll have to dig into your link a bit more but I appreciate the link!

       If there is one thing I learned from all of this is that I wish I had taken the UFO emails in the Podesta emails more seriously when they first came out. I was convinced shills were the ones bringing them up as a distraction, but I am now positive these emails are so much more important and we originally thought.

       I think the biggest threat to the Vatican would be if they were exposed and shown to be directly involved with systemic human trafficking and podophilia.  Also:

       I remember listening to a Higherside Chats podcast with Leo Zagami, an author who had information on an extra dimensional entity that was supposed to have lived/ resided/visited (what do extra dimensional beings do to show consistent presence?) on Mount Graham.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Apache had long held the area the telescope was built as sacred because of spiritual value associated with communication with the extra dimensional entity.  Eventually, the Vatican won the lawsuit and the LUCIFER telescope was built.

       I’m not sure if it's related but considering the occult relationships, subject matter, and the current state of transition that the world is in. There may be some relationship between this and OP’s theory even if its background information only.

       This video is from a YT channel called Outer Dark. He appears to be taking a break from making vids right now but still has a bunch more up on this very topic.

       In general,  I think there are more vids on YT about it if you search.

       I still find it really hard to believe this wtf?  These people don't even try to hide it  I knew they had jumped the shark when the Pope immediately jumped on "fake news" bandwagon with his,  "Watching fake news is like eating feces". ???

       I've heard it mentioned multiple times that "free will" is an actual rule that must be followed, hence why the wicked must leave obvious clues and symbols so that anyone willing to think for themselves and not follow blindly as sheep can recognize the darkness and choose good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I just think humans are insane and the more money and power insane people get, the more damage and weird shit they do. There's plenty of broke powerless morons out there sacrificing chickens and trying to cast spells that work at Hot Topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if there was a real battle between whatever the good energy in the universe is and the evil in a bid for your energy (or soul) it would make sense that the "false prophets" would have to make it somewhat obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say that there are no accidents at that high of a level as the Vatican. So I'm sure plenty of people looked at the plans and said "uh, hey guys, this looks like....a serpent, I mean that's kind of a big deal with the whole Christianity thing.....right?"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious they wanted it that way, I'm not sure I believe they are channeling evil spirits as much as that they are just goofy humans with way too much power and money that like everyone else, have no idea what happens when we die or why we are here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pope would either have to know he is a bullshit artist, or actually be connected to some sort of evil power. I'm going with bullshit artist, the Wizard of Oz, but maybe he is one of the highest demons, what do I know.

       It means there is an hermetic plan for a new world order, or a "golden age of man", that will last 1000 years, and that would see the world unite under one government, one religion, one money. This is apocalyptic/theosophist shit. But the central planners are very superstitious.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO this is how they will try playing it out:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         They crash the monetary system and reveal to the world we have been governed by pedocidal maniacs. They throw in for sock value some footage of beloved politicians engaging in monstrous acts. They have been encouraging this practice for a long time, for the purpose of blackmail, but also to bring it all out when time would be right.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They concomitantly ramp up their prosecution of the ongoing "clash of civilisations" with Islam, multiplying false-flag terrorist attacks, domestic repression and internment camps (mostly for Muslims but also for dissenters, as always).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Countries that by point that are not engaged in world, regional or civil war will be few. They will have effectively destroyed nations.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         All the while they will keep promoting New Age / theosophist cultism.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When the time is right, and the people are exhausted by the violence, they bring in their messiah; probably an ETI of some kind (whether real or not). He would bring what they call "universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer".
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       But they will fail, for we know the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let them bring down the child killers, we'll deal with the actual central planners later.

       Damn it. I was afraid you would say something to this effect. This new age religion has been building for some time now. I have never really regarded it as nefarious, but something that needs to be examined further. 
In your opinion, (hypothetical)ETI's- friend or foe? Or both. 
If you don't mind me asking... Do you consider yourself religious? I was raised christian and often struggle with how this all fits together with what I was raised believing.

       There are creatures, so there must be a creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus didn't ascribe to the view we "needed to be saved" because "we were all sinners". He said: "I am a rabbi, I hacked our obscurantist Jewish law, and here is the good news: none of you are damned anymore, you were never damned in the first place, anyhow you are henceforth saved, just reject the old laws and accept this simple truth, God isn't jealous or angry, he loves you, and his kingdom is inside you".
      </p>
      <p>
       This means I don't need a priest, or Pope, or guru to intercede with God on my behalf. I am my own, sovereign self, and my only master is my own conscience.

       there's a whole path of more linked posts from the OP. I agree the post and the premise as a whole are really on point, there's really nobody else out there saying this stuff. That's why I made the connection right away when I saw your posts.

       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g5w86/revealed_us_spy_operation_that_manipulates_social/c1l53bj/?context=1">
        this post in particular?
       </a>
       One thing that bugs me out is, the post was obviously made when the concept of shills or paid actors posting was pretty unfamiliar and foreign. You can tell by how the OP topic is a totally novel thing, and also there's way too much descriptive language being used to describe something that would be extremely simple if it wasn't a foreign concept. And the whole premise of the multi-post argument of course is that some hidden power is spelling all of this stuff out for us, manipulating us. Then what, during this election they suddenly forgot how to be sneaky and started doing crazy obvious shit, like for example CTR shills copying and pasting the same text in different posts many times and getting caught? It's obvious that it really is being spelled out extremely slowly, making sure everyone has the opportunity to draw the same conclusions, because we still don't fucking get it! So to me that post is just insane.

       One would think you're not sovereign if you still need a God, and as such, you
       <em>

       have a master. There still could be a creator, or universal deity out there, but if it really created this reality, I doubt our human minds could begin to conceive it.

       I am also Christian, and I see all of this fitting within the biblical description of end times. The "aliens" are demons and Nephilim (hybrid children of cast out angels/giants and humans that were born prior to the flood of Noah's time). CERN and D-wave technology (quantum computing) fit perfectly into this scenario. Mandela effect is a result of quantum modification to elements of "this" reality (e.g., the lion lays down with the lamb - now is wolf lays down with the lamb - see Isaiah 11:6 KJV). SOOO many changes of the Bible point toward a new world religion - it is no longer trustworthy (as predicted - the children will hunger for the Word of God and not find it). The false messiah event will be just that. We are warned throughout the Bible that there will be false messiahs and demons during end days and that many will be fooled into believing that it is Christ's return. The "mark of the Beast" will be microchipping people and requiring it to make purchases. It is too close to scripture, in my mind, to not be real. If you read the Books of Daniel, Isaiah, 1 and 2 Peter, Romans, Amos, Thessalonians, and Revelation (to name a few), you can find all of the prophesized events. So, for me, this is the beginning of the Tribulation, as forecast by God. Time to turn to Jesus (repent and accept Him as the true Son of God who died and was resurrected to act as the sacrifice for our sins, thereby saving our souls) and focus on getting through the lies that are to come. Remember, He is a free gift and only through Jesus can we reach the promised land and live with God. [just my opinion. please don't bash me for my beliefs, random posters]

       No bashing here. Thank you for sharing. I need to go back a reread the Bible, it's been a long time. But you are correct, so many signs that was ingrained in my brain are hard to ignore. In my early adult years I sought to find my own beliefs. I have sought to understand other interpretations and drawn my own conclusions. But this new age religion always throws a red flag at me and I have never been able to pinpoint why. Now, I have a better idea why the red flags.

       There is so much to be said...I have studied extensively at a Christian university, and am so blessed to have been exposed to God's Word during that time. There is no denial of the scriptural significance and the parallels are simply too numerous and significant to ignore. There is a great deception afoot, and I suspect that things will be rapidly speeding up in the next few months to a year. I am praying for everyone I meet, as my family members all believe me to be insane at this point; waking up to these truths is a mind-blowing experience, but it is too real to deny...while it sounds terrible and frightening, it is actually a fascinating time to be alive! Go forward without fear, but guard your heart and mind -- the false prophets are everywhere. Blessings in Jesus' name!

       I posted about this recently and got promptly down voted in r/conspiracy.  The new age "spiritual" ideology is getting pushed with increasing frequency, precisely because it fits in with the shadow cabal's agendas.  It promotes moral relativism and blurred boundaries between truth and fantasy in order to break down existing dogmas and introduce palatable 'religion' for the masses as another means of control.  And ultimately, it promotes Satan's number one agenda: to lead everyone away from Christ by promising that we can be our own gods and achieve "true enlightenment."  Same old tricks he used on Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden to lead to man's separation from God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus (Yeshua) came to us in human form to build the bridge back between the Creator and his creation.  He will come back again soon to crush the devil and bring swift justice to this broken world. Jesus IS the truth, the way and the life.  He loves us more than we can imagine. It is never too late to ask him to reveal the truth of who He is to you.

       Certainly! I've learned to ignore the down votes...lol. The developers of the D-Wave quantum computer have stated that their objective is to achieve AI within a short period of time; I believe AI is planned for use as a substitute to humans, as the elite plan massive depopulation (exhausting their "worker" pool) and can use AI to perform work without consuming resources (also, without free will, they will be easier to control). I believe also that this falls in line with the objectives of the anti-christ - to use these resources to gather further information on the human population -- to track them, mark them, and control or destroy them during the Tribulation. Blessings!

       A good source for information on quantum computing/D-Wave is

       For CERN, there are many on youtube, but this is pretty thorough:

       For Satan and Demons: Revelation-throughout the book, including 12:9 NIV: The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Nephilim/Biblical:  Genesis 6:4-7; Numbers 13:33 (NIV) -- BibleGateway.com is a good resource for finding scripture

      <p>
       Information on supposed "aliens" is often intermingled with that on demons; the biblical explanation for "beings from another world" would be demons/Nephilim residing in an alternate dimension or reality (see CERN, quantum computing). CERN's work is designed to open a hole into another dimension via breaking apart all particles into their most finite elements. The "god particle" (Higgs bosun) is seen as a negative force that is powerfully attracted to other negative elements...thus, if the portal is opened (as it presumably has been in the past), the entities released will gravitate toward creating destruction.

       There are many great reading resources, but videos are a good start. Let me know if you would like more resources -- I am happy to help.

       Ok. Watched the video on DWave.thats a bit scary. Why would we want to create something like that? 
I read about the Nephiliam today. Still need to read more on that. Do you suggest reading the book of Enoch? 
I know of CERN and what they are doing there, but not the implications. I will watch this one tonight.
      </p>

       Thank you for sharing. I am sure I will have questions. I always have questions.

       On D-Wave, I have no idea why...A friend of mine who is a Mensa member and retired science professor gets really excited in talking about this and CERN. Science for science's sake...I really don't understand it. She is atheist, so I don't think she believes in any harmful ramifications. What is really scary is that China just launched a quantum satellite, as they believe the encryption is untouchable - with quantum physics, the element doesn't "exist" if it is not actively studied, so any attempt to view data would result in no returned data. Bizarre...
I have not read the book of Enoch, though based on its historical context (re Noah) it may be enlightening. Enjoy the CERN video - and try not to be distracted by "RichieFromBoston"'s leads...he's a pretty good YouTuber, but the name is hard to take seriously. :)

       It's funny, I never knew the book of Enoch existed until a few years ago. I think I'm going to read it. 
With the d wave stuff, I guess they just want to see if they can. And I understand that, but yeah, if they are atheists, what do they care of the ramifications. 
I have heard of discovering the god particle, but never put it in to context of what it can/will attract. I saw the name and thought the same thing, Richie from Boston, lol. I will watch later when I get some free time.

       Not the person you asked, but new age "spiritualism" is designed to point all avenues away from Christ as the savior and Messiah of the world, and towardsand into false teaching.  "Aliens" are in fact extra-dimensional beings, just not the 'spacemen' we've been conditioned to expect or believe.  They're demonic entities, Satan's minions if you will.

       I'm not as knowledgeable about it as these other folks are but you could start with Archons. Rune Soup has a few articles on Archons and modern interpretations of Gnostic ideas. I was reminded of those articles while reading the posts above yours

       I'm a lurker here, but I made an account quickly to point you to this link. I was born and raised Christian. Nearly walked out on the faith until I found these videos. His "restless church" series was very helpful too about why the Christian faith seems so empty. But the youtube playlist I'm linking to here helped me connect the dots between the bible and the modern world.

       Though I disagree with you on the theological implications of the New Testament, I wholeheartedly agree with this apocalyptic scenario. It closely mirrors what I myself have come to conclude. Unfortunately I am really weary now, otherwise I would participate in the discission.

       Allow the world to spend 30 or 40 years with the internet, long enough for generations to become reliant on it for learning and discussing. Then take it away. There goes any chance of the few being able to inform the many (at least for a number of years).

It took a call to my husband, out of town on work, to calm me down.  Both because the call actually went through, and because he was able to pull up a few different web pages on his phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       But my mind had been thinking of different scenarios.  Very bad ones.

       Extremely well said and I believe this is the current timeline we find ourselves on. Can you summarize the last 1000 years or lead me to a comment regarding how the powers that be have gotten us to this point? Has everything gone according the plan over the lest few centuries? Religion etc? I guess what matters is the future, and you have detailed it wisely. And I agree :

       The false Messiah has the name Dajjal in the Islamic tradition and there are very interesting and often symbolic accounts of his appearance and signs of his arrival:

       Thank you for this. I'm a bit familiar with Islamic eschatology and what you are saying is right. As a matter of fact the central planners have been able to convince many Muslims that the return of the Mahdi is imminent, so they must fight to the death in the Arabian Peninsula.

       The Fall is concerned with the whole of creation, not simply the Human element. Jesuits notwithstanding, the majority of Cathodox theologians would likely maintain that JG Fumes is incorrect. I had the chance to hear Guy Consolmagno lecture, and even he seemed to say that the whole of the universe was the subject of the Fall.

       Christians are always fearful about what they don't understand. It's easy to discover if a movement is a false new age control system. Just check if it has a hierarchy. Not everything spiritual that doesn't align wth Christian doctrine is a false belief system. In fact most of Christian history is false, create by people in power to enslave the mind by getting people to believe in a off world deityinstead of aligning with the source of the universe and Mother Earth.

       Greer is a self-promoting quack. He at one point did some good work, like the testimony before former congress members being mostly credible (some of them were known BSers tho, like Clifford Stone).

       So I'm not going to defend Greer - as I point out I think the work he has done stands on its own regardless of personal feelings about him. I implore you to watch the presentations I link to in full and tell me you still feel this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do, however, find it curious that Greer's character itself is under such constant attack. I don't see people like Corey Goode getting the same treatment.

       What I have heard from Corey Goode sounds just too damn far fetched to believe - aliens picking him up in his back yard to take him for a spin and such. The difference though is that hardly anyone has heard of Goode, and for better or worse Greer has gotten his name out there.

       Great write-up. I have always considered BlueBeam to be a psyop itself to further confuse the subject of UFOs, and as a backstop to be used in the case of actual alien invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not trying to discredit your theory, this is very well broken down research. I just personally believe the UFOs are real, the deep state doesn't have a handle on the problem, and it would only make sense to have something in place to obfuscate the issue should an invasion or exposure out of their control occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I am eagerly watching Antarctica. That religious leaders as well as political insiders and an astronaut have all been seen visiting there recently lead me to the inescapable conclusion something was found, and it effects all areas within the sphere of humanity.

       The New Age apparatus I outlined here serves a purpose, I'm just not quite sure what yet. Blue Beam was the only documentation I could find that seemed to implicate New Age groups with this New World Order.

       I talked about BlueBeam because that is the only area here that I have done any substantial research in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your explanation of the new age apparatus is fascinating though. It begs the question what would they use something like this for on us? From your research it looks like it is at least another arm of their child trafficking/MKUltra slave creation project. I will look through everything more thoroughly once I get home from work. Thanks again for the excellent post.

       Antartica is perfect for that kind of "empty space hypnosis"
      </p>
      <p>
       As cartoonist and hypnotist, Scott Adams, said regarding his use of this method within his famous comic strip, Dilbert, "The empty spaces are provided for you to fill them in with whatever you think is a good idea"

       In theory, Antarctica would be a great location for an elaborate hoax for someone who had the resources.

      <p>
       Something crazy happened there? Let's check with the witnesses to verify the story ... oh right, there are none.

      <p>
       Something crazy discovered there? Let's examine the site for evidence of a hoax, like something being transported and planted there (the standard archaeological hoax.) Oh right, it's in the middle of Antarctica, good luck getting access to the site.

       Pertaining to the Blue Beam Cosmic False Flag theory; I wonder if chemtrails have anything to do with it? Like preparing the atmosphere to better reflect and see holograms.

       I know you didn't mention chemtrails, but it was just a random thought I had.

       Thanks for the great post. This lines up quite well with the research I've done over the past few months. Thought I'd share my opinion on some key points.
       <em>
        Corey Goode is being fed a narrative that is according to “their” plan.
       </em>
       Personally I tend to believe Goode more than Greer. To me it seems suspicious that Greer has briefed many politicians, and yet somehow isn't a govt official? Doesn't add up. The other reason is that if you accept that the tech exists to traverse our galaxy fairly quickly, then logically you will have "marauder" type races in addition to "guardian" types. There are too many testimonies and channellings referencing the Orion group (ie the Draco or Dragon alliance, the various greys), the reptoids (from zeta reticuli, insect looking beings), and other benevolent groups (the pleiedians, the sirians, etc) that line up for me to discount them all. Polarity exists everywhere in our galaxy, not just on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another problem I have with Greer's claim that Goode is part of Project Blue Beam is that Goode and Wilcock have both been warning that the announcement of the Antarctica discovery would be used to bring about this  new religion and distract from human trafficking revelations and bring about partial disclosure. They are all for full disclosure. This doesn't mean that I believe Goode and Wilcock for everything they say. I am sure they receive disinfo every now and then and they are fallible like any humans are. Plus it seems like Wilcock might be especially prone to manipulation, since he is always jumping on a chance to say "the cabal is defeated, ascension is imminent!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, here are some resources that I've found interesting that you may not have stumbled across yet if you are interested in some of the more far out stuff:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wingmakers - this is a time capsule potentially from humans 750 years in the future:
       <a href="http://www.wingmakers.us/">
        http://www.wingmakers.us/
       </a>
       . For interesting info about the nature of the "unacknowledged" type labs check out the
       <a href="http://www.wingmakers.us/wingmakersorig/wingmakersinterviews/www.wingmakers.com/interview/iview1.shtml">
        interview
       </a>
       with the scientist who leaked the info. The philosophy of the Wingmakers lines up quite well with the information given by Ra in the channelings done by L/L research. (Im sure you've heard of this but if not I'd check out the first 10 or so sessions
       <a href="http://www.lawofone.info/">
        http://www.lawofone.info/
       </a>
       )

       So a couple of corrections just for accuracy: Greer does not claim that Goode is part of Blue Beam. He specifically just answers a question saying he believes what Goode is going through is very similar to other "abduction" events (Greer specifically mentions an event that happened to Gorbachev) that our own government has perpetrated on others. I am the one who made the connection between the Cosmic False Flag event Greer says is coming to the Project Blue Beam theory put forth by Monast.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest of what you are saying, I worry that it is all just part of the psyop. There's no reason to think that ETI, if it exists, is violent or dangerous. In fact, the opposite appears to be true due to the relationship between UFO phenomena and the disabling of nuclear weapons tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I have never heard of the Wingmakers so thanks for the link. I will dig into the rest of what you have said.

       Its possible, I used to think that way too. Ultimately it doesn't really matter if people believe that there are good / bad ETs, the important part is to spread awareness of suppressed tech and the control systems in place used to keep people obedient (like blue beam) and uninformed. Once our society "wakes up" we will be able to openly investigate our past and the different ET's that have visited both past and present. Then we can come to more solid conclusions.

       Do you have proof of that claim? Why would they attempt to cover up information by changing the site from the original then if it was a hoax? (apparently wingmakers.us is the site that preserved the original writings, wingmakers.com is the altered)

       Greer explains this well. Most politicians, even most US Presidents, are kept in the dark about these issues. Greer, as an independent (but Rockefeller-funded) activist and disclosure spokesman, talks to a lot of whistleblowers. That's why he's privy to information that most politicians don't get access to. Politicians generally don't have the time to talk to whistleblowers and compile dossiers on esoteric phenomena. They're too busy dealing with down-to-earth political issues.

       Corey Goode and cosmic disclosure or whatever are certainly a part of this. I watched a single lecture just to see what he was about and wasn't very impressed and more suspicious.

       Lo and behold two days later Google plays me a fucking advert for Corey Goode and his cosmic disclosure star wars bullshit before an unrelated YouTube video.

       No, you're not. I have watched a friend come across the Gaia whatever and now she is totally sucked in. I'm not even sure what it is, but she is in the thick of it. It's wild to see play out IRL.

       Its quite terrifying you even mentioning the findhorn foundation. But i live a town away from them. They're well known for being a bunch of rich tree hugging hippies who smoke weed and (so probably other drugs and dmt etc). They have yoga and art classes and are actually pretty innovative in their "green" houses. Some roofs are made out of turf and the energy is generally green and everythings recycled etc etc. Its quite a nice place by the seaside. But people are a bit.. batty. Not in a mean way. I certainly have never heard rumours of dodgy things other than drugs and its a REALLY small community so shit gets around. Still.. might go do some investigating for symbolism..

       That is creepy.. Its just so bizzare.. ive been floating on conspiracy for a few months now but i never thought any of this would be connected to anything actually near me. Nothing happens here ever,  its REALLY boring. Findhorn is well known for having egotistical rich a-holes who overcharge for hollistic treatments that don't obviously work.. but ive been living here my whole life and never heard the ufo thing before. Rumours of ufo sightings.. yeah.. (there are 2 air force bases close by) but not from the foundation itself. It's added a whole new level of interest for me. Its quite cool.. im definately going to have to dig on ufo history in the area now lols. I would never be able to get near any of the main groups because im way too poor, but they do a lot of touristy crap thats accessable at least.

       just be careful. I researched really deep into findhorn/harbin/escalen etc and how they are connected to bigger and more sinister things. I wrote about 4 or 5 posts on voat about "the big picture". these places are all connected to tavistock - so just use common sense when/if you do irl investigating of these places.

       I found it strange that Hillary Clinton mentioned, on more than one occassion, that she wanted to open the files on Area 51 once and for all.  I know she said this on at least one talk show and one speech I saw.

       This is a new movie that has a lot of elements of what you are taking about in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       -A health spa for those suffering from mental breakdown or fatigue that is actually a testing site,
-that tests mind and body altering substances on the unaware guests. (never mind the creature plot)
-people that become trapped there against their will and experimented on.
-horrible human testing and trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's another one of those movies that makes you read between the lines and look for the 'secondary' plot, where they are hiding the truth in plain sight.

       Started a new job on 3-Jan.  Whereas my job with the government was pure drudgery nearly all the time, this new job engages and challenges me.  I've not been able to find the time to sleuth online as much, which is a pretty good problem to have!  Anywho, I'm glad I scanned the sub when I did -- this is an intriguing post, and it's right in line with the stuff I've been tracking, leading me to the same conclusions.

       This came off the top of my head from looking at the
       <a href="/r/harbinhotsprings">
        /r/harbinhotsprings
       </a>
       information. I tried to go back and get an exact source, but am having trouble. I know it had something to do with "Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography", but TBH I can't find an exact quote where they cite that age of consent laws and sexual education laws would allow for further sexual abuse. I should have sourced that since I put it in there. My fault.

       Thanks. I know it's a third rail topic but I'd rather not see healthy, helpful education get equated with deviancy. Sexual education is important, and the lack of usable information frequently contributes to extremely negative, avoidable outcomes.

       Greer himself travels among a dozen factions of elites, look at his own writings and his constant stream of videos.  Better yet take a look at his work 'Hidden Truth, Forbidden Knowledge' and reading the names and details you see a dossier of the military industrial complex who spent time destroying the Ufology community in the 70s to 90s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to check out ISGP's wonderful dossier on Greer and realize he is a plant:

        https://isgp-studies.com/ufo-disclosure-project-of-steven-greer
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Names in 'Hidden Truth, Forbidden Knowledge' correlated with Real Names
General T.E. = Gen. Albert Stubblebine
Col. MK  = Col. John Alexander
W.B. = Robert Bigelow
       <br/>
       Prince S.A. = Hans Adam II von Liechtenstein
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are worried about Rothschilds central banking or any of those pet issues around here you ought to be seriously concerned with Greer's dealings with Prince Hans Adams.  He isn't one of the good guys and is linked back
      </p>
      <p>
       Stubblebine literally destroyed the UFO community in counter intelligence operations and has now been mucking up the 9-11 community as you can find at the link above.  Ask any old UFO researcher about Stubblebine's role in producing false documents, false leads, and generally causing chaos in the community.  Better yet google it.  It is hilarious to see him so freely quoted here in various 9-11 threads.

       This same website has an entire section devoted to debunking Graham Hancock too, arguing that the pyramids could not have been older than 2500 BC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again - this isn't about Greer anyways. It is about the witness testimony he assembled from CIA agents, FBI agents, NASA employees, Lockheed Martin employees, etc.

       The link to the honorable James Woolsey no matter the turn of events is disturbing in the UFO community.  A director of a former agency which has released entire reams of documentation that they subverted an investigative community over the course of several decades should be anathema to that community.
      </p>
      <p>
       I side on the fact that they are indeed friendly as displayed by the facts of both sides despite the various and conflicting letters over the years.  Which is the entirety of the point, Woolsey is well known in the intelligence community for continuing his work into alternative subjects after his term as director.  Greer is possibly one of these projects as he has ties directly to Woolsey, a Rockefeller and Hans Adam von Lichtenstein.  If anyone else in a conspriacy community had direct links back to those gentlemen, there would be fifteen threads devoted to their "shilling".  The fact Greer is still claiming disclosure is imminent every few months while selling videos, t-shirts, and other rad-merchandise since the mid-nineties is a testament to his ultimate goals.

       His "link" to Woolsley is that Woolsley publicly shamed him over the meeting they had in an attempt to discredit Greer. Again, I don't know why his character is constantly under attack, but the witnesses he gathered are extremely important to understanding this subject. He is very upfront about his initial meeting and relationship with Lawrence Rockefeller and the other heads of state he has met with. I don't necessarily want to make this about Greer though. It is about the testimony he has gathered. It only takes one of those people to be telling the truth for it to be real.

       The testimony with which Greer has gathered has been assisted and given, with only words, and nothing admissible in court.  Most of this information or these individuals with impeccable credentials mostly Major General Albert N. Stubblebine, by Greer's own admission.  The good Major General is suspect in several disinformation campaign which crippled the UFO movement and left Greer as the main beneficiary by the mid 90s.

       The original poster has a lot of great truths hidden in here.  He did miss a major link to Antarctica and the Nazi UFO Mythos.  Dr. Greer has been recently touting that his next video will show actual camera footage from the Third Reich of the Nazi 'Bell' project.  Two continents of historians are literally awaiting to watch this footage.

       I actually didn't mean to come off as harsh if I did.  You have a lot of solid leads and I sincerely believe there is something peculiar about Antarctica.  I do however believe Greer's particular peculiarities do more harm than good as a four decade watcher of the UFO community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some more digging into the Nazi UFO Mythos, specifically Henry Steven's Hitler's Flying Saucers.  While Steven's runs an anti-Semitic think tank that I can't agree with and some of his Rense interviews are unbearable... However his text will link you back to actual physical documents that you could request from the National Archive or FOIA requests on the topic.

       As I understand it the whole alien invasion path to the one world government plan was scrapped in favor of a softer "environmental preservation" path where they tell everyone the earth is terribly overpopulated and slowly Agenda 21 everyone to death.

       Off the top of my head, some things about Antarctica
      </p>
      <p>
       1) You mentioned the various political types, buzz aldrin, etc visiting there. Buzz being taken to the hospital directly from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) There was tales of Russia going down there from the middle east with a number of ships.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The pope meets the head of the orthodox church there.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Old rumors about the nazis going there after WWII.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) This one is recent. In the wikileaks emails were a lot of photos taken in Antarctica.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could all have been predictive programming, or a little of that and something actually going on there.

       Werner Von Braun warned us about a fake alien invasion back in the 1970s:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wernher Von Braun never spoke to me about any of the details that he knew related to extraterrestrials except that one day extraterrestrials were going to be identified as an enemy against whom we are going to build an enormous space-based weapons system. Wernher Von Braun actually told me that the spin was a lie – that the premise for space-based weaponry, the reasons that were going to be given, the enemies that we were going to identify – were all based on a lie.

       I have no idea. It seems that this is something that was waiting to happen. I can't believe I didn't know about a lot of this stuff and for good reason - a lot of the documents around it weren't widely available. It seems that Podesta / Clinton were getting ready for some plan of disclosure.

       1: I hope you and Greere are not disinfo agents

      <p>
       2: I have been hearing about this cosmic scale false flag for as long as I have been researching the conspiracy community. It seems like the general consensus now, and with evidence that you bring up it just puts more emphasis on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       3: I wonder, if Trump is NOT in on the deep state (like Clinton is), does this mean their plan to release the cosmic false flags has been slowed down? I keep hearing how they are behind on their plans, how bad things are coming, but nothing 'BIG' has happened yet.

       The release of zero point energy would effectively put the fossil fuel industry out of business.  I think they have had it under wraps for a while now, probably some time after Tesla, and kept it secret.  I assume they are also wary of countries like North Korea gaining this free energy.  With these issues, I don't see how they would introduce free energy to the world.

       So you keep calling this a false flag and staged, but then there are parts where you write as if what's to be revealed is real in the sense that there is this huge discovery in free energy and there are non-human entities. I'm confused.

       Holy shit!, more on Synanon; I stayed at their Badger location, which has now been mostly converted to an AirBnB resort.  While walking by lake on the property, I jokingly asked a maintenance man what was in the lake. He looked at me and in a serious mood explained they had only drained it once since they got the property and found several bodies at the bottom. They filled the lake back and left the bodies since they didn't want to get the law enforcement involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       The place was weird, it had all these abandoned trailer homes on part of property. It was post-apocalyptic, like the place was quickly evacuated. Clothes, plates, packaged food and other belongings were all left in their places. We saw some set tables, like they were about to have dinner. Nature had taken over, and parts of the trailers were overgrown. Real spooky.

       I know it won't mean much because it is personal testimony, but I have met and spent a bunch of time with someone who I greatly respect and admire and happens to personally know Dr. Greer. They can attest to his honesty and morality, and convinced me that he has honest intentions.

       So a couple of corrections just for accuracy: Greer does not claim that Goode is part of Blue Beam. He specifically just answers a question saying he believes what Goode is going through is very similar to other "abduction" events (Greer specifically mentions an event that happened to Gorbachev) that our own government has perpetrated on others. I am the one who made the connection between the Cosmic False Flag event Greer says is coming to the Project Blue Beam theory put forth by Monast.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest of what you are saying, I worry that it is all just part of the psyop. There's no reason to think that ETI, if it exists, is violent or dangerous. In fact, the opposite appears to be true due to the relationship between UFO phenomena and the disabling of nuclear weapons tests.
      </p>

       Now, I have never heard of the Wingmakers so thanks for the link. I will dig into the rest of what you have said.

       Do you have proof of that claim? Why would they attempt to cover up information by changing the site from the original then if it was a hoax? (apparently wingmakers.us is the site that preserved the original writings, wingmakers.com is the altered)

        To me it seems suspicious that Greer has briefed many politicians, and yet somehow isn't a govt official? Doesn't add up.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Greer explains this well. Most politicians, even most US Presidents, are kept in the dark about these issues. Greer, as an independent (but Rockefeller-funded) activist and disclosure spokesman, talks to a lot of whistleblowers. That's why he's privy to information that most politicians don't get access to. Politicians generally don't have the time to talk to whistleblowers and compile dossiers on esoteric phenomena. They're too busy dealing with down-to-earth political issues.

       A good source for information on quantum computing/D-Wave is

       For CERN, there are many on youtube, but this is pretty thorough:

       For Satan and Demons: Revelation-throughout the book, including 12:9 NIV: The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.

       For Nephilim/Biblical:  Genesis 6:4-7; Numbers 13:33 (NIV) -- BibleGateway.com is a good resource for finding scripture

       Information on supposed "aliens" is often intermingled with that on demons; the biblical explanation for "beings from another world" would be demons/Nephilim residing in an alternate dimension or reality (see CERN, quantum computing). CERN's work is designed to open a hole into another dimension via breaking apart all particles into their most finite elements. The "god particle" (Higgs bosun) is seen as a negative force that is powerfully attracted to other negative elements...thus, if the portal is opened (as it presumably has been in the past), the entities released will gravitate toward creating destruction.

       There are many great reading resources, but videos are a good start. Let me know if you would like more resources -- I am happy to help.

       On D-Wave, I have no idea why...A friend of mine who is a Mensa member and retired science professor gets really excited in talking about this and CERN. Science for science's sake...I really don't understand it. She is atheist, so I don't think she believes in any harmful ramifications. What is really scary is that China just launched a quantum satellite, as they believe the encryption is untouchable - with quantum physics, the element doesn't "exist" if it is not actively studied, so any attempt to view data would result in no returned data. Bizarre...
I have not read the book of Enoch, though based on its historical context (re Noah) it may be enlightening. Enjoy the CERN video - and try not to be distracted by "RichieFromBoston"'s leads...he's a pretty good YouTuber, but the name is hard to take seriously. :)
