        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off, I love this show. It&#39;s based on a book by Stephen King. Basic premise is that a guy goes back in time for two reasons: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>One, to run surveillance on Lee Harvey Oswald.</p></li>
<li><p>Two, to stop him from killing JFK</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But last night when I was watching the show, things took a bit of a dark turn. A few examples?</p>

<p>One, James Franco plays the main character. Basically he&#39;s the good guy. So in recent episodes we&#39;ve had him living in an apartment beneath the one where Oswald lives. There have been several instances where Franco&#39;s character is shown using microphones/tape recorders to listen in on the Oswald family in their apartment. </p>

<p>Imo, this is normalization of surveillance. And it&#39;s done in the most clever fucking way. How so? Because of the element of time travel (fantasy and not real) the audience <em>knows</em> Oswald is guilty. So subconsciously, Franco&#39;s <strong>surveillance seems justified</strong>.</p>

<p>The makers of this show are trying to normalize intrusive surveillance... even to the point of making it look like a heroic act. Not good.</p>

<p>If anyone else has been watching and noticed anything like this, I&#39;d be interested to hear your thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the same thing with drones. When Obama first started, no one wanted drones on us soil. And Obama wanted the right to bomb Americans with drones on our soil. He end up filing an executive order so he could. However now numerous people are using drones and more open to them. Also they have drone races and the super bowl used drones to make the flag. They are trying to make us except them. Also when the Dallas shooting happened. They blew the suspect up with a drone and no one batted an eye. I bet more things like this will continue </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the same feelings about &quot;Designated Survivor&quot; even though it fucking sucks and is stupid.  First of all, like the first line of the pilot is a political speech from the President going &quot;helping the middle class is for suckers&quot; and cabinet member Jack Bauer agrees with his feet up sipping brandy while he avoids work.  Then a nuke takes out the State of the Union and Jack Bauer takes over and the country becomes 24 instead of, you know, what would really happen like total chaos.  It&#39;s all so obviously predicative programming from Disney/ABC.  </p>

<p>The show should have the tone of, say, Walking Dead.  A nuke wiping out government is 9/11² and society would just completely break down.  &quot;Government&quot; would be marshal law, at best.  But instead its just an excuse to shove guns in people&#39;s faces when they&#39;re tied to chairs and shouting <em>NOW NOW NOW TELL US NOW TELL US WHERE IT IS WHERE IS SHE GIVE US THE CODES</em> like 24.  </p>

<p>Oh, and Kal Penn plays his speech writer after the attack.  Kal Penn was actually a speech writer for Obama.  There&#39;s a lot of stabs at &quot;realism&quot; like that that ring creepy and false.  I want to see what else they&#39;re going to wink at after the pilot but it&#39;s so vapid, shallow and clearly designed as a Magic Eye with the word &quot;Obey&quot; behind it so I just can&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of what comes out of the entertainment industry contains more or less overt &quot;idea placement&quot;. It would be harder to compile a list of recent series/movies that DON&#39;T have such propaganda in their storylines or underlying philosophical assumptions. For example, the only virtuous men always work for the government, women behave like men, population control is essential, transhumanism is great, etc. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen this show but I would be surprised if mass-surveillance is the only idea they are subliminally propagandizing with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes totally. Another message in the show?</p>

<p>Reinforcement of political correctness. They go out of their way to portray 1963 as a time of unbridled racism, oppression of women etc. </p>

<p>Yes, those things existed and things have gotten better since then. But at the same time, it&#39;s like the old problems have just been replaced with new ones. </p>

<p>No mention of affordable housing, low unemployment, quality food and clean water etc. </p>

<p>If I had a time portal going back to 1962, I think I&#39;d spend a lot of my life in that era. The modern world and me just don&#39;t get along sometimes. It would be nice to take a break!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting point. Does surveillance need normalization though? Certainly the indiscriminate kind revealed by Binney and later Snowden is unacceptable for most thinking people and would require normalization, but can this be said about the type of surveillance used by Franco&#39;s character in the TV show? </p>

<p>It would seem to me that very few people would have a problem with surveillance if it is only used the way we always accepted it as happening, namely targeted surveillance of highly suspicious individuals, granted through a transparent process of warrants and a court of law.</p>

<p>The case in the TV show neglects the warrant aspect but claims reasonable suspicion through hindsight via time travel. In the show-universe, we know it was Oswald (even though he almost certainly was merely a patsy in the actual events).</p>

<p>The more troubling portrayals of surveillance to my mind is in movies like Enemy Of The State with Will Smith, where an innocent man is trapped in a web of indiscriminate and sophisticated surveillance.</p>

<p>Perhaps you find both types of surveillance despicable, I can&#39;t say I disagree in the current climate where warrants don&#39;t seem to matter much anymore and due process can be so easily circumvented (since NDAA). Still, it feels like a bit of a reach to consider the surveillance used in 11.22.63 a form of predictive programming or normalization when it was a more or less normal concept in this targeted context to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now that you have discovered on of the main &quot;keys&quot; of Television you will not be able to stop seeing this kind of thing in most TV programs.

Try watching Zootopia and if it doesn&#39;t give you cancer in the first 5 minutes you will see how loaded it is with cultural marxism memes and police state programming. Return to Witch Mountain is just full of this stuff...in fact if it is Disney it has been run through the Frankfurt School filter. </p>

<p>This is a great discovery that you have made. Internalize it and spread the word. </p>

<p>In North America and Europe, Television programs you!</p>

<p>Spoiler alert.</p>

<p>I watched it with a friend and after the movie i asked him, &quot;so the flower that makes the animals go savage, what is that in real life?&quot;  Took more than 5 guesses before he got to poppy/heroin/opiates.</p>

<p>And then we reminded ourselves why u.s. military guards the poppy fields through a decade of high level growth.</p>
