        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So i&#39;ve been curious ever since Antarctica has been getting more attention lately.  Especially after i seen the pictures in the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15503">wikileaks email</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s weird to me how everyone is looking for clues in the pictures (i understand why) but never mentioning how in some of the pictures there is a huge lack of ice in a couple of the pictures.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to match some of the locations to places but to no avail and found something a bit more interesting.</p>

<p>There&#39;s articles about the Larsen C ice shelf and part of it breaking soon, the size etc.  But no mention of the huge amounts of ice that has already melted all around Antarctica and quite a bit that is already gone.</p>

<p>Google has been slowly adding new images to Antarctica but you cannot see them until you zoom in, some are spliced weird but you can still see the extent of what has changed already.</p>

<p>Larsen C ice shelf @ <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@-67.3867525,-60.4272297,57745m/data=!3m1!1e3">-67.3593763,-60.6113215,33942</a></p>

<p>As you can see, quite a bit already broke off and who knows when the picture was taken.  Yet we&#39;re only told there is a crack that is just getting bigger and will break in the next few months.  Why?</p>

<p>More areas with either massive crack movement - complete break offs or no more ice at all:</p>

<p>(zoom out to see the difference)</p>

<p>There is many more, also pictures of ice movement in targeted areas which seems to be prioritized over other areas.</p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering why we&#39;re only getting a tiny bit of info when these pictures show a different story of what&#39;s going on with the ice down there.</p>

<p>Why tell us about the Larsen C ice shelf breaking soon when it&#39;s already broken?  Why no mention of the massive amounts of ice that is already gone?  Why no mention of the other massive breaks and ice melting that is going on?</p>

<p>Something seems off to me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you seem to subscribe to this American idea that people must be tribally attached to either one side or another of each instance of whatever set of arbitrary dichotomies you think the world is made up of.</p>

<p>It is likely that greedy people are opportunistically exaggerating or skewing the climate narrative to serve their own ends, because we are ruled by cunts and this sort of thing is generally permitted.</p>

<p>It is also possible that there are pragmatic scientists who have exaggerated data. I say pragmatic because they wouldn&#39;t necessarily be exaggerating the <strong>threat</strong> by doing so. If so then in the long run we may be glad they held people&#39;s feet to the fire with accelerated data, since we&#39;ve seen how slowly we&#39;ve reacted to what is ostensibly <em>current</em> data.</p>

<p>Or the data and percieved threat could be perfectly accurate, in the way people have reacted to <em>current data</em> is not serving us well. We have enough historical information on how the world and human civilisation have been able to cope with a warming planet--and for that matter how equally bad it would be if things started getting shit-cold (glaciers are like giant steamrollers that can crush entire nations)--that we should be capable of reacting and managing climate at this point.</p>

<p>As for whether it&#39;s anthropogenic, who fucking cares. If it&#39;s our actions then that just makes it <strong>easier</strong> to fix, as long as we aren&#39;t blind to it because we&#39;re not even open to the idea that it&#39;s happening/us. Either way!</p>

<p>On the gripping hand, seems kinda plausible at this point that there are weather control stations disguised as military and power installations all over the planet, so maybe it&#39;s total baloney (or it&#39;s not and they can be used to fix it by flipping a switch (but nobody has hit the switch yet(WOM-<strong>WOOOOMP</strong>)))</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a serious problem. We started watching Alaska not that long ago because it&#39;s shedding more glaciers than anywhere else we know of, and they&#39;re retreating way faster than anyone expected. That on top of submarine glacial melting is affecting things absurdly fast. We really have no idea what&#39;s happening in Antarctica, but a chunk the size of those island was shed within a week or two if I remember correctly. </p>
