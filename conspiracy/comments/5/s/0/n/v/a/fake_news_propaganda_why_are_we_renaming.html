       We're simply turning the meaning upside down as fake news was introduced by TPTB to be synonymous with conspiracy theory. Now it's becoming also synonymous with actual fake news broadcasting, aka. Propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's become a kind of double entendre.

       The same reason that quad-copters started being called "drones". It completely waters down our opinion on what
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       drones do, which is kill other people who are often innocent. It is a brain-trick and it very effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I am buying my son a drone for X-mas this year Betty, hehehehe."

      <p>
       Language is extremely important and influences how our brain works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about the difference between the terms "Shell Shock" or "PTSD"?
      </p>
      <p>
       By calling propaganda, sensationalism, or blatant lies "fake news", then the people have a new term to swallow and the people manipulating us now have a new term to bombard us with while also bombarding us with the associations that they WANT us to have with that new term.

       Kellyanne Conway cites
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Green_massacre">
        Bowling Green massacre
       </a>
       =  fake news!!! (because the media clearly wants Trump to be associated with this term)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/233053942-story">
        Man who claimed mom died in Iraq after Trump's ban lied
       </a>
       = "Oops" (notice no mainstream outlets are calling it "fake news" because that would imply that both sides are lying)

       Idk drone to me doesn't have the same connotation as you see it. I think it's plenty intimidating, and very weird that we call them drones when citizens by them too, very eerie.

       To be most specific I believe the word drone should be reserved for machines which are controlled by a computer program.

       Once you become sensitive to the pro-drone propaganda you'll see it absolutely everywhere.  Disney even replaced fireworks with individually colored drones in one of their parks.  Gotta desensitize kids early and often or one day they might wake up and realize war is just murder by another name.

       Kellyanne Conway is fake news because she's an official person in the government, thus when she lies to influence people, it is 100% propaganda.
On the other hand, you can't control people, and if she lied, it only involves her, they couldn't know before the imam spoke out, and were only reporting what they thought was true

       Again, Trumps' crowd size at the inauguration was obviously smaller than previous presidents. The Media trying their best to point it out, to further delegitimatize the President that they hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, Trumps' inauguration had the biggest "audience" in history. People watching on TV, internet, smart phones and in person.. I'm not sure that's really debatable and what Sean Spicer said in his pressed was correct.
"Trump had the biggest audience in history"

       It's up to the media to make stories and push their narrative.. Trump could solve cancer and the media would still find shyt to complain about.

       If it wasn't about crowd size.. it would have been about the rioters in the streets that are "frightened" for their lives by Trumps' rhetoric.

       Trump didn't have the biggest "audience" = "crowd size" in history..? again let's argue over semantics and a few words he said.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what the common American wants, yea? Arguing over BS semantics.. I blame the media. Trump doesn't help his cause with fueling the fire but nobody is getting away with delegitimatizing him. For once, a republican is fighting back against the corrupt media and Democrats. And I think most of the country that doesn't live in highly populated cities on the coast are loving every minute of it.

       The problem is trump isn't fighting against the corruption in his own party.  He's perfectly happy to  encourage it.  Fighting against corruption media, that's laughable.  He simply is favoring media outlets that will show him in a positive light, because he can't handle criticism.
As for the rest of the country not in dense urban areas, they won't be loving it when he doesn't bring back their jobs and they lose their healthcare.  Fact.

       You better hope he doesn't improve the inner cities and bring companies and jobs back.. healthcare will be tough but Obamacare set the bar pretty low so he'll skip over that shyt.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Republicans.. John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Romney are the only Republicans I can think of right now that need to go and getting blasted by Trump. I'm sure there's a lot more tho and will be dealt with hopefully.

       The whole Republican party is toxic to the success of this country.  Not saying the majority of Dems is better, but Republicans are down right evil.  If you can only think of three, you're either not paying attention or don't mind corruption.  Trump doesn't have a plan to replace the ACA, so they're just fine with kicking millions off their insurance.  The only thing to fix this country's health care is universal socialized medicine.

       I'm sorry but this is the first time the republicans are fighting back? Did they not just spend the last 8 years  with filibusters, refusing to pass laws, threatening to shut our government down in order to get their way, tried to repeal the ACA 40 something times. I realize you're a frequent Donny poster, that's cool, but please stop thinking trump came in and every Republican got inspired by him to fight those gosh darn global leftists. You also realize your beloved  republicans were also apart of that 13% (possibly lower) approval rating right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So then also you're trying to tell me that the MEDIA is at fault for this being said "the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe” you don't think the administration is trying to instill false hope to those folks who aren't from highly populated coast cities? You're also telling me that the media its at fault for the administration falsely stating something? I'm just confused of who in this administration is supposed to assume responsibility for spreading misinformation. The media is trying to discredit trump? Have they questioned Trump

       You want one my personal conspiracies? Your boy Donny will be the first president of the United States to go to prison. There's more too him hiding his taxes from the public and always dismissing discussions relating to his finances. I give it 2ish years until there's serious discussion of impeachment from both dems/republicans. I'm not saying Donny will be the direct cause of his downfall, he could do it himself, but somewhere down the line someone on his team will reveal some pretty damming things that the administration has been doing to serve themselves and their friends. And I don't mean things being leaked, could happen, but out of pure negligence, I think this administration will expose themselves in the coming years.

       What you don't understand is that when you denounce Trump, you're weakening your own position. Trump agitates that he is not being given a fair shot, now if he just claimed that and no-one responded he would appear immature, egotistical etc but as soon as you take offense, he suddenly appears to have a point. He's baiting you into destroying your own credibility.

       That's relative.  I'm just saying you are incorrect about his motives.  His actions and words are not a scheme,  he's just acting on his emotions.  So if you think his actions and words are stupid,  then i'm just informing you it's because he's stupid.

       Yeah because you're not as smart as he is lmao. If he does know and you don't, he's more intelligent. Nonetheless, I think it had a lot less to do with trumps competence as it did hillarys incompetence. Who the fuck else could have lost to trump?

       It had nothing to do with Trumps competence. He's obviously incompetent.  It's that he as well as his millions of supporters are too stupid to understand complex problems, so he has dumb answers that his supporters understand. He won partly because he didn't have to pander to stupid people, because hes actually stupid himself.

       I'm Canadian, I don't really "support" either candidate, but if you need to know what way i lean politically, I voted for justin trudeau in our election. I find it a little bit funny that the anti trump sentiment is that Trump is crass, prejudiced and discriminatory, and many of the people in that cause exemplify those characteristics to a tee when it comes to anyone who dares support someone they don't like. Everyone pissed their pants at the violence at trump rallies, and a lot of those same people burned down UC Berkeley because a gay jewish guy hurt their feelings.

      <p>
       But anyway, Okay, let's pretend all your conjecture is correct, and that the clear reason he won is just because americas voting citizens are stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Out of 230 million eligible voters in your country, only 130 million or so cast a vote for the president. If trumps views are so out of line with the average american, why did 100 million people sit at home and let him stomp hillary? Either your country really is full of idiots that don't know they have to vote to change the outcome of the election, or trump's views are in line with americas views, and democracy was a success. In any case, you have only yourselves to blame.

       I'm not saying our democracy didn't work, even though there is an argument that the electoral college hurts democracy, I'm just saying Trump and almost all of his supporters are stupid. I'm surrounded by them. 100% of the people I know that supported Trump just lack critical thinking skills.  Every republican I knew that is intelligent, jumped shipped and didn't support Trump.

       Maybe everyone you know just lacks critical thinking. Can you explain with your critical thinking skills why trump is worse for america/the world than hillary? I'm not saying it's impossible that everyone who voted trump is dumb as bricks (although it would be statistically very unlikely, and i sure as hell wouldn't put a bet on it), but some of the most intelligent people I know (who have actually paid attention to politics for 10+ years) saw hillary as a non-option. Anyone who paid attention to bernie sanders campaign and hillary and the dnc's dealings with him got to see their true colors, and it became an easy win for Trump. The emails and the war crimes therein didnt help either.

       Hillary was intelligent enough to understand the problems in the world. For example, fighting Islamic terrorism requires moderate Muslims.  Trumps ban just created a rift between our goals and moderate Muslims. If he's too stupid to understand the problem then he won't make good decisions fighting it.

       No, I'm talking about sending military aid to Saudi  Arabia while being completely aware that that money gets put directly into the hands of Isis. If Joe blow at the gun store sold weapons to an alt right lunatic who wants to kill lefties, I'm sure you would shit your  pants, but it's fine if Hillary and her friends sell weapons to the terrorists that kill Muslims who disagree with them.

       I don't see any of your evidence of Hillary's intelligence whatsoever, why don't you supply some? I think the fact that she lost an election to Donald trump when she had the entire media and the government on her side would indicate she at least isn't a very good tactician.

       Well she can formulate a coherent sentence. That's more than we can say aboutnTrump.

       Winning elections doesn't necessarily indicate intelligence, and in Trumps case it obviously didn't.  Trump won because he doesn't have to pander to relate to stupid people.

       Ha ha that's funny hyperbole, but trump actually does formulate lots of coherent sentences. Again, it's difficult to get through university and become a billionaire if you can't. funny meme though.

      <p>
       And please point me to the statistics of trump voters' intelligence, besides just what you feel based on how dumb you think trump is. I'm not trying to be combative, I just haven't seen any of this evidence. Typically republican voters have had higher iq's.

       He was handed a 200 million dollar real estate company by his daddy, he didn't become a billionaire on his own.  He was an average real estate investor, but failed at any other business he tried.

       I have never met an intelligent and honest Trump supporter. I've spoken to hundreds.  That's a plenty large enough sample size to suggest almost all Trump supporters are stupid. I have no idea why you think republican voters have a higher iq, but it's a fact that mos scientists and most higher graduates vote democrat.

       You should go talk to all the millionaires of the world and tell them to stop thinking so much and just become billionaires already. It's really that easy as long as you own a company, that's why the world is just full of billionaires.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't believe that you've talked to hundreds of trump supporters and not one of them was intelligent and honest, but even if they weren't, hundreds is not a good sample size for the potential billions of people on earth that support trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read a few studies on the subject that suggest that republicans tend to have higher iq's. I would never call it a fact, because there would need to be an illegal log of every persons vote during elections to determine anything concrete.

       If youre handed a 200 million dollar money already profitable real estate company in the 70s then yes it is easy to become a billionaire. All you have to do is maintain it at current levels and inflation will make it into a billion dollar company. Trump just happened to be born in the right situation.

       Actually, while it had OK ratings on TV, it was not close to Obama or the Gipper. Streaming is another thing, but it is suprisingly difficult to measure that, and Obama had a lot of streams, so yeah, those are some big shoes to fill.

       My money would be on Trump having the bigger audience but I don't necessarily have all the facts like you say.. so, again.. stupid argument to make and nobody really cares. Except the media and people looking to make a funny cause their arguments no longer hold up on public opinion.

       Anyway, no matter, we will likely be plenty fcked in the upcoming years. Trump already has his cronies installed in places of authority. The head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has been usurped by Steve Bannon, the rules put in place to help prevent 2008 happening again are quickly being eroded and after less than two weeks in power Trump has already had a Benghazi of his own.

       Kellyanne Conway may be a dishonest liar who works for a crook, but she is no more fake news than the people her crooked boss has decried as fake news. At least not if we are using the original definition of fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally it was websites/blogs, often run out of eastern Europe, that would appear out of nowhere, imitating the appearance of legitimate news sites and hawking shit designed to get as many clicks as possible before they would disappear and create a new site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using this definition, Kellyanne is not fake news, she is a regular old liar.

       To add to this, "fake news" is being presented as a very specific phenomenon, namely 100% deliberately fabricated stories to drive ad sales or influence an election. When the MSM is accused of being fake news, they and their advocates dismiss the claims, either because the news organization simply made a mistake, was duped by sources, or some other excuse. And according to this narrow definition they use, they're not wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       MSM may not be fake news by this definition, but it's certainly propaganda. If they had called what they're calling "fake news" propaganda instead, we would be completely justified, and they would have far less recourse, if we called MSM propaganda. MSM is a bit more subtle as propaganda. They generally don't fabricate stories completely; more often, it's what they choose to highlight and omit in a story, what context they use and what context they ignore, what credence they give to anonymous government sources, etc.

       I'm not saying that "fake news" was invented as a term after "pizzagate", just that their rise in mass popularity happened at the same time. That's what everyone is trying to get through your dense head in this thread.

       The comment at the top of this comment chain literally says...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Fake News" was created specifically to divert from Pedogate.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And to address your point, so people were googling "fake news" and "pizzagate"
       <em>
        around
       </em>
       the same time... so what? The MSM only started to pick up on pizzagate around the 20th (after "fake news" searches had already initially spiked).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you spent the time to actually look at what caused the initial spikes in searches for "fake news" (on the 15th and 18th of November) you'd see that on the 15th there were various news stories about Facebook's problem of "fake news" stories trending on their platform - a story which had been rumbling along in the MSM since August, and on the 18th Obama gave his opinion on the same thing during a speech he gave in Berlin.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is to say, people who searched for "fake news" on the 15th Nov. would've seen results referencing Facebook's fake news problem, and people who search for "fake news" on the 18th would've seen references to Obamas speech. i.e. Nothing about pizzagate. So why do you think they're connected?
      </p>
      <p>
       You and others like you are continually moving the goalposts and making wild assumptions based on what you want to believe while ignoring the actual facts. Correlation =/= causation.

       The term was co-opted. Of course it existed before. Even the term "pizzagate" existed before due to that Manchester incident. What google trends is showing us, however, is that both terms exploded with popularity at the same time.

       The recent rise of the use of the term started with articles critical of Facebook after they fired their human "trending" editors and replaced them with an algorithm (leading to "fake news" stories trending on Facebook).

       Most people here will discard any information from MSM sources as being disinfo. The only information they trust is that compiled by anonymous people on the internet, who have no reputation to risk by giving out wrong information.

       It wasn't a lapse; it was an active loosening of restrictions, yet I also don't think it had that much of an effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       The SMA of 1948 did not restrict the US Government or Executive from disseminating propaganda domestically, it merely gave restrictions on the State Department specifically, and gave guidelines on how they could distribute materials intended for foreign audiences within the US. Even reading the text of the bill, it does not expressly prohibit State from disseminating the materials within the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it certainly does not do is restrict any other federal agency from producing or distributing propaganda materials within the US. Operation Mockingbird may have broken other laws, but nothing in the SMA itself did anything to prohibit CIA from what it did.

       I've seen those fly-by-night sites with the ads, but rarely have I come across them during the whole election. Those little sites were used by the corporatocracy to justify labelling those sites lumped in with any non-mainstream sites which don't follow their narrative as "fake news." When in reality, the MSM is fake as shit, and almost every knows it. They shot themselves in the foot by using something which could so easily be used on them.

       If both sides use the term fake news then the general public can't figure out what is actually going on.

       Because fake news is a menace,  it actually influenced the US elections and needs to be regulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing people beg for censorship is so pathetic,  100 years ago nobody in his right mind would have accepted government institutions as their "friend".  Mecanisms were put in place to make sure they were accountable and did not have too much power.  Those mecanisms were all circumvented over the years and we are left with governing institutions that hold socialism as their core values.

       How, exactly, would such regulation go?  Seems to me you need some central source that declares some news true, and other news false, and then has legal penalties for the false news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, that seems bad and dangerous to me.  I don't consider free speech to trump (heh) all other considerations by any means - but the idea of a central truth committee scares the hell out of me and it should scare you too.

       The corporate media (WashPo-Paper of record for the CIA) came up with the term and the term fits them more than anything the alternative media ever came up with.  They realized this within a couple of weeks of releasing that term, but it was too late.  It took hold.  Now roughly half the electorate uses that term to describe the corporate media.  Conversely, propaganda doesn't have the same "fuck this bullshit" as fake news.  Propaganda can be real or not, but fake news is never real.

       Doesn't even have to be uninteresting. Simple omission of facts is common. War propaganda has lots of great examples of this. "After a week of hardship our troops liberated the town of x against all odds" sounds really good when you omit the fact that the town of X has been "liberated" and lost 6 times over the last months.

       Propaganda does not equal fake news. It is an advertisement designed to elicit an emotional response with a predetermined goal. Propaganda is not necessarily untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example would be those cell phone carrier commercials where they bring up pointed facts about their competitors, the facts aren't necessarily untrue, however, that doesn't matter because the goal of the commercial is not to show you facts, it's to get you to feel ripped off (anger) and in turn, buy their product.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fake news is news that is allegedly, completely untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I do believe the fake news  campaign rolled out by the msm is a propaganda campaign.

       Warning people about propaganda one can make them think critically about all propaganda. Warning people about fake news can make them think events didn't happen unless they are reported by an approved "real" news vendor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fake news implies the facts are wrong or completely fabricated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Propaganda can make use of accurate information and manipulate it for a political purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       "News: Canada shoots down a plane." Oh, this is on a fake news site. It didn't happen. None of the real news sites even mention this story!
      </p>
      <p>
       "News: Evil Canadians shoot down a plane as part of their ongoing campaign of terror!" Oh, this is propaganda, there's probably a more objective discussion of this plane getting shot down elsewhere.

       Fake news =/= propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although certain stories may fall into both categories, they are not the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Propaganda is information media that seeks to spread attitudes and ideas to the people it reaches.  Although it's often biased to favor a particular point of view, it does not always need to be untrue.  For example, spreading stories about Trump's sexual harassment of women or Hillary's misuse of a private email server may be factually true, but that doesn't mean they're not propaganda.  The goal of distributing that information is to discredit those people on a large scale and in doing so improve the position of their opponents.  Propaganda could also be positive information.  Missionaries who go out and seek to spread the good news of their religious establishment often do so via propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Fake news" on the other hand (besides being a meme propagated by mainstream media to discredit any ideas or memes that arise that don't fit within the mainstream narrative), is poorly sourced or inaccurate information.  Just because a news anchor on CNN declares something "fake news" doesn't necessarily mean that it is.  Likewise, just because an idea or story has sources doesn't mean it's factually true.  We saw the latter occur this week when Fox News tweeted about the Quebec shooting.  Their tweet was factually inaccurate despite being based on sources close to the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although propaganda and the "fake news" meme are very related (and often overlap), they are, in fact, distinct ideas with different meanings.

       There are plenty of synonyms in the English language, and plenty of nuances of meaning. Propaganda, yellow journalism, fake news. I think there are important subtleties which separate these terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fake news evokes the idea that the information is outright false, as opposed to simply misleading or biased.

       I really don't understand why propaganda is getting renamed when propaganda was legalized by Obama. Shouldn't it be acceptable enough now since it's law? That's when you know there's something fishy going on.

       Because there are enough people that still understand propaganda as political lies of a tyrannical banana republic.. fake news is double speak.. you can trust the news but not this news yet mentally disconnect the government agenda angle... You never think of it.

       They tried to call the truth "fake news", then it blew up in their face when we started using where it fits; i.e, against those who tried to coin it. It's just fun to rub their noses in it at this point. We all know it's censorship, or perhaps something worse than that, and so why not have a new label for a new crime? I think that "shilling" needs to be used much more often as well.

       On some level this is true but not entirely. Calling something fake news can be propaganda. The fake news itself can be propaganda. And then there are also some pieces of fake news that aren't meant to condition people to think a certain way but instead to just make money.

       It's a term used often by Trump, whose official political philosophy is to dumb down his vocabulary a bit so it's more easily accessible. My theory is that the term "fake news" is more easily understood than "propaganda", and it became somewhat of a meme.

       because propaganda in of itself is offensive t the senses, fake news on the other hand is easy to dismiss as its all "just made up spin pushed for people who dont think like you" george orwell was wrong about alot of the future but he was bang on about 1 syllable words become memes and internalized thought concepts

       The term "fake news" was started by the mainstream media to paint criticism of Hillary as "fake news". Now Trumpsters run with the term to backlash against the massive state/oligarch propaganda that DID happen throughout 2016 (and the last 80 years).

       Now each side stupidly dismisses everything opposing their side as "fake news". It's dumb.

       Kellyanne Conway is fake news because she's an official person in the government, thus when she lies to influence people, it is 100% propaganda.
On the other hand, you can't control people, and if she lied, it only involves her, they couldn't know before the imam spoke out, and were only reporting what they thought was true

       Ha ha that's funny hyperbole, but trump actually does formulate lots of coherent sentences. Again, it's difficult to get through university and become a billionaire if you can't. funny meme though.

      <p>
       And please point me to the statistics of trump voters' intelligence, besides just what you feel based on how dumb you think trump is. I'm not trying to be combative, I just haven't seen any of this evidence. Typically republican voters have had higher iq's.

       To add to this, "fake news" is being presented as a very specific phenomenon, namely 100% deliberately fabricated stories to drive ad sales or influence an election. When the MSM is accused of being fake news, they and their advocates dismiss the claims, either because the news organization simply made a mistake, was duped by sources, or some other excuse. And according to this narrow definition they use, they're not wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       MSM may not be fake news by this definition, but it's certainly propaganda. If they had called what they're calling "fake news" propaganda instead, we would be completely justified, and they would have far less recourse, if we called MSM propaganda. MSM is a bit more subtle as propaganda. They generally don't fabricate stories completely; more often, it's what they choose to highlight and omit in a story, what context they use and what context they ignore, what credence they give to anonymous government sources, etc.
