    <div class="md"><p>The same reason that quad-copters started being called &quot;drones&quot;. It completely waters down our opinion on what <em>actual</em> drones do, which is kill other people who are often innocent. It is a brain-trick and it very effective. </p>

<p>&quot;I am buying my son a drone for X-mas this year Betty, hehehehe.&quot;</p>

<p>Language is extremely important and influences how our brain works. </p>

<p>Think about the difference between the terms &quot;Shell Shock&quot; or &quot;PTSD&quot;? </p>

<p>By calling propaganda, sensationalism, or blatant lies &quot;fake news&quot;, then the people have a new term to swallow and the people manipulating us now have a new term to bombard us with while also bombarding us with the associations that they WANT us to have with that new term.</p>

<p>As far as I can see: </p>

<p>Kellyanne Conway cites <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Green_massacre">Bowling Green massacre</a> =  fake news!!! (because the media clearly wants Trump to be associated with this term)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/233053942-story">Man who claimed mom died in Iraq after Trump&#39;s ban lied</a> = &quot;Oops&quot; (notice no mainstream outlets are calling it &quot;fake news&quot; because that would imply that both sides are lying)</p>

<p>But, Trumps&#39; inauguration had the biggest &quot;audience&quot; in history. People watching on TV, internet, smart phones and in person.. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s really debatable and what Sean Spicer said in his pressed was correct.

Trump doesn&#39;t help his cause with fueling the fire but nobody is getting away with delegitimatizing him. For once, a republican is fighting back against the corrupt media and Democrats.

Did they not just spend the last 8 years  with filibusters, refusing to pass laws, threatening to shut our government down in order to get their way, tried to repeal the ACA 40 something times. I realize you&#39;re a frequent Donny poster, that&#39;s cool, but please stop thinking trump came in and every Republican got inspired by him to fight those gosh darn global leftists. You also realize your beloved  republicans were also apart of that 13% (possibly lower) approval rating right? </p>

<p>So then also you&#39;re trying to tell me that the MEDIA is at fault for this being said &quot;the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe” you don&#39;t think the administration is trying to instill false hope to those folks who aren&#39;t from highly populated coast cities? You&#39;re also telling me that the media its at fault for the administration falsely stating something? I&#39;m just confused of who in this administration is supposed to assume responsibility for spreading misinformation. The media is trying to discredit trump?

    <div class="md"><p>Okay its ironic that MY arguments are weak.......at best.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For once, a republican is fighting back against the corrupt media and Democrats.
Trump isn&#39;t Republican by the way.. 
You started off proud of the fact Donny was a republican fighting back, but then you say he isn&#39;t one ? Which one is it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im going to use this quote again...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For once, a republican is fighting back against the corrupt media and Democrats
ACA is a trainwreck.. don&#39;t blame the dumbass Republicans at all for obstructing against his globalism ideals.
so you agree then that republicans have been fighting back? and are you calling trump a dumbass if hes the one republican fighting back?</p>

<p>Keep your mind open 
probably shouldn&#39;t even waste my time. Plus you write too much and don&#39;t really get to any meaningful point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its also very ironic you tell me to keep an open mind, but you refused to have a conversation all while automatically assuming its an argument. Maybe one day I can write in one word sentences you can not be so confused by too many words.</p>

<p>Your post like this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gb0r6/rconspiracy_why_is_everyone_liberals_so_butt_hurt/?st=IYSVTT3Y&amp;amp;sh=980ddc91">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gb0r6/rconspiracy_why_is_everyone_liberals_so_butt_hurt/?st=IYSVTT3Y&amp;amp;sh=980ddc91</a> is something that should be asked on Facebook. Can&#39;t even fathom why you would even consider posting that in conspiracy. </p>

<p>You want one my personal conspiracies? Your boy Donny will be the first president of the United States to go to prison. There&#39;s more too him hiding his taxes from the public and always dismissing discussions relating to his finances. I give it 2ish years until there&#39;s serious discussion of impeachment from both dems/republicans. I&#39;m not saying Donny will be the direct cause of his downfall, he could do it himself, but somewhere down the line someone on his team will reveal some pretty damming things that the administration has been doing to serve themselves and their friends. And I don&#39;t mean things being leaked, could happen, but out of pure negligence, I think this administration will expose themselves in the coming years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m Canadian, I don&#39;t really &quot;support&quot; either candidate, but if you need to know what way i lean politically, I voted for justin trudeau in our election. I find it a little bit funny that the anti trump sentiment is that Trump is crass, prejudiced and discriminatory, and many of the people in that cause exemplify those characteristics to a tee when it comes to anyone who dares support someone they don&#39;t like. Everyone pissed their pants at the violence at trump rallies, and a lot of those same people burned down UC Berkeley because a gay jewish guy hurt their feelings.</p>

<p>But anyway, Okay, let&#39;s pretend all your conjecture is correct, and that the clear reason he won is just because americas voting citizens are stupid.</p>

<p>Out of 230 million eligible voters in your country, only 130 million or so cast a vote for the president. If trumps views are so out of line with the average american, why did 100 million people sit at home and let him stomp hillary? Either your country really is full of idiots that don&#39;t know they have to vote to change the outcome of the election, or trump&#39;s views are in line with americas views, and democracy was a success. In any case, you have only yourselves to blame.</p>

Anyone who paid attention to bernie sanders campaign and hillary and the dnc&#39;s dealings with him got to see their true colors, and it became an easy win for Trump.

<p>I really don&#39;t believe that you&#39;ve talked to hundreds of trump supporters and not one of them was intelligent and honest, but even if they weren&#39;t, hundreds is not a good sample size for the potential billions of people on earth that support trump. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read a few studies on the subject that suggest that republicans tend to have higher iq&#39;s. I would never call it a fact, because there would need to be an illegal log of every persons vote during elections to determine anything concrete.</p>

<p>Are you one of those people who can&#39;t bring themselves to write the word &quot;fucked&quot; but who lack the vocabulary to think of anything else to say?</p>

<p>Anyway, no matter, we will likely be plenty fcked in the upcoming years. Trump already has his cronies installed in places of authority. The head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has been usurped by Steve Bannon, the rules put in place to help prevent 2008 happening again are quickly being eroded and after less than two weeks in power Trump has already had a Benghazi of his own.</p>

<p>Looks like we are proper fcked/fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to this, &quot;fake news&quot; is being presented as a very specific phenomenon, namely 100% deliberately fabricated stories to drive ad sales or influence an election. When the MSM is accused of being fake news, they and their advocates dismiss the claims, either because the news organization simply made a mistake, was duped by sources, or some other excuse. And according to this narrow definition they use, they&#39;re not wrong. </p>

<p>MSM may not be fake news by this definition, but it&#39;s certainly propaganda. If they had called what they&#39;re calling &quot;fake news&quot; propaganda instead, we would be completely justified, and they would have far less recourse, if we called MSM propaganda. MSM is a bit more subtle as propaganda. They generally don&#39;t fabricate stories completely; more often, it&#39;s what they choose to highlight and omit in a story, what context they use and what context they ignore, what credence they give to anonymous government sources, etc. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Fake News&quot; was created specifically to divert from Pedogate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And to address your point, so people were googling &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;pizzagate&quot; <em>around</em> the same time... so what? The MSM only started to pick up on pizzagate around the 20th (after &quot;fake news&quot; searches had already initially spiked).</p>

<p>If you spent the time to actually look at what caused the initial spikes in searches for &quot;fake news&quot; (on the 15th and 18th of November) you&#39;d see that on the 15th there were various news stories about Facebook&#39;s problem of &quot;fake news&quot; stories trending on their platform - a story which had been rumbling along in the MSM since August, and on the 18th Obama gave his opinion on the same thing during a speech he gave in Berlin.</p>

<p>This is to say, people who searched for &quot;fake news&quot; on the 15th Nov. would&#39;ve seen results referencing Facebook&#39;s fake news problem, and people who search for &quot;fake news&quot; on the 18th would&#39;ve seen references to Obamas speech. i.e. Nothing about pizzagate. So why do you think they&#39;re connected?</p>

<p>You and others like you are continually moving the goalposts and making wild assumptions based on what you want to believe while ignoring the actual facts. Correlation =/= causation.</p>

<p>The recent rise of the use of the term started with articles critical of Facebook after they fired their human &quot;trending&quot; editors and replaced them with an algorithm (leading to &quot;fake news&quot; stories trending on Facebook).</p>

<p><strong>This happened in August.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Wikileaks published the Podesta emails on October the 7th.</strong></p>

<p>The SMA of 1948 did not restrict the US Government or Executive from disseminating propaganda domestically, it merely gave restrictions on the State Department specifically, and gave guidelines on how they could distribute materials intended for foreign audiences within the US. Even reading the text of the bill, it does not expressly prohibit State from disseminating the materials within the US. </p>

<p>What it certainly does not do is restrict any other federal agency from producing or distributing propaganda materials within the US. Operation Mockingbird may have broken other laws, but nothing in the SMA itself did anything to prohibit CIA from what it did. </p>

<p>Seeing people beg for censorship is so pathetic,  100 years ago nobody in his right mind would have accepted government institutions as their &quot;friend&quot;.  Mecanisms were put in place to make sure they were accountable and did not have too much power.

<p>How, exactly, would such regulation go?  Seems to me you need some central source that declares some news true, and other news false, and then has legal penalties for the false news.</p>

<p>Well, that seems bad and dangerous to me.  I don&#39;t consider free speech to trump (heh) all other considerations by any means - but the idea of a central truth committee scares the hell out of me and it should scare you too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fake news =/= propaganda.</p>

<p>Although certain stories may fall into both categories, they are not the same.</p>

<p>Propaganda is information media that seeks to spread attitudes and ideas to the people it reaches.  Although it&#39;s often biased to favor a particular point of view, it does not always need to be untrue.  For example, spreading stories about Trump&#39;s sexual harassment of women or Hillary&#39;s misuse of a private email server may be factually true, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not propaganda.  The goal of distributing that information is to discredit those people on a large scale and in doing so improve the position of their opponents.  Propaganda could also be positive information.  Missionaries who go out and seek to spread the good news of their religious establishment often do so via propaganda.</p>

<p>&quot;Fake news&quot; on the other hand (besides being a meme propagated by mainstream media to discredit any ideas or memes that arise that don&#39;t fit within the mainstream narrative), is poorly sourced or inaccurate information.  Just because a news anchor on CNN declares something &quot;fake news&quot; doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that it is.  Likewise, just because an idea or story has sources doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s factually true.  We saw the latter occur this week when Fox News tweeted about the Quebec shooting.  Their tweet was factually inaccurate despite being based on sources close to the shooting.  </p>

<p>Although propaganda and the &quot;fake news&quot; meme are very related (and often overlap), they are, in fact, distinct ideas with different meanings.</p>

<p>...do you know how probabilities work? If the weatherman says there&#39;s a 90% chance of rain, and it doesn&#39;t rain, I don&#39;t call the weatherman a liar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha ha that&#39;s funny hyperbole, but trump actually does formulate lots of coherent sentences. Again, it&#39;s difficult to get through university and become a billionaire if you can&#39;t. funny meme though.</p>

<p>And please point me to the statistics of trump voters&#39; intelligence, besides just what you feel based on how dumb you think trump is. I&#39;m not trying to be combative, I just haven&#39;t seen any of this evidence. Typically republican voters have had higher iq&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to this, &quot;fake news&quot; is being presented as a very specific phenomenon, namely 100% deliberately fabricated stories to drive ad sales or influence an election. When the MSM is accused of being fake news, they and their advocates dismiss the claims, either because the news organization simply made a mistake, was duped by sources, or some other excuse. And according to this narrow definition they use, they&#39;re not wrong. </p>

<p>MSM may not be fake news by this definition, but it&#39;s certainly propaganda. If they had called what they&#39;re calling &quot;fake news&quot; propaganda instead, we would be completely justified, and they would have far less recourse, if we called MSM propaganda. MSM is a bit more subtle as propaganda. They generally don&#39;t fabricate stories completely; more often, it&#39;s what they choose to highlight and omit in a story, what context they use and what context they ignore, what credence they give to anonymous government sources, etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that &quot;fake news&quot; was invented as a term after &quot;pizzagate&quot;, just that their rise in mass popularity happened at the same time. That&#39;s what everyone is trying to get through your dense head in this thread. </p>
