<p>Well, guess what - it DOESN&#39;T FUCKING MATTER. What matters is that what we know for sure that beneath the permafrosts of both poles exist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_methane_emissions">large quantities of methane</a> that are ready to be released into the atmosphere and kick off a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_feedback">climate feedback loop</a>.</p>

<p>I think it would be the same shit and worse in US under Hillary though, she actually got more campaign contributions than Trump from Big Oil. </p>

<p>At least now people won&#39;t be complacent <em>and</em> Musk seems to be gaining traction with Trump so that&#39;s also good... I hope/guess.</p>

<p>I live near the ocean and trust me,  levels did not budge.  The reason given is that apparently Australia is acting like a &quot;sponge&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, however, that does not mean we cannot affect these cycles noticeably or even throw them out of whack to some degree.</p>

<p>Other than that, I agree with all your points. The consensus argument is about as solid as the argument of the &quot;17 intelligence agencies...&quot; concerning Russian hacking. It seems to give credence to the argument until you notice that most of the agencies mentioned have jack shit to do with anything relating to the question at hand. Same goes for &quot;97% of scientists...&quot;. Easy enough when most of these scientists are as ignorant of climate science as the gas station clerk down the street. If you focus on climate scientists alone, there are wild disagreements, beginning from what kind of data they base their computations on, what kinds of assumptions they make, and particularly the conclusions they draw.</p>

<p>Opinions there range from pure doom and gloom with James Hanson all the way to &quot;really not that big a deal if we cut down on coal and oil a bit where we can while growing a few more trees every year&quot;.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve gathered, there seems to be a pretty solid agreement that human activities and emissions do have subtle consequences on climate, but vast disagreement on how far reaching these consequences are, how catastrophic the effects may be, or how well our planet compensates for our actions. All these things are still up for debate. But try and debate them and you&#39;ll be labeled ignorant and a science denier. Frustrating, really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed on the CO2 tax. </p>

<p>The thing you and me both want is to replace fossil fuel with solar energy. Why?</p>

<p>1) Fossil fuels have controllable sources, are capital intensive to gather, and regardless of global warming do have real health impacts. NO2, radioactive emissions, harmful if spilled, etc. The first two points HELP the global elite and give them control. </p>

<p>2) Solar has a moderate input cost and a very cheap long tail. It also can be harvested by anyone, anywhere. This means we get to control creating energy. While panel and battery production involve hazardous material, its both less in volume and limited in scope. </p>

<p>3) The major capital bottleneck is building the plants to produce the panels rather than resource extraction. Petral refining isn&#39;t cheap but it is still much less expensive than the extraction. By inverting that relationship, it decouples location as a defining aspect of the resource. For one this prevents something like OPEC, more it means war has much less value if you invade a solar panel plant, one can just be built elsewhere. </p>

<ul>
<li>The most likely situation is greenhouse emissions are having a non trivial impact on earth and its system. Life has meaningfully impacted it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event">before</a>. Not producing billions of tons of waste is almost certainly better than producing them. </li>
<li>Concentration of wealth and power is and likely more of a threat to the future. Both fossil fuel dependency, and overarching policies to prevent climate change further that. The only way forward is to make solar power and the needed supporting technologies the energy source preferred by all markets. The break over point for solar is really close. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source">1</a> <a href="http://www.clca.columbia.edu/241_Raugei_EROI_EP_revised_II_2012-03_VMF.pdf">2</a>. Though those are numbers many people would want to manipulate. </li>
</ul>

<p>If the trend on solar panel costs continues on a exponential cost reduction curve, in 10 years it will be the cheapest source of energy. The most important implication of that is how deeply it will devalue oil reserves. The power grid is ~40% of energy consumption, just replacing that is an enormous loss of demand. </p>

<p>Those who control the sources of oil will act to preserve the value of their assets or seek to replace them. 
* Using government overreach to subsidize the cost of fossil fuels or prevent the installment of solar panels. Things like fixing the cost or amount people can sell back to the grid or government regulating how energy should be produced. This is purely to prevent individuals from being able to participate in the market and to favor global interests. <a href="http://www.mcall.com/mc-pa-resale-electricity-20160214-story.html">1</a> <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/sarahhunt/2017/01/19/no-wyoming-is-not-banning-wind-and-solar-energy-n2273594">2</a> However, net oil importers, namely China and the EU have all the reason in the world to develop drive solar development, so these tactics have limited impact.
* The impending loss of the value of oil, the significant decentralization of energy production solar energy brings, and the loss of global power for those who control oil will result in the attempt to use force and war to prevent the realignment of wealth and power. </p>

<p>There is a very delicate game at play, the environment issue is being manipulated by all sides to leverage control as the game evolves. Overreach of environmental policies, like carbon tax, seek to replace control the centralized nature of fossil fuels. While the other side takes those motions to set new controls and uses them to prevent people from seeing how solar energy actually gives them less dependences on the global elite. </p>

<p>tl;dr </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if the climate is changing, solar photovoltaic cells will allow individuals to move from consumers beholden to those who control fossil fuels, to independently producing their own power with out the grid. All sides are seeking to prevent that independence. Things like carbon tax are a way to subvert that independence and it must be prevented. Things preventing the development of solar energy also seek to to prevent that independence and must be prevented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trump has backed himself into a bit of a corner to fulfill his campaign promises. He promised to bring back jobs to those areas that haven&#39;t seen job creation in so long and I think the easiest way to do it it is go back to revitalizing the energy sector.</p>

<p>Its a short cut and a means to an end and the question is at what cost? OP might be right.</p>

<p>Im still convinced it does atter whats going on in Antarctica because this a place where some odd people have visited. Religious leaders and such and that just doesnt make sense to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There already had been a &quot;revolt&quot;.   Global demand for fossil fuels has been dropping.  People are using less.</p>

<p>We just need to keep going.</p>

<p>If the companies keep producing and supply builds while demand drops, market forces will take over.</p>

<p>Could be why the price of oil is around $50 vs $100-$200 per barrel.</p>
