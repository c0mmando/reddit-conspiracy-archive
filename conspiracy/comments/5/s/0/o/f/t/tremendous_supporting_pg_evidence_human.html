       The link above obviously goes to the PG verse of Voat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not too long ago some anonymous internet internetters snagged some dialogue between apparent human trafficking contacts and clients.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks to be based on using crypto currencies and fairly anonymous (aside from some idiotic folks reusing their names on other sites and services), and details the kind of services provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       I figured you guys would find it interesting not only to reignite any embers, but because this isn't even PG related itself: it's human trafficking altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you'll notice, services can be paid for on hourly bases, and it calls to mind a certain "Want to get a pizza for an hour?" email from dear Grandpa John.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combined with the relatively harmless* desires to buy children for the sake of being a parent to the atrocious urges to buy and rent slaves and whipping posts, this log, even of a hoax, relays the importance of ending this trade.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one deserves to have their child taken, but no one deserves to be taken, regardless of age.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if anyone is interested in further assisting child trafficking causes, consider wherearethechildren.org for a new viewpoint. The website owner could use help spreading the word of the new site about child trafficking.

       It's started by a YouTuber named "from delusion to truth" and was launched yesterday. He posted for a few days prior to launching it and I supported his message, as it sounded like a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, having a public and non-threatening approach to PG so as to try and gain supporters seemed worth getting behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm wrong for supporting him, I'll accept that fact. People make bad judgements sometimes.

      <p>
       However, the Voat material is the focus of the post and the other site was secondary to tertiary in my mind.

       I can confirm this stuff is real, ok, guys.  I'm just going to tell you that out of curiousity, around 2011-2012 or so I installed tor and went to a darknet site similar to silkroad (it wasn't silkroad).  What I saw there was very real and extremely disturbing.  There were people bidding on what kind of torture to do to someone.  It was livestreamed and they showed a clip of it.  It was basically an auction to buy someone to torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was like, 'nope' this is fucked, I'm out
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had nightmares about this whole thing since then.  Not that I'm afraid they'd do that to me.  I mean I'll just admit I'm a pussy: they'd hit me a couple times and I'd dissociate into a sex/kill manchurian and sex/shoot your momma....seriously not enough willpower not to bite my nails much less resist some kind of demons like the CIA.  Let's not test this theory, ok? good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, no i mention that because the nightmares are about living in a country where I know this not only goes on but that the government is the one doing it.  Or let's say elements of the government doing it, while the ones that are those 'good honest government officials' just look the other way.  They absolutely know about this stuff.  They do.  Don't doubt for ONE second.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know what the CIA is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       ANd it's time you do too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we can put an end to this nightmare of living in a country whose highmost 'trusted' vanguard are selling drugs, raping kids, blackmailing everyone, spying on YOU for no reason other than to hurt you later, and mass murdering and enlslaving the rest of the world, all are activities which you pay for, btw, because you're lied to and yet--even knowing what you know--you can't handle the truth that's right in your face and so you even lie to yourself knowing it's readily untrue, 'no the government would never do these things'
