       I believe I have an idea of what the message they are trying to convey is, but as for what the overall statement is, I have no idea. This is what my theory is:
      </p>
      <p>
       What: The seed part of the seed bank is probably their way of saying they have a secure seed bank to release information via torrent as insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where: Probably underground, also referring to the information being a gold mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       When: F-119 could mean February 9th at 11:00 or maybe February 11th at 9:00? Either way, its obviously them saying they'll release their insurance vault soon. The jet engine also could signify that it will be soon, because of the speeds the engine can reach.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who: Probably their way of saying they only gave us a fraction of what Assange, Manning, and Snowden turned over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why: Now this the tricky part. Could be something to do with the Iraq war because the B2 bombers carried out the first strikes, or it could be a message that we aren't meant to know. I think its pretty clearly their way of giving someone a message, threatening to release the insurance information. Now the question is, what happens next?

       The MSM will cover the story and give platitudes if whatever WL leaks aligns with their political ideology and the dumbass audience that view them.

       They're probably waiting for Sessions to be sworn in seeing as how he's the man that will have the power to punish whoever is exposed. Wikileaks doesn't release as soon as they can, they time their releases for maximum impact.

       This for me is the real power of these teasers, all the conversations that are happening about the possible content. Everything from 9/11 to doomsday vaults to pedo rings. It's bringing a whole lot of awareness about the real nature of Govts. to curious folks who maybe hadn't heard any of this stuff.

       Any chance, what with all the other parallels being drawn to 9/11 around the Vault 7 tweets, that the "Why" picture is an allusion to the whole "jet fuel melting steel beams" meme?  Perhaps we're being told to expect the 9/11 insurance files ahead of the Ecuadorian election?

       What does it matter?  Honestly it doesn't matter what information is there because it will only reach those who are wanting to see it.  There aren't enough people out there that believe our government is capable of anything other than what has become "normalized" corruption in the political world.  This is why the 9-11 conspiracy has gone nowhere but dark channel discussion.  Does the evidence suggest that 9/11 wasn't planes flying into buildings....absolutely.  Do people WANT to believe our government is capable of killing thousands of innocents for whatever reason...NOPE....

       I wish someone would put all the tweets together in one line, without nonsense speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how people come up with so many terrible speculations about what these things mean. Really, a jet engine is to mean 9/11 or some other date. That is just terrible. Vault7 has to do with WTC7? That is terrible too. People need to take their tunnel vision blinders off. Maybe if all the tweets without misleading stuff are stacked in one image, it would be more clear.

       There's a good chance Julian Assange has been cloned for a while now. And WikiLeaks may be used by the White Hat Hacker Collective (C.P.M.) to distribute material en mass that would never get distributed by the Main Stream Media aka Government Controlled Media. We're in the middle of a worldwide war of consciousness suppression. Simon Parks has said as recently as one or more January 2017 interviews that he feels there may be a tightly controlled disclosure event or something else quite newsworthy between March 2017 and July 2017. The tightly controlled narrative may include a story of disclosure that one of our super computers has been communicating with ETs/Aliens for several months etc. There also seems to be some higher than usual activity going on with Antarctica. Time will tell.

       Well spotted then!  Yea, I've finally started keeping up with it at least as a reference among other references.  Gives a good insight into the overall reception of these things by the general public as well.
