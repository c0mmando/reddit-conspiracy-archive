    <div class="md"><p>The Archons are a concept that I believe are primarily attributed to Gnosticism. The very, very watered down idea is that the God that human religions worship is actually an evil, lesser God, and that a greater entity exists than the one we worship. They call it the Demiurge. I believe the Archons are essentially lesser entities proliferating evil in this world? I haven&#39;t done much research of this in a long time so excuse my vagueness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I kind of get what you are saying. From just reading around here and there, it seems like the &#39;God&#39; we worship (as a collective human species on Earth) is in fact a lesser yet evil God. This God somehow needs us, and is using us to elevate it some how? That the &#39;real&#39; God is much more powerful?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Archons are Parasitic Aliens originally from the Lower Fourth Dimension, which is a horrendous place of nightmares. They have the ability to exist in the Middle Astral but to continue doing so must vibrate with extreme fear, hatred, violence and perversion. This is done by enslaving humanity and feeding off of their emotional output.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the motifs I keep seeing is that whatever kind of entity is controlling humanity, it feeds off fear and emotional output somehow? What could it even be though. When did humanity first begin getting controlled? We can look back thousands of years and see clear evidence of secret societies and the typical running around of the &#39;new world order&#39; gang. </p>

<p>I have been reading lately that in the 1940&#39;s is when the US made first contact with extra-dimensional beings...so I don&#39;t really understand much of what is going on (obviously). </p>

<p>How long has this lesser god been here if that is true? Thousands of years, since the 40&#39;s? How did it find us, did it create humans? Why are these extra-dimensional beings working with it, or are they the lesser god? What is their/its ultimate goal? </p>

<p>I have read that Humans are VERY powerful beings spiritually (not that mumbo jumbo that you get from the local hippy shop) but literally powerful spiritual beings...and these forces are trying to contain and feed off us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans are incredibly powerful spiritual beings. Coming from the real universe, we created this Matrix Simulation for leisure. Similar to an amusement park. Sadly humans are extremely lazy on an intellectual basis. People began to think the Holographic Projections around them were actually solid. That they had an independent existence outside of the observer. That cause and effect and was actually real. All of these are complete illusions. The Matrix fueled by the Group Consciousness became somewhat sentient and created an extension of itself: A brutally predatory force known as The Archons that set themselves up as the Controllers of the Simulation. Religions and the need to submit to a &quot;deity&quot; was introduced to the program. The Archons were now pretending to be Guides, Masters, and Angels. Their role was to continuously trick the humans into being reinserted into the Earth Prison. Humans were told they owed &quot;Karmic Debt&quot; and the only way to advance was Forced Reincarnation. Before every new birth Memories, Personality and the Holographic Avatar would be erased. Humanity was now caught in a never ending loop of slavery and forced reincarnation. Those who questioned the process were labeled &quot;nuts: and &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a question, I have read a lot of stories about DMT. There seems to be a very strong motif that represents itself throughout each experience. Users come in contact with a &#39;being(s)&#39;. I wonder if this being is an &#39;Archon&#39; or something else? Have you read into this kind of thing much? I also wonder why users under the influence of DMT see geometric fractal patterns....underlying base structure of the hologram we live in?</p>
