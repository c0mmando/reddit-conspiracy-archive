        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When you look at all the popular games today, they are all massive addiction machines at the core. They target today&#39;s youth, and turn them into soulless, mindless, and emotionless zombies.</p>

<p>And all the top games have all the same kind of tone to them. They are always war, cult, anti-religious, satanic, and rage-inducing.</p>

<p>It just feels so other-worldly to me when I play a game like World of Warcraft, or Hearthstone, or Overwatch, etc. It feels like they are exploiting the human brain in ways I can&#39;t even begin to comprehend.</p>

<p>And when you start looking into who owns who, you start to realize that all these companies that produce the most addicting games are very connected to each other. Riot Games(League of Legends), Supercell(Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, Boom Beach), and Epic Games(Unreal Engine &amp; Unreal Tournament) are all owned by one company, Tencent.</p>

<p>And why is it that Blizzard Entertainment, the company that produces the most addicting games in the world, uses Satanic symbolism &amp; Cults as a core element in all of their games? They even have a game made literally around the Devil himself(Diablo). Why does it feel like the companies who are very successful have this tone to their games? Nintendo is a rare opposite.</p>

<p>And they constantly throw the numbers 6 and 9 around all over the place. It&#39;s like they are trying to tell us something. If you start looking for it, it becomes so blatantly obvious. Just look at a Hearthstone card back and you&#39;ll never be able to look at it the same again. They think they are clever in their disguises but it becomes clear as day when you&#39;re aware.</p>

<p>If I were to explain it, it feels like actual Evil has taken over to try and corrupt the minds of the weak. I may be crazy, but if evil does actually exist(which I strongly believe it does), then this would be the perfect outlet for such brainwashing and conversion(get them while they&#39;re young). To me, games don&#39;t feel much like games anymore. Usually when I walk away from playing a game lately I feel like I just completed my hypnosis therapy.</p>

<p>which ones are anti-religious? if they have satanic elements that would mean they do have elements of religion in them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you die you go to the Astral Afterlife. It is extremely similar to this reality except objects can be moved by thought. The Afterlife is under the control of extremely negative beings called THE ARCHONS. It is also in sort of a hard core martial law scenario. The human sellouts who work for THE ARCHONS will force you to get your memory and personality erased, and then be forced to reincarnate into this hellhole. Your best means of defense is &quot;Telekinesis&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me personally, as a gamer since I can remember (29 now), I have noticed that the major trend is to have games where you make decisions that impact the end-result. I would like to see a spreadsheet on the percentage of people who on their first runthrough pick the benevolence or malevolence routes. I noticed I almost always try to play the good guy on the first play but am curious if I am the minority, and if it would shed insight into the mentality of gamers as a whole. </p>

Sure, there&#39;s your shitty clash of clans and other bad mobile games, but most people that actually play video games don&#39;t consider those &quot;real&quot; games. Witcher 3, Bloodborne, FFXV, Uncharted 4, etc. These are all works of art. The same as a book, a song, a painting, a poem. What you make of them is up to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. And I take it you don&#39;t play video games. Every industry has it&#39;s shit, but completely overtaken? No. That would mean that the employees and dev teams themselves are evil, which they arent. Furthermore, you are generalizing in order to mold the narrative to your view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I&#39;d also like to point out the same goes for the music industry. We reward with millions of dollars the musicians brainwashing young kids to commit crime, partake in violence, become hypersexualized, and hate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>read up on or Youtube, GTA5 and its incessant road rage and foul mouthed NPCs who spew insults for no reason.</p>

<p>its gives the impression it was designed to be a road rage murder training environment. a simple repossession of a car for a car dealership requires twenty murders at the neighborhood.</p>

<p>FPS immersion games have morphed into strange things. either a refelction of our worst cities, or a glimpse of a future someone or something desires our society to become.</p>
