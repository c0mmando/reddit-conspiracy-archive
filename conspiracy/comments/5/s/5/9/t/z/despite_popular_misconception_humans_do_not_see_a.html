    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you&#39;re looking at the stars in the sky at night then there is anywhere from a few years to a few hundred, or even thousand, years between the time that has passed since each of those stars shone the light at you that you are seeing at any moment in time.  We all know that we&#39;re not seeing the light from those stars as the light is now, but we don&#39;t typically stop to realize that, for instance, Alpha Centauri, the third brightest star in the sky, just 4.37 light-years from Earth, while the farthest star we can see with our naked eye is V762 Cas in Cassiopeia at 16,308 light-years away.  So if you can see both of them you&#39;re seeing something that happened a little over four years ago at the same time you are seeing something that happened 16,308 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, i got high as fuck a week or two ago and i was having this exact though.  Thinking of the stars helped me realize how our perception is limited by the speed of light; if we could perceive energy faster than the speed of light, you would in theory be able to see the future (relative to everybody else who only perceives at the speed of light).  </p>

<p>Even if you are looking at the wall in front of you, there is still a really small small delay there; you are limited in your perception by the speed of light.</p>

<p>This means that whatever is going to happen, could have ALREADY happened (in a really tiny period of time), but you haven&#39;t perceived it yet</p>

<p>I reckon, if this is all true, at some point, if you could perceive energy way faster than at the speed of light, you could probably perceive all that exists all at once.  Maybe thats what death is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you remember what it was like before your parents conceived you?  That&#39;s exactly what death is like.</p>

<p>Next time you see the lightning strikes in a thunderstorm, count the number of seconds it takes for the sound of the lightning strike to reach you.  It&#39;s coming at you at approximately 1,126 feet per second.  You can estimate how far away the lightning strike is.  If there&#39;s no delay that you can perceive, well, check to see if you&#39;re still alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres nothing that I can remember before the age of probably 3-4 years old - but I was alive in those first 3 to 4 years; so i dont know if that proves what death is.</p>

<p>Maybe you only remember things once you&#39;ve had your perception crushed down into your own little box of life.  Meaning, when you are a child, you brain will accept anything that it is fed - it takes all of these things, blends them together, and that becomes your reality (you speak english, youre american, you live in whatever state ect).</p>

<p>What the hell would your brain/life/consciousness be like if you were just left alone and you developed your own unique language and perception of life/consciousness instead of having the world force their consciousness on you?  I think we are squashing the brilliance out of ourselves and our children</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really adding to this constructively....sorry in advanced, but can&#39;t our &quot;reflexes&quot; perceive faster than our eyes can?  I know there are tons of times I&#39;m putting groceries away and something drops that my conscious mind doesn&#39;t know about..but I instinctively catch it.  Does anyone know what that is?  Are we talking the same thing? I&#39;ve always been curious about what happens from the time we die to the time we &quot;see&quot; it.

    <div class="md"><p>I contend that the reality we &quot;see&quot; is constructed in a way that&#39;s actually pretty analogous to how 3D scenery is generated on a computer; i.e., inside a virtual 3D space where objects are represented as a polygonal surface mesh. Our brains can manipulate these objects using mathematics very similar to how angular rotations/transformations are performed on a computer.</p>

<p>And, it does this incredibly rapidly. Just shift your vision from one place to the next – in that blink of an eye, your brain takes a stereoscopic image and extracts all the information it needs in order to build a 3D polygon map, with high-resolution textures, and then a ray-trace – or perhaps a shortcut calculation of surface normals – to create a convincing illuminated scene.</p>

<p>While that&#39;s impressive in my opinion, there&#39;s another aspect that makes it truly phenomenal. In my above example, you might have thought of a living room or other human environment. These are pretty simple in terms of the shapes that compose them, as we tend to favor simple, regularly shaped object – but, what about plants and other natural phenomena like rocks and clouds and smoke, etc.?</p>

<p>I think that as well as &#39;knowing&#39; how to generate and rotate 3D objects mathematically, our brains know the &#39;god formula&#39; that underlies every living creature and natural material phenomenon. And, it actually requires less energy/effort for our brains to create a 3D version of a complex plant than an artificial object. We only need a tiny amount of information about the plant to, almost instantly, map and render its features completely. If there weren&#39;t such a shortcut, taking a walk through the woods would be as mentally taxing as a stroll through Times Square, or even more so.</p>

<p>But, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s relaxing. And, that&#39;s because this whole reality, especially the natural world, contains a lot <em>less</em> information than it appears to. My evidence in support of this comes from my meditative practices while on high-potency psilocybin trips. When one takes about 3.5g (5+ is more ideal) or more of dried shrooms and lays in a completely dark room or with a blindfold on, a new reality is witnessed. Particularly <em>after</em> the peak of the experience, one can remain in a state where they&#39;re beholding another reality, but has much more agency over its content and can shape it simply by thinking about it. What I&#39;ve discovered is that <em>any</em> new reality can be summoned in the blink of an eye, whether that&#39;s a land of white cubes stacked on top of one another (simple) or some lush alien planet like in Avatar or what have you. It&#39;s essentially instant. You can &#39;explode&#39; realities into existence, and they all have a profound beauty to them. One can conjure artworks of the highest order, better than has ever been created in this reality by a painter, say, at a blistering rate – 3 per second, at least. If you want it to go faster, it just does.</p>

<p>In seeing these realities appear before my eyes, I notice them at the threshold being &#39;drawn&#39; in a way that&#39;s like a 3D program. A wire mesh extends out first, then colors are filled in, and lastly, a ray-trace step adds that gorgeous finishing touch. An idea I had to try to get more insight into the &#39;god formula&#39; I spoke of earlier, I set my intention to, instead of having each new scene simply drawn in its complete state, show myself what it would look like if the creation of these realities were to occur on earth due to natural processes in a kind of time lapse. What I saw was profound – instead of simply appearing, each place would start as a kind of desolate landscape, and then a million plants would spring up from the ground and actually <em>grow</em> just as you see in time lapse movies of plant growth. Doing this was just as effortless as conjuring the completed product. I remember there was about a 2s delay between asking to see that (as if something was pondering the request for a moment) and it unfurling in utter perfection in my mind&#39;s eye.</p>

<p>This is why I can&#39;t stand it when sophomoric bien pensants like Michio Kaku &#39;introduce&#39; the idea that this reality might not be &#39;real&#39;, but rather some kind of VR simulation, perhaps a game created by ancient aliens or <em>whatever</em>. My response is – of course we are, you dunce! Of course we&#39;re &#39;living&#39; in a &#39;virtual reality&#39; – it&#39;s inside your head. That&#39;s where the VR game in which you &#39;live&#39; is located. How he doesn&#39;t notice this I don&#39;t know. But, what chance do you think we have of determining whether or not &#39;real&#39; reality is the real reality or a VR simulation from the perspective of a VR simulation of a reality that one has exactly zero purchase on the prospect of determining the realness of!?</p>
