       (First off, to address the obvious, yes, my account is new.  I, as a human being, am not new to r/conspiracy, but sometimes $#!+ happens and you need to retire an identity.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So, here's what I realized while casually browsing YouTube comments earlier today.  It would be trivially easy (in the Comp. Sci. polynomial-time sense of the word "easy", not to mention the "CIA black budget" sense of the word "trivial") to create a system where Manchurian Accounts could be used to promote false narratives by seeming sincere and trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's how it would work.  Google knows more about the vast majority of us than we know about ourselves.  They can easily identify who we are connected to by various degrees of separation, identify when that network changes, and so on.  Therefore, it could use any account to author a post and guarantee that the user whose account was parasitized would never find out about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say you're watching a video about Sandy Hook being a hoax.  Let's further suppose that Sandy Hook was, in fact, a hoax (I'm not making the claim one way or the other; insert your favorite conspiracy here if necessary).  Let's say the topmost comment is some guy claiming that he was an eyewitness and that Sandy Hook was horrific and he's never seen anything like it, and he's got like 300 replies basically accusing him of being a shill and offering rebuttals, none of which are ever addressed by the OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your average YouTube browser is gonna see this, along with whichever replies Google chooses to expose by default.  Of course, they can always expand the full list of comments, but why not look at the OP's post history?  It's a robust selection of intelligent posts on a variety of videos, painting an image of someone who is believable and reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only problem is, the OP never made the post.  He has no idea the post is out there under his name.  Nobody he's ever interacted with in his life would ever see that post on this video.  The replies all got sent to someone else to handle.  Private messages were intercepted and redirected.  He, and everyone he has ever interacted with, and everyone who ever interacted with
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       , sees that he has 999 posts, and he remembers writing all of them (or at least acknowledges that the ones he doesn't quite remember were probably written while drunk and/or high).
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, anyone without a connection to him sees that he has 1000 posts, one of which believably describes his firsthand account of Sandy Hook.  And if they reply to that post or send a message, he never gets it.
      </p>

       I think I'm beginning to understand why some people eventually decide to live life as if they're in an instance of Skyrim, the only real person, surrounded by a bunch of well-programmed NPCs. 😕  I'm not ready to go there, yet, but treating the Internet that way is starting to seem like the only rational position to take...

       No, you can't, unless you get to know the person. That's not to say some commentary cannot provide useful information, because it certainly can at times, just be mindful of the source and their motives (if applicable), and to fact check that which is not already known to you.

       How do you prove to me that Antarctica exists, much less that it is not a ring around the edge of a finitely bounded flat disk of an earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my case, I draw upon my knowledge of and experience with aerospace engineering. Jetliners cannot safely break the sound barrier, much less travel at speeds exceeding Mach 2.  Of course, o don't expect you to take a rando Internet stranger at his word.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I'm convinced that extraterrestrials are in contact with mankind and possess technology that allows for insanely fast acceleration and speeds well in excess of c, so...
      </p>
      <p>
       But then again, aliens from other star systems can't sensibly exist when earth is literally a flat disk at the center of the universe.

       Obviously you shouldn't take anyone on the internet's word for fact or truth. You should at least be skeptical of everything everyone says for the possibility that they are lying, or aren't who they say they are. Everything we read and say here should be treated as parables for the most part. It is pretty easy to talk yourself into something you want to believe; perception is reality.

       This statement is false.

       If you believe it's true, that means it's not false, so your belief is false.

       Here's a slightly different perspective to consider, along those same lines:
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been saying this for years: most people are not mentally qualified to use the Internet. Your instinct is to believe that every post you see is written by a real, honest person. (Many people start using the Internet by means of Facebook, by connecting with people they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       know in the real world.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But you nailed it, there is no way of knowing that anything you see on the Internet is "real", unless it's, like, a Facebook post your IRL buddy makes and you confirm with him IRL that he made it. Everything else could be completely fabricated.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past year, there's been a lot of talk about "shills", but instead of belaboring that point, here's something else to think about:
      </p>
      <p>
       With the recent rise in popularity of neural network chatbots and natural language processing, there is absolutely zero reason to believe that anything you read online has been written by a real person. Awhile back I set up a twitter bot using
       <a href="https://github.com/mispy/twitter_ebooks">
        twitter_ebooks
       </a>
       , an open-source bot that reads your entire Twitter history and generates tweets based on it. It's not a very complex piece of software, but it occasionally generated tweets that totally sounded like something I would've written. Corporations like Microsoft are actually actively researching this stuff, so anything they make would be lightyears ahead of twitter_ebooks in terms of believability.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot">
        Tay
       </a>
       ), for instance, blew me away. When 4chan started making it say white supremacist and conspiracy stuff, it was not only hilarious, but REALLY SCARY. Tay "was designed to mimic the language patterns of a 19-year-old American girl", and it more or less nailed it... what would stop someone from developing a similar algorithm but for /pol/? For
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ? For
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ? For
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Internet communities are fascinating things. Once they get enough traction and become "established", they often will have a pretty set "tone". Not everyone 100% adheres to the "tone", but enough do that you can sort of create a caricature of that community in your mind. From there, you can choose to join the circlejerk, if that's your thing, or not.

       Say I've been in a coma for a few years and I'm just waking up right now and learning about the current state of American politics. I decide that this Trump guy seems alright, and I want to support him. I find out that the subreddit for him is
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       , so I go and check it out. Wow! They have their own catchphrases and memes, injokes and Reddit bots (the one that makes "the wall" bigger every time it's mentioned, etc.)... okay, so if I lurk long enough, I can figure out how to fit in with the rest of the community, and maybe even contribute my own ideas, while keeping in the spirit of the rest of the subreddit. (After all, I don't want to get downvoted/banned!)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the process that everyone goes through when they investigate and then choose whether or not to join various Internet communities. You did the same thing when you first came to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ; even though you probably don't like everything that gets posted here, you like the cut of this subreddit's jib enough to stick around, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's stopping someone from analyzing the overall patterns of discourse in a given community, and then using a sufficiently powerful and believable distributed network of chatbots (a chatbotnet, if you will) to perpetuate the community?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of all of the political subreddit postings you've seen in the past year; many have been so low-effort, mindlessly regurgitating their preferred candidate or party's talking points (and counter-talking points), that it honestly becomes impossible to discern humans from chatbots at a certain point, once you consider how far we've come with chatbot and natural language processing technology. Think about it: if you go to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , before even clicking on the top post, you can already guess what the top comments will be, based solely on the submission title and what you know about the kinds of people(?) who post there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you believe that Internet communities can be, and likely
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       , robo-astroturfed to perpetuate their memes and/or bolster their numbers, the next logical step is: these hypothetical(?) chatbots can set the course the community takes going forward, by steering "the conversation".
      </p>
      <p>
       This can all be done alongside "actual (human) shilling", and paid-for upvotes, as we all know.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, bottom line: you can't trust a Goddamn thing you read on the Internet. Take everything with a pillar of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is... going forward, how do we educate people to override their gullible instincts when it comes to interacting with other "people" online? Honestly, I have no idea, short of making the Internet illegal to use without a license that you need to study and take a test for.

       People need to learn that:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        People frequently lie on the Internet (moreso than in real life, because it's harder to prove them wrong)
       </li>
       <li>
        People frequently pretend to be other people on the Internet (usually, but not always, behind a mask of anonymity or pseudo-anonymity)
       </li>
       <li>
        People on the Internet cannot be assumed to be human (and this is only going to get worse as time goes on)
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       These concepts do not come naturally to our human brains, because the Internet is a very complex thing that most people only understand as being magical, so most people simply map real-life social constructs directly onto it. Even Kids These Days who grow up being online as soon as they have the dexterity to reliably interact with an iPad don't truly understand how weird and unlike real life the Internet actually is.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, that's my analysis, but unfortunately I don't have any idea of what to do to solve these problems going forward. Even my "Internet license" idea is pretty silly, because any government probably shouldn't be trusted with being a centralized authority on who can and can't use the Internet. Plus, one of the greatest concepts of the Internet (I know, I know, I'm actually talking about the World Wide Web,
       <em>
        whatever
       </em>
       ) is how it's being increasingly available to
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       as a means of connecting people and ideas. It's just too bad that there's nothing stopping it from filling up with fake people and propaganda.

       And the reward for "well-written comment that really should be a post of its own" goes to... u/takua108 !

       I really used to basically believe everyone on the Internet was being truthful about stuff.  I have a couple of theories as to why but that's kind of whatever.  Over the last two years though, my God...if the word "media" is in there somewhere, whether it be "social media" or "mainstream media", assume everyone's lying and work your way up from there (I give certain "alternative media" outlets some small benefit of the doubt; I try to maintain my skepticism, though confirmation bias is a hell of a drug).
