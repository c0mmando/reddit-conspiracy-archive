    <div class="md"><p>let&#39; face it, mccain mispronounced his name several times, alonf with those of whom he was trying to associate with this mans hardships. I have to ask, does this guy even exist, because mccain seemed so emotionless in his speech, it was if he was doing a role call in middle school. Anytime he glanced up from his notes he forgot what he was talking about. I still can&#39;t believe that twats like this are stil entertained within the current administration. The best medicine for these fools is tor force them to participate in a weekly live debate with audience participation and watch them sweat and crumble under the scrutiny. This should be a thing. If you really want imput into how your country is governed, force public debate. This is the time, you now have an msm gagging for viewership figures, so force a transition, demand live political debate or you will turn off.</p>

<p>And soon we&#39;ll have more and more Trump-Putin Crony rhetoric. And if pedorings get busted it&#39;ll be Putin&#39;s fault, and Trump is his US coup tool.</p>

<p>McCain himself is a fucking killer. Like dawg, at least putin kicked out oligarchs and took russia from raped by western forces to decent nation in a decade and change. </p>

<p>McCain just keeps lying and killing. Go bust corruption, bomb isis, work with other nations, protect our nation and THEN may be you&#39;ll be morally equivalent with putin. </p>

<p>I want dirt on putin too dawg, but I can&#39;t take this seriously especially not from you.</p>

<p>Oh, and  John?... </p>

<p>thanks for all your help with money, equipment and Intel in creating ISIS... Give it up man, you deserve to be strung up by your ankles and whipped for treason.... You have US soldiers blood on your hands and deserve to be in hell if it exists....</p>

<p>P.S. nice touch with the orange Illuminati jump suits... It really adds that extra sparkle when people are beheaded.</p>

<p>Can you tell me how you keep those new orange jumpsuits so clean and pressed all the time?..... And where does one order those things.... Does ISIS order them through Amazon?</p>
