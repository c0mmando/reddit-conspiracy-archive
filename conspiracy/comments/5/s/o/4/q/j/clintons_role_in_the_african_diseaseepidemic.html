<ul>
<li>For over a year, the American Ambassador in Kenya requested additional security.</li>
<li>President Clinton neglected those requests.</li>
<li>Al Qaeda detonated a bomb that killed 12 Americans and over 200 Kenyans. Among the dead, 2 CIA operators.</li>
<li>In response, Clinton ordered missile strikes on a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan. </li>
<li>Clinton claimed the site was being used by Osama bin Laden to manufacture chemical weapons. </li>
<li>It wasn’t. </li>
<li>It was just a pharmaceutical factory.
This factory supplied around 50% of Sudan’s medicine. </li>
<li>Malaria mortality rates declined steadily from 1900 all the way through the 1980s. .</li>
<li>In the 1990s, the mortality rates skyrocketed, rising over 40%. This was caused by medication shortage.</li>
<li>This medication shortage was caused in large part by direct and indirect actions taken by the Clinton administration to destabilize Africa.</li>
<li>Not one to let a good crisis go to waste, Clinton sponsored several programs to boost spending to fight these problems.</li>
<li>These programs are designed to funnel money out of government, into the hands of Clinton cronies. </li>
<li>Clinton and large pharmaceutical companies are financially connected. </li>
<li>Clinical trials in third world countries are out of control. Pharmaceutical companies are taking advantage of uninformed populations in order to collect data for pipeline products. This is not the case in every instance, but it is happening, and all major pharmaceutical companies knowingly sponsor such programs.<br/></li>

<h1>Skip down a few paragraphs for the good stuff. I have included some background info on Ambassador Bushnell that some may find &quot;boring&quot;</h1>

<p>   </p>

<p><strong>Ambassador Prudence Bushnell</strong> | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence_Bushnell"><strong>WIKIPEDIA</strong></a>   </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Black Hawk Down</strong> On October 3, 1993, 18 U.S. soldiers were killed and 73 wounded in an attempt to apprehend warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid at the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia. The American public was appalled at the deaths and support for American involvement in African affairs suffered as a result.<br/></li>
<li>It was against this backdrop that the <strong>Rwandan Genocide</strong> began. On April 6, 1994, Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira, the President of Burundi, were both killed when their plane was shot down on approach to Kigali Airport in Rwanda. Responsibility for the assassinations has never been clearly established, however, the resulting chaos was the catalyst for the masacre of Tutsis at the hands of Rwanda&#39;s Hutu majority.<br/></li>
</ul>

<h1>Bushnell warned the Clinton Administration in advance</h1>

<ul>
<li>Bushnell, who had been visiting the area just weeks before, released a memorandum immediately following the assassinations. </li>
<li>In it, she predicted widespread violence and the military take-over of the Rwandan government and urged the U.S. government to take action to maintain order. </li>
<li>Partly as a result of the Somali incident, the U.S. government chose not to heed Bushnell&#39;s recommendations, and on the next day, April 7, the Rwandan Genocide began when several Tutsi government officials and moderate Hutu Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana were killed by Hutu militias.<br/></li>
</ul>

<h1>Clinton did nothing</h1>

<p>    </p>

<p><strong>Ambassador to Kenya</strong>   </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bushnell remained Deputy Assistant Secretary until being nominated by President Clinton to serve as Ambassador to Kenya in 1996. Upon confirmation by the United States Senate, Bushnell took up residence in Nairobi.  </p></li>
<li><p>Bushnell used her office to push Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to institute democratic reforms and to root out corruption in his government, a major drag on Kenya&#39;s economy.  </p></li>
</ul>

<h1>She warned them again.</h1>

<ul>
<li>Bushnell was also alarmed at the vulnerability of the U.S. embassy compound to attack.<br/></li>
<li><strong>For over a year, she complained about security conditions to her superiors in Washington.</strong><br/></li>
<li>Despite Bushnell&#39;s request for a new, secure building, a State Department evaluation team concluded that a renovation would suffice.<br/></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>On 20 August 1998, the factory was destroyed in cruise missile strikes launched by the United States military allegedly in retaliation for the truck bombattacks on its embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya on 7 August. The administration of President Bill Clinton justified the attacks, dubbed Operation Infinite Reach, on the grounds that the al-Shifa plant was involved with processing the deadly nerve agent VX, and had ties with the Islamist al-Qaeda group of Osama bin Laden.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>    </p>

<h1>Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory</h1>

<p>The Al-Shifa (الشفاء, Arabic for &quot;healing&quot;) pharmaceutical factory in <strong>Khartoum North, Sudan</strong>, was constructed between 1992 and 1996 with components imported from <strong>Germany</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Italy</strong>, <strong>Sweden</strong>, <strong>Switzerland</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong> and the <strong>United States</strong>. It was opened 12 July 1997.   </p>

<h1>U.S. missiles pound targets in Afghanistan, Sudan | <a href="https://archive.is/qOJc">CNN</a> | AUG 20, 1998</h1>

<ul>
<li>Sudanese television showed piles of rubble at the factory and fire raging in the distance. People were seen walking through the damage, wearing masks.<br/></li>
<li>Sudanese officials reacted angrily to the attacks. Interior Minister Abdul Rahim told CNN in a telephone interview that the privately owned pharmaceutical firm had &quot;nothing to do with chemical weapons.&quot;<br/></li>
<li><strong>&quot;We have no chemical weapons factory in our country,&quot;</strong> he said.<br/></li>
<li>A statement read on Sudanese television about an hour after the attack said, &quot;The wrongful American air force launched air attacks on Sudan tonight which aimed at strategic and vital areas.&quot; There was no report as to the number of casualties.<br/></li>

<ul>
<li>“The Sudanese plant, depicted by the White House as a chemical-warfare facility, was one of 2 targets in a retaliatory raid against Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden, who was linked to the bombings of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier that month; Tomahawks were also fired at sites in Afghanistan suspected to be terrorist training camps under the control of bin Laden.”<br/></li>

<ul>
<li>On Aug. 20, President Clinton personally ordered the leveling of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant on the outskirts of Khartoum.<br/></li>
<li>Sources in U.S. Intelligence apparently claimed that there was only one “window” through which to strike at bin Laden, and that the only time they could hope to hit his Afghan fastness by this remote means was on the night of Monica Lewinsky’s return to the grand jury.<br/></li>

<ul>
<li>“Sudan&#39;s government wants the Shifa factory preserved just as it was shortly after 13 Tomahawk cruise missiles took it out in the early evening of August 20. The destroyed factory has become a monument of sorts, a place that Sudanese authorities say symbolizes the mistreatment they have suffered at the hands of the world&#39;s superpower.”<br/></li>
<li>&quot;The government wants it as a showcase,&quot; said Eltayeb Hag Ateya, director of the Peace Studies Institute at the University of Khartoum. &quot;It&#39;s still a thorn in Sudan-American relations. It will always be a point for the Sudanese government to bring up.&quot;<br/></li>
<li>“Well then, what was the hurry? A hurry that was panicky enough for the president and his advisors to pick the wrong objective and then, stained with embarrassment and retraction, to refuse the open inquiry that could have settled the question in the first place? There is really only one possible answer to that question. Clinton needed to look “presidential” for a day.”<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>   </p>

<p><strong>The Observer</strong> noted:
- &quot;The loss of this factory is a tragedy for the rural communities who need these medicines&quot; quoting Tom Carnaffin, technical manager with &quot;intimate knowledge&quot; of the destroyed plant.<br/>
- A month later, Guardian correspondent Patrick Wintour elaborated that the plant &quot;provided 50 percent of Sudan’s medicines, and its destruction has left the country with no supplies of chloroquine, the standard treatment for malaria&quot;. (Wintour, Patrick, The Observer, 20 December 1998.)   </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He continued that, despite this, the </p>

<h1>British government (who publicly backed the attack) refused requests &quot;to resupply chloroquine in emergency relief until such time as the Sudanese can rebuild their pharmaceutical production&quot;.</h1>

<ul>
<li>The factory was a principal source of Sudan&#39;s anti-malaria and veterinary drugs according to the CBW Conventions Bulletin. | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070630113744/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/spru/hsp/cbwcb42.pdf">THE CBW CONVENTIONS BULLETIN</a><br/></li>

<h1>Malaria Surveillance - United States, 1999 | <a href="http://archive.is/wIa1W">CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL</a></h1>

<p><strong>”Interpretation:”</strong>   </p>

<ul>
<li>“The 25.5% increase in malaria cases in 1999, compared with 1998, resulted primarily from increases in cases acquired in Africa and the Americas.”<br/>

<ul>
<li>“This increase is possibly related to a change in the system by which states report to CDC, but it could also have resulted from local changes in disease transmission, increased travel to these regions, improved reporting to state and local health departments, or a <strong>decreased use of effective antimalarial chemoprophylaxis.</strong>”<br/></li>
</ul></li>
<li>“In the majority of reported cases, U.S. civilians who acquired infection abroad were not on an appropriate chemoprophylaxis regimen for the country where they acquired malaria.”<br/></li>

<li>In an interview in health centres, members of the public expressed &#39;strong interest&#39;, calling for &#39;immediate&#39; explanation from the health department over what they saw as the acute shortage of chloroquine vaccines at a time when malaria is taking a high toll on the population.<br/></li>

<ul>
<li>“According to the most recent data, 40% (2,400 million) of the world population in over 90 countries is affected by malaria. In any given year, nearly 10% of the global population will suffer a case of malaria (Malaria International, 1998).”<br/></li>
<li>“There are 300 - 500 million clinical cases of malaria worldwide each year with the majority occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 1998).”<br/></li>
<li>“Malaria has been estimated to cause 9% of all disease in Africa (Nchinda, 1998).”<br/></li>
<li>“According to recent data, there are 1.5 – 2.7 million deaths due to malaria each year, the bulk of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa where an estimated 360 million people live in areas of stable, endemic Plasmodium falciparum transmission (Snow et al., 1999a).”<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>   </p>

<h1>Rolling Back Malaria | <a href="http://archive.is/eDoE8">WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</a> | 1999</h1>

<ul>
<li>Almost 300 million clinical cases of malaria occur worldwide each year and over one million people die.<br/></li>
<li>Almost 90% of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where young children are the most affected.<br/></li>
<li>Malaria is directly responsible for one in five childhood deaths in Africa and indirectly contributes to illness and deaths from respiratory infections, diarrheal disease and malnutrition.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>The author then uses factual information in a manner that is very misleading.</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>“Chloroquine, perhaps the best ever antimalarial drug, and certainly the most widely used, is now failing against falciparum malaria in most areas of the tropical world.”<br/></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>True</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>“In some areas, such as parts of South-East Asia and South America, chloroquine is now completely ineffective against P. falciparum malaria.”<br/></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>True, but we’re talking about Africa. That’s where the problem is.</strong>   </p>

<ul>
<li>“In many parts of India and Africa, its effectiveness is falling rapidly.”<br/></li>
</ul>

<h1>True, but still misleading.

<p>   </p>

<ul>
<li>“For the treatment of falciparum malaria, the usual successor to chloroquine is a combination of pyrimethamine and a long acting sulphonamide (SP), which is also affordable and well tolerated. Five countries in Africa (Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa and Swaziland) have now been forced to switch from chloroquine to SP as the first line antimalarial treatment.”<br/></li>
<li>“Unfortunately, in several of the areas where it has been deployed, notably South-East Asia and South America, P. falciparum has become widely SP-resistant.”<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>   </p>

<p>I thought we were talking about sub-Saharan Africa.  </p>

<ul>
<li>The controversial insecticide DDT — which most nations have banned — is back on the menu for malaria control after the World Health Organization reversed a 30-year old policy on Friday (15 September).<br/></li>
<li>The move puts annual indoor spraying of DDT alongside drugs and bednets as one of the three main tools for controlling the disease.<br/></li>
<li>&quot;The scientific and programmatic evidence clearly supports this reassessment,&quot; said Anarfi Asamoa-Baah, assistant director-general for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria at the World Health Organization (WHO).<br/></li>
<li>&quot;[Indoor spraying] has proven to be just as cost-effective as other malaria prevention methods, and DDT presents no health risk when used properly.&quot;<br/></li>
<li>The chemical kills the mosquitoes that spread malaria. It helped eradicate the disease from southern Europe and North America in the 1960s.<br/></li>
<li>DDT is also toxic to birds, fish and mammals. It accumulates in the food chain and remains in the environment for many years. In the 1970s, growing awareness of these threats led many countries to ban its use in agriculture.<br/></li>

<li>The work has important implications for public health policies in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the need to tackle both diseases together.<br/></li>
<li>There is considerable geographical overlap between HIV/AIDS — which infects over 40 million people in Africa — and malaria, which causes 500 million clinical infections each year.<br/></li>
<li>People with both malaria and HIV/AIDS are more likely to transmit the HIV virus, according to the study published in the journal Science today (8 December). This may have promoted the rapid spread of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa.<br/></li>

<li>Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality.<br/></li>
<li>The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.<br/></li>
<li>Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.<br/></li>
<li>The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>   </p>

<h2>Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc. donated $100,001 - $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation.</h2>

<h1>Clinton Foundation Advised World Bank on Contracts That Netted Donors Millions | <a href="http://archive.is/jHhaR">FREE BEACON</a> | AUG 16, 2016</h1>

<ul>
<li>Two of every three dollars spent acquiring anti-tuberculosis drugs through the program, which is administered by the World Bank, have gone to two companies—Swiss health care giant Novartis and Indian drug company Lupin Ltd.—that together have donated up to $130,000 to the Clinton Foundation.</li>
<li>The project, dubbed the Second National Tuberculosis Control Project (SNTCP), is financed by the World Bank’s International Development Association, which receives the bulk of its funding from the United States, Britain, Japan, and Germany.<br/></li>
<li>Clinton has pointed to her foundation’s work in promoting access to pharmaceuticals in the developing world as an example of its laudatory humanitarian mission.</li>
<li>However, critics have noted how beneficiaries of other foundation-backed pharmaceutical access programs have made large financial contributions to the group. Companies that received funds from the foundation to provide low-cost HIV drugs, for instance, were donors to the foundation.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Clinton Foundation Likely Facilitated The Distribution of Watered Down HIV/AIDS Medications In sub-Saharan Africa Through Its Health Access Initiative.<br/></li>
<li>The Distribution of Watered Down HIV/AIDS Medications In sub-Saharan Africa May Have Increased Patient Mortality Rates.<br/></li>
<li>Watered Down HIV/AIDS ARVs Were Purchased With Taxpayer Money Through PEPFAR As A Result of Price Agreements, Some of Which Were Likely Negotiated By The Clinton Foundation.<br/></li>
<li>President Clinton Was Personally Enriched With Million Dollar Consulting Contracts By A Friend of Convicted Felon, and Ranbaxy advocate, Rajat Gupta From 2002-2008.<br/></li>

<h1>Lobbyists for Clinton’s ‘Enemies’ Are Bankrolling Her Campaign | <a href="http://archive.is/EYwiS">FREE BEACON</a> | OCT 14, 2015</h1>

<ul>
<li>Asked to name the enemies that she is most proud of during Tuesday’s Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Clinton cited industries represented by lobbyists who are among her top campaign fundraisers.<br/></li>
<li>In addition to Iran and the Republican Party, Clinton said she was proud to count “the health insurance companies” and “the drug companies” as her enemies.<br/></li>
<li>Those industries’ lobbyists do not appear to share that enmity. By mid-July, seven of them had raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for her presidential campaign, according to campaign finance records.<br/></li>
<li>They include Heather and Tony Podesta, the recently divorced Democratic power brokers. Heather Podesta represents health insurer Cigna, while Tony lobbies on behalf of pharmaceutical firms Amgen and EMD Serono, a division of drug giant Merck.<br/></li>
<li>The Podestas have also given as much as $150,000 to the Clinton Foundation, according to that group’s list of donors.<br/></li>
<li>Insurers Humana and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and drug company Pfizer have donated between $1 million and $5 million. Merck has given $250,000 to $500,000; AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson have donated $100,000 to $250,000.<br/></li>
<li>One of the speakers at this year’s annual Clinton Global Initiative summit was Merck chairman and chief executive Kenneth Frazier, a PhRMA board member. Last year, CGI hosted the president of health care consulting firm Rabin Martin, which represents a number of drug companies. The year before, it announced financial commitments from Pfizer, one of multiple such charitable commitments that drug company has made through the Clinton Foundation.<br/></li>

<ul>
<li>“CLINTON HEALTH ACCESS INITIATIVE (CHAI) first began working in South Africa in 2003, when the government asked for assistance to develop a plan to significantly scale up HIV services and access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). In 2009, CHAI was invited back to partner with the South African Government to help improve the response to HIV and TB, which laid the foundation for the most aggressive expansion of HIV testing and treatment ever attempted in the world. In addition to the CHAI HIV/AIDS work, CHAI also supports the National Department of Health (NDOH) with efforts to eliminate malaria.”<br/></li>
<li>“CHAI worked with the government to develop implementation plans for testing and treatment and to select facilities for ART scale-up. From April 2010 to March 2012, the number of facilities providing ART increased from 495 to over 3000, and in the last year close to 430,000 people started treatment. Since April 2010, nearly 20 million HIV tests were conducted in South Africa.”<br/></li>

<h1>Industry-sponsored clinical drug trials in Egypt | <a href="https://www.somo.nl/industry-sponsored-clinical-drug-trials-in-egypt/">SOMO</a> | JUN 21, 2016</h1>

<ul>
<li>The past 20 years have seen a considerable shift in the location of clinical drug trials sponsored by transnational pharmaceutical companies (TNCs), with a significant ex-pansion of such tests being conducted in low- and middle-income settings. This increased offshoring may result in serious ethical violations as highlighted by several recent field investigations and media reports.<br/></li>
<li>An attractive research infrastructure, a fast-growing and largely treatment-naïve population, and lower costs make Egypt among the most popular places in the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region for offshoring medicine testing. <strong>Egypt is second only to South Africa on the African continent in terms of the number of TNC-sponsored clinical trials it hosts.</strong><br/></li>
<li>Of the 57 international drug trials that were active in Egypt in February 2016, over half were cancer trials. The two Swiss giants Novartis and Roche are responsible for almost 50 per cent of the international drug trials taking place in the country. The Arab spring events of early 2011 and the subsequent political unrest had no chilling effect on the number of active international drug trials – on the contrary.<br/></li>
<li>Egypt has the highest prevalence of viral hepatitis C in the world, and was the frst low- or middle-income country in 2014 to negotiate preferential pricing for the new direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment sofosbuvir (Sovaldi®) with manufacturer Gilead.<br/></li>

<ul>
<li>The drug shown to cure hepatitis C is sold by Gilead Sciences of California under the brand name Sovaldi, but it was developed at Pharmasset, a private lab owned by Dr. Raymond Schinazi while he worked for the VA Medical Center in Atlanta and Emory University.<br/></li>
<li>Today, skeptical lawmakers question whether Schinazi got rich using VA resources and funding. He sold Pharmasset, and with it the drug, to Gilead in 2011 for $11 billion.</li>
