        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay, using occam&#39;s razor, my theory is: </p>

<p>What is #Vault7? ...picture of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Frequently described as an &#39;insurance policy&#39;. </p>

<p>Where is #Vault7? ...picture of the Merkers salt mines full of Nazi gold. Gold mine.  </p>

<p>When is #Vault7? ...picture of an F119 Jet engine. 11th September. </p>

<p>What do we get? A direct threat to the FBI: &quot;We have a gold mine of evidence relating to 9/11 as an insurance policy that we are willing to release if you do not release Vault 7 of the Hillary findings.&quot; </p>

<p>*speculation - I think Wikileaks has sat on this &#39;insurance policy&#39; by request of the FBI to give them time to organise the case against the Clintons and not have Wikileaks compromise it by leaking the evidence early. While they&#39;ve held up their end of the bargain, the FBI have failed to release their evidence and so this is a reminder of the consequences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The theory I heard somewhere is that they need more public awareness since there is still resistance within the agencies to making these arrests.  The agencies need to know that we know what&#39;s going on, otherwise it will be too easy to sweep under the rug. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice theory.</p>

<p>It could mean other things of things. </p>

<p>For instance a Seed bank could be some reference to the first bankers (in Assyria and Babylonia made grain loans to farmers and merchants)</p>

<p>I&#39;m expecting there more tweets, corresponding to &quot;who what where how which why when&quot;, so it will be interesting how it evolves.</p>

<p>The cryptic tweets are good - do you think it&#39;s about generating interest through speculation or baiting whomever the leaks will affect ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A 4chan anon I find rather compelling (High-Level-Insider) has made an interesting point that connects the Clinton&#39;s with 911 and its planning. It&#39;s been a few weeks since I read it all, so forgive me for no recalling the details now, but from what I recall it had to do with something like securities being sold off illegally by the Clintons of which records were stored somewhere in the WTC.</p>

<p>If you consider the Clinton&#39;s as the democratic faction of the Bush Cabal (an independently compelling theory) it would seem to fit the bigger picture that they were part of the conspiracy with their own motives and benefits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HLI said that Bill Clinton planned 9/11 with Bush Senior to cover up the fake bonds they took out of a bank in New York. Clinton took the bonds out to buy off KGB members and politicians and this directly helped topple the Soviet Union. The expiration date of the bonds was fast approaching. </p>

<p>What is #Vault7? ...picture of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Frequently described as an &#39;insurance policy&#39;.</p>

<p>Germany invaded Norway on <strong>April 9, 1940.</strong></p>

<p>Where is #Vault7? ...picture of the Merkers salt mines full of Nazi gold. Gold mine.  </p>

<p>Allied forces took over the Merkers mine on <strong>April 9, 1945.</strong></p>

<p>When is #Vault7? ...picture of an F119 Jet engine. 11th September.</p>

<p>The picture was very specifically noted to have been taken on <strong>April 9, 2010</strong> in the tweet specifically labelled as &quot;When.&quot;</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a leak involving Erdogan.</p>
