        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m a long time reddit user (had previous accounts) and I&#39;ve been constant poster here ever since. I&#39;m liberal and left leaning just to get this out of the way first =)</p>

<p>That this subreddit is a bit more right leaning is pretty clear for most people but let me put this into some numbers for you.</p>

<p>Given the tag line:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our goals are a fairer, more transparent world and a better future for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think I can post stuff like this as I&#39;m not attacking anyone, just posting some facts that might interest the long time users here.</p>

<p>I analysed almost 4000 <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users for the past 2 months. I picked top posts and very low quality posts (small amount of upvotes). So I think I have a pretty good random sample of the users here. <strong>No data published here can be linked back to a username!</strong></p>

<p>Since the_donald has an insane banning policy, it makes it easier to track their posting habits. If anyone has  a good suggestion for a highly left leaning (or very neutral) sub I&#39;m all ears! (not r-politics as there are a large amount of the_donald posters there as well and I did try to clean the data but so far I have inconclusive results)  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at some stats:</p>

<h1>the_donald</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>From all users analysed who post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> <strong>71%</strong> have a positive comment score in the_donald</p></li>
<li><p>50% of all links posted here are from the_donald users.</p></li>
<li><p>The ratio between users with more than 30 posts in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and those below is around 80%. So 20% of the posters here are either new accounts or just not regulars. </p></li>
<li><p>The numbers are incredibly close when comparing the_donald and none_donald users: 81.76% vs 81.64% 
So if you see someone with a low <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> post count, there is a 50% chance it&#39;s a the_donald user.</p></li>
<li><p>A the_donald user is 1.5x more likely to be upvoted. </p></li>
<li><p>The word <em>shill</em> and <em>shills</em> within a comment is 1.5x more likely to come from a the_donald poster. (this most likely includes people denying being a shill)</p></li>
<li><p>I did the same test for the word <em>cuck</em> and <em>libtard</em>.  2.3x for <em>cuck</em> and surprisingly only 1.5x for <em>libtard</em>. But at least it is consistent =)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Given all these stats I can conclude a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The_donald users are more likely to comment than post links</p></li>
<li><p>Given the vast amount of reddit users compared to the_donald subscribers, the_donald users are over represented in this community</p></li>
<li><p>If there is brigading (as in commenting, not voting) going on, it&#39;s more likely to be from the_donald as 50% of all none active users have posted in the_donald</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>hillaryclinton</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>12% of the users who post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have a positive score in hillaryclinton</p></li>
<li><p>5% of all &quot;shill&quot; comments are from posters who posted in hillaryclinton.</p></li>
<li><p>compared to the 80% regular rate from before, hillaryclinton users are at 85% which means they post more regularly here than the average user. (or the other way around!)</p></li>
<li><p>hillaryclinon users post 2% of all links to this sub</p></li>
<li><p>hillaryclinton users barely use the word <em>shill</em> or <em>shills</em>. 5% of all shill occurences are in hillaryclinton user comments.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>enoughtrumpspam</h1>

<p>Up next!</p>

<p>I&#39;m open for critic and if someone wants any other analysis just ask. I have almost 10k user histories. If you want me to analyse a specific subreddit it will take almost 24hours to download a good sample size (60 requests per minute is the reddit API limit).</p>

<p>EDIT: I can upload all the meta data I have for those who want to check my results.</p>

<p>EDIT2: I queued up a few hillaryclinton users to analyse their behaviour. Let me get back to you guys with a more in depth analysis.</p>

<p>EDIT3: I&#39;ll be compiling a bit more detailed stats for a bigger meta post, this time including a few left leaning subs. This will take a while and since I don&#39;t want to spam this board with just stats I&#39;ll wait a week or so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The api is confusing at first (as they have a weird way of chaining comments) but overall quite easy to implement a simple request.</p>

<p>I programmed a small tool that downloads users, a single subreddit request in my tool can take ages as it finds +- 6000-7000 users in larger subreddits. A request can only return 100 comments/links at a time and since reddit stores up to 1k comments it can take easily 10 request per user + maybe 3-4 requests for their submission list.</p>

<p>I have to figure out a way to find comments that are past the 1000 comment history of a user since I&#39;d have to go by submitted links and those are even harder to sift through to specifically find a user. So much harder to analyse.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give it a go with what I have, maybe something turns up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a r/conspiracy user long before a The_Donald user. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had my account listed, RESed, harassed, vote manipulated, Pmed, banned from multiple subs:</p>

<p>I was banned from r/ama for trying to get an AMA with the person who exposed Hillary&#39;s server guy asking reddit for help.</p>

<p>From r/videos for posting a video explaining Pepe isn&#39;t racist. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just an r/conspiracy user that believe&#39;s the PTB want rampant globalism and hope for a better way. Meanwhile, there is $40 m fresh dollars for CTR, now named Shareblue. </p>

<p>They distort all news with prefab talking points, they vote empty articles to #1 on r/all, they keep negative Trump articles at the top and truthful ones find no airing.</p>

<p>When it was that the State Department staff &quot;resigned as a protest to Trump&quot;, #1.</p>

<p>The articles actually telling the truth, that Trump had told them they were out, it doesn&#39;t show up anywhere.</p>

<p>When Hillary&#39;s team birddogs Bernie supporters into attacking Trump supporters, the Trump supporters happen to always be forgotten.</p>

<p>Headline (Bernie Supporters): It wasn&#39;t us, it was Hillary&#39;s people!</p>

<p>But it was them, they just allowed themselves to get incited by Hillary&#39;s people. </p>

<p>And that was the thing that got me onto The_Donald.</p>

<p>You can post all the statistics you want, but the truth is, what your one-sided analysis failed to account for was how many r/conspiracy users became T_D users.</p>

<p>Near zero became r/hillaryclinton users.</p>

<p>Many conspiracy theorists hate Hillary Clinton (despite being dem voters their whole life)</p>

<p>and at the same time, Donald Trump appeals to conspiracy theorists interests with the lock her up rhetoric, the space exploration, the calling out mainstream media, etc.</p>

<p>The simplest conclusion to draw is that he appeals to the predominantly White, American, Male <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> user base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL fucking seriously. Any serious poster here is just rallying behind whoever we think is the most anti-establishment. If theres any indication of Trump being anti-establishment it was the incredible resistance from the establishment. We wanted Bernie, it was literally rigged against him, so we moved on to the next most r/conspiracy friendly candidate. For the moment whether ya like it or not, thats Trump. </p>

<p>As a Trump supporter for the exact reason I stated above, I am fully willing to denounce him if he ends up not doing shit with respect to dismantling the establishment. Thing is he is as of yet done nothing to dissapoint on that front, the establishment is running around in a blatant panic making wild accusations. </p>

<p>Also, this is the third post I&#39;ve seen in this sub from different users all presenting a similar set of data.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I take reservation to the &quot;talking in pedo code&quot; which is really, really forced in my opinion, but I&#39;ll ignore that to focus on this part instead. How can you say that with a straight face when what Trump had to say about Epstein (long before he was a presidential hopeful, so let&#39;s not pretend this was some fake news to slander him):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it - Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can you read this, now knowing what you know about Epstein, and not think this is incredibly creepy and most likely a blatant admission by Trump that, at the very least, he knew what he was up to and didn&#39;t care? How is this less of a red flag than &quot;playing dominos on pizza&quot;, especially when put together with all the other red flags?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotta agree 100%.  OP is just trying to further the divide and make the sub look like a partisan playground when it&#39;s not.  A lot of people here simply see Clinton as a long time political establishment insider, infinitely worse in this respect than Trump.  When given the choice between TPTB and an outsider, the conspiracy minded or aware people will choose the latter.  Even Sanders would&#39;ve been a better choice than Clinton to most of us.   It&#39;s not about red vs. blue, dem vs. rep, it&#39;s about blatant ongoing levels of corruption over decades if not millennia, seeing through the bullshit, and choosing the best options going forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HRC lists Kissinger as one of her heroes. This isn&#39;t about right or left, this is about failed, terror-increasing international policy and endless war for profit versus admittedly odious but at least isolationist nationalism. It&#39;s no surprise that r/conspiracy folks were lining up behind any opponent of Hillary considering the expansion and empowerment of the deep state under her boss, Obama&#39;s administration, and the continuation of the dystopian drone <em>Terminator</em>-style state that her regime would have included.</p>

<p>In my lifetime, I&#39;ve seen the DNC go from serving the people to exploiting and denigrating them. Even as most big unions got co-opted in the 80&#39;s be corporate culture, eventually mirroring their power structure and pay-for-play values, the DNC saw what worked for the dirty tricksters of the statist RNC and have aped their methods as well as their international agenda. Now we&#39;re entering an era where the DNC has moved to Tea-Party tactics, NPR is hosting <em>They Live</em>-esque apologists like Raj Patel, who talks openly of &quot;redefining Democracy&quot;. Well, Patel you Orwellian fuck, I guess the advantage of redefining Democracy is that even if everyone else disagrees with you, you can simply &#39;redefine&#39; them as irrelevant because Democracy is only what you say it is. Which, I am willing to bet, looks a lot like an Oligarchy led by bookish center-left university types such as yourself.</p>

<p>The people in this sub, like myself and u/CitationDependent here, are too woke to fall for partisan hackery. We know that the real enemies of freedom wear different colored shirts, the way you can tell who they are by the number of zeros in their bank accounts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll post the same reply I posted 5 days ago by a user with a strikingly similar story to yours...</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry. But are we only allowed to follow and post in one subreddit? I must have missed that rule. </p>

<p>I do understand the conclusions you are trying to draw with the correlation between PG posts and t_d users, but I think it&#39;s unfair to try to say these posters are illegitimate or have a hidden agenda to push</p>

<p>Yes I post in t_d, sometimes frequently. I went from trolling them, to blocking them, to joining them as a show of solidarity in under a year and a half; after seeing the censorship and measures taken by admins to suppress the sub and it&#39;s users instead of the manufactured astrofturfing that is plaguing this site. The front page is nothing but a smear rag mouthpiece for the left any more. After the Orlando shooting and Reddit&#39;s attempts to suppress any information, that was a major turning point. I started to use t_d for breaking news then supplementing their sources with sources I trust. I haven&#39;t been let down since.</p>

<p>Not to mention, I always enjoy some good shitposting. That place is great for it. &quot;
&quot;</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m curious why this agenda is being pushed across reddit. This is the third post I&#39;ve seen in a week. </p>

<p>To say that there isn&#39;t a hive mind in action would be silly on my part, but the are people of many races, genders, and sexuality that use the sub; many of which despise the alt-right. Despite the false equivalency that has been recently pushed that:</p>

<p>Trump supporters/t_d posters = alt-right = nazi</p>

<p>I apologize if I&#39;m wrong, but I feel like that&#39;s the attempt being made with these posts in regard to people who post in both subs. I&#39;m beginning to believe that the idea is to take the conspiracies that t_d users believe and paint them as alt-right conspiracies. Therefore discrediting them and turning others away from paying any attention.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s what OP is trying to get at. If you&#39;re willing to post things on t_d that will get you upvotes then you&#39;re fitting in with their circlejerk mentality, even if you aren&#39;t a Trump supporter. There&#39;s not necessarily anything wrong with it, but it does begin to paint a picture of what type of person you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very interesting analysis and kind of makes me want to do some myself (for fun). I would add this anecdote about the high correlation between this sub and <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>.</p>

<p>I am a moderate in almost every sense when it comes to political affiliation. Some issues I lean a little right, some issues I lean a little left. I was occasionally on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> until the wikileaks emails dropped right before the election. I have followed wikileaks for years and going to their sub for the leaks lead me to <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> (all the new drops were no longer being posted in the wikileaks sub, just the donald). I now frequently go to the donald subreddit, and this one because I&#39;m looking for updates on the recent leaks and because it is obvious to me that the rest of reddit is very left leaning, so much so that I don&#39;t believe they represent the facts in an honest way most of the time (a lot of people feel this way).</p>

<p>I think the fact that the most recent leaks exposed the DNC candidate is also why you see a lot of right leaning users in this sub right now. The current conspiracies are linked to these documents and the DNC, and the left is basically ignoring all the evidence. I think it&#39;s also true that a lot of naturally curious people (conspiracy theorists) enjoy popping into subs that offer a different viewpoint than what is provided on r/all. I think you have people who started here and ended up at the_donald, and vice versa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am after the truth. If it takes down a bunch of Republicans then great, If it takes down a bunch of Democrats then great. As long as guilty people get the justice they deserve I am going to be happy with the result. A lot of moderates are watching the left lose their minds over Donald Trump and are getting frustrated. In truth, he&#39;s been in office for about two weeks and liberals have examined every move he makes with a microscope and attempted to spin it to fit a narrative. Calling his followers &quot;Nazi&#39;s&quot; is completely ridiculous and 
 offensive to people who had to deal with actual Nazi&#39;s. It&#39;s all exaggeration and desperate attempts to smear his character and they don&#39;t care about what information is true. I&#39;m honestly not the biggest fan of trump, but he&#39;s not a fucking Nazi. He&#39;s not a white supremacist (can&#39;t believe I even have to say that). He&#39;s got a million legitimate things you could criticize him for but instead of focusing on real issues they go for the stuff that makes a better headline and most of the time isn&#39;t based in much, if any, truth. It doesn&#39;t help that a lot of media outlets are fueling this with garbage journalism (on both sides).</p>

<p>Good stuff.</p>

<p>One thing to note about the_donald is like others are saying here, I was a member of r/conspiracy before r/the_donald. I joined the sub for two main reasons</p>

<p>1 - following along with the election
2 - it was creating a big buzz on reddit, and to be honest, reading through the threads and the insane number of inside jokes and memes just reminded me old reddit. It&#39;s like reddit at weird hours of the morning, it feels like normal again, comment threads are funny, almost as if everyone who is manipulating the site has gone home from work for the day.</p>

<p>With the downfall of r/politics, is knowing the massive amount of media manipulation present, I thought it was refreshing to see that thing rise up and become the powerhouse of a sub it is now.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t agree with everything they post, for all of us following r/conspiracy for a while this is an extremely crazy time. So many conspiracies feel like they are on the verge of being busted wide open, and while trump might be appealing more to the conspiracy side in us than obama, it is really no different (obama will bring change, he&#39;ll be different from bush -- trump is an outsider, he will bring change, he&#39;ll be different from obama!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Decent post, but you should keep in mind that this sub lost many users as a result of the U.S. presidential campaign. I used to be a regular poster here but couldn&#39;t take what was happening here during the campaign. I&#39;m left-leaning too, but the campaign clogged the sub and it was pretty much useless to me for the past year. </p>

<p>Worth noting too that it is a normal state for many of us &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; to be extremely suspicious of the Clintons, if not downright hostile, regardless of political leanings. Same applies to Bushes.</p>

<p>Trump as a perceived outlier running against the establishment Clinton made this sub a natural fit for some Trump supporters, to this sub&#39;s detriment I might add.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say your data and accompanying analysis is probably valid, but only for the past year. Things change here pretty quickly, especially when overrun with shills. </p>

<p>Each of them gets a JSON formatted response, get any cheap JSON library and you can parse that to your own data structure. I then simply store the combined JSON. Since JSON is so verbose I also zip the files before storing. It takes slightly longer to load them all but I already have 1.8GB of data (+verbose json) so it&#39;s well worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you lived in any other country, it would be obvious that some sort of social upheaval was taking place - maybe a revolution. I guess it&#39;s because no &#39;authority figures&#39; have acknowledged this that people can&#39;t really be expected to notice. The signs were clear, Bernie Sanders support and early Trump support. It was clear that Bernie Sanders in particular was enjoying popularity as an <em>alternative</em> choice and so was Trump to a lesser extent. I should probably spend a few more sentences to hammer home the discontent in the country, the disillusionment with the political correctness, black lives matter, the vapid elitism behind the left&#39;s pandering to only minorities while the country burns, while the middle east continues to burn. People simply aren&#39;t buying it anymore. The left has been promising a &#39;soft&#39; revolution for too long - change with out disrupting the status quo. The demise of the country, the demise of the working class should be obvious, but the left remains clueless.</p>

<p>Trump is just a symbol of discontent. Many people wanted to vote for Bernie but Mrs. Satan did not allow that to happen. So Trump becomes the de facto choice of sanity. The majority are mad and they are trying to tear down the system. So particularly to paint the Donald as some sort of shitty rise of fascism is highly dubious. It&#39;s called being out of touch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m left leaning as well (Bernie supporter), but your carefully researched data is undermined by your hasty conclusion, which seems Establishment Left.</p>

<p>The left used to have the truth and facts on their side (i. e., when W was president).  Then they became the establishment and showed W was mild, and now the Establishment Left has taken on new roles--terrorists, fascists, and bullies.  </p>

<p>The true left is tolerant of all people, regardless of race, creed, color, or opinions.  Being tolerant ends when actual violence or actual oppression is introduced.  Enforced Sharia Law is both of those things.      </p>

<p>A peaceful law abiding Muslim who does not enforce sharia law is welcome by the left.  However, being tolerant of unapologetic rapists and women beaters has never been a value of the left.  Shutting down freedom of speech is not a left value. </p>

<p>The Establishment Left pretends like Sharia Law doesn&#39;t exist or worse that it&#39;s cool to normalize.  It seems they are unable to use any fact based argument, and it&#39;s obvious when you watch them debate against Ben Shapiro, Milo, Gavin M, or even Richard Spencer (sad but true, Spencer is even winning debate against Establishment Left).  </p>

<p>So my point is you are not factoring in the above as well as the fact that there&#39;s a well established Clinton body count conspiracy.  Then add in the biggest actual conspiracy right now--the media&#39;s attack on Trump, including clear highjacking of t_d. </p>

<p>TL; DR - I disagree</p>

<p>I maybe have to adjust my algorithm to &quot;detect&quot; the_donald users. As I think I have a comment in there somewhere as well but it got deleted thus I&#39;m by my own definition not a the_donald user.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But isn&#39;t the_donald the same? Haven&#39;t seen a single critique on the_donald about trump.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good comparison IMO but the sample size of hillary clinton users is really small makes the results a lot less reliable. the error margins alone are a significantly larger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just got banned from TD for pointing out that the Trump administration report proving presidential precedence for immigration bans was bullshit.</p>

<p>(If you read the report, you&#39;ll see that all of the bans were for known or suspected criminals (mostly terrorist or uprising members). The only blanket ban on the list was against Cuba which...  if that&#39;s the precedent then why are we surprised that people are protesting and upset?)</p>

<p>TD doesn&#39;t care about reality. They don&#39;t even listen to what their own administration is saying. They read headlines and share memes and suck Donald&#39;s dick.</p>
