    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I agree. All insurance is is a bet that you won&#39;t need it.  When you do, they think they need to adjust the odds so that bet is in more favor of the &quot;house&quot;.  But in general it&#39;s just like any casino. The odds are already stacked against the player.  I don&#39;t gamble but this is how I&#39;ve always viewed insurance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surely it wouldn&#39;t cost them very much to use their purchasing power to negotiate a good deal with a couple national gyms for their customers&#39; use. Would likely increase the amount of people exercising, and thereby lower costs. No need to fully subsidize the price, just negotiate a lower price for members. </p>

<p>I also question why this isn&#39;t the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Americans don&#39;t practice &quot;preventive&quot; medicine. We live lives designed to rush us off to work with only fast food for breakfast. lunch  and most dinners that promise us unhealthy states.  Our 8 hour, 5 day a week jobs are designed to wear us down and with tv waiting to mind numb us til bedtime.  In America, you have to WORK to stay healthy. It takes time and energy and money to stay healthy. Most people can&#39;t afford the costs, don&#39;t have the energy or the time and most of all, many don&#39;t have the understanding of what the American lifestyle does to health.  With dietary choices like &quot;low fat&quot; (high sugar) and no added sugar (high alt) many are lied to and can&#39;t make healthy decisions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m aware of what health insurance is... but expecting an insurance company to &quot;care about you&quot; is just a little bit juvenile. Going to the gym is a recreational activity, not comparable to medical procedures and prescription drugs.</p>
