       Easy. Insurance never really wants to provide anything.  They exist on the fact that profit is NOT providing a service.  Greed at it's finest. Not that that's right, it's just how it is.

       Yeah, I agree. All insurance is is a bet that you won't need it.  When you do, they think they need to adjust the odds so that bet is in more favor of the "house".  But in general it's just like any casino. The odds are already stacked against the player.  I don't gamble but this is how I've always viewed insurance.

       Surely it wouldn't cost them very much to use their purchasing power to negotiate a good deal with a couple national gyms for their customers' use. Would likely increase the amount of people exercising, and thereby lower costs. No need to fully subsidize the price, just negotiate a lower price for members.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also question why this isn't the case.

       Because Americans don't practice "preventive" medicine. We live lives designed to rush us off to work with only fast food for breakfast. lunch  and most dinners that promise us unhealthy states.  Our 8 hour, 5 day a week jobs are designed to wear us down and with tv waiting to mind numb us til bedtime.  In America, you have to WORK to stay healthy. It takes time and energy and money to stay healthy. Most people can't afford the costs, don't have the energy or the time and most of all, many don't have the understanding of what the American lifestyle does to health.  With dietary choices like "low fat" (high sugar) and no added sugar (high alt) many are lied to and can't make healthy decisions.

       I totally and completely get what you're saying. But for a gym that is $10/month - and you use it - you will become more productive at work and make more money. I get it man, it's incentives though. Fuckin' insurance corporations wouldn't even want that.

       Food ads claim "Eat like a man" and offer triple cheeseburgers. fried potatoes, sugar drinks... good, fast and cheap. But deadly. We allow people to get to 500 pounds and THEN do surgury on their stomach, treat their weight induced diabetes with meds, prescribe pills for their other ails.... pills do not cure.

       Those $10 gym memberships sell because lazy people buy them and don't go.  If people used their $10 memberships, lines for treadmills would be excessive.

       Think about it, not many demographics of Americans work hard to stay healthy.  It is a minority.

       that would require them either to pay for the cost of membership, which they would pass that cost on to the insuree anyways or they would own the gym and exact more control on you or the gyms would be absorbed nationally, which is the equivalent of nationalizing all the fast food franchises in the world, many different owners.

       Yes, I'm aware of what health insurance is... but expecting an insurance company to "care about you" is just a little bit juvenile. Going to the gym is a recreational activity, not comparable to medical procedures and prescription drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not 80, i'm just old enough to know that sitting around wishing major corporations would "care about you" is childish and will result in nothing but disappointment.

       You could always go take a walk.  If you don't have the time to walk then invest in a standing desk.  Or a large exercise ball instead of a chair.  Or take your bike out on weekends.  Or at the very least, see if you can do a daily routine of 10 body squats, 10 pushups, 10 situps, and hold a plank for 30 seconds.

       If you really want to stay healthy just go for a run once or twice a week. It doesn't have to be a mile. The important thing is to just run no matter how fast or how far.

       Some insurances (mostly for hospital workers) have shitty programs that allow you to take a class or two a week at a local gym, and some university's programs (for faculty) provide gym memberships under a certain price point for non-university gyms.  For the most part you are correct, though.
