       I've been thinking about this for the last couple of days. Because I know if the arrests are coming I'm going to call in, get fucking wasted and scream on every social network "fuck you" to all my liberal friends, especially the ones that shamed me for not voting for Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I thought, oh fuck what if they do a pizzagate switcharoo and label it as an alt right thing. Honestly I could see it happening, the MSM comparing it to what hitler did or whatever. I know I will stand my ground and be sure to shame every kiddy fucker apologist to hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people probably have one last trick up their sleeve, I'm thinking it's not going to matter/be effective. They went so hard with the Russian hacking and pissgate but no one thinks about it anymore.

       I think Kristallnacht is likely the wrong German inspired meme, I'm not entirely sure it is anything, but it would likely be framed as a Night of the Long Knives.  Political enemies within and without your party arrested and given secretive trials.

       If there's been one theme with Trump, it has to be his enemies taking shots and ending up shooting themselves in the foot. Literally NOTHING anyone has tried has worked. The grab em by the pussy thing helped him and he reframed it to call Bill Clinton a rapist. I suspect there will be (basically) undeniable evidence, weather it be WikiLeaks releasing something on top of people getting arrested, project veritas showing some CNN bs...Etc. And whatever move "they/ptb" try will be the final nail in their coffin.

       I guaran-fucking-tee you people will say Trump is a dictator, that there is no evidence and that he is pulling a coup. This kind of thing could spark civil unrest. It could cause globalists to play all their cards. What I do like is that this is being precursed by low level pedo ring busts.

       I just treat them as sociopaths and never contact ever again.  Even if they aren't directly an ingroup globalist psychopath keyed into the agenda, they are sociopaths by being so willfully, obstinately resistant to new information that is emminently available to them, that they are effectively inculcated into a cult of fact-free ideology.  This makes them as absolutely dangerous, toxic to your future in their judgements and decision-making, that they are going to end up harming you and your families later on down the line.  It's best to cut your losses, and find friends that willing to listen and debate using logic, rhetoric and reason, despite their ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to be clear: I'm not talking about labelling a person a sociopath because you disagree with them; or because you're a conservative and don't like liberals.  I'm talking about this dangerous new breed of person.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking about labelling someone a sociopath because they are caught in the event horizon of infinite ignorance from which they not only can't escape, they won't even try, they won't learn, they won't show any effort to knowing actual historical facts.  Nationalistic, authoritarian, anti-sense, anti-intellectual liberals who think ends justify the means, and that social justice is more important than criminal justice, when in fact they are equally important.
      </p>
      <p>
       They just want to cry and blamethrow and make everyone aroudn them wrong, and that behavior is a very dangerous social disorder which can only be remedied by shunning and blackballing.  They'll be fine though.  Clearly the Soros'es of the world have infinite amounts of money to corrupt our youth in this way--and don't think you can "save them"--they're already gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like in lifeguarding, if you see someone kicking around and flailing in the water, you let them go under and basically drown, then pull them ashore and administer mouth to mouth, otherwise they'll take you down with them and you both die. It's a tough call, but it's the right one.  After all, it's these sociopaths that put themselves ever-willingly into the deep end of this mess, by not communicating properly and falling for each and every confidence game of the globalist elites, encumbrancing them with layers of illusion and delusion of media brainwashing, for years.  It's their fault they didn't question a damned thing at all.  Don't blame the game blame the lemming.

       This was worded really well. I'm also glad that someone out there shares some thoughts and feelings that I've had.
      </p>
      <p>
       I usually keep my mouth shut because people are very quick to throw shade and accuse someone else of hatred or ignorance. Still trying to find my own voice in a culture that seems to have lost the ability of critical thinking. Thank you for sharing this insight!

       Just lost a best friend of 8 years because of this. He just deflects anytime I bring up something too fringe for his taste. It finally came to a head and I ask him why he's so proud of the fact that he willingly accepts everything the media tells him to. He laughs and says "I guess I am a little proud of it. I've got differnet plans for myself.". Instantly think sociopath and how I can never trust him again.

       They'll spin it as a coup. This is what happens. It happened right here, in Brazil, where our president was democratically and legally impeached, following all of the legal steps.
      </p>
      <p>
       And stupid people were out on the streets saying they didn't vote for the VP, which replaced the president. The stupidity goes far.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm most scared is of false flags. You want to get Trump impeached? Use a false flag and frame Trump for it. It would fit the general conspiracy narrative. The MSN would say that Trump is so delusional he orchestrated a false flag to prove his points. It would be done in a matter of days.

       I would urge everyone to act with integrity and calmness if (when hopefully) this is the case. MSM MAY continue to spew lies. I certainly hope not, but it's entirely possible. If this is the case then your lib/SJW flower friends will probably continue to adhere to MSM's story either out of shame or stupidity. But if you calmly and intelligently approach them, maybe you can bring them around (if they don't fall in the utterly stupid category). If you scream at them, you alienate them and add to this divisive rhetoric that's become such a huge problem. If this blows up... be the bigger person, guys. It benefits everyone.

       The video editing tech exists to manufacture these kinds of videos, and that scares me. The pedos at the top might be saying "if you expose us, we can make footage that will implicate you in the whole thing as well. If you deny it as fake, we deny everything else as fake."

       It has to be at this point. Especially for the higher ranking officials. Hopefully when they get a few low ends of the totem pole, they'll crack and give people up. If this comes out, hopefully backed by evidence, there will be too many people demanding for televised trials. And they'll want them done quickly. Hopefully there's enough evidence to go to trial almost immediately, not let them sit around for a year.

       Honestly, it will be out of control. Trump will be compared to Hitler/Stalin for rounding them up. Riots will likely take place. I can already see it now "Trump is arresting his political opponents just like Hitler and Stalin did!!" MSM will be spinning it against Trump, also pushing the dictator narrative. I don't think Hillary (and the others) will go willingly and I sort of have been playing with the thought that she will do something similar to what Cersei Lannister did at the end of the last GoT season. Think about it. There is nothing they will not do, everything is on the line.

       I was going to post this, but you said it well.  The only way around it is for evidence to leak, showing awfulness.  That alone will turn riots against trump to riots against pedo.

       Expect for pedo loyalists within the system to sabotage the internet or the power grid. They will have to shut communication down to keep the leaked evidence from getting out. Also expect a mountain of fake evidence to come out showing their enemies as pedo's instead of them. These people will not go down without a massive fight. They will pull out every dirty trick in the book. I would also expect hits to be put out against Trump and any one close to him. It's going to get bad.

       It's heavily rumored that as soon as Jeff Sessions gets through the Senate and gets sworn in he's going to bring the hammer down on the massive pedo pizza gate ring. Maybe it will happen, maybe not. The question is, if this actually happens, how will MSM and the occult fight back.

       It should be noted that this rumor is based on literally zero real evidence and is bolstered entirely by people repeating things like, "just wait to ol Jeffie get in there," and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, when he is confirmed and no arrests happen, the narrative will simply shift to accommodate this, and the next rumor will be bolstered again.

       Well, I would think they may want to wait until the Supreme Court nominee gets confirmed as well. Any court case is likely to end up there and they don't want to fight it while it's sitting at 4-4.

       Except there is not going to be CP on any of their computers. What they will have is video and/or picture of the actual suspects caught in the act. No on is going to get accused of looking at CP. They are going to get accused to raping and murdering children.

       I think it depends on how many people get taken down. If it's just a few and no "high profile" people, it can be buried or spun very easily. But if it really is dozens of very high profile people I don't know how they can get out of it. It will be the biggest scandal in American political history.

       I've been wondering. Would it be better to start slow and take down one or two nobody's, and slowly turn up the heat of the investigation. Or to grab everyone at once to keep anyone from running or destroying evidence.

       I don't think the MSM will make any announcement whatsoever, be it arrests for the Clintons or the Queen of England.  The media doesn't want to undermine the public's faith in democratic institutions or hurt their national pride, which would hurt economies.  Trials are likely to be kept private and hidden.

       They could have gotten away with that a few years ago. Now half of everyone uses the alternative media which will be covering it like crazy. The MSM will have no choice but to cover it, if only to defend the occused.

       Jim stone insists that the day Hillary almost fainted at the 9-11 memorial and was "chucked into the side of a van" (as the_donald puts it) was actually video of her arrest. That she was cuffed and needed help getting in the van because the handcuffs.

       I'd expect arrests like that to be hidden for as much time as possible. No one's seem Huma abedin after her husband got busted there was a few clips of her out and about but crying, then nothing. Was she arrested?

       Well, I would think they may want to wait until the Supreme Court nominee gets confirmed as well. Any court case is likely to end up there and they don't want to fight it while it's sitting at 4-4.
