<p>Most top comments have either of the following message, or both: Pizzagate is false because it only attacks Democrats (wrong), or they dismiss it by saying it has no facts to support it and the Russian connection is what we SHOULD be focusing on.  </p>

<p>How could it have possibly have gotten to the top of the sub if it has no support?  I don&#39;t think for a second that r/conspiracy has enough regulars over the course of 12 hours to break several thousand down votes.</p>

<p>Regardless of the topic (well, if it isn&#39;t super anti-trump for some reason) it will get absolutely sacked in the comments (and regulars will get their comments buried) yet still hold 800-1k+ upvotes.</p>

<p>no idea what its about, feels like its due to visitors from /all whom dont seem to understand that this is a CONSPIRACY sub where we talk about strange stuff that sometimes has correlations and is about being skeptical and talking about the topics.</p>

<p>If anything, theres currently a conspiracy that anything that reaches /all will get brigaded by high-traffic users on other subs, &quot;spoiling&quot; any discussion in the comments due to them being &#39;un-skeptical&#39; about these sort of topics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s Russian shills upvoting pizzagate and other stories to distract from Trump scandals. They&#39;ve been doing it for months now. Notice how the second top post on the front page, posted shortly after the &quot;Breaking report&quot; one, is a generic anti-CTR post with nearly 500 upvotes? This is their top strategy for hiding themselves. Keep the sub focused only on CTR and it gives the Russian shills free reign to manipulate this place as they wish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hundreds of unsubstantiated comments everyday in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> claiming CTR, American Bridge, David Brock etc are shilling in this subreddit, and the mods don&#39;t react. I make one comment mentioning the possibility of Russian shills and suddenly you&#39;re rushing in here to label it &quot;utter shit&quot; and threatening to ban me? You couldn&#39;t have proved my point better if you tried.</p>

<p>Why the double standard? Why was the Trump-Russia story from a couple of weeks ago immediately tagged as &quot;unverified&quot; and then deleted, but the Clinton fleeing the country story on the top of the front page now hasn&#39;t even been tagged? It&#39;s equally unverified, the sole source seems to be a supermarket tabloid.</p>

<p>Are all the mods controlled by the Kremlin, or are you all just heavily biased for Trump on your own?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They frequently accuse the mods of default subreddits and the reddit admins of being part of the shills. Yet another double standard. Why are only the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods unquestionable?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>of course it&#39;s their right, but it&#39;s not right that they act on that bias in their moderating actions. Is it so unreasonable to want fair and consistent moderation? I see you dodged my question about why stories negative to Trump are immediately tagged as &quot;unverified&quot;, &quot;hoax&quot;, etc, and often deleted, while anything anti-Clinton is allowed to run free no matter how much nonsense it is. Certain mods are clearly trying to shape this subreddit into a pro-Trump safe space.</p>

<p>I made a post about how hypocritical it was for it to be removed considering most of the top posts of all time on this sub have hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and have been critical of the left.</p>

<p>My post was hidden, still is I&#39;m pretty sure. I&#39;ve got video, that if I&#39;d get off my lazy ass and upload, proves it. I also sent 2 mod mails within 3 days of my post being hidden and I never received a single response back.</p>
