    <div class="md"><p>I had seen conflicted reports as well, some as early as 2006. Petrodollars were devised by Kissinger in the 1970&#39;s to create artificially high demands for the USD after Nixon abandoned gold backed money. Any country that want to buy oil had to use US dollars. The saudis were the first to join on, in exchange for military protection and weapons sales. Soon, other OPEAC countries signed on as well. </p>

<p>As these oil producing copies drop the Petrodollar, demand for USD drops majorly, and could result in massive inflation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We increasingly don&#39;t need the petrodollar to ensure that we can get enough fuel; we&#39;re a net exporter of energy now, and thanks to the fracking boom and recent natural-gas strikes we&#39;ve got enough fossil fuel for a very long time. (We&#39;re also using more renewables these days; many utilities are building solar plants to shelter themselves from price shocks in oil and gas!)</p>

<p>However: instability in Saudi Arabia would still be very bad; if the KSA fell, we&#39;d probably get something like ISIS but much bigger in their place. They&#39;d have excellent vantage points from which to pirate major shipping lanes; and while the US doesn&#39;t really need Saudi oil as much anymore, the world certainly still does.</p>

<p>Instability in the US, if that&#39;s what you mean, would also be really bad -- I can&#39;t disagree with that!</p>

And it&#39;s really, really hard to govern Libya. Believe me, you need me here. If you get rid of me, you pop that cork, and refugees will flood Europe. Mark my words.</em></p>

It&#39;s not just about the US trying to &quot;contain&quot; Russia and China, the EU too. The timing also with the collapse of oil prices so now it wouldn&#39;t be a factor in what currency countries sell their oil, but the last part is just speculation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think in terms of Sunni vs Shiite all will become clear.</p>

<p>Also Iran supports Hezbollah so the Jewish lobby which seems to have Trumps arm up his back are not big fans.</p>

<p>Also Michael Flynn is a big proponent of war with Iran on an ideological basis. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Flynn they are part of the &quot;alliance&quot;</p>

<p>Flynn divides the world into two sets of enemies. First, there are the radical Islamists, whom he sees as America’s principal foes. Then there is a constellation of hostile anti-democratic regimes that he calls “the alliance” that includes both Islamists and non-Islamists that collaborate against the West because we’re their common enemy. The alliance includes Russia, Syria, North Korea, China, Iran, Cuba, Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Perhaps the book contradicts itself once in a while because the neoconservative Michael Ledeen co-wrote it.  Maybe the differing worldviews of the two authors come through in different passages on different pages. Or perhaps Flynn is just ideologically flexible. It’s hard to say. Mostly he comes across as a Jacksonian who wishes to wage total war against his enemies.</p>

<p>He wrote a chapter on how to win such a war against radical Islamist terrorists, but first he describes what winning means—destroying terrorist armies, discrediting their ideology, forging new global alliances and “bringing a direct challenge to the regimes that support our enemies, weakening them at a minimum, bringing them down whenever possible.”</p>

<p>I know [our enemies],” he writes, “and they scare me, a guy who doesn’t scare often or easily. They scare me even though we have defeated them every time we fought seriously. We defeated Al Qaeda and the Iranians in Iraq, and the Taliban and their allies in Afghanistan. Nonetheless, they kept fighting and we went away. Let’s face it: right now, we’re losing, and I’m talking about a very big war, not just Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan.” [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p>In Flynn’s view, the war against terrorism is enormous. He makes Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld seem cautious and even timid. He says we know how to win this kind of war because we did it during World War II and the Cold War.</p>

<p>He recommends we do four things.</p>

<p>“First, we have to energize every element of national power in a cohesive synchronized manner—similar to the effort during World War II or the Cold War—to effectively resource what will likely be a multigenerational struggle…Second, we must engage the violent Islamists wherever they are, drive them from their safe havens, and kill them or capture them…Third, we must decisively confront the state and nonstate supporters of this violent Islamist ideology and compel them to end their support to our enemies or be prepared to remove their capacity to do so…Fourth, we must wage ideological war against radical Islam and its supporters.”</p>

<p>Most Americans mistakenly believe that peace is the normal condition of mankind,” Flynn writes, “while war is some weird aberration. Actually, it’s the other way around. Most of human history has to do with war, and preparations for the next one. But we Americans do not prepare for the next war, are invariably surprised when it erupts, and since we did not take prudent steps when it would have been relatively simple to prevail, usually end up fighting on our enemies’ more difficult and costly terms.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What Flynn seems to have forgotten is that by far the biggest source of funding for islamic extremism comes from american allies in the persian gulf. Some parts of the republican establishment acknowledge that parts of the kingdom like the bin ladi construction firm is heavy financers of terrorism while still supporting the horrible regime. </p>

<p>Not true. At all. Iran funds the Houthis in Yemen / Saudi Arabia, they provide funding and logistical support to Assad&#39;s Syrian Army, they created and support Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran created suicide bombing in the late 70&#39;s. They&#39;re always categorized as the leading state sponsor of terrorism, including by Obama&#39;s State Department, which was well before Trump.</p>

<p>On top of that, Iran is Israel&#39;s number 1 enemy. Iran backed Assad because Syria is Iran&#39;s &quot;through point&quot; to provide logistical support to Lebanon. If Assad was forced to step down, and we replaced him with a leader that works with Israel (like Saudi Arabia, which was funding ISIS to help overthrow Assad for Israel&#39;s benefit), then Iran would have no practical ability to help Lebanon, since their supply chain through Syria would&#39;ve been cut off.</p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t hear about Iran very often doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re innocent and not involved in all these conflicts.</p>

<p>I know all about these, and I still say that they&#39;re better than the Saudis and the US and keep to themselves. Let there be no mistake. US is the number 1 terrorist backer and number 1 terrorist country. It arms terrorists all over the world to take down governments, and bombs whatever their terrorists can not finish. At other times, they like to pay off generals and mass murder millions.</p>

<p>The &quot;conflicts&quot; that Iran is involved in, are very limited and confined to a region. The US, however, terrorises the globe. From independence till this very day. It&#39;s bloody rich and laughable that US is the one calling Iran out.</p>

<p>Ah, I see. You meant credited.</p>

<p>You seem to lack the sense of scale.</p>

<p>Saudi backed terrorists are literally everywhere on the planet, funded by the US. While Iranian ones are highly limited. And lets not forget that the prominent MEK/MKO group is actually working together with Israel and the US dropped it from the terrorist list because they paid the politicians money and kill Iranian scientists.</p>

<p>And please stop trying to redefine each term or phrase I use. It&#39;s an unnecessary distinction (and not worth quibbling over) whether Iran &quot;created&quot; suicide bombing or &quot;inspired&quot; it&#39;s use in Islam. It&#39;s an unimportant distinction whether or not Iran provided logistical support or special forces to Syria.</p>

<p>Every one of your critiques reinforces my points while commenting on my choice of words and changing the subject back to the US. You&#39;re just arguing with yourself. It&#39;s pointless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israeli expansion is not perfect.  In fact imperialism is not an acceptable means for any country.  My stance is on the history books from both sides.  Israel has been raided and hit with imperialism several times over.  In fact, Persia (Iran), helped the Israelites exodus them back to their country after they has been take away from it.</p>

<p>Rome took over their country.  They also lost their country to several arab invasions, especially post and pre-crusades.  You will not find any history book in an arab country saying the land was <strong>always</strong> inhabitant by an arab nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To anyone who who voted for Gary Johnson over Jill Stein....face palm.
Read policies!
Johnson is a pro-TPP Koch brothers shill.
And IMO, right wing libertarians are extreme
and basically just rich people who don&#39;t want to pay taxes for the peasants that made them rich in the first place
or deregulates their business of ethical conduct/product safety regulations or whatever agenda that benefits them selfishly at our expense.</p>

<p>Left wing, moderate libertarians are much better than extreme right wing moderate libertarians IMO.
I.e. Jill Stein was moderately libertarian.
Please everyone, don&#39;t rush into a candidate because they wield
the term libertarian....
I believe there should be a mix of libertarian and authoritarian.
Hence moderate libertarianism is pretty good.</p>

<p>Jill Stein vs Gary Johnson:
(NOTE: most political spectrums are approximate and semi-subjective
but you can usually tell if one is extremely off, these ones seem at least mostly correct)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would disagree with your assumption that all &quot;right-wing&quot; libertarians are greedy and just in it for themselves. Ron Paul is not wealthy in any way, and from everything I have seen of him, genuinely just cares about freedom and liberty for all people. I would encourage you to check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkJ1N-7g9Q6n7KnriGit-Ig/videos">RonPaulLibertyReport.</a></p>

<p>As for Jill Stein, I really don&#39;t know much about her. I tend to avoid leftists in general because of their identity politics and authoritarian tendencies, but maybe this wasn&#39;t the correct assessment of Stein.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have some misunderstandings of leftism.
Bernie was between libertarian and authoritarian while Jill Stein was slightly more libertarian than Bernie.
Neither of them have authoritarian tendencies.
I would think most modern leftists side more with libertarian or 
&quot;the border between libertarian and authoritarian&quot; rather than near-communist style authoritarianism.
Some (but not too much) authoritarianism is necessary as full freedom (anarchy and near-anarchy) becomes a paradox and you get oppression from criminals and corporations having the freedom to take the freedom of others away, e.g. TPP, lack of regulations in full on free market capitalism, Monsanto providing a false narrative on GMOs with deliberately compromized science research, lack of labeling for what foods contain GMO contents would mean freedom for the company but lack of freedom for us consumers who want to know what we&#39;re eating/buying, etc.</p>

<p>The authoritarian feature belongs to the NEOcons like those in the two party system like Clinton, Obama, Bush, Cruz, Romney, Rubio, etc.</p>

<p>Also, I would say that identity politics is a product of the establishment and corporate media which are both inheritently very right wing and very authoritarian.
They want us to stereotype people into their controlled two party system
and have us fight each other constantly.</p>

<p>Now, there may be a chance that very moderate right wing, (almost centrist) moderate libertarians might not be that bad, I can&#39;t say for sure, I haven&#39;t seen any.
But Ron Paul is an extreme right winger and moderate libertarian.
The former is the real problem, his economics.</p>

<p><a href="http://oi41.tinypic.com/ay7mn7.jpg">http://oi41.tinypic.com/ay7mn7.jpg</a></p>

<p>I would say tread with caution when getting excited about someone like Ron Paul.
I sincerely believe he is a millionaire self serving shill or full establishment shill.
There&#39;s another possibility, he might not deliberately be a shill, but
perhaps genuinely believes his economic model can work well once things like the FED get audited, crony capitalism reduced, taxes not going to war, etc.
But that&#39;s a whole different world so it&#39;s hard to analyze if his economics are a complete scam or semi-reasonable once those things are taken care of.
Or if he&#39;s just pushing it.
But I still don&#39;t trust him.
Just my view.
Right politics in general is supposed to favor the ruling class, hence
its origins/coinage in the French Revolution relating to being on the side of the king/ruler (right wing) rather than the people (left wing).
But I don&#39;t want to get into an argument over Ron Paul as I&#39;m still
ignorant on some aspects of economics. But many economists agree with Bernie
and democratic socialism and social democracy are pretty common sense.
Tax isn&#39;t theft when done right.
All I know is, democratic socialism is essentially just this system but with less corruption, less crony capitalism, more nationalization of essential services like healthcare, more of a fair taxation system, removal of subsidies from corporations that don&#39;t need it and already have monopolies, etc.
The extreme right wing libertarian agenda seems to be more of a
&quot;become an entrepreneur or die poor&quot; sort of thing.</p>

<p>I consider people like Trump, (zionist links) Alex Jones, (zionist and CIA links) Ron Paul, (zionist and bad economics) etc. as frauds, personally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is for sure anti-war, but we still have to clean up our messes. Reducing geopolitics to &quot;this country good, this country bad&quot; is theater for the plebs. My hard and fast rules for Trump is &quot;always assume you are underestimating him&quot; and &quot;always assume that he is generating outrage for his benefit&quot;</p>

<p>The seven country ban was testing the waters. The judge halting the EO worked perfectly. Now the Trump admin waits for someone from the seven countries to commit a terror attack and prove the EO prescient. At the end of the day we very well may see SA on the travel ban list.</p>

<p>Trump is a billionaire because of the luxury condo and hotel buisness and not arms dealing. Wars take money away from him. The best outcome for Trump and his family is no war and 4%gdp growth. That&#39;s what he wants. Tillerson is a great proof of this.</p>

Persia was once a great empire that embraced western ideals such as free will and freedom of religion.</p>
