       I keep asking myself this. I can't imagine all the delays are just one giant temper tantrum over not winning an election. What the fuck does the DNC hope to gain by fighting over every scrap of political landscape? Would it not make more sense to regroup and attack when stronger?

       No, I didn't say it was just the DNC. I said the Democrats are attempting to delay Session's swearing in for some reason. If you want my opinion on the whole thing I think a massive number of both the GOP and DNC are pedophiles. I suspect this is why there was such resistance in the GOP against Trump despite him being the clear populace favorite in the primaries.

       This is not a binary DNC or GOP thing and people need to stop looking at it that way. It's an error that creates division among the citizenry. Keeping us divided is exactly what (((THEY))) want.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality of the situation is no matter what party currently has a candidate sitting in the Presidents chair it's only ever going to be the
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       party diligently pursued for crimes of this nature. It's unfortunate that the world works this way but it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama had a chance in 2009 to hold as many as 5000 pedophiles accountable for their crimes and he didn't for some reason. The DNC missed their chance at a home run when they were at bat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GOP sits in the White House and if they go after pedophiles I doubt they will go after their own, but if they at least go after the 1/2 represented by te DNC we can hopefully clean out half of the tumor.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's interesting about Trump is that he is a wild card and might completely go off the deep and and turn on the GOP also. It's a possibility and both the DNC and GOP fear this. I believe this is why we have been prepared with the Russian and Fake News narratives since November.
       <strong>
        IF
       </strong>
       (and that's a really big IF) anything comes to light both parties can refer back to Russia and Fake News and coup d'etat Trump as a foreign agent before we find out how many children they have all been fucking.

       its not going to happen.  when sessions gets sworn in, if he starts cracking down on and arresting the people implicated in pizzagate, i will start a youtube channel for the sole purpose of getting "#pizzagate is real and im a dumbass for thinking it wasnt" tattooed across my forehead.  then ill post it somewhere on reddit once a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       but until it is proven real, i reserve the right to tell everyone that pizzagate isnt real, and to tell all these tourists to "go the fuck back to TD."

       That would go against their narrative, though. If the moderators actually curated submissions to only FACTUAL content, the Reddit admins would shut the place down.

       I would argue that covering up pedophilia is a crime. Obviously you will have to be found knowingly complicit in a court of law but still. At the very least public shaming of those who refused to consider the possibility of widespread abuse even for a second seems reasonable enough.

       Wait really? I have no idea what's right at this point lol but I also heard Trump was in Tampa today and I live here so it was weird that I didn't hear anything about that... 
I lived in LA last year, Obama was in town at some point, you couldn't get anywhere lol. I didn't even have to go to work because the traffic and blocked roads were out of control. I know it's not the same but if the president is visiting I expect some craziness I guess.

       No one said the whole operation was coming down today. Anon said arrests would be made today. There were arrests in Haiti made today, and 474 in LA a couple days ago. You would have to be purposely dense to not recognize his statement was accurate.

       The thread that got upvoted to the top here spreading that story had more upvotes in 8 hours than this sub gets on average in an entire day.  Counting in it's downvotes, it's just straight up unreasonable to assume that the thread got where it got too naturally.
      </p>

       The story was a plant, so that you (wittingly or not) would come in here and say "what the hell was up with that?"

       See I think the way it works is, people hear a rumor, the rumor falls in line with the hopes and dreams of most users on this subreddit who want to see justice. So naturally, people post about the rumors. I could be wrong but I don't think I saw any posts that claimed this to be a factual future event or anything, just hopefullness based of various social media presences and "inside sources" . If it does happen, awesome. But if it doesn't, please don't try to use it as a way to discredit all who have high hopes for justice.

       No, it's clear he predicted some were going to be soon, he did not say any high profile arrests monday. He only said "individuals", he was correct.

       Either way, why would expect mass arrests of those in power to be publicized at all?  Does that sound like smart move by those doing the arresting?  It's far more likely that these people simply disappear and you just never hear about them again.

       Four more years of renegotiating toxic trade deals that fuck up the lives of the middle class, four more years of sick and demented freaks getting dealt justice for raping kids, four more years of identifying "liberals" and "conservatives" being as people who are only interested in the agenda rather then being like Gabbard or McKinney in doing a service to their country, partisanship be damned, four more years of that. While I can admit that I'm not thrilled with the Goldman cabinet nor the Zionist agenda ties, it's stupid to ignore the other stuff and focus on the negatives of the bullshit that is partisan politics.

       No, I didn't say it was just the DNC. I said the Democrats are attempting to delay Session's swearing in for some reason. If you want my opinion on the whole thing I think a massive number of both the GOP and DNC are pedophiles. I suspect this is why there was such resistance in the GOP against Trump despite him being the clear populace favorite in the primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a binary DNC or GOP thing and people need to stop looking at it that way. It's an error that creates division among the citizenry. Keeping us divided is exactly what (((THEY))) want.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality of the situation is no matter what party currently has a candidate sitting in the Presidents chair it's only ever going to be the
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       party diligently pursued for crimes of this nature. It's unfortunate that the world works this way but it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama had a chance in 2009 to hold as many as 5000 pedophiles accountable for their crimes and he didn't for some reason. The DNC missed their chance at a home run when they were at bat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GOP sits in the White House and if they go after pedophiles I doubt they will go after their own, but if they at least go after the 1/2 represented by te DNC we can hopefully clean out half of the tumor.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's interesting about Trump is that he is a wild card and might completely go off the deep and and turn on the GOP also. It's a possibility and both the DNC and GOP fear this. I believe this is why we have been prepared with the Russian and Fake News narratives since November.
       <strong>
        IF
       </strong>
       (and that's a really big IF) anything comes to light both parties can refer back to Russia and Fake News and coup d'etat Trump as a foreign agent before we find out how many children they have all been fucking.
