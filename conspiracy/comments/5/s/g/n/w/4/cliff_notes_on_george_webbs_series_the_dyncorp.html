        DynCorp Harvest
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This series is rated R for Mature Adults.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the DynCorp Harvest series, George incrementally describes a luxury medical tourism resort in Northern Haiti, funded by USAID and built by the Clinton Foundation, whose revenue-earning underpinnings are purported to be a) an illegal organ harvesting market, b) human sex trafficking Dyncorp-Slim ratline and c) microlending loansharking debt slavery by DynCorp--the CIA's privatized, covert-services contractor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The organs are proposed to be either transplanted in Haiti into rich elites skipping the lines with help from organ brokers he believes the Podestas and Braverman-the-doctor to be, or shipped to locations throughout the US to various aristocratic outlets; while women are forced into cellphone-based debt slavery and prostitution; and children are sex-trafficked to Colombia or stowed aboard a medical ship bound for a port in Norfolk Va to be (mkultra-best-use/sex/assassin/politician) trafficked in DC (and abroad).  Furthermore, and much like they were in Vietnam, the bodies would then be zipped in DynCorp bodybags, shipped abroad with organs removed and replaced with illegal drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       These activities, in addition to blackmailing police forces, politicians, and industry influencers into compliance and loyal servitude--the so-called
       <em>
        Brownstone Operations
       </em>
       --are the "natural and necessary" functions of the CIA, because--
       <em>
        the company
       </em>
       erroneously believes--these activities are needed to fund these selfsame covert operations!  Putting it more simply,
       <em>
        "We need to commit crimes so we can continue to commit crimes."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       There.  Now you understand the CIA.

          [Christopher Reeve] -- lets say he did a protest movie about war, and the pentagon didn't like it.  They could shoot your horse with a pellet gun as you're going over a jump--to give you a warning.  I don't think they thought it would turn out the way it did.  If you keep on speaking out against war, all of a sudden your wife [Dana Reeve] does young.  I don't think she had "old heart"

          Caracol park, I said this industrial park was going to get like a 1000 businesses, and they were all going to get loans from the World Bank and then they were going to fold over time after all the money was loaned out.  This is like the
          <em>
           Arkansas Development Fund

          I think this is done through the export/import bank run through the World Bank that has Congress oversight.  EXIM Bank.  They collapsed it last year in 2015.  They collapsed 10 yr insured loans, which Congress co-signed...Congress had to pay that out.  I think that's where Hillary got the extra 5B dollars.

          George shows a spending ledger of USAID assistance money.  He points to Petits Freres et Soeurs, and says this was for moving kids around.  They all had different illnesses.  That's because--he believes--dyncorp was spraying the area with different things.

          Paul Farmer is teaching in Rwanda, in Haiti and these genocide countries.  He's teaching these interns--the same ones being turned away up here--to do organ extractions, and now then they are coming back to the US to do organ transplants.  You need semi-skilled people doing extractions, and then they go to Cleveland clinic to learn under an expert to do the transplants.  When you look at the money [behind organ / blood harvesting] it's just too [compelling of a profit motive drive] to ignore

          Jorge Puello is no longer wanted--he served his time so George apologizes for saying that.  He wants to expose the downstream.   But we want to go upstream.  You aren't going to drain the swamp by going downstream.

          Jorge tell us who the operatives are.  Just publish it.  They always want to diffuse and have you go off in different directions

          All of this activity is for elites to have eternal life
         </li>
         <li>
          Knights of Malta.  When Clinton Foundation shut down the CGI, which is really going to be reformed by Rockefeller and Google foundation, I proposed the question: did they go to Malta?
         </li>
         <li>
          Malta can issue diplomatic passports so you can bypass the security lines.  Here are all the countries they have diplomatic relationships with.  And Canada is one
         </li>
         <li>
          If you are jewish you know this.  The maltese falcon is a bird you could put in the window of an art shop, hospital or church and that person would accept MONEY to get out of Germany into Jewish-friendly countries.  It's to let everyone know you can get letters of transit if you could pay that extortion money to escape.
         </li>
         <li>
          Reason I mention it is the Knights of the Grand Master of Malta resigned today.  The Pope is saying he's going to take control of the Order of Knights of Malta.  It's not actually part of the Catholic Church, but it's always been the military wing of the Catholic Church.  These guys were assassins.  They called them knights of Justice; popes were killing each other and so forth. It's been a spy ring for a long time {{Jesuits}} and in recent times, since war of 1812 it's been a way to spirit away rich people who are in trouble with the law.  It's been a ratline for trafficking for a long time.  SO when the CIA goes to find a network, the CIA doesn't go to the Church to pray--they go because they want letters of introduction, letters of transit
         </li>
         <li>
          FBI dominates in the US, so CIA inserts itself into Canada.  All the MKULTRA experiments are done in Quebec. And CSIS [Canadian Secret Intelligence Service] is a very strong partner of the CIA

       I don't know why George Webb would meet with Oliver Stone's people for a film project on this. So that Stone can whitewash it for the C I A?

       You know Polo I was thinking the same thing.  I just ...  it made me sigh.  I don't know if there's an honest filmmaker in hollywood that can help him...thats the fundamental problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think his 'hidden history of the us' is a little too discovery channel and it doesn't really capture it
      </p>
      <p>
       if a person wanted to do hidden history of the US, they'd start with this cadre of subverts in the intelligence community.  I would say Dulles and operation paperclip is a good starting point, but if you really wanted to go deeper:
      </p>
      <p>
       Cecil Rhodes and Rhodesia and the formation of round table supranationals.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you wanted to go deeper: freemasonry, adam weishaupt, rousseau and voltaire and the french revolution; origins of democratic republicanism and basically follow Grant Morrison's lead on histroy of US as given by the graphic novel "the invisibles" which is a more honest account of the US than what we think of as history, even tho invisibles is weird and has demons and such
      </p>
      <p>
       Then to go even deeper, tie into rosicrucianism, jesuits, evolution of science and the enlightenment  science vs theology for cultural supremacy...it's really masons versus jesuits and goes back to venice, malta, switzerland heidelberg and prague, london and paris

       The best part there is how it illustrates the never ending nature of the same conflict, and you can see why in mythology it's always just good vs evil, with each side thinking they are good and then whoever wins then becomes the evil god or ruler. Like Zeus conquering the old Gods before him and so on. So the the Gods rule from Olympus until the "good" reforms and battles again, ad infinitum. The comic Spawn is also the same idea, with heaven and hell recruiting their people to fight the other and Spawn was actually a CIA agent in Vietnam! I sometimes wonder if comics aren't intended to be the "official history" for way into the future lol. In the Wire remember the character known only as the Greek?
      </p>
      <p>
       But this has racked my brain and spins me in circles, so I stay depressed and hopeless, but just trying to figure out the telos and the point of it all, if it's even worth it. Like if the end state is to be a god or a star, for the good to become the bad Gods and so on, does it make you want to just disconnect from this game and refuse to play it? Then be a bystander who does nothing which is just as pointless as any other option? I feel like Leonardo DiCaprio at the end of Shutter Island, just give me the lobotomy!

       Makes you think of a lot of things like that.  Like maybe those 2997 people in the towers had gotten away down an emergency chute for example but ended up being taken down a tunnel to a facility to do god knows what to them.  After all the rescue teams found very few even parts of survivors

I heard his early videos were deleted.
