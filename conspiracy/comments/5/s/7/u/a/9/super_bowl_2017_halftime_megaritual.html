       People are becoming more aware of the occult symbolism being pushed in our media, especially through entertainment and musical performance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Magic rituals need not be performed in secret, and often they are performed out in the open, with the public as unwitting participants. These are activities based on imagery, intent, feeling, belief, and the understanding that we are all co-creating our reality together. And it is also based on scientifically-verified knowledge about mass hypnosis, used by certain intelligence agencies for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ceremonial magic can take the form of the Olympic opening ceremonies:
       <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/the-occult-symbolism-of-the-2012-olympics-opening-and-closing-ceremonies/">
        http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/the-occult-symbolism-of-the-2012-olympics-opening-and-closing-ceremonies/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       An opening ceremony for the longest tunnel in the world:
       <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/opening-ceremony-worlds-largest-tunnel-bizarre-occult-ritual/">
        http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/opening-ceremony-worlds-largest-tunnel-bizarre-occult-ritual/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And Super Bowl halftime shows:
       <a href="http://illuminatiwatcher.com/katy-perry-illuminati-goddess-2015-super-bowl-halftime-show/">
        http://illuminatiwatcher.com/katy-perry-illuminati-goddess-2015-super-bowl-halftime-show/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the biggest celebrity performers have an obvious fixation on illuminati imagery, ritualistic archetypes and Crowley satanism, including Katy Perry, Madonna, Jay-Z, Beyonce, and of course, today’s Super Bowl Halftime performer, Lady Gaga.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lady Gaga, as we know, has a particular interest in ’spirit cooking’, which is a dark occult/magic ritual in itself involving consuming blood and bodily fluids:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LadyGaga/comments/5bjb4l/lady_gaga_cooking_spirits_together_with_marina/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/LadyGaga/comments/5bjb4l/lady_gaga_cooking_spirits_together_with_marina/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Lady Gaga is today’s 2017 Super Bowl Halftime performer. You can be sure that not only will she be speaking against President Donald Trump (the intent), that there will be all the occult symbolism on display as part of the ritual itself. The masses of people watching add their thoughts, beliefs and emotions to give the ritual it’s power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch closely at all that is said, the music that is chosen, the images as they are presented. Ancient archetypes, goddess imagery, sacred geometry... It is all chosen very carefully, both to manipulate the masses and steer the collective co-creation of the mass consciousness.

       Look for a guest appearance by Beyonce, Katy Perry, Hillary Clinton or some other dark occult priestess as well.

       Lady Gaga's fame is just about timed out. Her last album succeeded only via smoke and mirrors -- the single was sold on iTunes for half-price, the album sales were spurred by her own label buying at least 10K copies for giveaways, there was some shady shit going on with Billboard magazine where they got 5% of the revenue from the album for plastering her face all over the magazine the first couple weeks the album was released.

       Gaga actually isn't very popular and she's being forced upon the American people for precisely the reason you say: To inflict a dark occult philosophy upon society. May she get the eternity she deserves.

       She's being forced to perform because she can and always has been about the shock value of her "performance art." She could literally perform a mock crucifixion/sacrifice of Jesus and claim it was about some grandiose political statement against Trump and everyone would just go "yeah...that's Gaga. Harhar, what a silly lady."

       While Energy vampires like Bush Sr sit in the crowd and jack off to the fact that the crowd and millions of people are not only witnessing but cheering on the satanic rituals that keep the elite powerful.

       Agree with a lot of what you write, but...."being forced to perform"? I doubt it. She's a fame whore, she needs this stuff. Plus her latest album was a sales disappointment, she may need this to give her career a boost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Big question to me is whether her people ponied up the $5 million that was said to be needed in order to play the halftime show. NFL later said they rescinded that requirement, but if the NFL will lie about their sport actually killing its players, they'll lie about anything and everything.

       If she is a victim--which would NOT surprise me at all--her psychic breakdown should start any day now, since she recently turned 30.

       I have a feeling that they're gonna try to unite people against "evil", and it's gonna backfire (as the real evil ones are doing the ceremony) :) Here occultists, have a blessing for your ceremony, lets hope it turns out well for all of us!

       Thanks for this post. It should be interesting to see what is said/done in terms of both words and imagery. Would you be willing to do a follow up post with any interpretation of what you saw OP? (For those of us without TV)

       Without describing every individual detail that I saw there were certainly ritualistic parts and pieces that I observed. It's all about energy and emotions, eliciting certain emotions in a certain series. Gaga started out patriotic then went to rebel then went soppy then sincere then back to Bad Romance at the end. There was a man in black dancing with her at certain points that seemed to.serve a purpose . Her and her dances were on a blue grid of squares kinda matrix like. It turned to red at the end and dancers in which joined her, a few of them had what looked like toilet paper headdress, one with horns. That's a loose recount of what I saw in terms of actual ritualistic behavior.

       downvotes are fine, but at least i'm being reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       you remember all those debunked cases in which the people claim to be psychic but it turns out they're just mentally ill or are faking it? that's because psychic powers are
       <em>
        likely very very
       </em>
       unreal and for the most part impossible. i won't even start on the vampire bit.

       The term psychic vampires is an over simplification of what it really stands for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joe Rogan Podcast #911 explains a bit and many other sources do as well. I'm sure Google can help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it is in reference to (Satanic) people involved in occult groups that drink blood (adrenochrome) for pleasure (and some theorize for power as well). They're also in touch and communicate inter dimensionally with what is believed to be a higher power. This higher power may be Gods or some sort of advanced beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I realize it still sounds crazy. Just wanted to clear it up. It takes hours if not days of research to make it this far down the rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceed with caution. Honestly, consider turning back now. The knowledge and awakening is somewhat of a curse. Knowing too much can make you a target. On top of that it will make you feel crazy. If you decide to live in bliss please do not insult/mock/ridicule other community members further down the rabbit hole.

       Kind of an oddball question here, but anyone here who was in GATE education as a kid? I feel as thought that's contributed to being able to see this kind of stuff (Yes, I agree with OP), because similar things were involved in the curriculum.

       Well, when I was in the program in the late 90s quite a bit of the history education focused upon the ancient world, mostly mythology. Funeral rites and death rituals were also covered, and books that were in the library were ones that I knew even as kid  wouldn't be available at "normal" schools like the one I had previously attended.
      </p>
      <p>
       I distinctly remember one of our history projects was to entomb a Barbie doll or action figure in a paper-mache coffin that we then painted up as an Egyptian sarcophagus. We got iMacs 3 months after they initially came out back in '98, overhauling the entire computer lab with them. Come to find out that GATE technical education is at the very least heavily influenced by DARPA, although I'd go so far as to say they flat out set those educational standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's more to it than that stuff even, but I'd prefer not to talk about it here.

       We did those as well. When I was in 5th grade for instance, a class assignment was to design a spaceship that could operate 100% independently from Earth. We had to draw the ship, label the rooms, and describe how everything on it functioned. Not simple explanations like "The plant room grows food" but as in "The water system recycles wastewater to be pure enough to water the plants.".

      <p>
       Pretty crazy to ask 10 year olds to do that kind of thing, but it wasn't anything too out of the ordinary for us at that school.

       Zzzz having kids sell their creative souls without knowing. That's entrapment. No wonder teachers all hated me for never turning my shit in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's how it starts: "Hey kids, our school is having a contest to see if your young minds can help Company A come up with a better way to do B! The winner moves on to the next round where your idea could win your class a pizza party!".
      </p>
      <p>
       Kid gets his class a pizza party (I know) that costs the company like zero dollars because Dominos is going to deliver and they are in a buisness group with that company. Now they take the idea some 5th grader with insane creative talent came up with and monitize it for their own profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporations do this constantly with young children in schools. Think back to your own elementary days and you will probably remember at least one instance like this. It's never done to benefit people in general and kids don't know any better. They are kids. They just think "oh cool pizza party, I love me some pizza" and never get to decide what their ideas and inventions get used for or which hands they fall into.

       Precicesly. I was the same way, I didn't turn my work in or did the bare minimum because I could see things for what they were, like you've described. Got bullied a lot by classmates and teachers/staff alike for non-conformity, but even now I'd take that over mindless obedience.

       It's kind of like when they were showing those ads for 'Taboo' these past couple months, I liked one particular line from it.

       "I know the evil you do... Because I was once part of it."

       ok watched a few trailers and found that one.. taboo guy sounds like the ultimate dissenter avenger.. totally agree.. it's interesting considering the dynamic at work in the world right now.. lines are being drawn and choices have to be made (sanity over delusion).. my favorite part about now is that everyone in the red pill revolution is willing to drop their differences and become one, in order to see truth get the resolution it warrants.
      </p>

       PS - have you considered making GATE its own discussion? the program was like a little secret society out in the open complete with psychological programming techniques.. all that stuff.

       I was. I've just assumed we were actually taught critical thinking skills which makes us question things. When I talk to people that weren't in the program, that was definitely not a focus, in fact it seems as if it was avoided.

       It was and it wasn't. Critical thinking when it came to problem solving and finding new points of view, but not when it came to authority. As a kid and even as an adult, labels of authority don't mean much to me (INTJ) and because of that I was weeded out of the GATE program after 6th grade, as I would constantly question and deliberately disobey instructors who demanded obedience (rather than demonstrating actual leadership skills) from their class. My understanding is that the government recruits students for military positions and other occupations out of the program, which ties into not emphasizing the questioning of authority.

       christians can be praying in faith that the dark agenda for the vision doesn't succeed and instead becomes a stumblingblock to them and a stepping stone to us, that truth is exposed instead of the lie being reinforced.. just overall for a total smackdown on their plans :)

       Apparently 100s of drones will be part of her performance.   All gyrating to her no doubt.   I expect a spy grid themed show with either a mix of transhumanism, the police state (less likely), or progressive values (most likely).

       I could look this up but won't - Madonna's halftime was famously symbol heavy as were many before that.   But last year I remember saying to myself that there was a complete absence of it.   Could someone go back ten years and remind of us how these have been traditionally?

       Guys the more I watch this the more I am going with some kind of ritual related to a disaster at a nuclear site. Check out my post,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5sbg6p/lady_gaga_halftime_observation/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link">

       . If you watch the whole thing in this context there are some definite parallels to a meltdown. grid goes from blue to orange to red. Gaga goes up on a fuel rod coming out of the reactor. Thing she is sitting next to her piano looks like an early reactor core. With the Fukushima radiation increases recently maybe this is related?

       The whole performance gave me a real eerie feeling. Made me uncomfortable watching. These people aren't even hiding it anymore (see Pizzagate), they are just hiding in plain sight now
