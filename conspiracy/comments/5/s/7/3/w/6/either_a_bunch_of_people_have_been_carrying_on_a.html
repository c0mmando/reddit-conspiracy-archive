<p>The writing style matches that of previous posts made to 4chan by a person(s) who goes by FBIAnon. This person(s) started posting on 4Chan under the aforesaid name last May. As the election season ran its course, predictions made by FBIAnon came to pass and almost verbatim as described in his/her prior posts.</p>

<p>One of the biggest indicators of validity of and truth in claims of an event on the horizon is when the chatter begins from other groups or individuals who, at one point or another, have been either tangentially or directly related to investigations over the past decade regarding alleged human and child trafficking carried out by defense contractors.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong><em>The Recent &quot;Chatter&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-weigh-child-pornography-charges-against-anthony-weiner-1485894771">https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-weigh-child-pornography-charges-against-anthony-weiner-1485894771</a></p>

<p>Federal prosecutors are considering charging Anthony Weiner with possession of child pornography. Keep in mind that Weiner getting busted for sexting a 15 year old is what lead to the NYPD seizing the laptop shared between Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin (Hillary&#39;s right hand for years). Keep these two things in mind:</p>

<p>1.) NYPD had possession of and forensically investigated the Weiner-Abedin laptop for four to six weeks before the FBI disclosed to the public both knowledge of the laptop and the investigation into Hillary Clinton being reopened.</p>

<p>2.) The FBI announced the laptop and the re-opening of the investigation on the evening of Friday October 28, 2016.</p>

<p>Good timing allowed me to watch the FBI press conference as I walked in from work and just as it began. I had Twitter open on my phone and it started blowing up with tweets along the following lines:</p>

<p>&quot;My sister&#39;s husband works for the NYPD. Rumor is that the laptop contains evidence of pedophilia and child / sex trafficking. The NYPD has been quietly working on this for weeks, but the cat was let out of the bag internally and it is all anyone in the entire department can talk about right now.&quot;</p>

<p>You can apply relevant hashtags to a twitter search and then scroll back to the tweets from October 28 in order to get the specific tweets.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/blue-campaign/take-second-look">https://www.dhs.gov/blue-campaign/take-second-look</a></p>

<p>PSA released by Department of Homeland Security. The message is to remain vigilant and on the look out for signs of human trafficking. Notice how the opening shot is in front of a pizza shop and the synched dialogue is &quot;The signs are everywhere; sometimes you just have to take a second look.&quot;</p>

<p>The six links above were tweeted by @FBIRecordsVault, the twitter account run by the department / division of the FBI responsible for releasing newly declassified information and permissible FOIA requests which may be of interest to the public at large.</p>

<p>Each page contains a PDF file of the FBI&#39;s investigation into Hillary Clinton and The Clinton Foundation. The biggest takeaways are the following:</p>

<p>1.) The FBI determined that the number of private servers used by Clinton and associates demonstrated willful intent to conceal emails which were subject to FOIA regulations for the purpose of preserving the emails and making them public; and </p>

<p>2.) The FBI discovered &gt;1,500 work emails between Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin. The emails were supposed to be turned over under the terms of a federal subpoena. They were never turned over and they were discovered after Clinton and her legal team claimed to have turned over.</p>

<p>3.) Then Attorney General Loretta Lynch used to do the accounting records for Hillary Clinton and The Clinton Foundation. Needless to say, this was a huge, undisclosed conflict of interest. Obstruction of justice by Lynch  and the DOJ to cover their asses has become blatantly obvious.</p>

<p>The first two links are articles (from 2002 and 2005, respectively) detailing how employees of DynCorp (one of the largest private defense contractors) were caught engaging in the buying and selling of children (aka Child Trafficking) in Bosnia circa 1999 and Afghanistan / Iraq circa 2002 and 2004, respectively.</p>

<p>The video is from a 2006 congressional hearing wherein then Representative McKinney grilled Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld over the U.S. DoD maintaining contracts with DynCorp in light of the child trafficking scandal.</p>

As far as the latest post from FBIAnon, I agree that it looks like what an authentic post would look like. But that doesn&#39;t make it real. It could be faked by a talented individual or a government agency. Here&#39;s to hoping it&#39;s real.</p>

<p>if you and your all caps are right, those kids are dead, and have since pizzagate became a thing.</p>

<p>my problem with you guys is that you say you care about the kids but you do fuck all applying your intense crowdsourcing zeal to trying to find and rescue the kids. eveything is about the gotcha. </p>

<p>on the infinitesimal chance a ring that clinton and podesta are prosecuted, they will serve jeff epstien jokes of sentences, if they aren&#39;t kept out of jail for good. the ring continues, and the kids continue to be tortured, because you and your all caps and your down votes, you aren&#39;t trying to be super heroes, you&#39;re trying to be prosecuters. </p>

<p>all i know is that if iwas one of those kids i wouldn&#39;t give a fuck about catching my tormentor, i&#39;d just be praying someone would come in and save me from their torment.</p>

<p>if you and your all caps are right, those kids are dead, and have since pizzagate became a thing.</p>

<p>my problem with you guys is that you say you care about the kids but you do fuck all applying your intense crowdsourcing zeal to trying to find and rescue the kids. eveything is about the gotcha. </p>

<p>on the infinitesimal chance a ring that clinton and podesta are prosecuted, they will serve jeff epstien jokes of sentences, if they aren&#39;t kept out of jail for good. the ring continues, and the kids continue to be tortured, because you and your all caps and your down votes, you aren&#39;t trying to be super heroes, you&#39;re trying to be prosecuters. </p>

<p>all i know is that if iwas one of those kids i wouldn&#39;t give a fuck about catching my tormentor, i&#39;d just be praying someone would come in and save me from their torment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand where you&#39;re coming from, because not long ago I was standing where you are right now.</p>

<p>However, as time passed and I conducted research and analysis from the information available, all I ever found to be occurring was the linking together of the information into an operational frame work. At this point, it seems nearly statistically impossible for th chain of connections to be simple coincidence. Furthermore if you really understand the nitty gritty of 19th and 20th century geopolitics, and how both still have lasting effects to this day, you&#39;lol come to understand that the fundamental basis for why a PG Type syndicate exists. </p>

<p>Fact of the matter is, a pervasive and widespread syndicate like that in PG is not without precedent in recent history (~ the last 200 to 250 years).</p>

<p>....this just so happens to be the first time it is occurring in our modern technological society and that wrinkle / variable was not taken into account by those allegedly behind PG (presuming it exists). Their oversight was an unaccounted for variable which allowed for information to pass right under their noses and see the light of day.</p>

<li><p>FBIAnon is very calculated and intentional with what he/she/they are doing and now, shortly after the most recent update, we have the video from DHS and @FBIRecordsVault tweeting links to documents and case files with a very clear intent and goal in mind.

<p>No of course not and that reinforces my point.  Why post at all?  This stuff has all hit mainstream media and been discarded as lunacy because of it.  What is gained by posting this to 4chan unless the investigation had failed?  </p>

<p>And the symbol was available to anyone on wikileaks for many years now.  You really think a massive elite group of organized crime wouldn&#39;t be paying attention to stuff like that and instantly disuse such symbols?</p>

The brazen behavior of people who are constantly feeding on the fear of others gives a very clear sense of impunity to them.

<p>And why would someone leak the details of an investigation into them if they weren&#39;t working with for them?  Seems better to wait until the investigation produces concrete results and then show up with handcuffs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO this past year has been amazing for citizen investigation. The more we know and piece together the less they can sweep it under the rug. I think they want to give us clues so they can&#39;t just blow and it all comes out to stop it. If the people know and find out more and more everyday it can&#39;t be silenced. They don&#39;t want to be silenced and the only way to really fight it is for the people to come out against it and link it all together like George Webb and many others are doing. How George is still alive is beyond me. He has to have people watching his back for sure. </p>

<p>If this is true and it all comes out we also have a fighting chance to keep our new POTUS and others to come in check but again just my opinion. </p>

<p>Before I get attacked let me say my politics lay in the middle. I think both sides right and left have been infiltrated to make each look bad. Look at the civil war and tell me the right wasn&#39;t against slavery so how else could it have gotten turned around but infiltration and I mean on both sides. On top of it we have so many leaning to far right or left anymore it&#39;s nuts. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all crooked anymore and this needs to come out so we the people can show solidarity again. The people that don&#39;t get it finally will and maybe and I mean just maybe we can come together again and stop this war of divide they are waging on us. </p>

<p>This comment only comes from love and not hate and divide. It is not a right or left comment only showing how sick it&#39;s gotten on both sides. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe they keep using it because they knew they were untouchable?</p>

<p>Also how far back does this symbol go?</p>

<p>In another thread about the same pedo symbol on the sherifs it was learnt that this badge dates back to the 40s so this would suggest that the symbol was in use long before that.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s so ingrained in the secret underground pedo society that it can&#39;t be changed,sort of like how the swastika can&#39;t be dissociated from Hitlery nazis?</p>

<p>I speculate that in recent times pizza symbolism has replaced the triangle or maybe they are trying to replace the the triangle.In fact thinking about know pizza is a triangle.</p>

<p>Just speculation of course.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t venture over there. Before Voat came online, there was a sufficient amount of information out in the open to allow for the beginnings of a critical analysis and connecting pieces which, when you make it, almost immediately strikes you as more than mere coincidence. </p>

<p>Once you get hundreds of these type of connections made, you have to presume one of two things moving forward:</p>

<p>1.) It&#39;s all quietly being investigated by the FBI and they are either intentionally releasing information which they are allowed to release...but which act as helpful hints for where to look next or aerve as a partial piece of missing information; or</p>

<p>2.) The correct buttons have been pushed and deals have been cut for this to either not be dealt with at all or to be dealt with quietly:</p>

<p>The connections made via citizen research is itself enough to suffice the criteria which must be met to open a formal investigation. </p>

<p>The whole reason a criminal investigation is opened in any matter is because research yields probable cause to believe a violation of the law has occurred. It&#39;s why you don&#39;t need the smoking gun for a formal law enforcement investigation;  an investigation by law enforcement is what gives you the possibility to find a smoking gun (should one exist).</p>

<p>This news/announcement from the media has the potential to be one of the most impactful events in US history. Like, it will change us forever. Just think who was involved (someone who could have been the president, former presidents, basically all the higher ups currently in our country).

    <div class="md"><p>This is why I keep going back to the FBIAnon threads and monitor FBIVaultRecords like a hawk.</p>

<p>The FBI, via the FBIVaultRecords twitter, seems to have a very specific intent and purpose in mind each time it puts out a tweet regarding new declassifications, new FOIA results, and material they choose to tweet that is neither classified nor the result of a FOIA request.</p>

<p>FBI intelligence analysts are crucial to the agency and they&#39;re the people who rarely, if ever, accept a conclusion or an argument at face value. They dissect an argument or cobckgsion from every possible angle in an attempt to disprove it, show it as partially true, offer alternative arguments and/or conclusions, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s their job to take something which sounds so far fetched, investigate I, and see if they can create a plausible scaffolding structure...created by making relevant connectikd between evidence and facts...which acts as the framework of what is being alleged so that it can stand on its own, allowing for further investigation to fill in the solid, base framework.</p>
