    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been encountering really aggressive pushback against discussing class as a theme that unifies fight against sexism, racism with other liberal causes.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve been banned from one of the feminists subs for trying to look at feminism from that point of view.</p>

<p>A lot of sexism and racism issues are either economic injustice issues, or a direct consequence of thereof.</p>

<p>It seems counterproductive to reject that kind of common ground that can rally up a lot more people than each cause individually.</p>

<p>What bothers me the most though, is that sometimes I see rhetoric that is extremely alienating, that goes far beyond simply focusing on a single cause and ignoring everything else. They proclaim that people who are not 100% with them are their enemies.</p>

<p>And that is not simply counterproductive, that is downright disruptive. If I wanted to sabotage non-mainstream liberal movements, I wouldn&#39;t be able to do better job than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A big part of the reason that The_Donald exists is due to the lack of anywhere anyone on the right is able freely post without automatically being labeled.</p>

<p>Are they hypocritical in that they do the same thing to the left? Yes, but that is the state of identity politics our society has created. We are taught that if you disagree just label it something they can&#39;t argue and ignore. People that fall into this don&#39;t even consider their viewpoint the side they were herded into isn&#39;t universally true. </p>

<p>I think a big part of the reason why our country is so divided right now is because both sides just want to sit in a corner and ignore the other and insult them when they come near. We should be debating and discussing the issues rationally, but our sources of information on both sides are all so filled with confirmation bias that we are ultimately herded to conform onto one side and treat that worldview as the ultimate one. The first step to coming together is to stop labeling the &quot;other&quot; through weak generalizations be it SJW or &quot;racist&quot; or whatever. This means that you don&#39;t have to mention Trump anytime someone criticizes the Democrats.</p>

<p>The democrats demonstrate incompetence time and time again, thats some of grandmas wisdom right there - It has made me believe that the dems engineer diaster so they can&#39;t get shit down. </p>

<p>Except!!! when it comes to guns, i think the true intention of the corporate dems was revealed - the media propagated party combined with facism, the whole goal is to take guns away by framing all gun owners as mentally ill - coincidently the next Dem project to solve after &#39;ACA healthcare&#39; was going to be expanding mental health services AKA painting a red + over those new supermax prisons.</p>

<p>If mental health reform does happen the corporate dems should be kept as far away as possible OR it aught not to happen at all. Just look at obamacare.</p>

<p>I am all about discussing issues with unregulated and runaway capitalism, but you&#39;ll be banned from this sub unless you agree to promote full-communism as the only alternative.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pity it is that sub that got so popular as of late.</p>

<p>It seems like any discussion of progressive economic issues from a moderate left point of view is getting harder and harder to have.</p>

<p>all this talk of fascism</p>

<p>Not a Trump supporter, but just to set the record straight can you tell me one thing he&#39;s done that hasn&#39;t been done by U.S. presidents in the past that is remotely &quot;fascist&quot; or similar to Mao Zedong who killed between 50-100 million people? </p>

<p>All this &quot;talk&quot; about fascism mostly comes from people who accuse Trump of being &quot;facist&quot; without even knowing what it really means or implies. It&#39;s not relevant at all but you probably believe so because you read a NYT article about how Trump is &quot;literal Hitler.&quot;</p>

Its like this whole bs of racism being that it has to come from a position of &quot;power&quot; from the majority group to the minortiy group hence minorities can&#39;t be racist, or that females can&#39;t be sexist, or that gender is fluid and a social construct.  Now its fasicm, white supremacy, or nazis.   Theres a ton of other examples beside just social justice,  those are just the immediate ones that come to mind.

<p>however, your words were &#39;you either kill 100 million people or you aren&#39;t a facist&#39;, and I&#39;ll do your work for you, restating your point more clearly: &#39;Just because he&#39;s not killing people [yet], that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not a facist.&#39;</p>

<p>However, the burden of proof remains with you. Correlation is not enough to accuse someone of facism, you need to definitely lay out a case that demonstrates Trump believes in a fascist ideology or acts in a manner meaningfully comparable to the italian or german or other fascists you want wherever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest question here, what&#39;s the big deal with illegal immigration? I&#39;m honestly asking because from what I can tell, immigrants all seem to be really nice. I live and work with a bunch of them and I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to murder me in my sleep anytime soon. I really don&#39;t get what the big deal is. </p>

<p>On top of that, most of them go out of their way to pay taxes. They steal social security numbers to pay taxes on them and then have some tax paperwork in order o start businesses or buy houses and shit. </p>

<p>Some places give them drivers licenses so they don&#39;t have to go through all that trouble. I just don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t give them, if not citizenship, just something so they don&#39;t have to live like that?</p>

They take citizens&#39; jobs.
They get benefits from the government that you are paying for.
They spit in the face of legal immigrants who did go through the process.
They are undocumented.
They become cheap slave labor for businesses that bring all wages down.
They commit a far greater percentage of crime than other groups.
NOT ENFORCING THE BORDER ALLOWS TERRORISM AND DRUG CARTELS TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY.
They don&#39;t care about America and have shown to care more about their home country by waving their country&#39;s flag.
And most importantly, they are here ILLEGALLY. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever met an illegal immigrant before, but all the ones I know live scared to be caught. They spend their time inside their houses and don&#39;t come out because they&#39;re scared of doing something that&#39;ll get them kicked out. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard all these arguments before and if I were to say you&#39;re right about something, id say you&#39;re right about them driving down wages, which I hadn&#39;t thought about. </p>

<p>But knowing the people I know, all the other arguments seem to be exaggerations or worse, lies. </p>

<p>Nothing against you. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re a good person trying to do your best in life and your opinions are only this strong because you love this country as much as I do, but can&#39;t we go out there and meet some of these people to see if they&#39;re as dangerous as you say they are?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not because they don&#39;t want to, but because they can&#39;t afford it.</p>

<p>A lot of cases won&#39;t get accepted unless you know how the system works. For that you need an immigration lawyer. Which is tricky because a Lt of people go around saying they&#39;re immigration lawyers but they&#39;re not or they don&#39;t knw how the immigration system works. You&#39;d be surprised at how many people I know that lost 2 or 3 grand per person on fake lawyers. </p>

<p>In order to know which lawyers are good and which ones are bad, you need to form part of a community that communicates with each other, a network that takes years to build.</p>

<p>The ones that do get a good lawyer will sometimes, depending on the country they&#39;re from or their circumstances, be asked to leave their country for a year, five years, or ten years. Some of them can&#39;t afford to do that because they&#39;re here by themselves or they&#39;re being asked to return to poverty traps, or war torn places. </p>

<p>This will usually be enough to get them a permanent residency, but not citizenship.</p>

<p>After that&#39;s completed, they pay around another grand and are then allowed to take the test and interview, where you&#39;re asked questions most Americans don&#39;t know the answers to. Things like how many amendments the constitution has, how many articles were there in the confederations, who were the first three presidents, who is their state representative, etc. Depending on how old you are and how good of a student you are, this is the part that gets you. A lot of them didn&#39;t even finish school on their home countries because the poverty forced them to work in order to survive. School became a secondary objective. That was the case with my father in law, he only finished the third grade. That&#39;s why he&#39;s only a resident and not a citizen. </p>

<p>You can usually start this process in your home country, but because of how expensive it is, the people that can usually afford it, don&#39;t need to come to the USA and the ones that need it, and have the drive to become something, can&#39;t afford it. </p>

<p>I promise the majority of them don&#39;t vote. It&#39;s an unnecessary risk they can&#39;t take. I promise they pay taxes and I promise they aren&#39;t peddling drugs. </p>

<p>Are there bad ones? Yeah, and they get kicked out all the time. In fact, they even get some of the good hard working ones like my brother&#39;s father in law. He always mowed his grass not to please the HOA but because he loved his neighborhood, he always paid taxes, he worked hard and got a certificate to be an electrician, and he was raising three upstanding daughters, but got caught in a raid here in Texas. They were arresting illegal criminals and he got caught with them. They sent him to an immigration detention center for two days. He said he hadn&#39;t ever been more scared or embarrassed in his whole life. The kindest man stuck with criminals man.</p>

<p>Immigrants are not the iniquity some people make them out to be. :&#39;(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is hate for immigrants,  there is much hate for anti-immigrants. The super-problem is hating and not enough &#39;getting&#39;</p>

<p>Its not that hard to sympathise with most immigrants or most anti-immigrants. You just have to imagine yourself in their situation without maligning their motives and characters.</p>

<p>Immigration levels wouldn&#39;t be a problem for anyone -we could have welcoming open borders and travel freely to and fro our fond birthlands - if global strategists helped misfortunate people <em>in place</em> instead of creating misfortune afar (which is whats been done - by the superpower).</p>

<p>For most people it is a <em>huge</em> hassle to have to immigrate, and for many people it is a real hassle to have to accommodate. Its no use  just saying our shit shouldnt stink.</p>

<p>We <em>should</em> all tolerate everyone regardless of origin, language and culture differences, but most people have a level where that becomes heavy to live with. They can be anti-immigration, doesn&#39;t mean they are hateful or even less hospitable than you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s be honest the entire site is dead as we know it. Just about every forum is censored and astroturfed to the point where you&#39;re only seeing what they want you to see. The presumption used to be that you could click on a post and debate and discuss, but now any dissent of the silicon-valley left wing narrative is removed. </p>

<p>The alternative to reddit just might be a site that allows people to have substantive discussions like they used to be able to on here. You have millenials who are increasingly becoming radicalized to the point where they can&#39;t humanize their ideological adversaries. (&quot;fucking white male&quot;, &quot;all trump supporters are nazis who deserve to be punched&quot;) I believe that this is the result of many sites--including reddit now--not providing a platform for all political and social beliefs.</p>

<p>In the 60s and 70s, young liberals did battle against a society deeply ingrained in conservatism. But today everything is controlled by liberals. The media, the internet, most institutions. I have a really hard time believing that the liberals who label all their opponents white supremacists, censor them, and advocating for assaulting them unconditionally are on the same moral high ground as the ones who protested vietnam and <strong>real</strong> racial inequality not &quot;oh I can&#39;t relate to black people maybe if I act like they&#39;re still oppressed I can coopt the 1965 civil rights movement and they&#39;ll have to be my friend.&quot;</p>

<p>Not only are they banning people to keep the main subs an echo chamber, they&#39;re also vote manipulating anti-Trump posts to the front page constantly from all these various little Trump-hating subs, and suppressing anything pro-Trump.</p>

<p>The even more subtle and disturbing thing is, any time people in the comments strike back in these slanderous threads, mods lock the thread because it&#39;s getting &quot;controversial&quot;, rather than let opposing views be heard, yet it&#39;s still allowed to stay near the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> for a while since it&#39;s anti-Trump.</p>

<p>Reddit is inorganically trying to force the entire site to be a liberal echo chamber, and I hope more people notice and a competitor rises up, this site is feeling very pointless as of late except for using it for your niche interests. The default subs are cancer.</p>

<p>all this talk of fascism</p>

<p>Not a Trump supporter, but just to set the record straight can you tell me one thing he&#39;s done that hasn&#39;t been done by U.S. presidents in the past that is remotely &quot;fascist&quot; or similar to Mao Zedong who killed between 50-100 million people? </p>

<p>All this &quot;talk&quot; about fascism mostly comes from people who accuse Trump of being &quot;facist&quot; without even knowing what it really means or implies.
