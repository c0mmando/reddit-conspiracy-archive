<p>Or even as far as other major sport championships being controlled? The last NBA Final went to 7 games (More adds to be played) and The world series as well. Is there any proof of something like this being true? I&#39;m sure i&#39;m not the only one who has this on their mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NBA players, especially a superstar like Kobe, are good enough that they&#39;ll hit almost every shot if you leave them open - especially once they get in the groove.  All you&#39;d need to do is play slightly loose defense and make sure that Kobe <em>knows</em> he doesn&#39;t really need to worry about his shots being blocked, and his skill will do the rest.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just speculating of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must have no idea how psychological factors play into any sports game. On a stage where everything is on the line? You think players should be immune to mistakes when they know over 100 million people are scrutinizing their every move?</p>

<p>And just think about it for a second. Imagine the amount of players that would have to be in on it. Imagine the number of coaches in on it, general managers, owners, offensive and defensive coordinators, etc. Literally hundreds of people at the very least, and thats just at the present moment. Football has been huge business for decades.</p>

<p>Why has not a single player, coach, gm, owner, ref, or anyone else EVER come out and proclaim that the nfl is rigged? </p>

<p>You will probably say, &quot;oh, they just got paid off, the money is too big!&quot; think about this. if a player is so good, so talented, and has worked his ass off to the point where he is influential enough to be let in on &quot;the scheme,&quot; you dont think there is a chance that he would come out and tell the truth? I&#39;m talking about the hundreds if not thousands of great players who have lived off competition their entire lives, and have fought tooth and nail to get to the top. </p>

<p>not a SINGLE one of them has said anything about your apparent, systematic scheming.</p>

<p>I think it is plausible that individual refs are paid off for certain matches, but the thought of a league with everyone being in on it is just plain stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, it is cool to have a sense of things or speculate but very little of what you&#39;re saying makes sense or stands up to scrutiny. This is a pretty silly minor thing I don&#39;t know is why it has me so engaged but I think, outside of individual players or refs being paid off, scripting, directing or shaping the outcome of a football game is crazy and unnecessary. People watch and bet regardless of who wins and there are way too many people involved for it to remain quiet. </p>

<p>ie: if you lose a game that by 8 points of less you get $xx bonus.
if you win a game by less than 8 points you get $yy bonus.</p>

<p>Every super bowl game has a few moments where defense just stops doing its job. All a coach would have to do is tell a line man or a corner &#39;dont cover X closely on this drive&#39;. Afterwards they just claim &#39;whoops I made a mistake&#39; and the stupid fans eat it up. In reality if it wasnt rigged, for the salary those coaches are making, the team would find a more capable strategist.</p>

<p>Falcons just pulled a newbie move by trying to go for a TD instead of running up the middle and getting a field goal they wanted to put the game out of reach not just be slightly ahead in points </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A historic first super bowl for Atlanta, fails in comparison to.. 1) Brady becoming the &quot;best&quot; ever.. 2) Staging the biggest comeback ever.. 3) First Overtime SB
4) merchandise sales from a Pats victory, will no doubt generate way more $ than an Atlanta win..</p>

<p>IMO since all of those things happened, it was clearly a shameless rigging, and it really bums me out. It&#39;s a slap in the face to every fan that spent their hard earned money on ridiculously expensive tix, and merch..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just think about it for a second. Imagine the amount of players that would have to be in on it. Imagine the number of coaches in on it, general managers, owners, offensive and defensive coordinators, etc. Literally hundreds of people at the very least, and thats just at the present moment. Football has been huge business for decades.</p>

<p>Why has not a single player, coach, gm, owner, ref, or anyone else EVER come out and proclaim that the nfl is rigged?</p>

<p>You will probably say, &quot;oh, they just got paid off, the money is too big!&quot; think about this. if a player is so good, so talented, and has worked his ass off to the point where he is influential enough to be let in on &quot;the scheme,&quot; you dont think there is a chance that he would come out and tell the truth? I&#39;m talking about the hundreds if not thousands of great players who have lived off competition their entire lives, and have fought tooth and nail to get to the top.</p>

<p>not a SINGLE one of them has said anything about your apparent, systematic scheming.</p>

<p>I think it is plausible that individual refs are paid off for certain matches, but the thought of a league with everyone being in on it is just plain stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s fixed. Vegas makes $BILLIONS on these games. Anybody thar thinks the NFL is not fixed is retarded. I stopped watching years ago. Refs can call holding on virtually any play to kill a drive. It&#39;s WHEN they make a holding call and NOT when they make a call that matters. It&#39;s rigged. The NFL shares 70 to 75 percent of its $10+ billion-a-year income including television/broadcast/internet rights and licensing. Ticket sales are split 66 percent for the home team and the other 34 percent shared equally among all franchises. Only luxury boxes sales (which explains the &quot;need&quot; for new stadiums), local advertising &amp; sponsorships, and official pro shop sales are not shared. No other league shares as much of its income as the NFL. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was trying to explain this to someone earlier but didn&#39;t have the articulation to put it like this. A system like the NFL controls a huge amount of the population. If it gets stale, they lose money. In order to maximize profits, it would be a horrible business decision to leave outcomes to the players. Much better to create tension, drama, escalation and climactic resolution. Make deflategate a big deal. Get people angry, emotionally invested. Give them a huge underdog story with a triumphant punchline, and watch them empty out their pockets to you. It&#39;s the biggest soap opera in history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes beyond money. All conspiracy theories need to be thoroughly tested against one simple question. What is the point? Some possibilities...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Super Bowl is a mass hypnosis event. It is definitely blatantly attempting to influence a giant audience of people that don&#39;t even like or follow football otherwise. This much is obvious.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone like Tom Brady is now a modern day demi-god. He can be employed to distract, influence, or criticize. This win solidified him as the actual Captain America. </p></li>
<li><p>The symbolism runs wide and deep if not obvious. Patriots are a symbol, red white and blue, and a very white team beating a team from the &quot;blackest american city.&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, what is the point of rigging the superbowl? Control? Suppression? Distraction? Racism? Elitism? Sports heroism and fanaticism has long been the &quot;circus&quot; of choice. What other entertainment avenues command such hundreds of billions of city tax payer money to facilitate? </p>

<p>How about this? What was the point of the Roman Coliseum? Wonder if those events were fixed? Football is Professional Wrestling for the intellectual average and socially complicit American masses. Yes, it could definitely be rigged.</p>

<p>“Referee Tony Corrente ruled the play was a fumble and a recovery by Detroit,” the league said in a statement emailed Sunday night to PFT.  “However, during the play and before Detroit recovered the fumble, another official blew the whistle believing it was an incomplete pass.  Because the ruling on the field was a fumble, and the whistle came before the recovery, the play is dead because of the inadvertent whistle and the Saints should have retained possession of the ball.  New Orleans would then have had the choice to put the ball in play at the spot where possession was lost or to replay the down.  <strong>Inadvertent whistles are not reviewable</strong>.”  &lt;&lt; Neither are shattered knee caps or dreams. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Patriots were finished, toasted and roasted. But this is the NFL, part of the entertainment industry, and here miracle comebacks are all part of the show.
Because if this game was real, why did the Falcons do any of the following?</p>

<p>Up 28-3, they only called running plays five more times for the remainder of the game.</p>

<p>Up by 16 in the fourth quarter, averaging 6+ yards a carry (when they did run the ball), and after running on the first two downs to make it 3rd-and-1, Matt Ryan fades back not for a quick strike pass, but a long pass play. He stands statuesque in the pocket and is promptly blindsided, sacked, and fumbles. </p>

<p>Then when up only  8 and after a spectacular catch by Julio Jones (which may have been an attempted interception on Ryan&#39;s part given the stupidity of the throw in the first place), the Falcons had the ball on the Patriots&#39; 22-yard line with three minutes left in the game. They were three runs and a field goal attempt away from sealing the team&#39;s first-ever Super Bowl championship. So what do they do? First down is a run (good start) for -1 yards. Still right there for a field goal. Second down is a pass (!), yet Ryan is sacked (doesn&#39;t bother to throw the ball away). Still, a long field goal attempt is possible. So on third down, the Falcons attempt another pass. This leads to an offensive holding call which makes it 3rd-and-33 and knocks out the possibility of any field goal attempt. The second attempt at third down is a complete bust, and well...you know how it ended from there.</p>

<p>Even Marshawn Lynch--you remember, the guy the Seahawks should&#39;ve given the ball to when their Super Bowl vs. the Patriots was on the line--managed to say of these moves:</p>

So twice now the Patriots won a Super Bowl not because their opponents weren out-coached, but because they did the dumb thing: pass when anyone with a brain would hand the ball off.
Funny, too, that the refs were very hands off in the playoffs, and from outward appearance, stayed that way in the Super Bowl (13 penalties for the game--only 4 of which were called against the Patriots). Yet it&#39;s not necessarily what&#39;s called, but when it&#39;s flagged that really matters. Like that previously mentioned holding call late in the 4th quarter against the Falcons. A backbreaker if ever there was one. Or like when in the second quarter as the Patriots were being pummeled the refs handed Brady and Co. three straight first downs on 3rd down because of &quot;defensive holding.&quot; These calls were clearly made to keep that drive alive and keep the Patriots in contention. </p>

<p>And what about the non-calls? The plays that should&#39;ve been flagged but magically were not? Such as the game-tying 2-point conversion attempt. Might there have been a big of premature blocking/interference on the Patriots on that play? Sure, they flagged the Falcons for being offsides, but an off-setting call would have put pressure back on the Patriots. But why ruin a good thing, right?</p>

<p>I could break this game down further, but why bother? You (probably) saw it for yourself. Plenty of football fans on Twitter seemed to think the game was a bit shady, that it might have been too much of a production. But it made for great TV--and the Super Bowl is the most watched TV production now, year in and year out. Plus, the Super Bowl&#39;s wild finish silenced all those naysayers who criticized the NFL&#39;s ratings and their &quot;boring&quot; playoffs leading up to this point. The league ended it&#39;s season with a true bang, one that will ring out over its remaining history (however long that may be). What more do fans want? What more entertainment can the league provide?</p>

<p>Remember, it&#39;s only a game. The meaning placed upon it is up to you, and you alone.</p>
