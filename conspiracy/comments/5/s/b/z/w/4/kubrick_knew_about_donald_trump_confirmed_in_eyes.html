       What if all of the following happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I say here must be somewhat limited but it is sufficient for you to gain a starting point and gather further intel on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       The event that Trump witnessed changed his life forever. It was traumatic to the point that it landed him in a mental hospital in the 1990s. He couldn't work as usual and he also had two bankruptcies around the same period. When you find out what Trump witnessed, you will understand why. Most people would not remain sane afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will also understand why Trump often has a profoundly stern, unbreakable resolve as though he were on a mission -- he is absolutely determined to stop the activity that he witnessed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, you will understand the deeper reason why the media, the entertainment industry, and the political class are so ferociously opposed to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump has connections to Soros and Epstein, but it is not what you think. And Stanley Kubrick knew, as he ran in the same circles.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump knew that Epstein was involved with girls around the age of 18 or 19. What Trump did not know was that, at the higher rungs of the operation, children and even newborns were involved, and he did not know about what was being done to these children.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump's son-in-law did receive financial transactions from Soros, but Trump did not realize that Soros was also involved in the higher rungs of the operation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump did ultimately come to find out about these deeper activities, and his response explains what we are witnessing at this point in history.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Here is a brief account of how it unfolded:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump was invited to a private party where libertine sexual activity was likely to take place. This is common in elite circles. Masks are worn to retain anonymity.   On this occasion however there may have been an isolated suite at the party in which "ritual" activity was scheduled to occur.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump was invited to the ritual. This invitation was arranged by Soros, who was also attending. Trump did not realize it was Soros wanting to have blackmail leverage over him in the future, but suspected something was afoot. Trump telegraphed false intentions to the individuals who invited him. They believed he was sincerely on board, but the fact is that he wanted to infiltrate and find out what precisely they were up to.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What Trump saw was the actual sacrificial murder of a child. He was immediately horrified,  and he knew which individuals were involved. Soros was standing behind Trump, but did not realize Trump was terrorized by what he witnessed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Shortly thereafter Trump broke ties with Epstein and had Epstein removed from his resort.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump broke ties with Soros as well.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump was essentially an infiltrator into an actual ritual to see it with his own eyes, and escape alive, as he hid his intentions to throw these people off.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Kubrick will show you the exact moment Trump saw it, what his real feeling about it was, and he will also show you Soros positioned symbolically behind Trump as the one hoping to entrap Trump.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You will need to go to the ritual frames and view them carefully to see.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hint: the masks are not random, but are unique molds intended to ID the members to the public. This is the biggest revelation in Kubrick's film that has gone unnoticed, until... today.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump truly believes these people are disgusting animals and for the last 20 years at least he has been infiltrating, preparing, and assembling a powerful team to take them down. He knows what is occurring at the very heart of the operation.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       As you can see from the frames, Trump was the only one horrified by what he saw, a real outsider, surrounded by those for whom the ritual was normal activity. He tricked them -- they let him in and he saw the full deal, and they're going to pay for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around late-2012 is when Trump decided he would take care of the problem by any means necessary. His close associates know that he fully wants the death penalty for the names involved, and he has mentioned it in public venues from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Everything above is fake of course and there is no reason to check the masks in ritual frames of Kubrick's documentary.)

       Kubrick, like many other legitimate, genius- level talents was somewhat of a recluse with little regard for the spotlight. Supposedly he didn't have very many close relationships other than family, and other than being obsessed with creating film didn't live much of a remarkable life.

       None, however, he knew a lot of influental people, so it was probably second hand and library knowledge of things. There is also a neverending conspiracy that Kubrick himself shot the fake moon landing for NASA. He did invent and patented a couple of things and lenses for shooting of "2001 Space Odissey", which was in 1968 , and first manned moon landing was in 1969.

       Interesting Kubrick tie in.  The mask ID idea would make them cut original footage and want Kubrick gone shortly after release of it were accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ran across some other interesting tie ins with eyes wide shut and ped stuff.  The pizza at the costume shop where the young girl eventually becomes a prostitute.  The rainbow/multi colored lights symbolism in the movie about being in the "secret realm" where the dark stuff happens etc.
