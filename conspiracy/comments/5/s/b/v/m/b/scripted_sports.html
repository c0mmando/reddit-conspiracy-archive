       After watching the end of the Superbowl, we have witnessed something that was never happened before. Atlanta blew a 21 point lead to lose the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Indians were up 3-1, but the Cubs won it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Warriors were up 3-1, but the Cavs won it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these things are incredible in their own right but all three impossible comebacks in the last three major sports happening in a row? Can't help but feel suspicious...

       I dunno man I started looking back a couple years and saw a video of the Seahawks, Broncos were a player gave the thumbs up before missing a tackle and running it in. Then the Baltimore lights... the Seahawks/Patriots interception... Newton fumbling the ball and staring at it... the falcons going retard mode and not closing it with a field goal...

       The Baltimore lights got me for sure was my straw. For me, as a Steelers fan, I was suspicious about Jerome Bettis' final season. A "Cinderella story" it would be. So many questionable holding penalties and such that entire season. But you know what's good for ratings, a Cinderella story. Then the Baltimore lights. Harbaugh vs Harbaugh, wait one team is destroying the other, kill the lights, momentum shift, other team makes a 3rd 4th quarter comeback. I played Junior and high-school football and anytime you stopped for weather or anything, momentum shift!

       So I was relating my personal experience with sports to professional sports to be able to assume what's going to happen the minute the lights went out and happened to be right. Okay, so they're professional so it's different, I get it. But when your team is on fire and something happens to make you pause and relax, and the other team just happens to rally together. There's something to it regardless of what level your at.  It just boils down to how disciplined your team is to overcome it.

       I think anything involving money is rigged. Baseball seems like it's the hardest one to script though. You don't know where that ball is gonna go when you hit it. I really wanted Atlanta to win. I can't stand Tom Brady and his cheating ass.

       People who can't understand how easy it is for professional baseball players to hit a ball out of the park blow my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do this thing before each game called "batting practice" where a dude softly throws a ball to the batter who proceeds to slam it out of the park about 15 times in a row.
      </p>
      <p>
       The home run derby is the championship round of batting practice.

       This isn't serious right? LeBron's mother was 16 years old and they bounced from house to house until she sent him to live with a coach when he was 8. It's not that unreasonable to think that someone raising a child in poverty can't afford baby portraits/a camera to take them.

       If you fail a drug test then you arent doing it right. Olympians, pro sports players, pro body builders take steroids (most) and are "drug tested".
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Serena Williams is suspect and IIRC she was almost caught (her friend was caught tho). Point is that the current urine test is ineffective. If they really wanted to regulate steroids they would implement carbon testing.

       You said it's incredibly easy for a player to hit a home run. It is in batting practice when it's lobbed at you, yes, but that has no impact on the sport being rigged or unrigged. It's a part of practice.

       I know exactly how Vegas lines work and how they're created. I also know that there is a whole lot of incentive for Vegas to get their lines as accurate as possible so that there is betting on both sides of the line, otherwise, they stand to lose much more money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not denying that it's possible for a game to be thrown. It certainly is and has absolutely happened. But, your initial argument was that it's SO easy for a baseball player to hit a tiny fucking ball out of a park when it's being thrown 90+ mph a foot from their bodies. It's arguably the hardest feat to accomplish in any sport, and your argument is minimizing the sport.
      </p>
      <p>
       They get paid millions of dollars every year to play baseball. What is the incentive for them to potentially ruin that income FOREVER by getting caught throwing a game? Pete Rose got caught betting on himself essentially and his name is forever tarnished because he got caught. He will probably never get inducted into the Hall of Fame because of it, which he very much deserves to do and have heard him in interviews saying that he would take it back if he could. There is a lot of pride in the game of baseball.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this technological age where every single play, pitch, throw is more heavily scrutinized than the previous, I would be very confident in saying that your initial claim of 15-20% of the game being rigged is such a gross overstatement and again, diminishes the game itself for what to me seems like crying conspiracy for the sake of crying conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is too much on the line for the players, teams, owners and the MLB as a whole to risk throwing a game for MAYBE a couple more million dollars that they could be making in advertising contracts anyway.

       Here: if you're a baseball fan, you'd remember this from this last season.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is beautifully rigged. It's a given home run. Not saying the pitcher was paid to do this or even told to, but the moment is just too easy. It's a feel good moment for fans and the sport and the media attention that goes along with it.

       I watched that play happen live, and it was certainly all too perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       But look at Dee Gordon's career stats
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8203&amp;amp;position=2B/SS">

      </p>
      <p>
       The guy has less than 20 career home runs. He isn't a power hitter at all, and hit it in one of the hardest parks to hit a home run in. Even if the pitch was grooved perfectly down the plate, it's still not an easy feat to accomplish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whose to say that he didn't go up to the plate with his adrenaline pumping after one of his teammates just passed away tragically, and thought to himself, I'm going to swing as hard as I've ever swung at the very first pitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion that's much more likely than the pitch being grooved on purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what do you know about pitch counts? Some pitchers want to get ahead in the count as early as possible and many batters tend to not swing at the first pitch either.

       There are a lot of variables involved in baseball and I think it diminishes the game when rare feats are accomplished and it's chalked up to it being rigged.

       In baseball, the rigging happens with the losing team, not the winners. You either make an error on defense, or the pitcher serves up an easy home run ball. Baseball is probably the easiest to script because of routine errors. Makes me wonder if Buckner got paid to miss that ball in '86.  The Chicago White Sox actually did throw the World Series in 1919.

       This is pretty damn detailed, but basically a few white sox players accepted money from gangsters and gamblers like Arnold Rothstein to throw the game. Mainly, starting pitchers purposefully giving up runs in the early and middle innings of games.

       Now I know this is professional baseball we're talkin about and they might have some fancy machines, but the pitching machines I know of are insanely consistent in how they throw the ball. When you know how fast the ball is gonna be going and where it's gonna go before it is even released, hitting it perfectly is just a matter of muscle memory. When you get a human pitcher who can change aim, speed, and pitch types at will, and suddenly hitting the ball can become a challenge.

       This was the first year in as long as I can remember--maybe EVER--I did not watch the Super Bowl. It just seemed ridiculous to me. NFL seems ridiculous. The ads and their prices seemed ridiculous. I don't feel like I missed anything, even if the media tries to convince me it was the greatest Super Bowl ever.

       Ha!  I had a conversation with someone about watching the Super Bowl.  I told them I am not going to watch it, and I do not even have a TV.  I got the "Oh, you are one of those!" looks.
      </p>
      <p>
       We talked a bit about sports, the media, TV, etc., then I asked them if they knew about Pizzagate.  Of course, they did not.  I asked them if they knew about Jeffrey Epstein, the Lolita Express, Anthony Weiner, etc.  They had no idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it that I am better informed without the TV?  It should be the other way around, but it is not.

       I would think twice about going to a party if I knew a TV would be the central focus.  I make it a point to go hiking during the Super Bowl.  It benefits me.  I do not want to sit around and watch others be successful.  I would rather be successful.

       Good!  I am glad you feel that way.  It should not have any bearing on your spirit.  It is all just a show.  A facade to keep people from being unruly and non-compliant.  People know more about their sports team then they do about subjects that actually affect their life.  I used to be one of them...

       I do not listen to music on the radio because I do not control what is being played and when.  Also, I do not want to listen to the commercials.  I do watch videos online, but that is because I have greater control of the content.  Do you see the difference?

       Who said anything about the radio? However, in a crazy scheme to make money I would argue that stations have it in their best interests to play music they think people will like in order to have a large listening base which is attractive to advertisers.

      <p>
       Now, if it's the advertisers you have issue with, are you so weak minded that you can't even listen to commercials for fear of their mastery of your psyche? If that's the case then commercials still control you, by way of preventing you from being entertained.

       Humans are not too stupid to vote.  They do it all the time.  My point is that people vote for candidates without knowing what the candidate is about.  People vote for pedophiles without realizing that the person is a pedophile.  Then, when they find out, they do not believe it.

      </p>
      <p>
       I watch the Super Bowl because I like football. They can play the Budweiser commercial 100 times and I may watch it all 100 times depending on how the viewing turns out. I'll still never buy that swill and will only drink it to be nice when I'm at somebody's house and that's all they have.

       I looked at your post from before, and you said democracy not a republic.  As you now point out, there is a difference.

       No, I also listen to music others create and produce.  Of course, I also listen to mine to change it and rewrite it.  How about you?

       You are a better hiker than fortune teller. As far as republic/democracy goes, every dipshit knows there's a technical difference but nobody who's intelligent gives a flying fuck about the semantics. Republics are simply democracy's with fail safes. They're both miserably flawed systems which have no business governing people.
      </p>

       Really their only use is in pointing out trolls such as yourself who use things like this to try to prove they're smarter than everybody else while they actually only succeed in proving the opposite. Carry on you democracy/republic semantic pointer outer you.

       If you said Democracy but meant Republic, then that is fine.  It is not a big deal, but there is a difference.  Fascists are in control of the US government anyways, so it does not matter.  The whole democracy, republic, land of the free home of the brave bullshit is so we do not see the true nature of the fascists in control (see below).

       Lawyers only care scout semantics when they help their case. Much like yourself except in this case semantics don't help you at all because you knew what I meant. You attempted to use the semantics to make yourself appear intelligent while you actually just pointed out to people that you're a social misfit. Now, go find your hand boy.

       None needed. I don't let George Bush's pedophilia, or lack thereof, dictate what sporting events I do or do not watch. I know democracies, i.e republics, are doomed systems. Its rule by the lowest common denominator. So, good luck with that! You're gonna need it.

       Maybe you worry about who's having sex with minors so much because you're infatuated with it. A certain percentage of humans are pedophiles. It's a simple fact of life. I personally feel sorry for them. I don't need to demonized them as a low hanging fruit of moral superiority. That's for the intellectually bankrupt.

       You went hiking at 6:30 P.M. at night in early February?  Even if you were WC that leaves you starting your hike at 3:30.  Most people don't go hiking late in the day.

       The level of "I am so smart" that you are portraying in this thread in staggering.  Stop trying to hold yourself on some lofty pedestal above everyone else.

       I think I stepped on the toes of people that are still riding the Super Bowl high.  Watching that game makes them feel like they accomplished something in life.  Which is fine.  I understand.  I used to be one of those.

       Did your team win?

       It was really great to see George HW Bush do the coin flip at the beginning of the game.  It is great that he was honored for his great service to our country.  Don't you agree?

       I barely watched the game as I didn't care for either team. The Super Bowl is an excuse for friends/family to get together, have good food, and have fun. That's what I did. I'm gonna take a guess and say you don't do that a whole lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, my team didn't win because I didn't care about who won. Lastly, about Bush, I don't even like him. He was a mediocre president whose son was 100x worse than he was. I don't care that he did the coin toss, most people don't. Despite all of this, he wasn't even that horrible of a person. I can think of lots of people who were more reprehensible than him and they've been showered with honors. I'm not sure why you have a vendetta out on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to calm down dude, the massive amount of pretentiousness in you is ridiculous. Do you not see that? Why are you so angry about a football game? I kinda feel bad for you.

       Having knowledge actually ruins quite a bit in life.  After the game last night, someone posted a picture of George HW Bush from the Superbowl.  People worship the man like he is a great person, but they have no idea.

       When I do go to gatherings at someone's house, I get annoyed when they have the TV on, but it is interesting to observe people.  The same stupid commercial is played over and over again, and people will sit there and stare at it.  Maybe people just get used to it.  Of course, I used to do that, too, but now it is just annoying as hell.

       Just to be clear, my comment was not meant to imply they believed or disbelieved Pizzagate.  They did not even know about it.  You have to know about it in order to decide if you want to believe it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would think that people would want to know that it could possibly be true so they can make an informed decision during the election.  When people vote, they have no idea if the person they are voting for likes to have sex with underage children.  I have never heard a candidate being asked this question.  We assume the answer is no, but that is not always the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really want to vote someone into office who enjoys sex with underage children?  It happens all the time, but the voters are not aware.

      <p>
       <strong>
        "Pizzagate and better informed don't fit in the same sentence."
       </strong>
       In view of what I just typed, I really hope you do not believe this.  Of course, if you are a lizard, then I understand.

       It was covered by tv news after an insane man came into a shop and shot his gun. Other than that it was buried where I belonged. There wasn't evidence and if you say there was than the same goes for our current presidents many allegations. Even the allegations with underage people. You can't expect everyone to spend time looking up crackpot shit without better evidence to present it and have that evidence be current and correct.

       I am still not sure you understand my point.  Most people have not even heard about it, even though most people own televisions.  I do not own a television, but I have heard about it.  Whether it is true or not is not relevant to this conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I take it you are not aware of US politicians being convicted of sex crimes with underage children.  I am not talking about Pizzagate, but I mean other previous instances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there are many instances in which the politician was not convicted of anything.

       I know about those things. And I know enough that if a person brings them up in conversation, I'm just looking for a way to get the hell out this dialogue as fast as possible.

       Did you see George HW Bush at the Super Bowl?  There is a picture of him there with Barbara Bush (I just looked it up, and he did the coin toss.  LOL.  Great!  Hahahahaha!!!  The American public is so duped.

       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Look it up, then watch this video.

       So.... if you are aware of these things and you are watching the game and see George HW Bush on the TV, then it is kind of a downer.  Especially because they will say all of these great and wonderful things about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I make people aware, so then people think there is something wrong with me.  LOL.

       I have an idea for next year's Super Bowl coin toss.  Have Jerry Sandusky walk out there with a bunch of underage boys.  He can then take them back to the locker room and do his thing until halftime.  I will complain about it, and you can accuse me of being a massive killjoy.  Deal?

       It is without a doubt the greatest come back in super bowl history. Might be the great super bowl ever. Crazy stuff. As for it being scripted. It just isn't possible with the pivotal catches that changed the game. That can't be faked

       All you need is the refs to be in on it.  Something doesn't go as planned? Holding on the offense. Offside, etc.  There's probably a violation every play they just pick and choose when to call it.

       I'm just saying, those 3 straight calls like that could really mess with the defensive players mindset the rest of the game.

       They were definitely justified but could we go back and analyze video of the game and see if the Patriots were doing something similar and were not being called for it?

       You clearly didn't even watch the game if you think that is what decided the game. If a ref call is what came between victory and failure that is what you would be seeing in social media, how the refs handed him the game. If you watched the game however, you would see that is not the case. But please, don't let me stop your uninformed speculation.

       Every play has the potential for a penalty and its referee's discretion as to how to allocate penalties.

       I don't disagree with that, I'm aware how football works, I played for years. That also isn't the claim that was made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im saying if someone thinks this game was decided in penalties they either don't understand football or they weren't watching the game. It's really that simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like saying the the reason the patriots won is because they do better in cold weather than Atlanta. While that is a true statement, it was played in Houston so that cold weather advantage did not factor in because it wasn't freezing there.

       Holding and PI calls are so precarious in a single game, and from game to game--no two games are called the same. I think the way those two penalties are handled are enough of a "control" to keep a game relatively in check so to speak. I'm not saying games are controlled by a kicker missing a kick on purpose because the mafia got to him or something---I'm talking about adjusting the way the refs call a game based on the style of the respective teams playing as way to create an imperfect, amorphous border to the competition. Its not perfect, its not always the case, and it may not always work. Its like a shepherd guiding a flock of sheep using the staff and stone of yellow flags to maintain limits and boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance most of us are totally fine when in one game the refs call a tough game and "let the boys play" as long as its consistent. The thing is, letting the DB's man-handle WR's at the line when games normally aren't called like that is enough to destroy an offense's entire chemistry, timing, gameplan etc. I think I've seen it happen a fair amount of times. New England is ENTIRELY a timing based team. Tom was hot garbage out there with too much pressure and tight coverage... yes he played through adversity, yes there was a meltdown aspect and lucky plays... but come on... that holding call on Atlanta as they were driving just gutted them.

       Just because one team collapsed doesn't make it a good game.  There wasn't enough back and forth scoring or lead changes to even be in the top 10 of SB games.

       I stopped watching after the Patriots won against the Seahawks when Bush wanted to go to war and we didn't and suddenly it's Patriot this and patriot that and the refs made some seriously bad calls to throw the game.

       It can be loosely scripted. After all if most the players think the game is for real they will make for a better show.

       I admit I tune out all sports now but back in the day, when I quit football, I remember the patriots scandal getting caught with playbooks from other teams they stole. Knew every call and plan the opposite team would use.  Probably handed to them so we could have "Patriots won superbowl" drums to war.

       No, I am confused by how uninformed your comment was. No need to be butthurt when you have 5 rings and the only thing you can do about it is cite a website made to show that the Pats aren't the only team to get in trouble for rule violations.

       I sat in the room while my family watched and mostly was here on Reddit, I didn't really watch much of the game, but it seemed like there were far fewer ads than I remember there being in the past. I haven't legitimately watched the Superbowl in quite a few years though.

       Not to mention all week long every time the game was brought up, the falcons were portrayed as the sure thing to win. I saw it a handful of times and immediately knew it was going to be a mirror of the election.  I told my friends at work this and they scoffed. They came up to me around halftime and were like patriots are down so far. I repeated to them that it was going to be an upset just like in the election.  They laughed in my face.  Then a couple hours go by and they came up to me one by one and were like "how the fuck did you know!?" then I had to explain how the media has been pushing narratives to create upsets.  Its an obvious formula if you look for it.

       From what I read Patriots were favored handily to win, Falcons were likely to score first, the O/U bets were 27.5 Falcons and 30.5 Patriots at Q4 end. OT bet was 15/2.

       Those are O/U bets, not the odds given for the outcome of the game itself. It also doesn't necessarily matter what the numbers are, but what the chances are of diverting from the O/U. 25% each of 20-21-22-23 gives an O/U of 21.5, but so does 25% 10-15-28-33.

       I think someone is just a lil upset I mean the Falcons did have defensive players get injured during the game and had a huge lead all they he'd to do the last possession in the red zone was run up the middle to get a few more yards and then on 4th kick a field goal but they went for the TD.

       Was it last year or the year before that it looked pretty obvious (and I don't watch any games but the Super Bowl and try to avoid that if I can) that it was rigged, I think it was the Broncos v Seahawks?

       The problem is if you actually follow the money (advertising) then this was a terrible game.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was just bad football for three quarters. We would have turned it off if we hadn't had a bracket going and we were definitely not paying much attention to ads or otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       A big comeback win might be a good news story but that is hardly going to help ratings seven months from now. Also, why would the NFL reward a team and QB they were criticized for punishing at the beginning of th let season? Goddell was booed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply there is nothing to gain from rigging this SB.  Now, any sports series can gain visibility and ad dollars when the series lasts longer. Forcing a tied game seven is great for revenue, but forcing a comeback in a single game is pointless.

       Uh- lots to gain on the betting markets.  All week long its been Atlanta this falcons that about how they had a 90% chance to win etc etc on even the news networks.  They played people so that it was a huge upset and they talked up the falcons so much that those who bet on the patriots definitely won big.

       Uh- betting generally closes before the game starts and a majority of bets are already placed so a huge lead by Atlanta won't change the books. The Patriots were only -3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, people who actually gamble don't just bet on one team. They bet the line and the line was dropping before the game. Most the book was on the Patriots due to their perennial popularity. This combined with prop bets with big payouts for missed field goals, 2-point conversions, and overtime the books got trounced. It would be very strange for the game to be rigged towards giving a win to the heavy favorite, beating the line, and covering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, If you watched the game there were a bunch of clutch plays that were necessary for the comeback. Fabricating a historic comeback and overtime win is probably the less reliable then just betting on the game if you are putting money on the line.

       I think you missed what I said.  The week prior everyone on television, in articles, etc were talking up the falcons. That influences the betting markets.  Also don't be so naive about the authenticity of pro sports.

       It makes no sense for it to be rigged. All the money was on the over and the patriots covering. Hearing non sports fans theorize about sports literally makes my brain hurt, it's like hearing Nancy grace talk about Benoit being demoted from the four horsemen to raw. Literally no clue about the sports just see "ridiculous comeback" and use that as justification

       I love when people talk about sports betting and have no fucking idea how it works. They think all those numbers you see are from each team being super analyzed and they reflect the scores that some supercomputer predicted they would be.

       A lot of football ads featuring kids playing football to increase interest since it's rapidly losing interest for kids. I definitely noticed that. I don't think NFL is rigged but I sure do think the patriots still cheat. NBA is definitely rigged. Sumo Wrestling is rigged. MLB is not rigged.

       lol except the MLB has been proven to be rigged with a team even throwing I think the 1919 World Series.  Do you have any idea what you are talking about?

       Tuned in at the beginning of OT to see that the biggest game of the year was being choreographed with CG and impossible angles. Not saying the stadium was full with a hologram audience, but let's say I wouldn't trust the porcine of the game if I weren't within a few feet of each play in person. It was like watching a videogame.

       Yes it's a fact. I believe there are several court cases where fans sued the league but in court it came out the sport was classified as "entertainment" and fully has the right to predetermine outcome.
      </p>

       Some good research exists on this subject.  Might dig it up later. Tldr:  never bet on sports, treat as wrestling.

       A couple things struck me during the game- and I was watching for it because I was sure going into it that the game was going to be fixed for the patriots.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of holding and interference penalties against the falcons was ridiculous- with over 2x the number of penalties called against the falcons even when they were winning so significantly. There is almost always holding going on- the refs have a lot of sway with deciding when to throw a flag.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        An enormous holding penalty was called against the Atlanta Falcons on second down, pushing them out of field goal range on a crucial drive late in the fourth quarter. However, there was a clear face mask made on the same play as Mohamed Sanu was tackled out of bounds that wasn’t called.
       </p>

       The conversion that the patriots made on the td which tied it up, looked questionable- as did the final touchdown

       Why wouldn't that final touchdown be reviewed? his knee was down before the ball crossed the plane.  They played 1 shot from the line, and quickly went to other views where it was less obvious.  The announcers were on board- they can't question the outcome at that point.

       Sanu was the dude who the facemask penalty would have been called on, he ripped the other guy's helmet off.  Since both penalties would have been on the offense, they wouldn't have cancelled out and the Pats would have had their pick of penalties to accept.
      </p>

       The touchdown and conversion were reviewed, all scoring plays are automatically reviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       James White's knee was not down before the ball broke the plane, only the tip of the ball has to cross the very front of the goal line for it to be a TD.

      <p>
       Mohommed Sanu had the ball and was getting facemasked when he ripped the other guy's helmet off.  You may be right, but either way there should have been a call there.

       i didn't realize that.  still skeptical of those touchdowns. I suspect we will never see the endline videos on either of those, again.  If anyone DVRed it, I'd suggest looking at it again.

       IMO if games are rigged its done by the referees. They can use their calls, or lack of, to sort of dictate the momentum of the game and try to control the outcome. Because the players would have no idea viewers wouldn't notice any lack of effort or bribed attempts to throw the game. Looks completely authentic yet the outcome is decided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said this, I don't think football is really a sport where this sort of manipulation reaps much benefit. Reason being is each round is a single game where as in most other sports each round is a best of 5 or 7 series. This makes the attempt to rig a series a lot more worth it because you can get 3 more games worth of revenue. When you think of how much money is made off a single playoff game you realize its not that crazy to think they'd try to manipulate series to go all 7 games.

       The only way sports can be rigged if refereeing. You cannot have players as actors because someone would snitch if they figured out the thing they have been working for turned out to be a lie the entire time. It is also why the Super Bowl was not rigged, as that was the best reffed game of the year.

       Agreed. And like I said theres way more incentive in baseball, basketball, hockey where both teams and the league greatly increase revenues by having more playoff games i.e. 7 games instead of a 4 game sweep.

       I listen to a guy who was MK Ultra'd and, several years after childhood, went on a quest to figure out wtf had happened to him. That led him to start meditating, etc. Eventually, his mind awakened and he remembered everything. He goes on to talk in great detail about everything that is really happening behind the scenes in the world -- i'll be honest, it gets a bit strange, he goes on and on about ETs controlling the paradigm and stuff but remains completely convincing and he was also recently and randomly assassinated -- and he admits that every major sports program we watch on TV is undoubtedly rigged by TPTB.

       Shoot, who knows. They have the tech to create the internet and text messages. Doesn't blow my mind that they might have tech in space with the ability to mess with players' physical functions at certain times. They might also cut players' deals off the field and what not. Idk. I played college football and that game last night made me think Max Spiers, and you, are completely right. It just makes no sense.

       It's a great way to keep us distracted from pursuing truth and content in putting all of our time and energy into consuming sports/buying tickets/listening to sports radio, etc.

       Yes, because that Edelman catch that bounced  from the DB was "scripted". I'm cool with the opinion, but it's ridiculous to think this shit is "scripted". It's beyond reaching.

       This is ridiculous... the Kobe game was "rigged" in the sense that his teammates' gameplan was to give him the ball a million times so he could have a nice sendoff in a game that didn't have too much meaning otherwise.

       At the end of the game he made like 10 clutch shots in a row to bring he's team back from being down like 15 though. I meant how he brought them back to win more so than his stat line.

       Ive been watching football my whole life and i do believe it is loosely rigged. I have seen my team have so many head scratching calls go against us that it is way too much of a coincidence. It is blatant. I think the refs are told to make certain calls here and there to INFLUENCE the outcome of the game.

       No, he did it and he said a few refs were involved as well. They are not told by the NBA, he said he did it for money. Also, you are going to get a ton of head scratching calls because refs are going to make mistakes. If refs were blatantly told, someone would of snitches.

       Ill have to look it up but i remember him explicitly saying he was told to influence games depending on where they were playing. And kings/lakers 2002, clear example of it. Refs make mistakes obviously, but i know what i see.

       I've recently become hyper-aware of how heavily controlled and scripted everything is that is viewed by any majority of Americans. Considering how many people watch the super bowl, I have a really hard time believing that any of it is honest. I have no interest in sports and have never watched the super bowl myself, so it's not something I could care about investigating or caring about. But I wouldn't be surprised to find that none of it was real.

       All you need is the refs to be in on it.  Something doesn't go as planned? Holding on the offense. Offside, etc.  There's probably a violation every play they just pick and choose when to call it.

       Mohommed Sanu had the ball and was getting facemasked when he ripped the other guy's helmet off.  You may be right, but either way there should have been a call there.

       i didn't realize that.  still skeptical of those touchdowns. I suspect we will never see the endline videos on either of those, again.  If anyone DVRed it, I'd suggest looking at it again.

       I know about those things. And I know enough that if a person brings them up in conversation, I'm just looking for a way to get the hell out this dialogue as fast as possible. I would have said "no" too. It's like talking about religion or politics at a family gathering, only dumbasses and/or trolls do that kind of shit.

       Good!  I am glad you feel that way.  It should not have any bearing on your spirit.  It is all just a show.  A facade to keep people from being unruly and non-compliant.  People know more about their sports team then they do about subjects that actually affect their life.  I used to be one of them...

       The level of "I am so smart" that you are portraying in this thread in staggering.  Stop trying to hold yourself on some lofty pedestal above everyone else.  Just because you chose to go for a night hike in the cold and others chose to hang out with friends doesn't make you better than anyone else.
