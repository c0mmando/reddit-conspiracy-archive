Lets start with Andrew Jackson, the founder of the Democratic party. Slave owner. Slaves who escaped would have rewards on their heads. A bonus reward of being returned with up to 100 lashes.

Planned parenthood was founded by Margaret Sanger specifically for this reason. Planned parenthood is still around today. Pushed by the Democratic party.

    <div class="md"><p>They have. Republicans and Democrats have been the two dominant parties for the last 150 years, but what it means to be a Republican/Democrat changes every 30-40 years. Wikipedia has some good reading on how the coalitions of the parties change over time:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Party_System">First Party System</a> (1792-1824)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Party_System">Second Party System</a> (1828-1852)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Party_System">Third Party System</a> (1854-1892)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Party_System">Fourth Party System</a> (1896-1932)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Party_System">Fifth Party System</a> (1932-1968)</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s a bit of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dealignment">dealignment</a> period from 1968-1980 where the southern states go back and forth before finally settling on the Republicans.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Party_System">Sixth Party System</a> is where we are today, although based on the previous time frames we should be due for the start of a new party system right about now.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true that the Democrats were the party of slavery, and that Republicans freed the slaves. But anyone trying to use things that happened 150 years ago to infer anything about what the parties believe today is either incredibly ignorant or trying to push an agenda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Haven&#39;t the two parties been flip flopping since the US&#39;s inception?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, u/AmadeusK482 called you on your &quot;incomplete viewpoints on history&quot; in an effort to help you correct your communication of same.</p>

<p>You clearly stated above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It opens doors of knowledge for people. And created the conspiracy of how the Democratic party...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Had you stuck only to the Abe Lincoln <em>Chapter</em> few in here would argue those facts but you went off the <em>third rail</em> from that point forward.</p>

<p>You also chimed in with this little gem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I can help you get out of your feelings a little bit.</p>

<p>You came in here with your britches all bunched up right out the gate ta boot. You&#39;re on the right track...just tighten up the critical parts of communicating, thinking and accepting <em>correction</em>!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm and the republicans are to blame too. The drug war really got kicking with Reagan. And Bush senior is director of the CIA at the time.  Hey, I&#39;m also in agreement that Clinton had a major contribution with 3 strike laws and mandatory minimum sentences. But republicans were major operatives in the drug war, possibly more so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha why anyone would read that and not think &quot;I wonder if anything is filtered out to show only the good light of the Democrats..&quot; And yes, it is very filtered lol. Lets start with Andrew Jackson, the founder of the Democratic party. Slave owner. Slaves who escaped would have rewards on their heads. A bonus reward of being returned with up to 100 lashes. Not to mention the african american women he raped. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do things in other ways. They knew slavery was a dead subject so they decided to look like they were/are for immigrants and minorities for their votes. They were pretty damn smart about it. Promising housing, government funding, medical, the works. All you gotta do is vote Democrat and you stay on social security, medicaid, food stamps, bail out bail out bail out. It&#39;s a shit system but it worked extremely well.</p>
