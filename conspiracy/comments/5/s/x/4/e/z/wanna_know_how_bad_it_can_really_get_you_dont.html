       Over the past couple of decades, Mexico has spiraled to a level of chaos that
       <strong>
        shames
       </strong>
       many Islamic "failed states." Despite the fact that we share a common border, a common culture with the people of Mexico, and a common destiny, we do not see any media focus on highlighting this crisis, we do not see any political pressure on solving this crisis, we do not see any conversation about how we might even try to solve this crisis. It is just not discussed
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       ,  which is telling in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, we give them weapons, we continue to incentivize the drug trade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mexico is a clandestine playground flooded with CIA and other spooks and private interests. The cartels, government, and military are CIA trained, funded, and cooperative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to know how bad things can get? Want to know what the US might look like as a prison state? Just look to our brothers in Mexico.

       God help us.

       have your own food, grow as much as you can. Share with others and tell them to grow a bunch as well.

       Everything is encoded into language. It's the Carbon deception. Avoid sugar and all processed carbo(n)hydrates.

      <p>
       Eating an all raw diet will take time to clean your body but after you're done you'll realize a lot of things. Like "Did that really come out of me?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Just do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest all who want higher awareness and a healthy body (AWAY FROM BIG PHARMA) start eating fruits. Start with veggies + fruits + some almonds. After using that as a baseline removing all that excess sugar you can move to the next stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get a full body clean start doing fasting. Eat grapes and lemons for whatever length it is. (2 weeks, 4 weeks) you can live no problem on grapes and lemons ignore what our joke of health science says. No animal in the entire kingdom cooks its food.
      </p>
      <p>
       After healing your body through this you'll have gone through hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each time you fast and eat a cleansing diet you'll become stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let your food be your medicine and your medicine be your food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do it and never look back.

       I have a friend who raises pigs and chickens. Our entire region has very poor topsoil, lots of red clay, can't grow anything without pumping the dirt full of petrochemicals. Organic products at the market are bullshit, they're just sprayed with special FDA designated 'organic' chemicals, and typically much more of the chemicals since they're less effective than their non-organic counterparts.

       You need to invest in a bee apiary. Not only good for vegetation growth but also serves as an early warning system for toxins in the air. A farmers market will get you started.

       No America can't get that bad, and even when Mexico has some big problems, it cannot be compared to a Islamic failed state, Mexico has it's own Goldman Sachs and Bank of America branches(not to be proud of), also has a ban on GMOs Maize and other similar bans, tbh Mexico is not the sharpest knife on the drawer but surely not a sewer or a dangerous place many ppl think or imagine or try to make other ppl think is, but still a wall is strongly recomended, as that important person said "i assume not all Mexicans are bad" i think the problem is that a good percentage of the people that shows themselves at the border as Mexicans are from southern countries and or other places, they enter illegaly to America as Mexicans, and the problem start to expand, most of them are gang members or even as you call them "terrorists", i think that's where the issue starts
      </p>
      <p>
       not forgeting that "Fast and Furious" operation that led to a big influx of illegal guns that ended up on the wrong hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... just my 2 cents
