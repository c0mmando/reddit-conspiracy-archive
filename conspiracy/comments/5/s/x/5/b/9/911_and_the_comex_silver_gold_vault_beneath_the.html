          WTC basement reportedly housed vaults with at least $650 million of silver and gold pre-9/11
         </a>
         (but the true value of stored gold was kept secret following 1993 bombing)

       </li>
      </ul>

       So:

          According to (somewhat sketchy) report of FEMA employee tasked with filming ground zero, vault was emptied prior to attack
         </a>

       <li>

         ) that gold was found loaded onto a crushed truck and recovered from WTC delivery tunnel (was being transported on morning of 9/11).
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So with all this vault talk from wikileaks I wanted to revisit this 9/11 detail... Is several hundred million dollars worth of gold missing? And if so who made off with it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully somebody on here knows more about this than I do (I haven't watched 'Loose Change' which apparently deals with this theory). Or about the story of Kurt Sonnenfeld.

       This is old. There's like a half a dozen reasons for the attack. The vault, the destruction of pentagon money laundering records, the laws locking down opposition in the US, the mass spending to enrich the coffers of the weapons manufacturers, the federal contractors, and the ability to hand over assets to oil companies at discount prices....not to mention preserve the petrodollar.

       Yep that's correct; it happened in 2001, and there are likely to be several reasons (or motives) for the attack.

       I remember hearing about the truck found abandoned in the tunnels filled with gold. One of the reasons I believe it was not an attack it was planned by someone and used to cover up several things.... building 7 was destroyed to cover up/destroy records for some investigation(I forget what it was). And the owner took out an unusual insurance policy on the buildings and got double the payout.

       there was an official FEMA photographer who was assigned by FEMA to take photos and video of the aftermath of the attacks. He claimed he videoed EMPTY vaults with doors standing wide open and in his mind, that proved pre-knowledge by at least somebody.  When he announced his video, he had to flee to Argentina to escape accusations of murdering his wife by authorities.

       Yea I read that and didn't know what to make of the story. Not the FEMA/video part, but the part about his wife.
