       I've heard that they feel the need to kill the degenerates, and they see homos as degenerates. Their preachers tell them (I guess, from what I understand), that it's ok to kill infidels, because they are homosexuals, and because the US is promoting so much degeneration such as crappy sjw stuff.

       Oh yeah, that's pretty basic stuff. The abramahic religions are far from pro-gay.

       Yeah but abrahamic religions do not use gays as an excuse to conquer countries and kill people. (i didn't get your point here I think).

       If it's basic stuff, can you point me to a direction to look, to find more evidence of this?

       We attack US soil because of the killings of Muslims in the Middle East. Not because ya'll have corrupted sexualities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also because it is a democracy so the people are the government and that is why we attack civilians. From our perspective they are guilty because they voted for the people that invade and occupy our lands.

       Wut?  Lot happened to move into and live in the city of Sodom, but it wasn't like they were "his people".  The men of Sodom specifically call him a sojourner.  That means he was someone from out of town.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And they said, Stand back.  And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them.  And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door. (Genesis 19:9)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The "people of Lot" would be the Moabites and Ammonites, the peoples that came from the sons he had with his daughters.

       We cannot trace the bible back to Jesus. However you can trace the Quran back to Muhammad. So you can use the story of Lot from the Quran.

       The old testament predates the first coming of Jesus Christ.  Moses was who penned Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.  How is tracing it back to Christ even relevant?  How is tracing something back to Muhammad even relevant if he was a liar?  You take it on faith either way buddy.  There is no "proof" of either book in a worldly sense.  Only spiritual.

       No duh, the old testament started being written
       <em>
        2000 years before Christ walked the earth
       </em>
       .  There's no such thing as a "gospel of Jesus" book.  Jesus was a prophet, not a scribe.  He came to reinforce that the law and the prophets were his words, not write new ones.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. (Matthew 5:17-18)
       </p>
       <p>
        How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?  Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.  For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.  But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? (John 5:44-47)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is it clear that the law and the prophets were around before Christ walked the earth?  Do you need a timeline?  The gospels are the written testimonies of other people
       <em>
        of
       </em>
       Jesus which were written after he ascended.  You're looking for something the Bible doesn't assert exists in order to prove the Bible?

       I think you're mistaken on the 'people are government' part. Our thin veil of democracy is a joke. It's an insider run technocratic plutocracy. The average American has no idea what's actually going on and is a half dead, brainwashed zombie and the few that do know what's going on have no real option when two puppets for the elite are presented as the only choices to vote for. Stop justifying violence.

       Well, the psychopaths that control the American government give no excuses to anyone for anything and will keep mass murdering Middle Easterners if they are allowed to. I genuinely hate the fact that it's happening but I can't change it currently. Violence against American civilians will only 'justify' the mass murder of Middle Easterners further, esp once our corrupt media gets ahold of it and spins it to the government's advantage. That's only helping to perpetuate the problem instead of helping fix it by dealing with the root of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a 1000% against America's wars in the MidEast, and so are many of the people that I know, but we can't realitically stop it right now. I guess I can't argue with you if you think that killing us is the solution but it won't achieve anything besides getting more of your people killed and getting more Americans to support a war machine that you literally have close to zero chance against.

       From my analysis every time we do a "terrorist attack" the enemies of Islam unite to fight us. If we leave them alone you attack each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no need to worry too much about terrorism because we notice it is more productive to leave you alone. Our "terrorism" unites you against us.

       That is actually one of our attack vectors. Spend $1 on a terrorist attack incite a $1 million dollar response. Repeat. The fact that the US is trillions in debt shows that it is working.

       That debt comes from elsewhere, you should know that. Bombs to kills Mideasterns are like loose change dropped and forgotten about. It's disgusting but true. My nation's debt is owed to many other things, they kill ya'll for cheap and they laugh about it. Get that harsh reality through your head and let's move forward as allies united against them. We are both their enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to believe that killing ya'll is their chief objective or means much of anything to them like you're on some righteous crusade. It's only a sideshow distraction to keep manipulating you and us while they pursue their goals behind the scenes. Huge black budget projects and near science fiction shit is actually where that money goes, not cheap explosives that are used to murder poor people. They have enough weapons to do that for the next century and not even see a dent in their bankroll.

       Yeah it comes out of the pockets of average citizens in the form of taxes, inflation, ect. Which we hope will eventually cause a rebellion and topple the governments of the world. You aren't poor enough to rebel yet but that is a goal.

       Their primary goal is to prevent the reestablishment of an Islamic Caliphate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like they are failing because we are half way there. If we can get the Muslims in MENA to see the Caliphate as a legitimate entity and to merge their territories then no government would ever be able to take us on.
      </p>
      <p>
       This map was probably made by a racist but its a pretty good indication of our goal to unite the Muslim majority nations into a single global Caliphate:

       Haha you're persistent. I commend you and I won't argue with you anymore. I think that you are missing some key elements of what's actually going on and putting the blame in some of the wrong places but I understand where you are coming from. We ultimately aren't enemies and I'm not trying to push some "go america, fuck you" type shit on you at all. I genuinely pray for the strengthening and upliftment of your people, I never didn't. But I just hope that it's non-violent and with the aim of helping heal the world if it happens.

       There's been more than enough pain and death and separation. Our real enemies delight in humanity's quarrels and consolidate power while we fight, and a rebelling American populace nor a renewed caliphate is enough to stop them. We must all work together.

       Like the Muslims aren't ruled by the rich and powerful.  When was the last time you seen a "prince" commit jihad?  No matter what system of government you have it's going to end up being a plutocracy, even your precious Sharia.  Get a grip, just like all wars the poor are sent to fight and die while the rich get richer and fatter.  It's easier to fool than convince someone they've been fooled.

       Who do you think is funding the calipate?  So you consider the princes and enemy that you would remove if you had the opportunity?  That kind of sounds like the flawed democracy you denounce.  You don't think we consider the the dark state(plutocrats who rule our politicians)our enemy,and that we would remove them if given the opportunity?  Again your reasoning is flawed, just like any religious zealot.

       Aren't you forgetting attacks are highly suspicious of being false flags by our own govt.?  Stop being MSM fake news agitator. You are a shill.

       Well, the psychopaths that control the American government give no excuses to anyone for anything and will keep mass murdering Middle Easterners if they are allowed to. I genuinely hate the fact that it's happening but I can't change it currently. Violence against American civilians will only 'justify' the mass murder of Middle Easterners further, esp once our corrupt media gets ahold of it and spins it to the government's advantage. That's only helping to perpetuate the problem instead of helping fix it by dealing with the root of it.
      </p>

       I'm a 1000% against America's wars in the MidEast, and so are many of the people that I know, but we can't realitically stop it right now. I guess I can't argue with you if you think that killing us is the solution but it won't achieve anything besides getting more of your people killed and getting more Americans to support a war machine that you literally have close to zero chance against.

       Like the Muslims aren't ruled by the rich and powerful.  When was the last time you seen a "prince" commit jihad?  No matter what system of government you have it's going to end up being a plutocracy, even your precious Sharia.  Get a grip, just like all wars the poor are sent to fight and die while the rich get richer and fatter.  It's easier to fool than convince someone they've been fooled.
