       Trump is more likely to create real life problems and not conspiracies. I think you need to think more about what is actually happening and not what could happen.

       Yeah this is a shitpost. I get that Trump may be the face of the NWO but the resistance from the conglomerate media, establishments proves he is still somewhat rogue in this, might get assassinated I don't know. There wouldn't be such massive resistance If he was just another puppet like Obama, W, Clinton. The military industrial complex may flourish but we have to see what happens first

       Even if they were 53%, that's still extremely unpopular for a president in his third week in office.

       That being said Rasmussen is an outlier that has long had a pro-Republican bias.

       Trump said he "respects Putin as a leader of his country".... Not understanding all the hoopla over this statement. Trumps goal is to make America SAFE again, by eliminating terrorist organizations, which he feels Putin/Russia could greatly contribute with. So, what exactly do people want? Trump to spew hate against Putin? Say "well you're just such a horrible person we don't want anything to do with you (Russia) &amp; just ignore them? Because that's not gonna work. Please.... Someone explain EXACTLY what Trump could do regarding Putin which would apease you.  Funny how nobody threw these fits when Hilary was wining/dining/accepting huge monetary"contributions" from leaders MUCH sinister than Putin. Hypocrisy.

       My point is actually beyond any policy specifics.  It's more that an increasing fear along with love of a "strong man" leader is going to lead us to accepting more freedoms being taken away - same with what happened with the Patriot Act.  I feel like I'm watching this happen and no one is paying attention.

       Think whatever you want on whether or not working with Putin can contribute to stopping terrorism.  American's admiring him as someone to look up to as a leader is what is scary.

       There's a HUGE difference in love &amp; respect. He respects him as a LEADER, not necessarily as a person. I definitely don't understand how you feel our leader having respect for another leader jeopardizes your personal freesom....Or what particular freedoms you feel are at risk. It's kind of like life, and learning to get along with those we don't like, maybe a co-worker. Would you not say you respected your co-worker as a co-worker, even if you didn't care for them personally? People are unfortunately so swayed by the lying, biased media they actually believe Trump is going to be the next Hitler. That's outrageous!!! Our system of government has many checks and balances in place. Just like the EO banning the 7 countries. Some people didn't agree.... Appeared before a judge....Ban placed on hold. I find it interesting you chose not to comment about all the time/money HRC spent with "killers" a lot worse than Putin....Of course, the streets weren't filled with protesters during that time either. Imagine that?!?  As far as the Patriot Act, I see both sides of the spectrum. Unfortunately some freedom will have to be sacrificed for safety. So, ask yourself which is more important? Personally, freedoms no good if I'm dead bc our country is no longer safe &amp; full of terrorists. I'd be willing to sacrifice a certain amount of freedom to ensure my daughter sees her 20's/30's/40's.

       I'm didn't mention Trump at all in the previous comment, not sure why you went there.  I'm talking about people's reaction to the constant fear mongering - love of a strong man and complacence with freedoms being removed.  And quite honestly, your last sentences pretty much prove my point.

       Then do yourself and all trump supporters a favor and stop trying to use equivalencies to HRC as an excuse of trumps behavior. Not only is it intellectually lazy, but it just screams insecure true believer backed into a corner.  I mean that would maybe work if you are talking to a goofy HRC supporter but assuming that everyone is (especially here) just makes your arguments forgettable.

       Excuse me?!? I'll argue my point how I want. If that means comparing to HRC, then so be it. She is NOT excluded from accountability just bc she wasn't elected. In fact, she still has a lot to answer for, as she was in a government role, therefore an employee of the public. You're rude. And this conversation is OVER.

       I'm no right-winger, and Putin is exceptionally rational however authoritarian he is or isn't, or is made to appear.  The Maidan incident shows that he is the target of covert operations to
       <em>
        frame him
       </em>
       as autocratic.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Bush/Cheney breached the post-WW2 "Old World Order" in which "Pre-emptive War" was the highest war crime (according to Nuremberg prosecutor Robert H. Jackson), Putin was the last major leader upholding the Old World Order.  Obama took Bush's side.  This is the reason for NATO's Ukraine coup:  to finally taint the clean Putin by forcing him to defend his only southern port access.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin's record on human rights is worthy of discussion, but not by the filthy U.S. who are only more covert with their journalist assassinations, and better at whitewashing their gulags &amp; war crimes.  Putin is not even in the league of the U.S. when it comes to war crimes or conspiracies or oligarchy or a one-party system.

       Quite a rebuttal.  As a general rule, the simplistic answer is usually the wrong one, whether it's from Trump, anti-Trump people -- or even from Putin.  Count on that from anti-Putin propagandists also.

       Trump won't do none of what your saying. When Trump says Law and Order he means too many have broken the laws of our land in high places. He's going after the  traitors that have been preying on America and ripping us off. He's gonna use this whole NSA system they built to use against us as a weapon against them.

       No one's right or wrong here neither of us have met Trump - we believe whatever we each feel his true intentions are. We both hope for the best and we both have been screwed over many many times by politicians with empty promises and false hopes - in some of the worst ways people can't even imagine.

       It probably won't happen yet, but it seems obvious that that powers controlling Trump will conduct a false flag attack, and blame Iran for it. Trump needs something to justify his planned Iran invasion. If he wasn't so eager to attack Iran, Israel wouldn't have installed him as President in the first place. But he needs an attack to justify the coming war.

       I wouldn't be surprised if a false flag happens, but I wouldn't be surprised if the shadow globalist folks bump him off either.  The hysteria about Trump has reached a deafening pitch which is absolutely unmatched.

       lol, you are delusional. Every single democrat(-Feingold ), including that dirty filthy cunt Clinton voted for it, not just republican's, child. Grow up. Your candidate lost, the better person won and it's killing your type that he's accomplished more in a few weeks than 8 years of the puppet oboobla.

       Projecting your weak emotional state onto words is telling. The milliseconds that it takes to comment or respond is far from triggering, kiddo. Triggering is when you go out of your way to whine about someone calling a cunt a cunt. You were triggered and are still triggered over kkkillary being called a "filthy dirty cunt" lol...you are too cute. Please project more of your weak emotional state, I find it amusing.

       Sorry about all the trumpers that you triggered. They cannot stand to hear even the tiniest criticisms of their beloved "god-emperor," so I think you really got under some skins with this post.

       I find it amazing how r/conspiracy trusts the government now.  The old standard posts are shouted down now.

       Is Trump a secret Russian agent?  How dare you suggest that!

       Could Trump create a false flag to push his agenda?  That is crazy talk!

       What you are witnessing is a disinformation war. I also find it concerning that we now have a conspiracy theory with a brand name that is pushed here at spam levels. Not saying I don't agree that there is a human trafficking and pedophilia problem among the global elite but I think that there are things being ignored by this sub now that have much bigger ramifications. So many damn sensationalist headlines and accusations about censorship with no leg to stand on. Remember when we used to not get caught up in a partisan loop? That's their MO, keep us divided, brigade anything that's critical of the current POTUS and admin, and push that brand name theory about handkerchiefs so we can make it about gays too..
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just going to ignore the fact that there is serious brigading going on here and look at it as we've been over-run by people that lack any sort of empathy or objectivity to have a civil discussion about current events. This sub is now a nationalist shit heap.

       Trump, or any other president, would love another 9/11. It would give him essentially free reign to suppress free speech and wage war.

       The fact that r/conspiracy, of all places, now trusts the government concerns me. We should have a
       <strong>
        healthy suspicion

       regarding all powerful people.

       Yeah this is a shitpost. I get that Trump may be the face of the NWO but the resistance from the conglomerate media, establishments proves he is still somewhat rogue in this, might get assassinated I don't know. There wouldn't be such massive resistance If he was just another puppet like Obama, W, Clinton. The military industrial complex may flourish but we have to see what happens first

       Trump just happening to like the way Putin's butt smells is simplest explanation though! It's hilarious to think that anyone belives he could have become president of our masters didn't want it.
